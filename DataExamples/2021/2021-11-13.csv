Experts discuss regulatory options for PFAS chemical contamination control.

Font Size: A A A

Every day as many as 110 million Americans may be consuming water polluted with human-made chemicals.

Colloquially known as “forever chemicals” perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of contaminants that can be found in many common products and drinking water. They do not break down under natural conditions. Instead they accumulate over time in the environment and even in human bodies. Studies of laboratory animals suggest that large amounts of PFAS may affect growth and development damage immune systems and even lead to cancer.

In the 1940s major chemical manufacturer Dupont invented PFAS to produce a coating-like substance Teflon for cookware. Over the last 80 years PFAS applications expanded from cookware to include food wrappers furniture clothing and cosmetics. Today the company 3M predominantly manufactures PFAS for product applications.

A 3M-commissioned study found that 3M was aware of PFAS in food products since as early as 2001. In addition the Environmental Working Group published a timeline of documented health risks dating back to the 1950s. Despite scientists and organizations calling for federal control of PFAS the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) U.S. Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) failed to act for decades.

EPA began investigating PFAS in the early 2000s but has only recently made progress towards regulating them. In January 2021 EPA posted an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments on potential PFAS regulation. In October EPA Administrator Michael Regan announced that PFAS regulation is a priority and urged the Defense Department FDA and FAA to take action as well. Regan also released a roadmap for setting a national standard for the maximum level of PFAS that can be present in drinking water a measure advocated strongly by advocates.

Other efforts to regulate PFAS emerged during the years without federal standards or regulation including medical monitoring through toxic tort litigation and state-level regulation. State actions include maximum contaminant standards health advisories and funds for PFAS cleanup.

In the coming years civic organizations industry players and consumers will keep their eyes on executive agencies as the federal government begins to take action on this public health crisis.

This week’s Saturday Seminar discusses potential routes for regulating PFAS chemicals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vdGNibWFnLmNvbS9pbm5vdmF0aW5nLW9uLXRoZS1pbnNpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovating on the Inside,"Not every company names its growth strategy. But General Mills Inc. is a global marketing machine so the Golden Valley-based behemoth dubbed its spring 2021 blueprint “Accelerate.” The company is restructuring to “increase agility” which will result in the elimination of 700 to 800 North American jobs and another 600 to 700 worldwide—news that grabbed most of the headlines. But cost savings weren’t the only driver. The reorganization also created several new leadership roles focused on transformation growth and disruption. Like many Fortune 500s that are feeling pressure to move at the speed of startups the company that created Cheerios wants to bulk up its innovation muscle.

“This is an acknowledgement that we can’t just do things the way we used to do it” says Doug Martin General Mills’ newly appointed disruptive growth officer. Previously the president of the company’s dairy operating division Martin was promoted in June to oversee a new team focused on growth opportunities. That includes G-Works a new internal innovation engine and the 301 Inc. venture capital arm which invests in and mentors emerging brands.

“There are things we do really well: delivering big brands everywhere in America safely and effectively. And we’re good at marketing those big brands” Martin says. “But there’s a big difference between the skill set of someone running a billion-dollar brand and the skill set of someone who is going to create something new from scratch.”

Enter Amol Dixit. Make that “re-enter.”

Dixit started his career at General Mills and spent 15 years climbing the ranks to a senior marketing manager position. In 2011 he became manager of a team that identified and executed investments in emerging food brands. “I wanted to be an innovation guy at General Mills” he recalls. A year later he left to do it his own way. He launched Hot Indian a fast-casual restaurant concept with ambition to popularize Indian cuisine. Today Hot Indian has two locations at Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis and Mall of America (a third in the downtown Minneapolis skyways remains in pandemic limbo). Dixit has become a familiar face in the local food and startup scenes thanks to his pioneering concept cheeky branding and support of corporate titans like former General Mills chief marketing officer Mark Addicks now a Hot Indian investor.

But as is often the case with startups revenue doesn’t necessarily match the buzz. So with a trusted head chef running Hot Indian’s day-to-day operation Dixit went looking for his next opportunity. He found it in the last place he expected: back where he started at General Mills running the G-Works incubator.

“This isn’t me coming back to get on the marketing career path” Dixit says. “This is me seeing an opportunity to be an innovation leader. For me it feels like the company is in a different place. Innovation is front and center. To be part of a group that is going to play a big role in achieving that ambition it’s exciting.”

A Startup Mentality

General Mills isn’t Minnesota’s only large company stepping up internal innovation. Cargill launched the Entrepreneurial Digital Growth Engine (EDGE) last year to pursue new ideas unencumbered by the typical corporate process.

“Often in big corporations the team comes up with a new idea and then applies traditional business decision-making like ‘What’s the [return on investment]?’ The biggest tech giants wouldn’t be what they are today with that thinking” says Lawrence Wang Cargill’s director of digital strategy development. “We’ve always had it in our DNA to be innovative—but we need to learn how to take more risks and how to invest in the big market potential of new ideas.”

That means making investments without guarantees. Fail fast. Test cheaply. The pace of innovation today requires looking beyond the corporate walls Wang says.

For many big companies the most efficient way to evolve is through acquisitions. Wang says Cargill has learned a lot about the startup mentality by working with independent founders through its Techstars Farm to Fork Accelerator but the company also wants to capitalize on the institutional knowledge of its 155000 employees.

That’s what EDGE is meant to do. The program is staffed by a small team of people who have corporate innovation or entrepreneurial experience. Anyone in Cargill’s global workforce can put forth an idea and the EDGE team will decide whether there’s a viable path to scale. If greenlighted the employee with the idea might become a “founder” and work on the project part time—or more; EDGE will provide the resources support and necessary capital to pursue new ideas. Both Cargill and General Mills declined to say how much funding is available to their new startup programs.

“The goal is to develop a portfolio of investments” Wang says. “You need a high volume of ideas to do that.”

As for General Mills “We’re very good at flowing capital into things that are working” Martin says.

G-Works’ mission is much the same as Cargill’s EDGE but General Mills took a different approach to setting it up. The department consists of 20 “builders” divided into threeperson teams. (Most came from other departments in the company; a few like Dixit were external hires.) Each trio includes a commercial lead a technical lead and a trend specialist. The G-Works teams identify “opportunity areas” and find a consumer problem they want to solve. “We’re very open in how we define opportunity areas” Martin says. The key he says is finding space between existing products. For example “We shouldn’t have a G-Works team coming up with a new cereal flavor.”

G-Works’ first product is already on shelves at local Hy-Vee stores and Amazon. Good Measure is a snack brand targeted to people with diabetes. It resulted from a team digging into the unique pain points faced by people who have to think about how what they eat interacts with their blood sugar. Nearly one in six adults in the U.S. has been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It’s the sort of niche product line that might have come from a solo founder with diabetes who experiences dietary struggles every day. G-Works is an attempt to improve on the ideation and support for smaller ideas Martin says rather than what has become the sweet spot of many large companies like General Mills: making big brands bigger.

“The competition from smaller brands has clearly been exposed in the food space” Martin says. “We’d like to rebuild some of that muscle of creating and nurturing brands in their infancy so that one day they can be big enough to live comfortably within the bigger machine that is General Mills.”

15% Culture

But can big companies really get out of their own way?

At 3M a freewheeling spirit of entrepreneurship was in effect long before Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson built rocket ships to launch themselves into space. Company leaders today often recite the edict of William L. McKnight who became 3M’s president in 1929: “Delegate responsibility and encourage men and women to exercise their initiative.”

That philosophy held by several early company leaders led to 3M’s longstanding “15% culture” which allows employees to pursue passion projects on company time that may or may not be related to their day jobs. Post-it Notes are the classic example: A 3M scientist charged with making strong adhesives came across one that stuck lightly to surfaces and didn’t bond. After several years of noodling with potential applications a colleague griping about how his scrap notes fell out of his hymnal inspired the eureka moment.

“I’d argue almost all of our products come out of 15% time” says John Banovetz 3M chief technology officer.

The company doesn’t track 15% time. Some employees mark it on their calendars; for others it’s more of a general understanding that daydreaming is good for business.

“As a leader I don’t want to know what you’re working on” Banovetz says. “As soon as I know it creates that compulsion of  ‘This has to work.’ ’’ For large companies to successfully create a culture of innovation it’s essential to support ideation Banovetz says. “Knowing that only three in 10 ideas may succeed it’s more important to promote that personal initiative. The payoff is long term.”

In today’s business environment where successful entrepreneurs become celebrities and VC firms throw mega-millions at potential unicorns that have yet to turn a profit you have to wonder: Would that 3M scientist have left the company and tried to launch Post-its alone?

The lure of entrepreneurship has become more powerful and seemingly more tangible says Myles Shaver professor of strategic management and entrepreneurship at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. “There’s a bigger focus today on entrepreneurial education. Students want to take these classes.”

That path was less obvious when Dixit earned his MBA in 2002. “If I had to label myself I don’t know if ‘entrepreneur’ was the thing I would have said back then” Dixit says. “I think I’m an innovator and you can apply that anywhere.”

The “working in a garage subsisting on ramen” stories of starting a company tend to get glamorized but the realities of being a startup founder can take their toll. “There’s the emotional side: I have the feeling that the best possible version of Hot Indian hasn’t yet seen the light of day and that’s on me. I’ve made some bad decisions over the past eight years but I still have such belief in the brand and what we’re trying to do” Dixit says. “Then there’s the practical side of it: I have leases bank debt investors employees. There are always obligations and you’ve got to do everything in your power to meet those obligations.”

Corporate innovation support eliminates some of the more nerve-racking aspects of starting up. “It allows me to focus on the task at hand” Dixit says.

But the reward of writing payroll checks is the determination it creates to succeed.

“We’re still figuring out how to do this in a corporate setting as effectively and efficiently as possible” Dixit says. “In traditional corporate jobs there’s a playbook for how to build how to manage how to grow. Here we’re building that playbook. All of these accelerators and venture funds we have to think about the equivalent for corporate entrepreneurship. How prescribed should the playbook be? How do we plug into the food startup world? How do you gain big company resources while gaining empathy for what it means to be an entrepreneur?”

At G-Works Dixit has the space to explore all of those questions and experiment with the answers.

“We don’t know what perfect looks like here” Martin says.

For now G-Works members receive the same sort of compensation package as any other General Mills employee. But everything is up for discussion and disruption Martin says. “We need to think about incenting the right behavior. We’re not going to do that on Cheerios. But here the whole model assumes a level of failure that’s pretty high—and now and then you’re going to hit it out of the park.”

At 3M accolades come to those who shine but there’s no monetary award for a successful 15% project Banovetz says. “My advice to other companies: Be conscious of the pivots that happen and support the people who choose to pursue new ideas. Innovation is very much a team sport.”

Supporting Startups

Four Twin Cities-based corporate accelerators with proven results.

Not all of the big ideas come from big companies. More than 75 businesses in the Fortune 100 are now active in corporate venturing according to Inc. magazine. In the Twin Cities home to the most Fortune 500 companies per capita of any metro area several corporations run their own external startup accelerator programs.

Beyond funding most provide resources and expertise to help small businesses grow. The goal might be acquisition or partnership but sometimes it’s simply about learning and mentorship. “When you think about a startup what they need most is access to the market and expertise. Meanwhile big corporations need access to innovators and solutions that could potentially be disruptive” says Lawrence Wang Cargill’s director of digital strategy development. “Our overall belief is we need to transform ourselves and be better at how we innovate internally but we also know that there are a lot of big problems to be solved in food and ag and our environment such as food safety security sustainability and transparency. We can’t do it alone. We need a broader ecosystem of innovators to bring these things to life and market.”

Here’s a sampling of corporate accelerators active in the Twin Cities.

PIDG company InfraCo Africa has joined into a consortium with DOB Equity and Mobility 54 to commit to a €3 million investment in Zembo that will grow the company’s electric motorcycle business across Kampala Uganda. Zembo helps drivers buy electric taxis or pay them with a lease-to-own arrangement. This investment helps the company grow the number of their motorcycles by 2000 while supporting the development of additional >60 Zembo charging and battery swap stations across the city.

Zembo co-founder Étienne Saint-Sermin said “Zembo’s mission to improve incomes for Uganda’s boda boda riders while cutting air pollution.”

Gilles Vaes InfraCo Africa CEO pointed out that “Zembo has a great track record of delivering electric two-wheeler vehicles to the market.”

Zembo is working to increase the number of electric motorcycles on Kampala roads. The company’s model means that drivers do not have to buy own or charge batteries. Instead they make a swap for a fully charged one. Uganda’s national grid is fueled by 92% renewable energy and adding extra off-grid solar PV charging stations will ensure vehicles reduce emissions.

Saskia van der Mast co-CEO at DOB Equity described Zembo as “offering a low-emission and cheaper transport solution.”

The new investment will support Zembo’s growth offering high health and safety standards and business development helping the company scale and attract future private sector development.

We’re excited to announce our raise of €3 million from InfraCo Africa DOB Equity and Mobility54 to continue developing electric boda bodas and charging stations for Uganda https://t.co/hJRPLTniiR — Zembo (@gozembo) November 12 2021"

Model Amanda Abbott who lives in Queensland says she has struggled to adapt to electrical sockets since moving Down Under.

Australian power points have on/off switches while American ones typically do not due to differences in the strength of the electrical current.

The US uses 110 volts while Australia - along with the UK and Europe - uses 220 or 240 volts to supply power.

Switches are installed for safety reasons to reduce the risk of fire and electrocution but Ms Abbott has found it difficult to adjust to the cultural difference.

She took to TikTok to share her frustration saying: 'In America when you plug something in it just starts charging.'

She continued: 'I get it I get that this is probably better for the environment.

'But if I forget to turn this on which I always do I'll have my phone charging for four to five hours and then I go and check on it and it's not charged at all because I didn't flip the f*****g power switch.'

If you feel Earth is a little too plain compared to some of its flashier neighbors like Saturn with its fancy rings there may be good news for you.

“Earth is on course to have its own rings” said University of Utah professor Jake Abbott. “They’ll just be made of junk.”

NASA image displays space debris or ""junk"" in orbit around the earth. The junk has accumulated since the dawn of space exploration in the 1950s.

There are 170 million pieces of space junk in orbit around the Earth. Most of them are quite small but 23000 of those are larger than a softball and concerning enough to be tracked by the Department of Defense. Space junk endangers space flights orbital missions and the astronauts who pilot them.

Space junk even falls to Earth. Usually it breaks up in the atmosphere but not always. An estimated 200 to 400 pieces of debris fall each year.

Earlier this year a portion of a Falcon 9 launch vehicle made an “uncontrolled reentry” and lit up the night sky. A 5-foot section of the vehicle survived reentry landing on a farm in Washington State.

Ummm... just caught this flying over my home in SW Portland. pic.twitter.com/CvQJwvWsyj — Vince LaVecchia (@vincelavecchia) March 26 2021

Space junk considered a type of pollution has grown dramatically since 1957. We have 7500 metric tons of junk in orbit – the equivalent of 1100 elephants floating over our heads. The size of the herd is projected to continue to grow exponentially unless we do something about it.

“Most of that junk is spinning” Abbott said. “Reach out to stop it with a robotic arm you’ll break the arm and create more debris.”

So how do you get junk out of space? The answer Abbott says is magnets.

Magic Magnets

Abbott is a professor of robotics at the University of Utah but what really pulls him in are magnets.

He recalls a presentation he saw as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University.

“Under a microscope they had this tiny maze with almost a little submarine in it. It moved forward and backward and turned” said Abbott “working its way through the maze.” A task completed entirely with magnets.

“Way simplistic compared to what we do now” Abbott said “but it seemed like magic.”

The magic led to post-doctoral studies at the University of Zurich in Switzerland where Abbott worked mostly on applications of magnets to surgery. He spent years working with a team on how to get a microscopic “submarine” to swim down through a human eye and deliver drugs to the retina.

“It took years to develop but the math used is the foundation for everything we do now” said Abbott.

“Everything” includes using magnets to guide precision virtual reality eye surgeries.

“If it takes 30 surgeries before a surgeon is really competent we want those first 30 or more surgeries to be on virtual patients and we want them to be as realistic as possible.”

Abbott’s system uses magnetic fields to create the sensation of real surgical pressure with a virtual eye.





(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) University of Utah professor Jake Abbott has developed a system for using magnetic waves to track tools which could help train surgeons for surgery on Friday Oct. 29 2021.

“I work a lot with the Moran Eye Center” Abbott said.

His lab is also working on making colonoscopies more palatable. Using capsule-based cameras they are developing a system for moving the capsules with precision using magnets. Their current design is a two-part capsule-cam where the two ends are connected with a short rubbery chord.

“The magnets would move the cam through you like an inch worm” said Abbott. “Swallow a capsule lie on a table for a couple hours you’re done.”

He notes that fear and hesitancy around colonoscopies are a major barrier to early detection of colon cancer.

Then there’s space junk.

You might imagine space junk as a lot of metal and much of it is but it’s not all magnetic.

So magnets won’t work right?

“They will work” Abbott said “because of eddy currents.”

The principle and his team’s findings applied to space junk are spelled out in a recent article for Nature but let’s break it down.

You have a spinning piece of nonmagnetic space junk that can conduct electricity. You extend magnets toward it on the end of robotic arms. The magnets spin. When they spin they activate eddy currents - electrical currents shaped like eddies (or whirlpools) in the object - that create their own magnetic field.

Use a lot of careful math and modeling and suddenly you can use controlled force and torque to slow the spinning object move it around collect it.

The short version: “We’ve basically created the worlds first tractor beam” said Abbott. “It’s just a question of engineering now. Building and launching it.”

It is said to be the largest purchase of Oculus by a single company. The headsets are targeted at new joinees to give them an immersive experience during their onboarding and training. Since Accenture's biggest base is India and its largest hiring is happening here the India operations is expected to get some of the headsets.A tweet by Nick Rosa  Accenture's global head of immersive learning and extended reality practice for Europe said the devices are “full 6dof self-contained latest generation VR headsets” and the programme was ""just phase one”.6dof is six degrees of freedom and refers to the freedom of movement of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. The reference to `phase one' suggests a lot more headsets are on the way.It's not clear if the employees get to keep the headsets. An email sent to Accenture India didn't elicit a response. In a recent interaction Accenture CEO Julie Sweet explained the purpose of the headsets for training new recruits saying ""Because the way you build connections is also through experiences and it’s super cool.

In the not so distant past one would expect the primary reason for a financial business investment to be squarely numbers-based. Does it increase revenue or EBITDA? Does it decrease operational spend? But obviously times have changed and now a lack of trust not only causes reputational damage but also can seriously sink the bottom line. In effect trust can almost be considered currency – currency that can pile up or vanish at the blink of an eye. “Our research proves that no company is immune to the impact of a drop in trust on the bottom line” says Michael Lyman Senior Managing Director Accenture Strategy North American Lead in the Bottom Line on Trust. Public or private small or large business-to-consumer or business-to-business the currency of trust doesn’t discriminate. This entire article could list the multitude of examples of companies intentionally or unintentionally making a misstep that took their trust currency to zero.

How automation is the golden ticket

So with “trust” top of mind companies are focusing on getting more from their data and are increasing their investment in digitalisation. In fact nearly six in 10 companies (58%) believe that without better automation their firms will be at risk of suffering significant reputational damage. The benefits of automation extend far beyond compliance; gaining visibility across the full value chain is more crucial than ever. Making full use of the right technology is the only way to overcome siloed operations and make data easily accessible and actionable to everyone in the business.

Consider specifically accounts payable (AP) automation for example. When you automate your AP to receive all invoice data electronically you capture 100% of data. In turn you gain 100% spend visibility through this complete and high-quality invoice data. AP automation of course facilitates business-critical tasks by eliminating manual repetitive tasks and enabling touchless processing. But it also frees up time for the AP department to perform more strategic tasks the golden ticket to gaining a competitive advantage. With data at their fingertips they can answer questions such as: which payments should be prioritized to capture negotiated discounts? And which invoices have been flagged because prices are not compliant with negotiated contracts? On the flip side what competitive advantage can an AP department gain from manual entering and tracking invoices?

The plans for automation … and trust

The finance and procurement compliance landscape is complex and companies are prioritizing a range of automation technologies to help achieve their goals. The Basware research report found 61% of respondents expect to increase their investment in automating and digitising data collection and 57% plan to spend more on continuous automation for touchless data processing. Acquiring the tools to understand the data is also critical and more than half (54%) want to invest money into artificial intelligence/machine learning to support data-based decision-making.

It’s refreshing to see this commitment to trust. It’s equally encouraging to see the wheels are turning regarding plans to get there.

(AP) — Before her daughter’s birth she spent weeks in bed. Another difficult pregnancy would be worse as she tried to care for her toddler.

Faced with that possibility the 28-year-old Texas woman did what a growing number of people have considered: She had a friend in another state mail her the pills she needed to end her pregnancy. She took the pills went to bed early and describes the experience as “calm” and “peaceful.”

“If people can have births at birthing centers or in their own homes why shouldn’t people be able to have abortions in their own homes?” said the woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she worries about legal reprisals as Texas moves to join several other states in disallowing mail delivery of abortion medications. “It’s a comfort thing.”

The COVID-19 pandemic and Texas’ near-ban on abortion fueled increased interest in obtaining abortion medications by mail. But with the legality in doubt in several states some people looking to get around restrictions may not see it as worth the risk. The matter is taking on new urgency with the Supreme Court set to hear arguments next month in Mississippi’s bid to erode the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing the right to an abortion.

Some abortion-rights advocates worry that whatever state officials and anti-abortion groups promise people ending their pregnancies at home will face criminal prosecutions.

“We don’t think that people are doing anything wrong to order medication from an online site” said Elisa Wells co-founder and co-director of Plan C which provides information about medical abortions. “I mean that’s how men get Viagra. They order it online and nobody’s talking about that and asking is that illegal?”

Medication abortions have increased in popularity since regulators started allowing them two decades ago and now account for roughly 40% of U.S. abortions. The medication can cost as little as $110 to get by mail compared with at least $300 for a surgical abortion.

However people seeking abortion pills often must navigate differing state laws including bans on delivery of the drugs and on telemedicine consultations to discuss the medication with a health care provider. And until Democrat Joe Biden became president U.S. government policy banned mail delivery nationwide.

“We just didn’t want women to use these medications and not have any protections any guidance any consultation” said Oklahoma state Sen. Julie Daniels a Republican and lead sponsor of her state’s law banning delivery of abortion medication by mail which is on hold amid a legal challenge.

Plan C saw roughly 135000 hits on its website in September about nine times the number it had before the Texas law that bans abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy took effect Sept. 1 Wells said.

Aid Access which helps women get abortion pills and covers costs for those who can’t afford them says it can’t yet provide data from recent months. It saw a 27% increase in the U.S. in people seeking abortion pills as states instituted restrictions early in the COVID-19 pandemic according to a University of Texas study. The biggest increase was in Texas which had limited access to clinics saying it was necessary to check the coronavirus’ spread.

Aid Access has a physician based in Europe Dr. Rebecca Gomperts provide prescriptions to clients in 32 states that only allow doctors to do so. The pills are mailed from India.

“I don’t think that any state level regulation is going to stop Dr. Gomperts from what she’s doing” said Christie Pitney a California nurse-midwife who is Aid Access’ provider for that state and Massachusetts.

Indeed Aid Access defied a 2019 order from the Food and Drug Administration to stop distributing medications in the U.S. In April the Biden administration dropped the FDA ban on mail delivery of abortion medications during the pandemic.

The divide among Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states is stark in the St. Louis area. On the Illinois side Planned Parenthood offers telemedicine consultations and prescriptions by mail. Missouri however bars telemedicine and requires a pre-abortion pelvic exam which providers see as unnecessary and invasive.

“In Missouri we don’t actually provide medication abortion because of the state requirement” said Dr. Colleen McNicholas chief medical officer of the regional affiliate.

Abortion opponents don’t expect the FDA restriction on abortion medication to be reinstated under Biden. GOP lawmakers in ArkansasArizona Montana and Oklahoma already were working on new laws to ban mail delivery when the FDA acted. Texas’ mail-delivery ban takes effect Dec. 2. South Dakota GOP Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order in September.

Even some abortion opponents believe it will be difficult for states to crack down on providers and suppliers outside their borders especially outside the U.S.

“Obviously it would be a lot easier if we had the cooperation of the federal government” said John Seago Texas Right to Life’s legislative director. “There’s no silver bullet yet identified of how we’re going to approach this kind of next frontier of the fight.”

Still Seago says tough penalties give prosecutors an incentive to pursue violators. The Montana law for example mandates a 20-year prison term a $50000 fine or both to anyone who mails pills to a state resident.

Pregnant people seek telemedicine consultations and abortion pills by mail because they don’t want to or can’t travel or can’t arrange time off or child care abortion-rights advocates said.

“Just because somebody can’t access an abortion doesn’t mean that they’re going to all of a sudden want to continue a pregnancy that originally was not desired right?” said Dr. Meera Shah chief medical officer for the Planned Parenthood affiliate outside New York City who also does abortions in Indiana.

A person in Ohio who identifies as nonbinary said they used an herbal remedy to self-manage an abortion alone in their college dorm room in 2016 before Aid Access launched its site telling their roommate they had the stomach flu. They said they didn’t have a car and didn’t know they could get financial help and called the Aid Access model “fantastic.”

“Any avenue to help pregnant people facilitate their own abortions and have that experience in whatever way best suits them is a great way to give bodily autonomy back to a wider range of patients” they said speaking on condition of anonymity because they fear harassment from anti-abortion protesters.

The new laws in Montana Oklahoma and Texas say people can’t face criminal penalties for having medication abortions. Yet those provisions — and assurances from abortion foes that their goal is not to prosecute people who have ended pregnancies — don’t comfort some abortion-rights advocates.

They say roughly two dozen women have been prosecuted since 2000 in the aftermath of self-managed abortions. An Indiana woman who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for feticide in 2015 for a self-induced abortion spent more than a year behind bars before her conviction was overturned.

Some abortion-rights advocates said prosecutors also can use child endangerment or manslaughter charges against people who have had abortions — or who have had miscarriages that authorities deem suspicious. They worry that the poor and people of color are especially vulnerable.

“They can’t get drugs where they are and so they may purchase pills from informal networks or online sites” said Melissa Grant chief operating officer of carafem which operates clinics in four states and provides abortion medications in nine. “But that’s riskier in this country than actually taking the medicines.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3NhZmV0eS1zZWN1cml0eS9yaXNrLWNvbXBsaWFuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTc0NzY5OS9oaWQtZ2xvYmFsLWhvdy1yZmlkLWlzLWVhc2luZy1saWZlLWluLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How RFID is Easing Life in the Pandemic,"The pandemic has forced the world to live digitally. Social distancing has meant that those who could work from home did making sure essential workers could do their jobs as safely as possible. While healthcare professionals are rightly heralded as the heroes of the pandemic supply chain teams were the unsung heroes battling at the front lines making sure that vital goods including fuel food and medical supplies continued to flow.

Supply chain has always been vulnerable to sudden changes and crises. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic ushered in a new era of disruption and along with it calls for contactless and touchless technologies that kept businesses open while protecting people. Radio frequency identification (RFID) was successful as a technology for contactless identification of assets that optimized processes and prevented errors. Although technology adoption was steadily increasing before the virus the prolonged interruption and RFID’s inherent ability to increase safety has necessitated adoption throughout supply chains.

How is RFID positively impacting supply chains during COVID-19?

Whether due to illness or workforce reductions the reality of a smaller staff required organizations to do more with less. The pandemic has laid bare that technology is critical not only to a company's survival but also to the survival of our global community. The ideas that Industry 5.0 is now bringing about automated systems and our ability to work with them are vital. RFID technology merges the digital and physical world to create trusted identities and delivers huge potential in the speed depth and breadth of processes in large sectors of the economy. Falling costs touchless solutions and the importance of visibility in supply chain are further driving RFID’s embrace.

RFID technology in healthcare. RFID was solving problems in healthcare supply chain before the pandemic. Overwhelmed ICUs and shrinking bed availability have made process optimization critical. Reducing variation in quality and eliminating errors literally mean the difference between life and death. RFID technology enables healthcare to automate logistics that improve capacity management and the care cycle.

Passive RFID applications in healthcare have far-reaching implications. RFID is safe for patient interaction easy to apply yet durable to resist high temperatures and water as well as offers transparent communication layers for integration with existing apps and systems. Facilities can track logistical chains manage inventory and ensure untampered delivery of sensitive assets such as vaccine kits and emergency drugs; automate the configuration and lifecycle of medical devices and provide audit trails that confirm the proper disinfection inspection repair use and billing of tools in treatment; and enable data mining capabilities for reporting metrics management and analysis. NFC tags offer provider authentication visit documentation secure proof of presence and confirmation of care through identifications that are cryptographically secure.

Active RFID that is cloud-connected offers location services within the healthcare ecosystem. Real-time location systems (RTLS) offer visibility into the immediate status of free and in-use inventory of devices and technology and save precious minutes in locating essential tools such as crash carts in emergency situations.

RFID in global tourism. Hotels resorts airlines and tourist attractions experienced a boom up until 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic caused shutdowns and travel restrictions. As sentiment improves over the coming months maintaining consumer trust will help to accelerate the recovery. Hotels and resorts using RFID tags fixed to laundry reduce the risk of human error and maintain safety along with high quality standards as linens are recorded identified and sorted electronically.

Active RFID in the form of RTLS has applications for tourism by assisting in pandemic-related efforts. Physical distancing can be enforced by deploying beacons within a room and tags affixed to wrist bands or badges for guests or personnel. Beacons are configured to detect tags that come within a specified space of one another and create real-time alerts so that social distancing can be enforced. RTLS also allows for occupancy level monitoring and contact tracing to comply with regulatory guidelines and requirements.

RFID in brand protection and authentication. Counterfeiting results in lost sales and very unpleasant customer experiences. Protecting major brands against grey market goods is a global challenge and successful brands are subject to more sophisticated attempts at imitation. In fact counterfeiting has skyrocketed since the onset of COVID-19 aided by shoppers having almost no choice but to turn to e-commerce.

NFC tags embedded in objects – such as rare shoes limited-edition bottled spirits collectibles antiques or even diplomas – are difficult to remove and generate a unique digital code with every use verifying authenticity. And now with larger support for NFC we see the uptake of embedded RFID technology as part of trusted brand authentication and protection strategies.

Final thoughts

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified weaknesses that existed in supply chain worsening bottlenecks and choking resources for those still operating on traditional models. RFID is empowering organizations to respond to the pandemic by implementing advanced technologies at scale. As the world returns to work RFID will aid in the continued recovery efforts. Markets will mature form factors will standardize and software interoperability will improve as use cases are better understood.

Industry 5.0 will bring into sharp focus how man and machine will work together to improve productivity adding a personal touch to the pillars of automation and efficiency brought on by Industry 4.0. RFID technology creates a robust portfolio of solutions for practical use including larger data storage capacity with cryptography and writeback capabilities. RFID and its advancing technologies will continue to shape new business models into the future driving growth and making the next revolution even smarter.",,,,,,,,,

The two-time Grammy Award winner 22 appeared with his ""That's What I Want"" music video costar in a teaser for next Wednesday's episode of Maury along with Ariza's wife and their 4-year-old son Noah.

""Montero found the love of his life"" host Maury Povich narrates the promo which was posted on the show's YouTube page. ""But was shocked to discover Yai was married... with a child. Is Yai the dad? Or will Montero get exactly what he wants?""

Although the teaser appears to be another masterful piece of trolling to promote Lil Nas X's debut album Montero it's stacked with all the Maury-isms that daytime viewers have grown to love. From a scorned wife to an on-air paternity test and an ill-timed marriage proposal there's plenty of drama to devour in the 40-second clip.

RELATED: Lil Nas X Confirms He Dated Broke Up with Music Video Costar: 'I Am Still Very Much in Love'

Lil Nas X first sparked relationship rumors with Ariza in August noting that he'd ""found someone special"" just weeks before they shared some steamy onscreen chemistry in his ""That's What I Want"" music video in September. In the video Ariza's character turns out to have a wife and child (played by the same actors in the Maury teaser).

The ""Industry Baby"" artist has since admitted that he and Ariza dated and later broke up. ""We were dating and we are still on very good terms"" Lil Nas X said last month on SiriusXM's Hits 1 LA. ""You know we may date again I'm sure.""

""I love him; he is amazing. I wanted to kind of focus on my music right now"" he explained calling Ariza ""the best person I have ever dated"" before adding: ""I am still very much in love but I'm trying to manage you know?""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then the company has become one of Silicon Valley’s most notable success stories a paradigm-shifting business that experienced exponential growth throughout the next decade. The company’s billion-dollar valuation was seriously dented by the pandemic with bookings declining by nearly 80 per cent as travel ground to a halt. With the tentative return to a different kind of normality the company is looking to leverage the platform and network it has built.

Recent platform upgrades have improved the depth of information and the quality of translation and other elements. As well as new search categories – like ‘ski-in ski-out’ ‘off the grid’ ‘offbeat’ and ‘luxe’ (which supplements the company’s existing curated ‘luxury’ offerings) – there are new review systems for a property’s accessibility and Wi-Fi speed as well as the ability to search up to a year in advance.

We spoke to Brian Chesky about what’s new and why and how his original aspirations for the company are finally coming to fruition.

Our goal was to perfect our core service and we’ve done that through two big platform releases with a total of 150 upgrades and innovations.

BC: We have AirCover insurance now which gives hosts a massive amount of protection and confidence. But the upgrades are also a design-driven approach. We want to design for the changing world and we're trying to obsess over every little detail of the product.

W*: What are the changing trends you’ve seen this year?

BC: A lot of people are living and working out of Airbnbs. They need to know they’ll get good Wi-Fi so our new Verified Wi-Fi service helps them for example.

W*: Do you see an opportunity to capture a more nomadic lifestyle?

BC: Before the pandemic I think things were really compartmentalised. Our house was a place we lived. An office was a place we went to often by car to work in. The pandemic took three spaces and made it one. So yes short-term housing long-term housing and co-working are all starting to blur together because people’s modalities are blurring together.

W*: Has that had an impact on the kind of places that are listed on Airbnb?

BC: Oh totally. Before the pandemic a lot of our business was in cities. Now the majority of business is outside of cities. And larger homes are being booked because a lot of people are staying longer and they're travelling with their entire family their pets or cohabiting with friends. One in five stays booked is for a month or longer. People think of Airbnb as a travel website but a fifth of our business is not people travelling but people living. When people can live anywhere it changes things.

W*: How can you capitalise on that shift?

BC: The 150 upgrades are a start. For example AirCover includes protection against pet damage because a lot of people are travelling with pets. We’ve verified 25000 homes for accessibility. We introduced the ‘I’m flexible’ option on the home page – it’s been used over 500 million times already.

W*: Has the number of properties on your books gone up or down significantly?

BC: It's been going up steadily. When the pandemic hit a lot of people got out of the business – there were some hosts who decided they didn’t want to list at least temporarily. But today we have nearly six million listings more than ever.

W*: How has Airbnb opened you up to the world of interior design and different tastes and styles?

BC: When we started Airbnb there was only Craigslist [a classified ads site] where you could only have four small photos. They were typically very poorly lit and gloomy. Sites like that were purely competing on price. What Airbnb did was help bring design to the category. There were nicely designed hotels but there wasn't really any personality. But people love homes they’re a wonderful expression of a person's life. There is good and bad design but it's hard to judge people's personal taste. It's just their life and I find it endlessly interesting.

W*: Do you have a design background?

BC: I went to Rhode Island School of Design 20 years ago. I was a very middle-class person not from the exclusive elite world of design or art galleries. I always thought of art and design as something that should speak to everyone. Design was something that should reach as many people as possible and the best design is contagious. Once people see something that’s well designed it’s hard to unsee. A lot of industries have done this. Back in the 1990s people weren’t necessarily asking for computers to be better designed before Apple devices came out.

W*: Did this approach inform Airbnb at the beginning?

BC: When I got to Silicon Valley a lot of people thought design was purely about how something looks a pretty container. However I always believed that design is about how something fundamentally works a way of thinking through a problem understanding a context or behaviour. The story of Airbnb is very much a design story. What we’ve done is a top to bottom upgrade of a software service released as if it is a piece of hardware.

W*: What version number would you say Airbnb is on now?

BC: I would say we’re probably on version 1.5 or 1.6. I'm hoping in the next year or two to launch Airbnb 2.0. We’re still using the original paradigm we designed in 2008 but we’ve added a lot of features and upgrades. It's really evolved. But we will earn the Airbnb 2.0 designation when we change the paradigm and create a new system of trust.

W*: Do you think there’s still more change to come in the rental market?

BC: My observation is that at the highest level we’ve had a digital revolution. It started in the 1990s but the pandemic has accelerated trends – we’ve had to do a mass adoption of technology. The world was already moving from the mall to Amazon but now it has been speeded up even more. The big recent change is that the office got digitised. Digital is faster it’s more efficient it’s cheaper but it’s also worse in some ways. Physical relationships and real communities get digitised and I don't want to presume this is purely a good thing. We have so much more freedom and flexibility but the world could also become a lot more isolating. But ultimately I believe that technology shouldn't be thought of as good or bad but whether the design is good or bad. That's the way I think about it.

(WSVN) - Police are investigating a shooting near an Airbnb location in Miramar that left a man dead in his car.

Miramar Police units were responding to a call of a shooting but were diverted to a crash along the 8600 block of Miramar Parkway just before 2 a.m. Saturday.

A man who spoke with 7News on Saturday said he rented the Airbnb home located along the 2700 block of Canal Road for three days while visiting South Florida. He said he and some friends were there to celebrate a birthday.

“I’m from Dominican Republic but I live in Pennsylvania” he said.

The man said there were about a dozen people inside the home and the group had been drinking all day. He said he fell asleep around 11 p.m.

Investigators said shots rang out at around 2 a.m. after some kind of altercation took place.

Neighbors said off camera that the altercation did happen and the victim was shot then got in his car and drove away.

Police said the gunman fled the scene.

7News cameras captured skid marks on the front of the Airbnb home.

Witnesses told police the victim crashed his white sedan into an unoccupied red pickup truck on Miramar Parkway about half a mile from the Airbnb. Another car was also damaged.

Detectives said the victim and suspect had both attended the party at the Airbnb.

The victim was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.

Police said there were only a handful of people there when they arrived to investigate.

“We were having fun; that’s it” said the man who rented the Airbnb. “I don’t know what happened. I wake up and I saw the police.”

The man added that the gunman and victim were not part of his group of friends.

“I don’t know the guys. We’re young and nobody wants to die” he said.

Detectives are working this case as a homicide.

A spokesperson for Airbnb released a statement that reads “Airbnb bans parties and are shocked by this senseless act of gun violence that took place last night in Miramar. Airbnb is quickly working to understand what occurred and we stand ready to support the Miramar Police Department in their investigation.”

Airbnb officials said they have deactivated the listing where the party took place while the investigation continues.

As of late Saturday night the gunman remains at large.

If you have any information on this shooting call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember you can always remain anonymous and you may be eligible for a reward of up to $5000.

In the video only the guest’s tattooed arm is visible. The person places a checkered towel over the camera lens. The person struggles a bit at first to get the object to stay but is eventually successful in covering the device.

“That time an Airbnb guest [thought] it was a good idea to put a towel over the ring camera” the host writes in the overlay of the video.

In the caption of the TikTok the host refers to the guest as a “bonehead” and uses the hashtag “idiot squad.”

The viral video has more than 3.3 million views and sparked a lot of heated conversation in the comments section. People are divided over whether the host should be able to surveil their property using security cameras. Some viewers say cameras allow hosts to check if guests are following the rules of the rental—like not bringing more than the allotted number of guests. Others feel like it’s an invasion of privacy.

One commenter defending the homeowner said the guests wouldn’t “need to cover it unless they are sneaking in extra people or things they shouldn’t have in someone else’s house.”

“Yeah no this sus. They could bring in a ton of people or animals or things not allowed or steal from the home [you] never know” Sierra Gray commented.

Echoing Gray another person said the hosts have a right to protect their property especially if it was included in the listing or the guests were informed prior. Airbnb allows hosts to have disclosed cameras in common spaces.

“It’s no different than staying at a hotel with cameras” Leeann Richards responded.

On the other side of the spectrum were comments saying that at this point with all of the hassle of Airbnb and scaling prices they’d rather just stay in a hotel.

“I don’t understand why anyone would ever choose an Airbnb over a hotel. Cameras? Chores to do? And all for basically the same price. No thanks” one commenter wrote.

Several people added that the difference between a camera in a hotel and an Airbnb is that there isn’t the worry of potential privacy invasion by being featured on a host’s social media without consent.

Others were creeped out at the thought of being surveilled. One person said “Imagine going outside to talk on the phone and have someone just listening in.” Another said it makes them uncomfortable to know someone “knows when I’m coming in and out of the house at every second.”

The Daily Dot reached out to the host via TikTok comment.

Instead of adopting a defensive reactive posture toward decarbonization that seeks to mollify stakeholders or comply with regulatory mandates companies in hard-to-abate industries have an opportunity to proactively shape their low-carbon future through deep collaborations targeting the fundamental drivers of demand. There are manifold benefits to moving early: access to novel and differentiated insights; the ability to share risks and investments and to influence the direction of the transition in their favor; and the opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers and other ecosystem players during the early phases of the transition.16 Early movement can also initiate a snowball effect—as a handful of leaders begin to decarbonize others will likely quickly follow suit to remain competitive.

In the following section we outline two key strategic challenges which face most businesses in hard-to-abate sectors—technical gaps and business model gaps—and explore why collaborative ecosystem approaches could be the most effective way to overcome them. Throughout we draw on examples and case studies from our collaborative research with Shell looking at several hard-to-abate industries namely deep-sea shipping road freight and aviation.17

Mind the gap: The strategic challenges facing most hard-to-abate businesses

While each hard-to-abate industry faces its own idiosyncratic set of challenges in transitioning to lower-emission operations from a strategic perspective such businesses typically face two dilemmas: technical gaps and business model gaps.

Technical gaps arise when direct electrification is structurally constrained while other viable low-carbon alternatives do not exist or are not yet available at scale to replace current carbon-intensive processes or energy sources. For example emissions from internal combustion engines in road freight could be reduced with the expansion of battery electric vehicles for some applications but for many uses fuel cell electric vehicles using hydrogen could be required. Hydrogen is also required to produce synthetic sustainable fuels for aviation as well as synthetic methanol and green or blue ammonia for shipping. Producing such fuels at scale requires large amounts of renewable energy (to produce green hydrogen) but also widespread use of carbon capture technology (for blue hydrogen) each of which remains nascent and prohibitively expensive.18 Closing technical gaps often requires focused research development and deployment all backed by patient capital. To get there hard-to-abate industries can look to share development costs foster more coordinated and sustained investment flows and advocate for supportive policy moves that can catalyze early-stage technology development or create the regulatory or market incentives to accelerate progress.

Technical gaps can also bleed into business model gaps that forestall decarbonization efforts. In some cases a viable low-carbon solution exists but is deficient on one or more relevant dimensions: It may be more expensive to implement or operate it may be less productive it may yield a lower-quality output it may require changes in supplier or customer behavior and so on. Implementing such solutions unilaterally could put the organization at a disadvantage relative to competitors. In aviation bio sustainable aviation fuel (bio-SAF) for instance is a biofuel produced from a variety of feedstocks that can reduce life cycle carbon emissions from aviation by up to 80%.19 It is a “drop-in fuel” with a relatively mature production technology that can be used in existing aircraft to immediately reduce emissions. However SAF currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel and supply is extremely limited making it uneconomic without additional investment.20 Business model gaps can be addressed by enhancing market demand and demonstrating a willingness to pay for new solutions; evolving more agile and flexible approaches to deploying new products or services; and collaborating with new partners to share the risk in exploring novel business models. For example because hydrogen-powered trucks are new to the market there isn’t enough data yet available on their longevity to predict their resale value and to demonstrate a clear return-on-investment. This makes it hard for individual business leaders to make the business case for fleet replacement. That in turn makes it complex to secure financing from lenders. Instead some OEMs are exploring a new business model whereby they continue to own the vehicle but lease it out to carriers; essentially trucking-as-a-service.21

Whatever the specific challenge hard-to-abate businesses face the root cause is likely traced back to one of these twin strategic constraints. And in both cases escaping those constraints likely requires working beyond the four walls of the business.

Assessing sector readiness

Ecosystem approaches come in a variety of configurations from joint ventures and consortia to closed platforms and “walled gardens” and can extend to players far beyond traditional industry lines and the current value chain. Crafting an appropriate approach that targets the right bottlenecks participants and behaviors hinges on understanding a sector’s readiness to decarbonize. Assessing three core questions and the six factors that flow from them can help break a very large problem into manageable steps which can be executed upon.

To decarbonize a sector companies should consider six factors concurrently and should not focus only on technology.

Why should the sector change? What actions or conditions can trigger industry stakeholders to act?

Market and customer demand: What sorts of pressures and incentives from society customers financiers and investors can be invited and encouraged to create motivation and momentum for change?

What sorts of pressures and incentives from society customers financiers and investors can be invited and encouraged to create motivation and momentum for change? Regulatory incentives: Understand the key instruments applied by global regulators and regional and local authorities. These can include incentives such as tax cuts and disincentives like fines and carbon levies.

How fast can the sector change? What effort is required to implement change at scale?

Ease and time horizon of asset replacement: Consider the time horizon to replace or upgrade equipment where applicable or understand the rate at which alternative technologies are developed. The bigger and more expensive the assets and the longer their lifespans the greater the challenge.

Consider the time horizon to replace or upgrade equipment where applicable or understand the rate at which alternative technologies are developed. The bigger and more expensive the assets and the longer their lifespans the greater the challenge. Ease of infrastructure replacement: For example what does it take to set up green production of new fuels at scale deliver them to ports and prepare for bunkering? The more production capacity needed and the more dispersed the infrastructure the greater the challenge.

What are the best changes for the sector? What decarbonization accomplishments are most realistic and feasible in the near medium and long term?",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also the largest auto insurance agency in the country and thanks to attention from celebrities like Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes their aim is to remain on top for years to come.

The company saw $3.7 billion net income in 2020 based on their latest reports which allows them to continue pulling in big-name spokespeople.

Why does Aaron Rodgers get paid by State Farm?

Aaron Rodgers who is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL is in his 16th season with the Green Bay Packers and has been a “great ambassador” for State Farm over the past decade according to a statement provided to CNN Business.

Rodgers who has been featured in State Farm’s television ads for several years now gets paid an approximate $2-3 million for his services according to Yahoo!

Even though the amount seems like a lot of money Rodgers has been prominently featured in several iconic ads that have created much audience success. We’ve shared a compilation of all Rodgers’ ads with State Farm so far.

State Farm respects Aaron Rodgers' rights

As Rodgers continues to promote State Farm with his appearances and famous profile his recent covid-19 incident set him back with the company but not fully.

Following last week’s drama with Rodgers missing Sunday’s game against the Chiefs because of testing positive for coronavirus with it then emerging he was not vaccinated State Farm stood firmly by their mission to “support safer stronger communities.”

A lot of NFL fanatics were affected by the MVP’s decision and response to whether he was vaccinated including the Packers who were fined over $300000 for covid protocol violations.

Even though State Farm did not support decisions that Rodgers have made they stand by his right to decide matters such as covid vaccinations for himself ""We don't support some of the statements that he has made but we respect his right to have his own personal point of view. We recognize our customers employees agents and brand ambassadors come from all walks of life with differing viewpoints on many issues” a State Farm spokesperson said.

One of Rodgers' other corporate partners Prevea Health decided it could no longer continue with the QB in light of his comments on vaccines.

Rodgers to start against Seahawks

The Packers quarterback was activated off the covid-19 list coming into this weekend and is expected to start against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kick-off is at 4.25pm ET. Check out the full NFL schedule for this weekend.

The challenge: About 7.5 million people in the U.S. have difficulty speaking and being understood due to a brain injury a disease like asmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or some other condition.

Not only can this make it hard for them to communicate with other people it can also stifle their ability to use speech-recognition technology which is particularly disheartening given that many people with speech impairments could greatly benefit from the tech.

“For example people who have ALS often have speech impairments and mobility impairments as the disease progresses” Julie Cattiau a project manager at Google AI told the New York Times in September. “So it would be helpful for them to be able to use the technology to turn the lights on and off or change the temperature without having to move around the house.”

Users record themselves saying 500 phrases to train the app to recognize their particular speech.

Project Relate: Google’s Project Relate app aims to solve both of these problems.

The AI can be individually trained to understand what people with speech impairments are trying to say — this allows them to take advantage of Google’s voice-controlled Assistant.

The app also has a “Listen” feature that transcribes users’ speech to text. They can then show the text to someone who’s having difficulty understanding them or use the “Repeat” feature to repeat what they’re trying to say with a synthesized voice.

Beta testers: Google is currently looking for adults with speech impairments that make it difficult for them to be understood to beta test the app. They must use an Android phone speak English and live in Australia Canada New Zealand or the United States.

Each tester will need to record themselves saying a list of 500 phrases to train the app to recognize their particular speech — that’ll take about 30 to 90 minutes but it doesn’t have to be done in one session. They’ll then be asked to use the app and provide feedback on it to Google.

The big picture: People with speech impairments aren’t the only ones being left behind by speech-recognition tech.

Today’s systems are typically trained to understand “the average North American English voice” Frank Rudzicz a computer scientist at the University of Toronto told the NYT. As a result they aren’t as adept at understanding some English speakers such as those with accents or who speak African American Vernacular English.

AI researchers will need to make collecting data from people who speak “non-standard” English a priority to make the speech recognition tech more universal and Google’s Project Relate is a step in the right direction.

In that year and a half Apple Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon all crossed the 13-figure bar in market cap. In each case they won entry because the market was already anticipating exceptional bottom-line performance in the years ahead. Though Apple was posting the highest sustained earnings in the annals of capital markets investors awarded the iPhone-maker a valuation based on the forecast that its profits would advance in the mid–single-digits on that already gigantic base far into the future. Microsoft was pocketing almost as much as Apple yet it sported a lofty price/earnings ratio of 35 early last year signaling that folks and funds were counting on a fast ramp from there. Google ranked third behind those two club mates in S&P 500 earnings for 2019 yet it too boasted a premium 30-plus multiple auguring that only rapid expansion would deliver decent returns.

Amazon was by far the lowest earner of the group. But its $1.1 trillion cap in February of 2020 stood only 20% below those of Apple and Microsoft. Investors were paying $94 a share for each $1 in profits; hence they expected Amazon’s earnings to absolutely explode going forward.

In the pre-pandemic economy each member of the Trillion Dollar Club dominated its market: Apple in smartphones Microsoft in cloud computing Alphabet in internet advertising and Amazon in online retail. The question was whether their immense power could persist enabling them to keep swelling their sumptuous overall profits at a pace that would drive their stocks higher still. That’s what Wall and Main Streets believed in opening the Trillion Dollar Club. “Even then these companies had been growing fast for a long time” says Vitali Kalesnik director of research in Europe for Research Affiliates a firm that oversees investment strategies for $171 billion in mutual funds and ETFs. “The big question was whether these ‘top dogs’ could keep it up or be toppled by newer players vying for their huge profits and market shares.”

Instead the quartet that broke the trillion-dollar barrier absolutely boomed during the pandemic far surpassing the market’s already great expectations. Both their sales and margins raged lifting those already giant profits to levels that awed even their fans among analysts and market strategists. Put simply the work-and-buy-from-home economy disproportionately rewarded the charter members. The reason is threefold. First the multitrillions in stimulus payments that swelled Americans’ bank accounts during the crisis had to go somewhere and much of it bought products and services that gained vast new popularity in the lockdown. Second slender interest rates provided a giant boost to the top growth companies in part because they raise the value of earnings heavily weighted toward the future especially in the case of Amazon. The speculative craze opened the portal to a new member Tesla the ultimate example of paying big now for profits that need to wax at incredible speed far into the future.

Third the sectors that thrived in a pandemic era were precisely those that trillion-dollar contingent rules. Amazon prospered as families switched en masse from shopping at stores to buying online and flocked to stream its series on Amazon Prime; Google’s ad business flourished as folks stayed glued to the computer screens in their home offices; and Apple and Microsoft garnered a bonanza selling the IT gear and cloud services that power the work-from-home economy. The rise of social media “influencers” in the pandemic helped spawn the bull market in belief that just welcomed Tesla to the club.

The rub: While it was a stretch in pre-COVID days to project that these highfliers could generate profits big enough to justify in four cases their trillion-plus valuations getting there now looks even more like a reach-too-far. And as for Tesla a long membership looks mathematically impossible given that it would need to control two-thirds to over 100% of the EV market by 2030 to justify its $1.1 trillion cap. Though Tesla’s profits are tiny versus its valuation the Trillion Dollar Club overall is boasting what are probably bubble earnings profits so out of whack with the basics that they’re destined to fall from here. Even though that’s what the fundamentals say that’s not how the market’s voting. Investors are paying even more for every dollar of those highly inflated earnings than before the pandemic run-up began. Today the Trillion Dollar Club provides the most extreme example of the market’s paramount problem: U.S. big-caps feature high price/earnings ratios on profits that not only far exceed past summits but dwarf almost any other periods in such bedrock measures as net income as a share of sales. And the main culprit in creating the “rich valuations on top of bubble earnings” obstacle for big-cap stocks is the heavy betting on the Trillion Dollar Club members themselves.

How the club first hit $1 trillion then jumped in a flash to $2 trillion

It’s surprising to recall that less than four years ago the world hadn’t seen its first trillion-dollar publicly traded enterprise. At the close of 2017 the most valuable player on earth was Apple at $861 billion and only five companies’ worth exceeded half-a-trillion. The prospects for a $2 trillion champ anytime soon seemed remote indeed.

Apple arrived first hitting the mark on Aug. 7 2018 and by our definition Microsoft was second to join ringing the bell in April of 2019. Amazon briefly reached 13 figures just one month later than Apple in the summer of 2018 but then retreated and didn’t reach $1 trillion and keep rising until July of 2019. So we’ll call it third to win membership. Most recent to don the club crest is Alphabet; it crossed the portal on Jan. 16 2020 just a month before the crisis struck. Then the COVID economy supercharged both their earnings and share prices. Three of the four got their portraits displayed in the paneled library by hitting $2 trillion. Apple triumphed first on Aug. 19 2020 a mere two years after exceeding a single trillion. Next came Microsoft on June 22 of this year and Alphabet clinched what the champs might call “two units” on Nov. 9.

Two weeks earlier on Oct. 25 Tesla entered the Trillion Dollar Club propelled by a strong Q3 earnings report and Hertz’s pledge to buy 100000 Teslas. That news helped boost its market cap by almost half-a-trillion dollars in three weeks the biggest increase over a brief period in the history of equity exchanges. Then CEO Elon Musk sent Tesla’s shares into retreat by calling the Hertz deal into question and declaring via Twitter his plans to sell 10% of his shares. But as of late afternoon on Nov. 11 Tesla was still seated at the club’s bridge table at a valuation of $1.06 trillion.

The Trillion Dollar Club vastly outperforms the raging overall market

Let’s examine where the Trillion Dollar Club stood at the beginning of the crisis versus the current weight of its earnings and valuation in the S&P 500. For this analysis I’ll include Tesla in recognition of its current membership though it hadn’t yet joined at the start of the pandemic. Our starting date: Feb. 19 2020 when the S&P notched an all-time high of 3386. Since then the index has gained 37% closing on Nov. 11 at 4653. Over that 18-month span all of the hard-partying clubsters beat the market; Amazon rose 46%; Microsoft 78%; Apple 84%; Alphabet 93%; and Tesla 480%.

To gauge how their rising girth tilted the market we’ll consider the group as a single company Trillion Dollar Inc. As of February of last year the group’s market cap totaled $5.138 trillion. That already marked the culmination of sterling performance across many years. Trillion Dollar Inc.’s share of the S&P 500’s then overall market cap of $26.8 trillion was 19.2% and its combined earnings were $141 billion. Hence its P/E multiple hovered at 36.4 meaning investors expected substantial profit growth in the years ahead.

And that’s what they got courtesy of the New Economy. Over that tumultuous year and a half net GAAP profits swelled from $141 billion to $257 billion a jump of $116 billion or 82%. That’s 40% a year on an annualized basis. But Trillion Dollar Inc.’s market cap rose even faster from $5.138 trillion to $9.76 trillion for a gain of 90%. Hence its P/E rose from the high bar of 36.4 to the daunting bogey of 38. That hike showed that investors were positing even higher profit growth than their already high benchmarks before the pandemic. Their wager: Earnings that had grown 80% in less than two years would keep rocking. See what I mean about towering valuations atop outsize earnings?

The club has made the overall market a lot more expensive

Over this period earnings for the entire S&P 500 also rose sharply going from $1.15 trillion to $1.48 trillion an increase of $300 billion or 29%. But Trillion Dollar Inc.’s profits raced three times as fast. Our elites contributed $116 billion or an astounding 35% of the big-caps’ overall leap. The 500’s total valuation also waxed strongly from $26.8 trillion to $39.5 trillion. But the Trillion Dollar crowd far outpaced that 47% march by a roaring 90%. As a result their $4.6 trillion advance accounted for 36% of the index’s entire progress.

The upshot is that the Trillion Dollar Club’s outperformance had two effects. First it gigantically raised the S&P’s profit base contributing greatly to what looks like a profit bubble. Second its valuation rose so fast even relative to earnings that it helped make the S&P 500 superexpensive. The other 450-odd companies are trading at a P/E of 24.3; but the members’ royal multiple of 38 lifts the overall number to 26.7 or 10%. And since their shares account for 36% of the S&P’s valuation a drop of 20% in Trillion Dollar Inc. would hammer the index by nearly 8%.

Margins that are impossible to sustain

It’s especially instructive and scary to compare the club’s profit margins to their pre-COVID levels and where they sit alongside those of the 490-odd members of the S&P. In February of 2020 the S&P booked a net profits-to-sales ratio of 9.8% and the club was delivering 16.5%. Both were already well above historical norms. But in Q3 of this year the 500 hit 11.7% and get ready the club registered 20.1%. Put another way the club’s getting 20.1% margins and the other 90% of the S&P 500 are reporting 9% a number that’s well above the average for the past two decades.

The trend is dangerous because the club accounts for just 10% of the S&P’s sales. To be sure its members have long furnished a far bigger portion of profits than its share of revenues. But in the pandemic their weight in the S&P’s market cap expanded far more than their size in the economy as measured by revenues. Investors in big-cap index funds are now parking at lot more of their money in club stocks that are extremely expensive especially when measured against an earnings blowout that will probably reverse. And the higher the club’s prices go the more of them investors in passive funds will own.

It’s certain that the club’s great brands and market leading technologies and in the case of Microsoft Alphabet and Apple capital-light models should be posting well above average profitability. What’s troublesome: 20% margins of net income to sales are far too big to last. It beats the club’s combined results in the pre-COVID years by something like 40%. As Kalesnik says profits that big are a magnet for competitors. The pandemic economy provided a gigantic windfall for shooting stars that were already due for a rush of fresh competition and probably a slowdown before the lockdown radically changed how families shopped and what they shopped for. Loads of demand stepped forward that won’t be repeated. Kalesnik notes that few “top dogs” rule their markets for much over a decade. The pandemic pushed the club into a new gear just when its rampage might have slowed.

The most likely scenario: The Trillion Dollar Club’s profits will drop or at least go flat. In the latter case they’d decline in “real terms” by trailing inflation. The club’s new far heavier weight in the S&P 500 is likely to make a looming drop much more severe than if their valuations didn’t stand at such a vertiginous multiple of towering peak profits. The rise of these top dogs to the Trillion Dollar Club has been one of the great spectacles of the past three years.

By putting three players in the gilded trillion-dollar clubhouse and two others in the $2 trillion commodore’s circle the market has lifted hurdles for future performance so high that the members will struggle to deliver decent returns. Investors are giving the members super-low handicaps wagering they’ll clinch scores in the club golf championship they probably can’t achieve. Young rivals tuning up on the public courses are aching to lower their status on the club’s rolls or even bump them from capitalism’s new pantheon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJtb25rZXkuY29tL2Jsb2cvdG9wLTEwLXN0b2NrLXBpY2tzLW9mLWphY2stcmlwc3RlZW5zLXBvdHJlcm8tY2FwaXRhbC1yZXNlYXJjaC05OTk1NzYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Stock Picks of Jack Ripsteen's Potrero Capital Research,"In this article we discuss the top 10 stock picks of Jack Ripsteen’s Potrero Capital Research.

At this point we see very little chance that regulation changes Facebook’s business model in a meaningful and adverse way. Regarding the recent data shared by a former Facebook employee and the company itself on some of the unfortunate negative consequences of social media we recognize these types of issues will inevitably linger in different forms and fashions well into the future. We have been focused on the ability of Facebook to identify and mitigate these negative consequences while amplifying the value users typically cite for its apps across a long list of use cases. We continuously monitor the vibrance of the user base on Facebook’s apps to confirm that value.”

The challenge: About 7.5 million people in the U.S. have difficulty speaking and being understood due to a brain injury a disease like asmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or some other condition.

Not only can this make it hard for them to communicate with other people it can also stifle their ability to use speech-recognition technology which is particularly disheartening given that many people with speech impairments could greatly benefit from the tech.

“For example people who have ALS often have speech impairments and mobility impairments as the disease progresses” Julie Cattiau a project manager at Google AI told the New York Times in September. “So it would be helpful for them to be able to use the technology to turn the lights on and off or change the temperature without having to move around the house.”

Users record themselves saying 500 phrases to train the app to recognize their particular speech.

Project Relate: Google’s Project Relate app aims to solve both of these problems.

The AI can be individually trained to understand what people with speech impairments are trying to say — this allows them to take advantage of Google’s voice-controlled Assistant.

The app also has a “Listen” feature that transcribes users’ speech to text. They can then show the text to someone who’s having difficulty understanding them or use the “Repeat” feature to repeat what they’re trying to say with a synthesized voice.

Beta testers: Google is currently looking for adults with speech impairments that make it difficult for them to be understood to beta test the app. They must use an Android phone speak English and live in Australia Canada New Zealand or the United States.

Each tester will need to record themselves saying a list of 500 phrases to train the app to recognize their particular speech — that’ll take about 30 to 90 minutes but it doesn’t have to be done in one session. They’ll then be asked to use the app and provide feedback on it to Google.

The big picture: People with speech impairments aren’t the only ones being left behind by speech-recognition tech.

Today’s systems are typically trained to understand “the average North American English voice” Frank Rudzicz a computer scientist at the University of Toronto told the NYT. As a result they aren’t as adept at understanding some English speakers such as those with accents or who speak African American Vernacular English.

AI researchers will need to make collecting data from people who speak “non-standard” English a priority to make the speech recognition tech more universal and Google’s Project Relate is a step in the right direction.

In that year and a half Apple Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon all crossed the 13-figure bar in market cap. In each case they won entry because the market was already anticipating exceptional bottom-line performance in the years ahead. Though Apple was posting the highest sustained earnings in the annals of capital markets investors awarded the iPhone-maker a valuation based on the forecast that its profits would advance in the mid–single-digits on that already gigantic base far into the future. Microsoft was pocketing almost as much as Apple yet it sported a lofty price/earnings ratio of 35 early last year signaling that folks and funds were counting on a fast ramp from there. Google ranked third behind those two club mates in S&P 500 earnings for 2019 yet it too boasted a premium 30-plus multiple auguring that only rapid expansion would deliver decent returns.

Amazon was by far the lowest earner of the group. But its $1.1 trillion cap in February of 2020 stood only 20% below those of Apple and Microsoft. Investors were paying $94 a share for each $1 in profits; hence they expected Amazon’s earnings to absolutely explode going forward.

In the pre-pandemic economy each member of the Trillion Dollar Club dominated its market: Apple in smartphones Microsoft in cloud computing Alphabet in internet advertising and Amazon in online retail. The question was whether their immense power could persist enabling them to keep swelling their sumptuous overall profits at a pace that would drive their stocks higher still. That’s what Wall and Main Streets believed in opening the Trillion Dollar Club. “Even then these companies had been growing fast for a long time” says Vitali Kalesnik director of research in Europe for Research Affiliates a firm that oversees investment strategies for $171 billion in mutual funds and ETFs. “The big question was whether these ‘top dogs’ could keep it up or be toppled by newer players vying for their huge profits and market shares.”

Instead the quartet that broke the trillion-dollar barrier absolutely boomed during the pandemic far surpassing the market’s already great expectations. Both their sales and margins raged lifting those already giant profits to levels that awed even their fans among analysts and market strategists. Put simply the work-and-buy-from-home economy disproportionately rewarded the charter members. The reason is threefold. First the multitrillions in stimulus payments that swelled Americans’ bank accounts during the crisis had to go somewhere and much of it bought products and services that gained vast new popularity in the lockdown. Second slender interest rates provided a giant boost to the top growth companies in part because they raise the value of earnings heavily weighted toward the future especially in the case of Amazon. The speculative craze opened the portal to a new member Tesla the ultimate example of paying big now for profits that need to wax at incredible speed far into the future.

Third the sectors that thrived in a pandemic era were precisely those that trillion-dollar contingent rules. Amazon prospered as families switched en masse from shopping at stores to buying online and flocked to stream its series on Amazon Prime; Google’s ad business flourished as folks stayed glued to the computer screens in their home offices; and Apple and Microsoft garnered a bonanza selling the IT gear and cloud services that power the work-from-home economy. The rise of social media “influencers” in the pandemic helped spawn the bull market in belief that just welcomed Tesla to the club.

The rub: While it was a stretch in pre-COVID days to project that these highfliers could generate profits big enough to justify in four cases their trillion-plus valuations getting there now looks even more like a reach-too-far. And as for Tesla a long membership looks mathematically impossible given that it would need to control two-thirds to over 100% of the EV market by 2030 to justify its $1.1 trillion cap. Though Tesla’s profits are tiny versus its valuation the Trillion Dollar Club overall is boasting what are probably bubble earnings profits so out of whack with the basics that they’re destined to fall from here. Even though that’s what the fundamentals say that’s not how the market’s voting. Investors are paying even more for every dollar of those highly inflated earnings than before the pandemic run-up began. Today the Trillion Dollar Club provides the most extreme example of the market’s paramount problem: U.S. big-caps feature high price/earnings ratios on profits that not only far exceed past summits but dwarf almost any other periods in such bedrock measures as net income as a share of sales. And the main culprit in creating the “rich valuations on top of bubble earnings” obstacle for big-cap stocks is the heavy betting on the Trillion Dollar Club members themselves.

How the club first hit $1 trillion then jumped in a flash to $2 trillion

It’s surprising to recall that less than four years ago the world hadn’t seen its first trillion-dollar publicly traded enterprise. At the close of 2017 the most valuable player on earth was Apple at $861 billion and only five companies’ worth exceeded half-a-trillion. The prospects for a $2 trillion champ anytime soon seemed remote indeed.

Apple arrived first hitting the mark on Aug. 7 2018 and by our definition Microsoft was second to join ringing the bell in April of 2019. Amazon briefly reached 13 figures just one month later than Apple in the summer of 2018 but then retreated and didn’t reach $1 trillion and keep rising until July of 2019. So we’ll call it third to win membership. Most recent to don the club crest is Alphabet; it crossed the portal on Jan. 16 2020 just a month before the crisis struck. Then the COVID economy supercharged both their earnings and share prices. Three of the four got their portraits displayed in the paneled library by hitting $2 trillion. Apple triumphed first on Aug. 19 2020 a mere two years after exceeding a single trillion. Next came Microsoft on June 22 of this year and Alphabet clinched what the champs might call “two units” on Nov. 9.

Two weeks earlier on Oct. 25 Tesla entered the Trillion Dollar Club propelled by a strong Q3 earnings report and Hertz’s pledge to buy 100000 Teslas. That news helped boost its market cap by almost half-a-trillion dollars in three weeks the biggest increase over a brief period in the history of equity exchanges. Then CEO Elon Musk sent Tesla’s shares into retreat by calling the Hertz deal into question and declaring via Twitter his plans to sell 10% of his shares. But as of late afternoon on Nov. 11 Tesla was still seated at the club’s bridge table at a valuation of $1.06 trillion.

The Trillion Dollar Club vastly outperforms the raging overall market

Let’s examine where the Trillion Dollar Club stood at the beginning of the crisis versus the current weight of its earnings and valuation in the S&P 500. For this analysis I’ll include Tesla in recognition of its current membership though it hadn’t yet joined at the start of the pandemic. Our starting date: Feb. 19 2020 when the S&P notched an all-time high of 3386. Since then the index has gained 37% closing on Nov. 11 at 4653. Over that 18-month span all of the hard-partying clubsters beat the market; Amazon rose 46%; Microsoft 78%; Apple 84%; Alphabet 93%; and Tesla 480%.

To gauge how their rising girth tilted the market we’ll consider the group as a single company Trillion Dollar Inc. As of February of last year the group’s market cap totaled $5.138 trillion. That already marked the culmination of sterling performance across many years. Trillion Dollar Inc.’s share of the S&P 500’s then overall market cap of $26.8 trillion was 19.2% and its combined earnings were $141 billion. Hence its P/E multiple hovered at 36.4 meaning investors expected substantial profit growth in the years ahead.

And that’s what they got courtesy of the New Economy. Over that tumultuous year and a half net GAAP profits swelled from $141 billion to $257 billion a jump of $116 billion or 82%. That’s 40% a year on an annualized basis. But Trillion Dollar Inc.’s market cap rose even faster from $5.138 trillion to $9.76 trillion for a gain of 90%. Hence its P/E rose from the high bar of 36.4 to the daunting bogey of 38. That hike showed that investors were positing even higher profit growth than their already high benchmarks before the pandemic. Their wager: Earnings that had grown 80% in less than two years would keep rocking. See what I mean about towering valuations atop outsize earnings?

The club has made the overall market a lot more expensive

Over this period earnings for the entire S&P 500 also rose sharply going from $1.15 trillion to $1.48 trillion an increase of $300 billion or 29%. But Trillion Dollar Inc.’s profits raced three times as fast. Our elites contributed $116 billion or an astounding 35% of the big-caps’ overall leap. The 500’s total valuation also waxed strongly from $26.8 trillion to $39.5 trillion. But the Trillion Dollar crowd far outpaced that 47% march by a roaring 90%. As a result their $4.6 trillion advance accounted for 36% of the index’s entire progress.

The upshot is that the Trillion Dollar Club’s outperformance had two effects. First it gigantically raised the S&P’s profit base contributing greatly to what looks like a profit bubble. Second its valuation rose so fast even relative to earnings that it helped make the S&P 500 superexpensive. The other 450-odd companies are trading at a P/E of 24.3; but the members’ royal multiple of 38 lifts the overall number to 26.7 or 10%. And since their shares account for 36% of the S&P’s valuation a drop of 20% in Trillion Dollar Inc. would hammer the index by nearly 8%.

Margins that are impossible to sustain

It’s especially instructive and scary to compare the club’s profit margins to their pre-COVID levels and where they sit alongside those of the 490-odd members of the S&P. In February of 2020 the S&P booked a net profits-to-sales ratio of 9.8% and the club was delivering 16.5%. Both were already well above historical norms. But in Q3 of this year the 500 hit 11.7% and get ready the club registered 20.1%. Put another way the club’s getting 20.1% margins and the other 90% of the S&P 500 are reporting 9% a number that’s well above the average for the past two decades.

The trend is dangerous because the club accounts for just 10% of the S&P’s sales. To be sure its members have long furnished a far bigger portion of profits than its share of revenues. But in the pandemic their weight in the S&P’s market cap expanded far more than their size in the economy as measured by revenues. Investors in big-cap index funds are now parking at lot more of their money in club stocks that are extremely expensive especially when measured against an earnings blowout that will probably reverse. And the higher the club’s prices go the more of them investors in passive funds will own.

It’s certain that the club’s great brands and market leading technologies and in the case of Microsoft Alphabet and Apple capital-light models should be posting well above average profitability. What’s troublesome: 20% margins of net income to sales are far too big to last. It beats the club’s combined results in the pre-COVID years by something like 40%. As Kalesnik says profits that big are a magnet for competitors. The pandemic economy provided a gigantic windfall for shooting stars that were already due for a rush of fresh competition and probably a slowdown before the lockdown radically changed how families shopped and what they shopped for. Loads of demand stepped forward that won’t be repeated. Kalesnik notes that few “top dogs” rule their markets for much over a decade. The pandemic pushed the club into a new gear just when its rampage might have slowed.

The most likely scenario: The Trillion Dollar Club’s profits will drop or at least go flat. In the latter case they’d decline in “real terms” by trailing inflation. The club’s new far heavier weight in the S&P 500 is likely to make a looming drop much more severe than if their valuations didn’t stand at such a vertiginous multiple of towering peak profits. The rise of these top dogs to the Trillion Dollar Club has been one of the great spectacles of the past three years.

By putting three players in the gilded trillion-dollar clubhouse and two others in the $2 trillion commodore’s circle the market has lifted hurdles for future performance so high that the members will struggle to deliver decent returns. Investors are giving the members super-low handicaps wagering they’ll clinch scores in the club golf championship they probably can’t achieve. Young rivals tuning up on the public courses are aching to lower their status on the club’s rolls or even bump them from capitalism’s new pantheon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJtb25rZXkuY29tL2Jsb2cvdG9wLTEwLXN0b2NrLXBpY2tzLW9mLWphY2stcmlwc3RlZW5zLXBvdHJlcm8tY2FwaXRhbC1yZXNlYXJjaC05OTk1NzYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Stock Picks of Jack Ripsteen's Potrero Capital Research,"In this article we discuss the top 10 stock picks of Jack Ripsteen’s Potrero Capital Research.

At this point we see very little chance that regulation changes Facebook’s business model in a meaningful and adverse way. Regarding the recent data shared by a former Facebook employee and the company itself on some of the unfortunate negative consequences of social media we recognize these types of issues will inevitably linger in different forms and fashions well into the future. We have been focused on the ability of Facebook to identify and mitigate these negative consequences while amplifying the value users typically cite for its apps across a long list of use cases. We continuously monitor the vibrance of the user base on Facebook’s apps to confirm that value.”

I was told to get in contact with their corporate office before I could speak to anyone but after a lot of phone calls and messages I still couldn’t get in contact with the right people so I haven’t been able to speak with any Amazon officials or workers.

I got information from their website other stories about Amazon Flex and I spoke to a few of the drivers themselves (they asked to remain anonymous for this story.) The website paints a fairly rosy picture while some of the newspaper articles speak very poorly of the way Amazon treats its drivers. Based on what I heard from the drivers themselves the truth seems to be somewhere in the middle.

Amazon Flex is basically Uber for delivery drivers. Workers use their own vehicles and once approved they are notified of delivery opportunities by way of an app.

One of the key points highlighted on Amazon’s website is that most drivers make between $18-25 per hour while an article from the Seattle Times included quotes from drivers saying they actually made much less money than that. Drivers spoke about losing a lot of that money because they have to pay for gas.

Additionally many drivers couldn’t work for as many hours as they wanted to because there simply weren’t enough packages for them to deliver.

Some of the drivers work at odd hours to make more deliveries and others talked about having to “constantly rush.” Drivers joked about getting carpal tunnel syndrome from checking the app so many times for work.

“It’s not exactly how it’s advertised but I’m happy to have work” A driver rold me. “Some days are tough and I’m not able to work as many hours as I want to. That’s the most frustrating thing for me but I was out of work before and I’m grateful to have this job now. I live near here and I don’t mind doing this.”

Another driver said he had the same problem and that he was lucky if he could get six hours of work per day.

“I don’t do this full time and I do this to make some extra money” she said. “I’m not relying only on this job for my salary so it’s not as tough if there’s a bad day. But at the same time you want to make as much as you can.”

From what I could see drivers weren’t speeding to make deliveries like some of the drivers in the Seattle Times article had to. The drivers in Red Hook were driving within the speed limit and following all of the traffic rules which is especially important since the facility is right across the street from a school (BASIS Independent Brooklyn.)

Nobody I saw seemed to be stressed out about getting deliveries done. The people that I met were kind and they were able to take a couple of minutes to talk.

“I didn’t have a lot of opportunities with the pandemic going on and when I heard about this I gave it a shot” another driver said. “I was able to get this job when a lot of people I know weren’t working. No job is going to be perfect but there have been more positives than negatives for me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYW1hem9uLXRha2VzLWl0cy13YXItdG8tZ2V0LXByb2R1Y3RzLXRvLW91ci1kb29yLXRvLXRoZS1oaWdoLXNlYXMtY29tbWVudGFyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon takes its war to get products to our door to the high seas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

MILWAUKEE -- An Amazon driver is thankful to be alive after an Amtrak train slammed into his truck.

He was transporting packages west of Milwaukee when the collision happened Wednesday WISN reported.

The man said he's still sore and shocked about the crash.

""Yeah it just boom"" Alexander Evans said.

Evans said he's still in shock after an Amtrak train slammed into his Amazon delivery truck cutting it in half Wednesday.

""Just air and the pressure. I felt the airbags and it was just -- I I didn't know what to feel to be honest with you"" he said.

The Milwaukee husband and father of two little girls posted photos of the wreckage on his Facebook page.

He traced his route in red on a map showing how the road parallels the track before the crossing limiting a driver's view of the tracks.

""I just tried. I made a look as I was going down the hill the hill to swerve. I didn't see anything. He was on my left side"" Evans said.

He added that he's deaf in his left ear and didn't hear the horn at first.

""Literally it was like one long beep like a horn from the from the train and I put my foot on the gas. I was like I don't know how far I'm going to get away from him"" he said.

FREEBURG Ill. — Nearly half of the natural gas Ameren Illinois customers will use this winter is already in the state but you might be surprised at where it is stored.

Eric Kozak with Ameren Illinois said the state ""has some natural geologic formations that allow us to store gas in the ground.""

You don’t see them because they are deep under the farm fields of Illinois in a dozen locations across central and southern Illinois including the Freeburg storage facility just south of town. Other facilities in our area include Centralia and Hillsboro Illinois.

""These are natural gas and oil fields where the gas was taken out and depleted so we repurposed them"" Kozak said. ""We take gas from the pipeline and put it in the ground.""

The underground storage capacity in the Freeburg site could fill a container the size of Busch Stadium more than 80 times.

It's a cost-effective way of insuring availability of natural gas during the coldest part of the year because Ameren Illinois buys the gas during the warm months when natural gas prices are typically cheaper and demand is lower. Forty to forty-five percent of all the natural gas used this winter by Ameren Illinois customers was stored before November.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s the only way his 7-year-old daughter would make it to Boo Bash Disney World’s $159-a-person Halloween event the following night.

Mr. Maness’s flight was one of around 2000 the airline canceled that weekend. What made him angry he said was not the cancellation per se. It was that he only learned about it from another passenger after an agent checked their bags and that his wife had wasted a total of 90 minutes on two calls trying to rebook their flights. (Both calls were dropped.) His wife Carissa said she was also infuriated by losing hours trying to reach someone on the phone to explain why a month later they have yet to get their $1600 refund.

“A massive airline like Southwest is making money hand over fist” said Ms. Maness. Indeed Southwest reported a $446 million profit in the third quarter thanks in part to $763 million in government support. “They should have more customer service representatives on standby to handle the influx of calls” she said.

Similarly Paulina Morales whose flight was among the more than 2000 flights that American Airlines canceled between Oct. 30 and Nov. 1 was less annoyed about the cancellation than about the length of time she spent on the phone trying to rebook a flight from Chihuahua Mexico to the Los Angeles area: 4 hours and 54 minutes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zsb3JpZGEvMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1yZWR1Y2VzLXNlcnZpY2UtdG8taGFpdGktZnJvbS1mbG9yaWRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines reduces service to Haiti from Florida,"MIAMI — With the United States warning Americans to get out of Haiti and planes flying down empty amid the country’s spike in kidnappings and gang-aggravated fuel crisis American Airlines is cutting back service.

The major U.S. carrier said that as of Monday it will no longer be operating its three daily flights to Port-au-Prince one from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and two from Miami International Airport.

“Effective Monday Nov. 15 we will be reducing our flying to Haiti to one daily flight between Port-au-Prince (PAP) and Miami (MIA)” spokeswoman Laura Masvidal said. “We apologize to our impacted customers and we’re working to re-accommodate them on other flights.”

Masvidal cited frequent cancellations and reduced customer demand for travel to and from Haiti for the decision.

Since last month Haiti has been in the throes of one of its worst crises yet as gangs abduct foreign aid workers and Haitians hijack fuel tankers and prevent others from accessing the Varreux fuel terminal outside Port-au-Prince. The blockade has led to life-threatening fuel shortages throughout the country.

American Airlines’ announcement late Friday came the same day that the leader of the federation of violent gangs that have been blocking the distribution of fuel from Varreux since Oct. 17 announced a lifting of the the blockade to allow gasoline diesel and kerosene to start flowing again.

But Jimmy “Barbecue” Cherizier the former Haitian police officer who is now a gang leader said the “truce” is only temporary. It is to allow for the resignation of interim Haiti Prime Minister Ariel Henry he said and for “a week of reflection” among Haitians in commemoration of the Nov. 18 1803 Battle of Vertieres the historic victory against France that led to Haitian independence.

“If Ariel Henry doesn’t resign the same problem will continue” Cherizier said in a video statement while dressed in all black. “We will remove our truce and that will be our strongest fight against him. After that no one will be able to say anything against us again.”

A member of the prime minister’s team said in response to Cherizier’s demands: “We don’t deal with gangs.”

The operators of the Varreux terminal the West Indies Energy Company SA WINECO said fuel began flowing again at 10 a.m. Friday.

In a statement it “unequivocally” denied information circulating on social media and certain Haiti radio stations stating that WINECO is refusing to deliver fuel even though everything is in place to ensure safety and free movement in the area.

The security situation the company said has worsened since Nov. 10 because of ongoing confrontations between the police and various armed groups.

“WINECO confirms that in spite of the risks and their fears for their lives employees continue to show up for work every day and are available to fill customers’ trucks. It goes without saying that gunfire in the vicinity of fuel tanks is also of great concern” the statement said. “WINECO does not own the fuel nor can it decide on its delivery. It remains at the discretion of its customers the sole owners of the fuel.”

Cherizier who fashions himself as a leader announced nine demands including the resignation of Henry the reopening of the Varreux fuel terminal at the Port-au-Prince port starting Friday afternoon and the immediate return of armored police vehicles back to their base.

“Stop shooting on the ghettos. Stop the political persecution” he said.

Since last month the coalition of gangs known as the G-9 Family and Allies has blocked fuel tankers from accessing Varreux which stores about 90 percent of Haiti’s petroleum products.

The blockade coupled with renewed inter-gang fighting in the vicinity of a second smaller terminal in the Martissant neighborhood in the capital has forced hospitals to turn away patients schools to shutter and banks to reduce their hours to three days a week. Adding to the crisis is the refusal by drivers of tankers to work after several were kidnapped and their trucks were hijacked.

A security corridor established by the Haiti National Police has also failed to provide relief.

Because of the fuel shortage hospitals have been forced to turn away patients and others have reported deaths that would have been preventable with access to oxygen and diesel for electricity. Even foreign embassies have not been immune.

Citing the gang-aggravated fuel shortage and kidnappings the U.S. and Canadian embassies have urged their citizens in Haiti to leave the country warning that commercial flights may soon not be available. The U.S. first issued its warning last week in a travel alert and reissued it again Thursday.

The warnings to depart Haiti come as 16 Americans and a Canadian remain hostages in the country more than three weeks after being kidnapped by a gang east of Port-au-Prince. The group of 17 Christian missionaries with Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries were kidnapped at gunpoint.

In the case of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince the warning has created panic among Americans as well as Haitians many of whom have been unable to apply for or renew their visas because of the low staffing in the consular section.

Spokespeople for the two other major U.S.-based carriers that service Haiti Spirit and JetBlue have said their schedules remain unchanged.

Cherizier is wanted in connection with several massacres in Haiti and has been sanctioned by the U.S. government along with two other former Haitian government officials after they were implicated in the brutal murder and rape of dozens of Haitians including children in 2018 in the La Saline neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. Despite calls from France and others in the international community for his arrest he remains at large holding news conferences and flexing his strength amid a weak government and police force.

During the “week of reflection” Cherizier said gang members will be reflecting with the Haitians in the diaspora and across the country’s 10 regions on the unconditional resignation of Henry who was tapped by President Jovenel Moise weeks before his July 7 assassination to serve as a consensus prime minister. Since taking the job however he has faced challenges from the gangs and members of Haiti’s civil society who have been demanding a two-year transition to a new government.

“We are a force we have proven that. Everyone has seen our strength” Cherizier said. “Everyone has seen that Ariel Henry cannot govern the country.

Cherizier said the doors of the Varreux terminal which is located in the Cite Soleil neighborhood “are wide open” and the trucks can travel “without worries.”

All the government institutions and private companies also can open their doors without fear he said while demanding that the fuel be sold at the same price as it was being sold before the crisis hit.

In a statement Friday ambassadors from Germany Brazil Canada Spain the U.S. France the European Union as well as the special representatives of the Organization of American States and the United Nations called on Haiti’s politicians and business people to act responsibly in the interest of the Haitian people and to prioritize the restoration of law and order as well as the normal functioning of strategic infrastructure.

Known as the CORE Group the diplomats condemned the violent criminal acts that have been exacerbating “the already deep suffering of Haitians” and hampering the work of the Haiti National Police.

They are deeply concerned they said about the petroleum supply crisis that has been affecting the country for several weeks as well as its humanitarian economic and social impact on the Haitian population.

“A peaceful context is essential for the restoration of the authority of the State the effective treatment of the problem of insecurity and the emergence of a broad consensus on the most adequate way of leading the country towards general elections” the statement said.

The introduction of daily service from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to New Delhi Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) marks American’s return to the Indian capital city.

As part of its international expansion the airline will also commence daily service between Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and Kempegowda International Airport Bengaluru (BLR) in early 2022 linking two critical global technology markets with the U.S. and beyond.

American will use Boeing 777-300ER aircraft -its largest widebody fleet for its services to New Delhi and connect many commodities such as leather products textiles ready-made garments pharmaceuticals machinery and technology parts with destinations around the world via JFK.

“India is a really exciting market for our cargo business and we are delighted to be returning to these key destinations. There has long been a demand from our customers in the region for a direct link with New York and we anticipate strong support for the service” Tim Isik sales director – EMEA & APAC for American Airlines Cargo.

The company’s GSSA in India is Air Logistics which will be selling outbound cargo capacity from DEL to JFK.

“Recent capacity constraints to the US have created a huge demand for air cargo capacity ex-India and at such times when a stimulus is needed to reinvigorate recharge and revive our economies this new service is a huge boost. We are ecstatic that the two largest production powerhouses of the world are on the cusp of being better connected through this new service” Sakshi Gupta country manager India – Air Logistics Group.

The total price tag for the package comes to over $1.2 trillion when routine funding for highways is included making it the largest public works bill since President Eisenhower created the Interstate Highway System.

The vote in the House was 228-206—13 Republicans supported the bill and 6 Democrats voted against it. The Senate passed the infrastructure plan in August with a bipartisan 69-30 vote. I think we can assume that President Joe Biden will quickly sign the bill into law.

In addition to the 7.5 big ones for public charging infrastructure the bill includes: around $110 billion in new investment for roads and bridges; $65 billion for power grid upgrades; $66 billion for Amtrak and other rail; $39 billion for public transit; $5 billion for new school buses half of which can be spent on diesel or CNG buses; $17 billion for port infrastructure; and $25 billion for airport repairs and measures to reduce congestion and emissions. The latter two items could include some funding for transport electrification (airport ground equipment port drayage vehicles).

After passing the infrastructure bill the House adopted a procedural rule establishing floor debate parameters for the Democrats’ next project: the $1.75-trillion Build Back Better Act which includes several e-mobility-related measures. One of these is a reboot of the federal EV tax credit including a controversial bonus for union-built EVs.

The battle over this next bill could stretch into December but for now Democrats are taking a hard-earned victory lap. “Generations from now people will look back and know this is when America won the economic competition for the 21st century” said President Biden.

Why Do Environmentalists Hate It?,"Thomas Catenacci

Expanding U.S. nuclear power — an energy source that many environmentalists and lawmakers oppose — could be the most reliable way to achieve a carbon-free electricity grid according to experts.

Nuclear energy is considered a renewable energy source because it produces zero emissions through fission the process of splitting uranium atoms according to the Department of Energy. Currently nuclear accounts for about 9% of total U.S. energy consumption slightly less than all other renewable energy sources combined and coal government data showed.

“If there is meant to be a serious conversation about changing the way we generate electricity in the United States particularly with a focus on carbon emissions nuclear has to be a part of the conversation” American Institute for Economic Research senior faculty Ryan Yonk told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“Absent that I don’t see a way that we change electrical generation” he continued.

President Joe Biden said in April that the U.S. would have a completely carbon-free electric grid by 2035. Reducing total economy-wide emissions 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050 are among his other goals.

However the Biden administration has prioritized developing wind and solar energy over nuclear since taking office. Experts have criticized wind and solar as intermittent and unreliable sources of energy.

There are still burdensome regulations preventing development of future nuclear reactors nationwide. More than a dozen states have strict rules restricting such development according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Just a handful of nuclear plants have been constructed in the U.S. over the last two decades. In 2012 a plan to build a nuclear plant was approved marking the first approval in more than 30 years and in 2016 a Tennessee reactor became the first to come online in 20 years the Energy Information Administration said.

‘Both expensive and dangerous’

Dating back to the 1970s environmental activists have opposed relying upon nuclear. In October the Center for Biological Diversity and five other prominent environmental groups penned a letter to the White House Senate and House urging them not to include funding for nuclear in the budget reconciliation package making its way through Congress.

“Nuclear energy has no place in a safe clean sustainable future” the international environmental group Greenpeace said on its website. “Nuclear energy is both expensive and dangerous and just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean.”

Greenpeace argued that nuclear energy poses the risk of a catastrophic meltdown similar to Fukushima and Chernobyl. The group also said there is no clean or safe way to clean up radioactive waste which is created during the fission process.

The total used nuclear fuel used over the last 60 years though could fit on a football field at a depth of less than 10 yards according to the Energy Department. In addition emerging technology may offer a path forward for recycling spent nuclear waste.

“I think this is a slow process right and I don’t know that there’s any one deal or a meeting that entirely turns the corner but we’re headed down a road” Craig Piercy executive director and CEO at the American Nuclear Society (ANS) told the DCNF in an interview. “The sooner that we realize it and plan for it the better off we’re going to be in terms of our energy reliability and resiliency.”

“Nuclear is a big part of achieving that long term objective” he added.

Piercy — whose organization represents 10000 nuclear engineers scientists and technologists — believes more people will begin to believe more in nuclear as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. He noted that the Union of Concerned Scientists an environmental group recently changed their tune on the issue.

Meanwhile the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing examining nuclear power on Nov. 4. Experts from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) American Electric Power and Council of Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals testified in favor of nuclear as a reliable energy source.

INL Executive Director Shannon Bragg-Sitton said modern nuclear reactors “are designed to operate at higher temperatures run more efficiently and provide greater flexibility.” INL is the nation’s main lab for nuclear energy research and development.

“As developing economies begin to shift to more energy-intensive industries the U.S. must be on the cutting edge of developing the technologies required to decarbonize industry” Chairman Joe Manchin stated during his opening remarks.

“This shift is an enormous opportunity to deploy new technologies domestically and abroad to promote job growth here in the U.S. as the demand increases for nuclear technologies that reduce emissions and deliver industrial products” the West Virginia Democrat continued.

The committee’s top Republican Sen. John Barrasso also endorsed nuclear energy.

While some remain skeptical of nuclear power France may provide a powerful case study of what a transition to such an energy source could look like. The European nation aggressively developed its nuclear infrastructure in the 1970s and 1980s.

“Among all the advanced economies France has the lowest carbon emissions thanks to the nuclear power industry” International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol told the Financial Times in July.

France has emitted the least amount of carbon dioxide relative to gross domestic product compared to all G20 nations over the last decade according to World Bank data. The French also have the least emissions per capita relative to most competing world powers.

More than 40% of France’s energy came from nuclear in 2020 an IEA database showed. About 70% of its electricity comes from nuclear much of which is recycled nuclear fuel.

“There are a lot of good lessons to be learned from the French experience” Piercy told the DCNF noting that France made its decision to invest in nuclear for national security reasons.

“It’s about energy but it’s also about our security” he continued. “It’s about the resilience of our economy and I think that there’s a big opportunity there.”

France has become a net exporter of electricity because of its nuclear infrastructure according to the World Nuclear Association.

French President Emmanuel Macron recently doubled down on nuclear announcing additional funding for the sector as part of a $35 billion investment for renewable energy more broadly according to Fortune Magazine. France would put the funds toward developing new mini modular reactors which are less expensive than traditional nuclear plants.

“To produce energy especially electricity we are in luck” Macron remarked in a nationally televised speech in October Fortune reported. “The country’s nuclear power installation is already in place.”

Getting there

Flights from North America to Tel Aviv (TLV) consistently hover around $1000 round-trip in economy and over $3000 in business so award redemptions are the way to go when booking travel to Israel. Luckily thanks to new diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and recent route additions by the major U.S. airlines there are now plentiful routing options.

After years of not offering nonstop service to Israel American now offers flights to Tel Aviv from three U.S. gateways — New York-JFK Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Miami (MIA). You can book these flights through the AAdvantage program from 40000 American miles in economy 62500 in premium economy or 70000 in business. That said finding saver-level business-class award space on the nonstop routes is extremely difficult. You might have better luck with American's partners like British Airways through London (LHR) Iberia through Madrid (MAD) and Royal Jordanian through Amman (AMM). The redemption rates are the same but you'll typically face higher taxes and carrier surcharges with the partners.

If you need to earn more American miles consider picking up a cobranded American Airlines credit card. New cardholders of the Citi® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard® (see rates and fees) can earn a sign-up bonus of 50000 bonus miles after spending $2500 on purchases in the first three months of account opening. Alternatively opening the CitiBusiness® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® Mastercard® can snag you a bonus of 65000 bonus miles after you spend $4000 in purchases within the first four months of account opening.

United operates nonstop flights to Tel Aviv as well including from Newark (EWR) Chicago (ORD) San Francisco (SFO) and Washington Dulles (IAD). Even better most flights offer the ""true"" Polaris business class product. The MileagePlus program's redemption rates are dynamic but economy awards start at 42500 miles one-way and business at 75000 miles.

A potentially better option for booking United and other Star Alliance member airline awards would be through ANA Mileage Club a 1:1 transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards. Round-trip awards cost just 65000 miles in economy and 104000 miles in business. However there are two caveats: You can only book round-trip awards and ANA passes on fuel surcharges for partner awards. Otherwise consider booking through programs like Avianca LifeMiles or Aeroplan which also charge fairly reasonable rates and are partners of most transferable points programs.

If SkyTeam is your preferred alliance you can either fly Delta nonstop from New York (JFK) or fly with a partner like Air France or KLM and connect through a city like Paris (CDG) or Amsterdam (AMS). However since Delta SkyMiles and Air France/KLM Flying Blue don't have award charts redemptions can vary greatly depending on your travel dates and class of service. For instance it's not uncommon for Delta One awards to cost over 400000 Delta miles one-way though you can occasionally book them for half that.

Luckily Delta has relatively fixed prices for award flights operated by partner airlines. Partner awards will set you back a much more reasonable 37500 miles one-way in economy and 85000 miles in business class. Alternatively when prices for Delta-operated flights are sky-high you may be able to get a better deal through Virgin Atlantic's Flying Club program a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards.

Israel's flag carrier El Al operates the most nonstop flights from North America to Israel and offers a competitive business-class product on its Dreamliners. However there aren't many ways to book these flights with points and miles especially now that El Al is no longer a transfer partner of Amex Membership Rewards.

Your best option for booking El Al awards would be through Qantas Frequent Flyer. Redemption rates vary by distance but to give you an idea one-way awards from Newark (EWR) to Tel Aviv cost 37800 Qantas miles in economy or 90800 in business class while flights from Chicago cost 45000 Qantas points in economy or 104500 in business class. You can transfer points to Qantas from American Express Membership Rewards Capital One Miles or Citi ThankYou earned with cards like American Express® Gold Card and the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card.

Getting around

Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion International Airport (TLV) is located about 15 miles from the city center. Although you could use the app to request a metered taxi you won't find an Uber in Tel Aviv. That said the taxi drivers at the airport are under strict supervision and as long as you request one via the taxi booth outside the terminals you shouldn't get ripped off. You'll have the choice of either a private taxi or a ""sherut"" which is essentially a shared taxi service carrying up to 10 passengers. Another option is public transportation. The airport offers both bus and rail services but buses are a much more convenient (and cheaper) option since the trains stop at the edge of the city.

Once you've made it into the city the best way to explore Tel Aviv is on foot. That said the city offers high-frequency bus routes which can help get you to many different places quickly. There are also plenty of shared electric bike and scooter services available. Just keep in mind that no public transportation operates in Israel from mid-afternoon Friday until Saturday night in observance of Shabbat.

Where to stay

While the selection of points hotels — more specifically luxury points hotels — in Tel Aviv is lacking it's definitely on the rise and you shouldn't have trouble finding somewhere to stay.

The nicest option is easily the Jaffa Hotel part of Marriott's Luxury Collection brand. It's set within set within a restored 19th-century neo-Gothic complex. Aside from being a gorgeous hotel it's located in a fun and convenient neighborhood and has friendly staff. It's a Category 7 Marriott Bonvoy property meaning free nights will cost you 50000 60000 or 70000 points per night depending on the dates of your stay. But keep in mind you could score lower rates by leveraging Marriott's fifth-night-free benefit.

If you're looking to spend slightly fewer points Marriott also offers the Renaissance Tel Aviv and Sheraton Tel Aviv both of which cost 40000 to 60000 points per night. Or if you'd rather have a quieter beach experience consider staying at the Ritz-Carlton (50000 to 70000 points per night) or Publica Isrotel (30000 to 40000 points per night) in Herzliya a roughly 20-minute drive from Tel Aviv.

The other main luxury points hotel is the Norman Tel Aviv. It's World of Hyatt's only option in the city and costs a whopping 35000 to 45000 points per night. On the bright side the hotel is part of Small Luxury Hotels of the World (SLH) so all World of Hyatt members get extra perks like free breakfast early check-in late checkout and a room upgrade — including general members.

You can earn enough Hyatt points for at least one free night here by adding the World of Hyatt Credit Card to your wallet. It's currently offering a welcome bonus of up to 60000 bonus points: 30000 bonus points after you spend $3000 within your first three months from account opening plus up to 30000 more points by earning 2x bonus points total on purchases that normally earn 1x bonus point on up to $15000 in the first six months of account opening. Alternatively you can transfer points from Chase Ultimate Rewards to Hyatt at a 1:1 ratio.

If you're looking to be in the heart of the action there's the Hilton Tel Aviv. This property often costs around 80000 points per night and isn't that exciting. But its beachfront location is unbeatable and it has a massive pool. It also offers an executive lounge which you can access through the automatic elite status provided by several Hilton credit cards.

Other solid options include the InterContinental David Tel Aviv (50000+ IHG points per night) Crowne Plaza Tel Aviv Beach (34000+ IHG points per night) the Crowne Plaza Tel Aviv City Center (31000+ IHG points per night) and the Hotel Indigo Tel Aviv Diamond District (31000+ IHG points per night).

Activities

Soak up the culture

Jerusalem isn't the only Israeli city rich in culture and history — Tel Aviv is too. Specifically Tel Aviv offers an exuberant art scene that you can embrace sans admission fees. The city's streets feature vibrant graffiti and thought-provoking messages — with art that is generally inoffensive and doesn't involve politics. Although this feature has now spread throughout the city you'll find a high concentration of art in the Florentine section of south Tel Aviv.

Hit the beach

While Israel is best known for its historical sites it's also a fantastic beach destination. Tel Aviv offers 13 white sand beaches that sprawl out over nearly 10 miles of sand. The most popular stretches are Gordon Beach Frishman Beach and Hilton Beach which draws a predominantly gay crowd. You can comfortably swim in the Mediterranean and enjoy the sunshine from April through mid-November. If you want to fit in with the locals be sure to pick up a Matkot set (Israeli beach tennis). Chairs loungers and umbrellas are available for rent at most beaches for 6 NIS ($1.93) 12 NIS ($3.86) and 6 NIS ($1.93) respectively. The city sets the rates so you shouldn't pay more than that.

Eat your heart out

Tel Aviv is basically heaven for foodies. Delicious hummus shawarma and falafel are readily available (the best is in the Carmel Market) but the city offers much more than the standard Middle Eastern fare. Since Tel Aviv is largely a city of immigrants you can enjoy phenomenal international cuisine as well.

UNCF SPDP wants to help.

The knowledge and skill sets needed to be successful today poses a series of daunting challenges for employers as well as students.

• A college education once a “nice-to-have” component on a prospective employee’s resume is now a must-have—a prerequisite for almost every well-paying fast-growing job and career path.

• With America rapidly becoming a majority-minority population and workforce a pipeline of diverse and college-educated professionals will soon be in high demand.

• And as the competition tightens for these highly educated employees pressure will rise to choose the right employee the first time and to make hires who can hit the ground running—employees who come ready to perform and make an impact.

Meeting those three critical challenges is the mission of UNCF’s Student Professional Development Programs (SPDP) a collaboratively designed implemented and administered set of programs working with supportive corporate partners. The SPDP works to provide diverse students the preparation and support they need to succeed in college familiarize themselves with the professional path on which they will soon embark and prepare themselves to be competitive candidates for future employers after graduation. UNCF has deep experience and demonstrated success in each phase of the work involved in SPDP program design and implementation.

UNCF knows how to get students—especially high-potential diverse students from first-generation and low-income families—to and through college.

More than 460000 students have earned degrees from UNCF’s member historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

UNCF-member HBCUs have a higher average six-year graduation rate than non-HBCUs for comparable student bases.

African American recipients of UNCF scholarships have a 70 percent six-year graduation rate nearly double the graduation rate of all African American students (38 percent) and significantly higher than the rate for all students.

UNCF has worked closely with some of the nation’s leading firms and foundations to shape and execute internship programs including both stand-alone internship programs and internship-and-scholarship programs. UNCF SPDP partners include Anthem Carnival Cruise Lines Association of American Publishers Intel The Walt Disney Company Wells Fargo and the Walton Family Foundation.

UNCF has developed a menu of internship components from which partners can select—and can revise to suit their needs—in shaping their customized programs. Components include but are not limited to:

Student Recruitment/Identification

Interview Preparation

Career Coaching

Online Community/Career Curriculum

Mentorship Program

Comprehensive Evaluation

Scheffler pitched in from 55 feet for birdie on the 14th hole holed a 10-foot birdie on the next hole and avoided mistakes down the closing stretch Saturday at Memorial Park for a 1-under 69 and a one-shot lead going into the final round.

Scheffler in his third year on the PGA Tour has a 54-hole lead for the first time. He was tied for the lead going into the final round at The American Express in 2020 and finished third.

""I'm just going to go out there and try to get off to a good start and hopefully put myself out in front early and stay there"" Scheffler said.

Kevin Tway had the lead until he chipped in the water and had to scramble for bogey on the par-4 17th and then missed a 10-foot par putt on the closing hole. He shot 73 and was among five player who were one shot behind.

Scheffler was at 7-under 203.

Jhonattan Vegas winless since the Canadian Open four years ago had a 68 and will be in the final group with Scheffler on Sunday.

Matthew Wolff one of the steadiest performers in the fall portion of the PGA Tour schedule had a 69 and gets another shot at winning for the first time since he stepped away from golf for two months earlier this year to reset.

Kramer Hickok had a 70 and was in the group at 204 that included Martin Trainer the 36-hole leader who struggled to a 74.

The group two shots behind included Colonial winner Jason Kokrak who had to play 25 holes on Saturday because of a weather delay at the start of the week and he was all over the place.

Kokrak was at 8 under when he returned to play the 12th hole of the second round. He played his last seven holes in 7-over par and wound up nine shots out of the lead. He bounced back with seven birdies in his third round of 66 to right back in the hunt.

Wolff also was atop the leaderboard at 8 under until he took double bogey on the 17th hole when his second shot came up short and in the water. He took a penalty drop hit the same club to 7 feet and missed the bogey putt.

""I just misjudged the wind"" Wolff said. ""To this moment I really don't know what happened on that hole. It might have just been not as good of a lie as I thought.""

Either way he's right in the mix in what should be a compelling finish with a dozen players within three shots of Scheffler's lead.

That includes Trainer who took a double bogey on the front nine and then dropped consecutive shots on the back nine. But he finished with a 10-foot par that left him only one shot behind.

Not bad for someone playing the weekend for only the second time since April.

""I'm certainly hitting it better than I have in the recent past even today"" Trainer said. ""I think I have turned a corner and whatever happens this week happens. But I'm just excited about the future to be playing well again.""

Scheffler has been playing well ever since he left his four years' at Texas with a business degree first on the Korn Ferry Tour and then well enough to qualify for the Masters as a PGA Tour rookie. He also was picked for the Ryder Cup where he delivered one of the biggest birdie putts late in the fourth session and then took down Jon Rahm in singles.

He also has contended in majors. All he's lacking is a win and with so many players in contention it doesn't figure to be easy.

Scheffler had a chance to win last week contending for the lead until one errant tee shot led to double bogey on the back nine at Mayakoba.

""I feel like I'm playing solid golf right now"" Scheffler said. ""I'm hitting a decent amount of fairways a decent amount of greens starting to roll the ball pretty good. There's a few days where the putts may have not all gone in but I always seem to be hitting them right around the cup at the appropriate speed so they're bound to start falling eventually.""

Missy Parkin a 12-time member of Team USA  has visited the International Training and Research Center in Arlington Texas enough times to know the significance of the photos that line the walls of the facility's on-site meeting room.The 39-year-old right-hander has been through countless meetings meals orientations training sessions and team-building activities at the venue and she quickly realized the photographic timeline is more than just a nostalgic look at Team USA's storied tradition.Whether she has acknowledged it verbally written it down or tucked it safely somewhere in the back of her mind she wants her picture to be on that wall.The colorful collection is a shrine to all of those who have worn the red white and blue and found their way to the top of the podium in the coveted team event at the International Bowling Federation Super Masters or Youth World Championships.Parkin is one of eight Team USA members in Dubai this week looking to become the latest additions to the wall and she and her teammates are a step closer to that goal after the first day of team competition at the 2021 IBF Super World Championships All 20 women's teams and 30 men's teams bowled 10 Baker games Saturday at the Dubai International Bowling Centre to determine the 16 teams in each classification that will return to the lanes Monday for round-robin group match play.The team event is the final competition of the tournament and the conclusion of 10 days of bowling on a high-scoring 44-foot oil pattern.Singapore set the pace for the women's teams Saturday and topped the standings with a 2339 total a 233.9 average.Team members Shayna Ng and Cherie Tan claimed the gold and silver singles medals respectively Friday night and that momentum carried over to team qualifying. A 300 in their seventh game Saturday helped propel them to the top spot.Korea qualified second with 2294 and was followed by Germany (2256) defending champion Colombia (2252) and the Team USA women (2236). Norway took the final spot in match play with a 1877 total a 187.7 average.Parkin was joined on the lanes by Kelly Kulick Danielle McEwan and Jordan Richard.""This is the event we love and work so hard for and coming into today even though almost all the teams make the cut we still wanted to stay focused and continuing learning"" Parkin said. ""I think we learned a lot of information about the different parts of the bowling center and what we need to do moving forward. We worked very well as a team today and bowled well too and we feel great heading into the next round.""On the men's side Team USA out-averaged the field by more than eight pins and led qualifying with a 2449 total a 244.9 average.The men's roster for Team USA includes Andrew Anderson Jakob Butturff AJ Johnson and Kristopher Prather and the four started the day with games of 289 254 and 258 for an 801 series.Sweden used a run of 22 consecutive strikes to surge into the No. 2 spot with a 2366 total and was followed by Singapore (2349) Italy (2337) and Malaysia (2276).It took a score of 2103 to make the cut.Now that the initial cut has been made in the team event the teams will be divided into four four-team groups for three games of round-robin match play.Points will be awarded for each win and the top two teams in each group based on points will advance to the bracket-style quarterfinals scheduled for Monday morning (10 a.m. local time in Dubai).In the four-player Baker format the leadoff bowler bowls the first fifth ninth and 10th frames. The other team members bowl the second and sixth third and seventh and fourth and eighth frames respectively.For Parkin the 2021 Super World Championships marks her third opportunity to be enshrined at the ITRC.In 2013 she helped Team USA to a silver medal in the team event. They lost to Korea in a total-pinfall match. In 2019 it was bronze for Parkin after the team fell to eventual champion Colombia in the semifinals.""It means everything to be able to make it onto that podium to hear our national anthem and there's nothing like it"" Parkin said. ""And yes I want my picture on the wall in the ITRC. That's definitely something I've been working toward. I think that's an ultimate goal for all of us. We just need to be us and execute and hopefully everything will fall the right direction for us.""The last time the Team USA women won the team title was in nearby Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates in 2015. They failed to make the medal round in their title defense in 2017.That year in Las Vegas it was the men's chance to shine and they came away with the team gold. That team included Butturff and Johnson.The Team USA men entered this year's tournament looking for redemption after their own title defense in 2018 was shut down by Italy which won for the first time.After missing the medal round in singles this week the Team USA men have gained momentum too qualifying for the medal round in doubles and trios and making the first cut in mixed team.Those who advanced in mixed team will return to the lanes Sunday morning for match play and the quarterfinals.

THE STEPHEN SILLER FOUNDATION STORY

On Sept. 11 2001 Stephen Siller a husband and father of five was off-duty and on his way home from Squad 1 Park Slope Brooklyn to play golf with his three older brothers.

Stephen Siller

When he heard that the World Trade Center had been hit by a plane he headed toward the site. But the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel (now officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) was already closed. So he parked his truck and strapped 65 pounds of fire fighting equipment to his back and raced through the tunnel toward the Twin Towers to save lives.

Stephen who was age 34 never returned.

Stephen laid down his life to save others along with 342 other New York City firefighters 23 NYPD officers 37 PAPD officers EMTs court officers and fire marshals. The Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation was born out of that tragedy.

A touching poem titled “Have You Seen My Son” was read by Toni Scarito a retired NYPD detective that paid tribute to retired Battalion Chief Albert Petrocelli whose son Mark was lost on Sept. 11. Mark was a commodities broker and was to attend a meeting on the 92nd floor of the World Trade Center’s Tower 1 on the morning of Sept. 11. Scarito received the call from the elder Petrocelli when his son was missing. Mark was two days shy of his 29th birthday. And Albert Petrocelli lost his life to COVID-19 during the spring of last year.

A reading of the names of Staten Island’s fallen first responders from the FDNY and the NYPD who passed from post 9/11 causes was also incorporated into the evening’s program.

Jack Oehm an FDNY retired battalion chief spoke of the Siller Foundation Tunnel to Towers Foundation: “They are the family of all who were lost. And they are able to continue to do their work thanks to your support. This year alone in 2021 they have paid off more than 200 homes for Gold Star families and families of first responders. Their mission is to do good and to never forget.”

Living in the American South may have traditionally meant single-family homes but these days modern towers with New York City-inspired sensibilities could be the way to go. From Dallas to Atlanta with Nashville in the mix the southern region is seeing a growing number of sleek residential buildings that evoke big city sophistication.

These developments have a growing presence on the real estate scene down South because so many more people want “convenient living” today more than ever before according to Marianna Anvaripour a real estate agent with Harry Norman Realtors in Alpharetta Georgia. As she further explains that’s exactly what they offer. “You get fantastic amenities great service with a concierge at the ready and a cool design” Anvaripour says. “The perception in the region used to be that you were cash-strapped if you lived in an apartment but we’re talking about luxury today.”

Below are six swanky buildings that would fit in as much in New York as they do in their Southern locales.

AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2hhdHMtYXQtc3Rha2UtaW4tdGhlLWZpZ2h0LW92ZXItdGhlLWNoZXN0ZXItd2F0ZXItYXV0aG9yaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's at stake in the fight over the Chester Water Authority,"These days all eyes are on Chester’s state-appointed receiver tasked with rescuing the financially crumbling city from total collapse to see if he’ll sign off on the purchase.

The water authority has organized a growing grassroots campaign Save CWA to fight the private takeover until the very end. The group has handed out more than 7500 yard signs. Its petition demanding a ratepayer referendum before the sale of CWA had garnered roughly 7700 signatures as of Nov. 13.

“Privatization is almost never a good idea. It’s bad for the ratepayers and the community. CWA does not need or want to be sold” said Catherine Miller an organizer for Save CWA.

The group argues an Aqua takeover will have grave consequences saying that water bills will be higher that public access to the CWA-owned Octoraro Reservoir in Lancaster County — a free recreational hub — will be lost and that the more than 2000 acres of green space CWA owns in Delaware Chester and Lancaster counties could be sold to developers.

“Why are we abdicating control of a vital resource such as water to a private company that’s gonna make money off you?” Miller asked.

Franklin CEO of Aqua PA’s parent promises that the reservoir will remain intact.

“You’re hearing from me directly — the chairman of the company — that we will preserve that reservoir in perpetuity in its current form without developing any land around without fencing it in a way that would preclude people from using it and we would allow the continued recreation on the reservoir essentially status quo moving forward” Franklin said.

He also said that the CWA is employing scare tactics and that ratepayers have nothing to worry about.

“The truth of the situation is the mayor and City Council along with the company have worked to set up a structure where a lot of the proceeds would go into an account completely segregated single-purpose use of the funds and we will use it to offset rates. And that single use would then keep rates steady for at least a period of 10 years” Franklin said.

Miller doesn’t buy Franklin’s promises pointing to Aqua’s closure of the once-popular Springton Reservoir in Delaware County for security reasons. She also said rate freezes are a pipe dream.

CWA admits its rates will go up 5% in 2022. And the skepticism directed toward Aqua is not unfounded. ​​The company filed a rate case petition with the state Public Utility Commission in August seeking to increase water bills for all its customers by 17% and wastewater bills by 33%.

Aqua cited the recovery of $1.1 billion it has spent in “infrastructure repairs and improvements” throughout the state since its last rate increase in 2019 as the reason for the dramatic rate hike.

“The shareholders have no money at risk and their money is at risk if Aqua does a bad job in running the day-to-day operations. But with the PUC they’re allowing them to raise rates whenever they want to. They have really minimal risk and they don’t use their own money. Here’s the problem — the people who pay for these acquisitions are the ratepayers and they don’t have a seat at the table” Catania said.

The customer base is becoming increasingly upset. But Franklin thinks the Save CWA effort is artificial.

“This has been generated by massive legal fees and public relations fees of a very small group of people and it is agitating in communities surrounding it. And that’s what this is all about” Franklin said.

A fight that’s been brewing for years

In 2017 Aqua made an unsolicited $320 million offer to CWA to purchase it. The nine-member water authority board — consisting of three Chester City Council appointees three Delaware County Council appointees and three appointees named by the Chester County Commissioners — unanimously rejected the offer citing no benefit to ratepayers.

In a strategic move to block Aqua and help Chester with its financial woes CWA proposed a $60 million bailout of the city in exchange for placing the authority in a trust. As a corporate water customer of CWA Aqua sued in 2019.

In February 2020 in what water authority solicitor Catania described as a request for proposals the city of Chester received two bids for CWA from Aqua and Pennsylvania American Water Co. (Separately CWA had proposed a public-private partnership with the city and some restructuring.)

Since then the issue has been tied up in court. Through it all CWA has maintained that it is not owned by the city and that it is not in financial distress. Initially a trial court issued a favorable ruling for the water authority. But the most recent court action saw Commonwealth Court rule in a “very limited” majority decision that the city of Chester possessed “the general authority to obtain the assets of an authority that it created” thus clearing a path for the city to re-engage with Aqua.

In his dissent Commonwealth Court Judge Michael Wojcik wrote that he believed the sale to be a “foregone conclusion.”

“It is patently unconscionable to permit the city to pay off its own municipal debt by selling the authority’s assets that were paid for by its ratepayers the vast majority of whom reside in the counties and elsewhere. In fact the General Assembly granted the counties ‘seats at the table’ to prevent the city from looting the authority and using the sale of the authority’s assets as its own municipal piggy bank” Wojcik wrote.

Although CWA hopes to see the matter decided by the state Supreme Court it could very well be resolved by the Chester receiver.

A city in dire fiscal straits

Chester is in trouble. In an interview Mayor Thaddeus Kirkland said that accepting “the most appealing” offer — Aqua’s — was the best way out of it.

“We have to find a way of making sure that the citizens of Chester have an opportunity to stand on their own financially. This could possibly be that opportunity” Kirkland said.

He writes off public disapproval of his actions and those of the City Council as the result of a lack of factual information.

“There has been a lot of talk around the possibility of Aqua raising their rates … We would never ever leave our residents or anyone else in that manner exposed to such a rate increase” Kirkland said.

He acknowledged that the $12 million on the table a sort of signing bonus is enticing.

“And that $12 million basically is nonrefundable. Win or lose in court the city of Chester would be able to receive that $12 million” Kirkland said.

He told WHYY News that he is open to public meetings with Aqua ratepayers and even CWA so that everyone understands one another. But that’s contingent on the city not sinking in the near future.

The predominantly Black city has a population of about 30000 people. However it was once a hub for manufacturing with a population more than double what it is now.

Both Chester and the local Chester Upland School District have been in a long economic freefall. Since 1995 Chester has been under the state’s financial oversight. In 2020 the situation took a dramatic turn when Gov. Tom Wolf issued a “declaration of fiscal emergency” for Chester.

With that step Chester became just the second municipality in the state’s history (Harrisburg was the first) to be placed under receivership.

Receiver Michael Doweary arguably has one of the toughest jobs in the state. He said the situation is far worse than can be imagined: Chester is on “the brink of insolvency” and there is no playbook.

“Pensions in the city of Chester are the worst-funded plans in the entire commonwealth maybe the country. To have a police pension plan that is 3% funded that if nothing else is done the benefits the money in the reserves would run out in the next five months — that’s unheard of” Doweary said. “Desperate times call for desperate measures.”

Vijay Kapoor chief of staff to Doweary said past decisions have come back to haunt them.

“There were benefit changes over a decade ago that actually enhanced the police pension benefits that allows certain police officers to retire with a $100000-a-year pension. And under commonwealth law it’s very difficult for the receiver to be able to change those” Kapoor said.

It shouldn’t be lost on everybody that righting the ship for a city that has lost most of its population is a tall order Kapoor said.

Like Mayor Kirkland Doweary sees CWA as a golden ticket to recovery.

“To be financially viable Chester needs a big influx of money and the only asset that the city has that would even come close to generating that amount of money is the water system” he said.

But Doweary said he has not made up his mind nor does he have a timetable for a decision. Both Doweary and Kapoor said there is a possibility the water authority can remain in public hands.

“The receiver is absolutely open to keeping the system in public hands. The receiver had an independent analysis that was done on the water system about a year ago that valued the system and looked at the variety of bids… There was also the potential of… using a public-private partnership as a model of keeping it in public hands and the receiver is open to seeing whether or not that might prove useful” Kapoor said.

Doweary said the public should be patient.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWNvcmQtZWFnbGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9nZXR0aW5nLXRoZS1sZWFkLW91dC1wdWJsaWMtd2F0ZXItc3lzdGVtcy13b3JrLXRvLXJlcGxhY2UtbGVhZC1jb250YWluaW5nLXNlcnZpY2UtbGluZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9lY2Y4YThhOC00MjNlLTExZWMtOTI2YS1lMzFiMDE1Yzk0ZjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Getting the lead out: Public water systems work to replace lead-containing service lines,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

In a joint statement 15 members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade said recent media reports have raised concerns about continued abuses in the industry eight years after a U.S. Labor Department investigation found evidence of low wages child labor and substandard housing and medical care.

“These are desperately poor people and there is an industry that’s willing to exploit them” Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Or.) who chairs the subcommittee said in an interview last week. “It’s really appalling that this has not been addressed. … This has been a bipartisan failure.”

The lawmakers cited an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Washington Post that described how the family of the late former president of one of the Dominican Republic’s largest sugar companies turned to South Dakota in 2019 to finalize four new trusts. The trusts contained shares of the sugar company Central Romana and personal wealth worth $14 million.

The stories were published as part of the Pandora Papers an international investigation based on nearly 11.9 million financial records that documented how the wealthy and powerful secretly move money around the world.

Central Romana has for years been accused of exploiting laborers and forcibly evicting families from their homes. During a late-night raid in 2016 the company tore down makeshift shacks built by 60 impoverished families living without electricity or running water alongside Central Romana’s fields.

In a previous statement to ICIJ and The Post the company said it created more than 20000 jobs and built more than 5000 homes. The company said it works closely with a labor union to address wages and working conditions and denied that it illegally evicted the families arguing the company has defended its property from “illegal land invasion.”

Blumenauer and the other lawmakers also cited a September story by Mother Jones published with the Center for Investigative Reporting that described allegations of chronic debt low wages and dangerous working conditions among Central Romana workers.

In their joint statement lawmakers did not identify any company by name. Blumenauer said the committee will seek to work with Ambassador Katherine Tai the U.S. trade representative and a member of Biden’s cabinet who serves as the principal advisor and negotiator on U.S. trade policy. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.

Reached earlier this week Central Romana said some members of the House subcommittee “have always been against the U.S. sugar program” and that media reports about forced labor are “based on false accusations.”

Andrew Samet a spokesperson for the Dominican Sugar Industry said in an email that companies “welcome further engagement between the Biden Administration and the Dominican Government.”

The companies “have transparently and publicly reported on labor conditions in the sector for near a decade” Samet said adding that “allegations of trafficking forced and child labor against them are unfounded” and play no part in the “operations of the private companies in 2021.”

Advocates for Dominican families and sugar workers said an investigation is badly needed. “This is a clear message to the companies that they cannot abuse human rights and export their sugar to the United States in total impunity” said Laurence Blattmer program coordinator at the Geneva-based Dominicans for Justice and Peace which is working with the evicted families.

The push by Blumenauer’s committee is the third call for action in Congress in the weeks following the Pandora Papers.

Earlier this month the chairs of three Congressional committees cited the Pandora Papers investigation in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that called for the rapid implementation of legislation signed into law this year requiring limited liability companies to disclose their owners to a federal database.

“The value and urgency of these efforts are reinforced by the revelations of wrongdoing emerging from the latest leak of financial documents the Pandora Papers” said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY).

Last month a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed the most sweeping changes to anti-money laundering laws since 9/11 calling for stricter requirements on trust companies law firms art dealers and other so-called enablers that provide services to foreign clients.

Outside the United States members of the European Parliament citing the Pandora Papers approved a resolution critical of South Dakota Alaska Wyoming Delaware and Nevada for being “hubs of financial and corporate secrecy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZHVuZS1ib29rLWZyYW5rLWhlcmJlcnQtaW5zcGlyYXRpb24tZXhwZXJpbWVudC1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dune: The Real U.S. Experiment That Inspired Frank Herbert,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZHVuZS1ib29rLWZyYW5rLWhlcmJlcnQtaW5zcGlyYXRpb24tZXhwZXJpbWVudC1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Come see the Stars! As part of our ongoing coverage of the best brokers in the commercial insurance space Risk & Insurance® with the sponsorship of Philadelphia Insurance is expanding its coverage of the Rising Stars those brokers who represent the next wave of insurance brokering talent.

Look for these expanded profiles on the Risk & Insurance website and in your social media feeds now and continuing into 2022.

We sat down with Kathryn Christensen senior consultant risk finance and captive consulting for Aon and a 2021 Captive Power Broker winner and Rising Star.

R&I: What was your biggest win as a broker in the past year?

I think it comes down to finding solutions for clients. It’s sometimes very hard — no pun intended with the hard market — to find opportunities to create solutions for clients.

So I would say there’s been a couple of specific standout clients where we were able to restructure their programs incorporate captive insurance solutions and create quite material savings within their overall total spend. This solved problems and allowed clients to get back to focusing on their core businesses. And that’s been the biggest win for sure.

R&I: What do you think the most pressing issue for your clients will be for the remainder of 2021 and into 2022?

It definitely depends on the client and what industry they’re in. There’s certainly global trends that we’re seeing.

I think a lot of companies are still trying to get ahead of the hard market. You don’t want to be at the mercy of the way that the market is going. You want to try to get ahead of that and take control where possible.

Philosophically I see this as moving from the position of insurance buyer to risk seller. The foundation to this is understanding your risk exposures and proactively managing your programs strategically.

Cyber risk is also a very challenging area — as this risk continues to evolve with ransomware becoming a particular problem in recent quarters.

I work with a lot of clients who are looking for solutions for emerging risks. Risks where maybe the traditional insurance market isn’t as big of an option. So utilizing a captive insurance structure creatively to create solutions where maybe there isn’t one otherwise available is a big part of my job.

R&I: How did you get your start as an insurance broker? When did you realize this career path was for you?

So I had a rather circuitous path. I feel like it’s very binary. Some people knew right out of college — maybe even in college — and then some people kind of found their way to insurance.

I’m one of the latter. So within my family my mother is in the insurance industry as an actuary. I kind of wanted to go on my own path and so I really started on the research side of the hard sciences doing biomedical research. That transitioned into going into consulting and management consulting which evolved and transitioned into insurance consulting.

And so I found my way to insurance even though [that] hadn’t been my initial intention. As a side note my sister actually did the same thing. She always said she didn’t want to do insurance and she found her way into the industry. It’s kind of become a family business.

R&I: Who has been a mentor to you in your career? What advice did they give that stuck with you?

I have been enormously lucky in having a lot of really really amazing mentors.

There’s so many people that I will continue to look to as mentors. I think by far the most instrumental to me someone to whom I am eternally grateful is Ward Ching who is with Aon. He is just a rockstar at what he does and I love working with him because he is so good at what he does. You can learn just by watching him.

He is an amazing teacher and has always been willing to share his knowledge. He actually has been roped into being a university professor as well in his non spare time. He helped to found the risk management minor at the University of Southern California. And so he’s actually a professor there.

Ward has given amazing amazing advice from the really technical stuff to how to communicate with clients which is fundamental to everything we do.

A lot of my job is learning how to ask the right questions to really get a better understanding of a client’s needs and sometimes you end up identifying things that they didn’t even know they needed at the start of the conversation.

And then Ward has been absolutely amazing in terms of helping me to develop as a professional.

R&I: What advice would you give to a young woman looking to start a career in insurance?

I think that you should be thinking about skills that you’re developing and building and to also be honest with yourself about your weaknesses.

A lot of times that is a great way to identify areas for improvement and growth. I suggest thinking about your own development within the structure of your current role as well as where you want to be in the future so as you’re looking for opportunities to grow it’s both within that role and setting you up for the next role. &",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL3RvbS1oYW5rcy0zLWJlc3QtbW92aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Hanks Picks the Three Best Movies He's Ever Made,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL3RvbS1oYW5rcy0zLWJlc3QtbW92aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2pvYnMvc3RvcnkvaW5kaWFuLWZpcm1zLXR1cm4tdG8tZGVmZXJyZWQtYm9udXNlcy10by1yZXRhaW4tdG9wLXRhbGVudC1hcy1hdHRyaXRpb24tc3VyZ2VzLTMxMjEyNy0yMDIxLTExLTEz0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL2pvYnMvc3RvcnkvaW5kaWFuLWZpcm1zLXR1cm4tdG8tZGVmZXJyZWQtYm9udXNlcy10by1yZXRhaW4tdG9wLXRhbGVudC1hcy1hdHRyaXRpb24tc3VyZ2VzLTMxMjEyNy0yMDIxLTExLTEz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indian firms turn to deferred bonuses to retain top talent as attrition surges,"Indian companies are introducing deferred incentives into the salary structure of key senior talent across several industries to retain them for 2-3 years at least amid high attrition in a buzzing job market.



""We are seeing a fair amount of deferred incentives which include stock options Restricted Stock Units as well as deferred cash being offered to retain talent for 2-3 years"" said Roopank Chaudhary partner in Aon's human capital business.

Firms are finding it hard to have an employee stay on for more than a year given the market sentiment and resultant churn as overall attrition is at a decade-high of 20% he added. ""A sizeable lock-in can help retain people at the senior levels. That's where long-term incentives come into play"" Chaudhary stated.

""Companies are thinking about good retention policies. One way is through short-term policies like an annual retention bonus where 8-10 per cent is paid upfront to ensure the person is no longer an attrition risk. The second is through long-term incentives such as deferred incentives which could be as high as 20 per cent with say 8 per cent in the first year another 8 per cent in the next year and the rest in the third year"" said PS Viswanath MD &CEO Randstad India.

Umesh Ramakrishnan senior partner and co-CEO of global executive search firm Kingsley Gate Partners said forward-thinking CEOs and companies in India are proactively offering as high as 25% bump up in salaries on a retention basis as they expect a brain drain of executives when pent-up demand begins catching up at some point.

A deferred incentive programme is one type of long-term incentive (LTI) where the company pays someone on its payrolls a certain percentage of their salary as an incentive over 1-2-3 years. Many companies offer a bonus plus long-term incentives like stock plans.

Some companies just defer a part of the cash bonus over a few years to retain people. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOPs) and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPPs) are also long-term incentives.

""ESOPs are already prevalent in listed companies across industries but they are limited to the management or leadership team. So that's a small number. But ESPPs are being introduced across levels. Around 25-30 per cent of the MNCs operating in India have this option"" said Viswanath.

Chaudhary said the trend is visible across industries especially in technology firms financial institutions and professional services. Tech roles are the most impacted but other roles at senior levels also have a significant play in LTI.

Meanwhile the IPO frenzy among Indian startups has also fueled this trend the experts said. With record levels of PE/VC funding flowing into Indian startups and several of them turning into unicorns the new-age firms have been hiring aggressively to grow their ventures.

""A lot of talent is moving to startups. To stop that from happening you need to have a wealth creation opportunity being given to senior people…When companies ask us how to retain talent the answer is to have a longer-term hook not a one-year plan"" said Chaudhary.",,,,,,

The impact of Apple's privacy change in April is beginning to show up on the balance sheets of other companies and it shows the huge power Apple wields over industries unrelated to consumer electronics. In April Apple released an update for iPhones with a new popup that asked users if they wanted to allow apps on their phones to target the user for ads. IPhone owners could easily opt-out by tapping a button labeled ""Ask App Not to Track."" Over six months later it's clear most iPhone users did opt-out and the feature called App Tracking Transparency (ATT) is now presenting challenges to companies ranging from Snap to Facebook to Peloton. The privacy feature has upended the behind-the-scenes mechanics of many mobile ads especially those that confirm whether a purchase or download was made. Meta  Facebook's parent company warned last month that adoptions of the features had hit ""critical mass"" and made its ads less effective at targeting lucrative potential customers. Facebook said its revenue would have grown sequentially in the September quarter if not for the Apple ad changes. Instead it stayed flat. Snap's stock got hammered last month after it came in light on sales which the company blamed on Apple's privacy changes. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said that the privacy feature continued to pose risks to the company's fourth-quarter earnings and the company said that holiday-quarter sales would be around $1.18 billion — significantly lower than the $1.36 billion in sales Wall Street was expecting at the time. Peloton  which is an advertiser and doesn't sell ads said last month that Apple's privacy feature hurt user growth. Earlier this week during an interview Apple CEO Tim Cook declined to comment on the feature's impact on other companies but said ATT was released to give users the choice of what happens on their devices. ""What we've been all about is putting the power with the user. We're not making the decision we're just simply prompting them to be asked if they want to be tracked across apps or not. And of course many of them are deciding no"" Cook said. Cook said that if app developers have trust from users a larger percentage of them may allow device ID tracking. While the changes have been marketed as a win for users they're also benefitting Apple's advertising product Apple Search Ads which marketers are turning to for mobile ads that drive app installations. ""We've really seen a huge increase in Apple search ads market share"" said Shani Rosenfelder head of content for AppsFlyer an ad measurement firm. ""They've become the new number one player and they passed Facebook which dominated iOS in the past.""

62% of iPhone owners are opting out

It took a few months before advertisers started seeing the full effects of Apple's changes as iPhone owners update their software. The update divided iPhone users into two categories: Those who opt-in to device tracking for ads and those who don't. 86% of iOS devices are running a recent enough version of the software to be presented with ATT prompts according to an October report from AppsFlyer. Of the people who see the pop-up 38% are opting-in and 62% are opting-out. Users who opt-in have become even more valuable to advertisers who can use the data they get from them to fine-tune campaigns for the users who opted-out said Rosenfelder. ""We see that the cost of media is increasing especially for the users who have consented to tracking because they're really valuable"" Rosenfelder said. Several companies have signaled through their earnings that the ATT change is affecting them but they remain optimistic that they can build new attribution systems using Apple's replacement or their own first-party data and tune targeting with data they have like purchase history or similar demographics.

Facebook Snap and Peloton react

Meta the parent company of Facebook has been vocal about its opposition to the feature which at times has seemed targeted at the social networking company. For example Cook specifically mentioned Facebook in a tweet showing a picture of the privacy prompt. Facebook has reacted by constructing its own systems inside the apps it builds like the ability to buy products directly from Facebook which reduces the need for third-party tracking. ""As Apple changes make e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web solutions that allow big businesses to set up shop right inside our apps will become increasingly attractive and important to them"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel had previously praised Apple's approach in interviews and the company has updated its ad products to work with Apple's ATT replacement. But last month Snap officials said Apple's replacement for advertising measurement SKAdNetwork was unreliable. ""Over time we saw [SKAdNetwork] measurement results diverge meaningfully from the results we observed on other first and third-party measurement solutions making Scan unreliable at a stand-alone measurement solution"" Snap chief business officer Jeremi Gorman said. Snap is speeding up the development of its own first-party technology to help its customers the company said. Peloton is one example of a company that can no longer acquire customers in the same way it did before the change citing challenges related to Apple's privacy change. But Peloton also said that it believes it can adapt and that its app business will remain an important way to acquire customers. ""Like many other direct-to-consumer marketers we're seeing some disruptive impact as our teams adjust to the new data landscape"" Peloton's CFO Jill Woodworth said earlier this month.

How Apple benefits

ATT has attracted attention to Apple's advertising business which focuses specifically on mobile ads for apps. Apple's most notable ad product is Apple Search Ads. It allows developers to buy keywords on the Apple App Store to appear at the top of searches. Apple doesn't break out search ads in its financial results but it is a small part of its services business which reported $68.43 billion in revenue in the company's fiscal 2021 an increase of 27%. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated in a note to clients last week that Apple's search advertising generates $4 billion annually and has 60% of the app search ad market share on iPhones. Search ads are only a fraction of the entire mobile ad market the Bernstein analyst wrote. He estimates that the mobile ad market as a whole is worth $300 billion per year and 20% of those ads are for mobile apps or about $60 billion with iOS accounting for half of that pie. Last quarter Apple reported over $83 billion in total sales so even if Apple massively expanded its advertising business it still wouldn't be a major revenue source for the iPhone maker. Apple's products may be more competitive because they can access targeting data that other ad companies can't. Apple's ATT focuses on limiting data transfer between third parties which doesn't apply to Apple's first-party advertising. ""I think our targeting can suffer compared to others like Apple who have the direct data themselves"" Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said in October. ""We see several opportunities for Apple"" Sacconaghi wrote. ""The company will directly benefit from any shift of app advertising dollars from display to search as advertisers seek out better targeting metrics.""

Challenges may just be temporary

For some companies that make money through selling ads like Facebook or Snap ATT has made it more difficult to ""attribute"" a purchase to a specific ad or campaign which allows those companies to charge more and gives advertisers confidence their budgets aren't being wasted. Other companies like Peloton use mobile ads to find new customers especially for their apps or services in a process often called user acquisition. Without confidence that these companies or their ad partners can attribute specific installs some are finding that advertising to increase their user base on iPhones is becoming more difficult and less predictable. Many companies and advertisers affected by Apple's privacy change are confident that the challenges will only be temporary. But ad professionals want Apple to improve its replacement for device identifiers called SKAdNetwork which Apple says does attribution in a more private way. But it also lacks some of the capabilities of the old device ID-based system. ""SKadNetwork is like the system if you brought an alien down from space and you're told that we have this thing called marketing attribution but it's evil and we need to replace it can you design something else without knowing anything about the domain space?"" said Alex Bauer the head of marketing at Branch an app measurement firm. While each advertiser may pay attention to different parameters to measure advertising effectiveness SKAdNetwork ""requires them to use Apple's fixed definitions of advertisers success"" Gorman the Snap CFO said. ""For example advertisers are no longer able to understand the impact of their unique campaigns based on things like time between viewing an ad and taking an action or the time spent viewing an ad."" Apple's change is only the first step towards a new more private era of mobile advertising which relies less on data on individual users and instead uses advanced statistics to infer the success of ad campaigns ad professionals say. ""Maybe now we're going back into the world where advertising is less of a science and now it has to be more of an art"" Bauer said.

Crescent Real Estate LLC a commercial property investor and development firm that owns much of Flatiron Park is putting its assets in the east Boulder campus on the market.

The company is attempting to sell just over 1 million square feet of space spread across 21 buildings according to a marketing brochure from brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (NYSE: JLL).

A major selling point referenced repeatedly in marketing materials which do not include an asking price is the presence of an “undisclosed tech tenant.” There’s evidence that the mystery tenant is Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL).

Apple has long been rumored to covet space in Flatiron Park and evidence suggests that the Cupertino Calif. company could be this mystery tenant which JLL’s brochure shows as occupying nearly 240000 square feet in 2300 2400 5777 and 5718 Central Ave.

“Apple is growing its engineering team in Boulder and expects to have close to 700 employees at its offices in the region by 2026” a company spokesperson told BizWest on Thursday.

Apple did not reply to specific questions about its presence in Flatiron Park.

Representatives of Dean Callan & Co. the company in charge of leasing at Flatiron Park declined to comment as did JLL. Crescent did not respond to requests for comment.

Here’s what BizWest knows about the link between Apple and Flatiron Park:

Apple signage including the image of the company’s iconic logo is visible from outside the office space at 5718 Central Ave.

According to publicly available records from Boulder’s Planning and Development Services Department Apple pulled a series of fire permits for the 5718 Central Ave. address over the past year and a half.

The JLL brochure describes the undisclosed tenant as having an AA+ credit rating. Standards & Poor’s reaffirmed Apple’s AA+ rating in 2017.

Marketing materials say that the tenant has a market cap of $2.54 trillion. Apple’s market cap which fluctuates with the stock market was about $2.43 trillion on Thursday — close to the figure cited in the JLL brochure. The only other company in that stratosphere is Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT).

The brochure refers to Boulder as one the tenant’s “targeted growth markets.” This is certainly the case for Apple which went public in April with its plan to expand its Boulder workforce to 700 as part of a nationwide investment of $430 billion in U.S. projects and addition of 20000 new jobs nationwide over the next five years.

JLL’s marketing materials use a quote from Apple’s vice president of worldwide real estate and facilities Kristina Raspe published in April by BizWest. Raspe’s job title is the only direct reference to Apple in the brochure.

Attorney Morgan Bottner whose LinkedIn profile identifies him as a “Principal Counsel & Senior Manager at Apple” used the 5718 Central Ave. address to register with the Colorado Supreme Court Office of Attorney Regulation Counsel. That registry also lists Apple as the firm for which he works.

According to the JLL brochure Crescent is “redeveloping a mission-critical facility at 2300 & 2400 Central Avenue” for the mystery tenant. The building at 2300 Central is indeed being redeveloped and Crescent is also redeveloping a 14-acre parcel at 2400 and 2450 Central Ave. into a combined structure at 2400 Central Ave. that totals about 144500 square feet.

Apple has a habit of imbuing its Boulder County operations with an air of mystery.

In 2018 the tech giant quietly absorbed Longmont-based Akonia Holographics a startup that produces lenses for AR glasses.

Few details were available in August 2018 when Reuters first reported the Akonia acquisition. Terms of the deal were not disclosed and company representatives including CEO and co-founder Ken Anderson did not grant interviews.

Likewise Apple wasn’t particularly forthcoming about the deal providing Reuters a statement that read: “Apple buys smaller companies from time to time and we generally don’t discuss our purpose or plans.”

In the time since the acquisition Akonia has gone silent.

A source speculated after the acquisition that Akonia is working to help develop augmented-reality glasses.

If the mystery Flatiron Park tenant is Apple — which is confirmed to have about 40000 square feet of office space at 5360 Sterling Drive — it is by no means the only big tech company with a growing presence in Boulder.

Amazon set up shop downtown at 1900 15th St. in 2018. Those offices were leased to house advertising-focused engineers.

About a year ago Google expanded its Boulder operation with additional offices and employees at its 3333 Walnut St. facility leasing the entirety of the nearly 160000-square-foot facility.

The company followed that expansion up with the purchase of The Reve a new mixed-use development in central Boulder. Google’s footprint at The Reve totals about 125000 square feet.

The company also has completed the third building at its 300000-square-foot main campus at 2930 Pearl St. That campus was designed to house 1500 employees.

Social network Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) inked a new lease last November for 65000 square feet in the S’Park neighborhood in central Boulder.

That added to Twitter’s 30000-square-foot lease in the Wencel Building south of the Pearl Street Mall where it houses an app development team.

Posted on 11/14/2021

In June 2021 Apple Inc. disclosed they would soon store state-issued identification cards in the iPhone’s Wallet app. Apple is trying to get its tentacles in a global ID infrastructure giving it more power control and financial profitability over consumers in the U.S. and globally. Apple would likely combine its biometric security measures like Face ID with state-issued digital IDs. Apple’s market power lies in its ability to build and construct its own ecosystem. One great example of this is Apple’s App Store.

State governments see an opportunity in turning smartphones like Apple’s iPhone into tracking digital passports. Apple Inc. is negotiating with states such as Connecticut Iowa Maryland Utah Georgia Arizona Kentucky and Oklahoma on having those state governments foot the bill and provide customer support if Apple were to turn iPhones into digital identification cards. Apple would mandate the state governments to maintain systems issue and service various credentials and hire personnel to deal with inquiries from Apple. Apple also gets power to review and preview the marketing of how state government’s will be selling the digital IDs. Essentially Apple wants the state governments to fund and be liable for the financial burden while profiting from existing tech.

Apple is seemingly the mystery ""tech tenant"" listed in a brochure for a portfolio of properties in the Boulder Colorado region according to a new report.

Commercial property firm Crescent Real Estate LLC recently put it assets in the east Boulder campus on the market. According to the Boulder Daily Camera the company is attempting to sell about 1 million square feet of space across 21 buildings.

In marketing materials for the office space the sellers tout a ""undisclosed tech tenant"" that leases property in Flatiron Park. The Daily Camera suggests that there's plenty of evidence Apple is the tenant and occupies nearly 240000 square feet in the business park.

On Thursday Apple told BizWest that it is growing its Boulder-based engineering team and plans to have nearly 700 employees at local offices by 2026.

According to BizWest some of the evidence that Apple is the tenant includes Apple signage at an office space at 5718 Central Ave and the fact that the tenant has a marketing capitalization of $2.54 trillion which is close to Apple's valuation. The only other company to have that type of market valuation is Microsoft.

Additionally Apple has pulled a series of fire permits for the 5718 Central Ave location and the listing indicates that the undisclosed tenant has a AA+ credit rating. Apple's credit rating was reaffirmed as AA+ in 2017. Microsoft's credit rating by comparison is AAA and Aaa.

The marketing materials also use a direct quote from Apple vice president of worldwide real estate and facilities Kristina Raspe. Raspe's job title is the only direct reference to Apple in the brochure."

There is a surge of interest in AR (Augmented Reality)/VR (Virtual Realty) market due to the recent focus on the Metaverse by industry leaders such as Meta (the new name for Facebook) Microsoft and others.

Metaverse incorporates AR/VR holographic avatar video and other means of communications. Some see AR/VR as the next generation communication platform. To make it a reality there is a need for many technological developments and multiple challenges need to be resolved. Emerging display technologies are an integral part of AR/VR market development.

Battle of Display Technologies for the AR/VR market

According to Guillaume Chansin Director of Display Research at DSCC Meta (Facebook) is betting on AR/VR with a $10 billion investment in 2021. Its Oculus Quest 2 is the fastest selling headset and the company is planning a ‘project Cambria’ (high-end VR headset with pancake optics in 2022) and ‘project Nazare’ (thin and light see-through AR glasses). Apple is expected to launch a high-end VR headset in 2022 (with dual smicroOLED CMOS Si+ one other OLED displays and Sony will be bringing in its second Gen VR headset for PlayStation 5. Companies such as Magic Leap Snap ByteDance (Tiktok) Nreal and others are all investing in AR/VR this year.

Technology developments product introductions and higher investment will drive AR/VR growth in the next few years. DSCC’s forecast shows that revenue for AR/VR displays will grow at a CAGR of 51.6% from $0.3 billion in 2020 to $4.2 billion in 2026. VR (including pass-through AR) will be a much bigger market segment for display suppliers generating 4.2x more revenue than see-through AR by 2026.

According to the presentation the display requirements are different for VR (and pass-through AR) and see-through AR.

For VR (and pass-through AR) most displays are based on TFT LCD and AMOLED. VR needs high pixel density to reduce or eliminate the screen door effect as optical lenses magnify the image. Also it requires high refresh rates and a short duty cycle to reduce motion sickness. There is a need for smaller lighter headsets.

For see-through AR all headsets are currently based on microdisplays (DLP Micro-LCD LCoS Micro OLED) or laser beam scanner (LBS). They need very high brightness displays to match the ambient light; display needs to be small and power efficient to make headsets thinner and light-weight. DSCC forecasts that OLED on Silicon will capture the largest share of shipments from 2025 for AR/VR display market with LCD in second place. AMOLED will lose share due to limitations of pixel density. MicroLED with higher potential brightness will have an advantage for see-through AR but will be less important for VR.

LCD: Strong presence through high pixel density global blinking and MiniLED

According to a JDI presentation LCD is leading the VR market with technology advancements such as high PPI.

The company announced its latest high PPI LCD for VR at the forum. It’s a 2.88-inch 1201PPI LTPS TFT-LCD (120Hz refresh rates global blinking backlight). JDI used advanced LTPS (LTPS+Oxide backplane) to produce the display and it contributed to a higher aperture ratio (30% higher than before) which is essential for VR. The use of local dimming technology achieved higher contrast and lower power consumption.

An impulse display is also realized by applying a global blinking backlight and by shortening the display “on” time and minimizing “ghosting” to provide a clearer image. The company uses SLC-IPS technology for fast response LC (3msec B/W). By combining the backlight blinking (impulse display) and fast response LC it can achieve ‘no blur’ and ‘no ghost image’. According to the presentation by JDI LCD is the best technology for 2-3-inch size displays for VR-HMD as it provides a wide field of view (HFV) which is a critical factor for an immersive VR-HMD. For future VR LCDs JDI is planning a 4Kx4K 2.x-inch display with 1700-2000PPI 1000 cd/m² contrast ratio of >100000 color gamut of >DCI-P3 95% with local dimming. JDI has also developed a prototype HMD using a laser backlit LCD of 2.89-inch diagonal with 1058 PPI. The lasers proved for a wider color gamut of BT 2020 (97%).

Companies are also starting to use miniLEDs backlight for LCD for higher contrast and lower power consumption. A DSCC presentation showed two products – the Varjo Aero($1900) with two miniLED LCDs (Varjo Gets Aero) and the Pimax Reality (12K QLED) ($2399) with two miniLED LCD panels (200Hz refresh rates and QD layer for high color gamut 6K per eye resolution with 1200PPI) (Pimax’s New Headset Boasts ’12K’ & MiniLED – WBS subscription required).

Lynx announced a $500 headset with full color pass-through AR which is versatile and covers mixed reality. In its presentation Stan Larroque CEO of Lynx said their product is using JDI’s LCD display due to low BOM costs and high refresh rates. They are considering other displays for future products also.

Micro OLED: Poised for dominance with very high resolution & high luminance

OLED micro-displays (microOLED) are viewed through an optical system and generally have higher pixel densities than AMOLEDs. OLED on silicon is the most common technology used to implement microOLED. It can be used both for VR and see-through AR.

MicroOLED displays can be generally categorized into RGB OLED and White OLED (WOLED) classes. However high resolution RGB OLED microdisplays still face challenges due to a shadow effect during the deposition process using a FMM (Fine Metal Mask). White OLED uses a color filter to generate the image and can achieve high PPI (4000PPI). However the color filter absorbs a very high percentage of the emitted light that limits maximum brightness for microOLED.

Sony has been using a microLens to increases peak brightness of its OLED micro-display. Kopin has developed a trio stack architecture to increase brightness. According to the presentation of Andrew Sculley CEO of eMagin there are four major challenges for the AR/VR market: Displays Optics Content and Price.

Display: high resolution high brightness high contrast low power no screen door effect high fill factor

Optics: large FOV (Field of View) no distortion high efficiency light weight small form factor

Content: games movies live events etc and graphics processing speed

Price: has to be right

The human eye’s resolution capability is 60 Pixels/degree (PPD). eMagin’s OLED microdisplay demo has 40PPD compared to the Oculus Quest 2’s PPD of 20. For microOLED its higher PPD high luminance (to eliminate motion artifacts) high resolution (to eliminates screen door effects) high fill factor higher efficiency and longer life time capabilities result in increased demand for the VR applicatrion.

See-through AR also requires very high brightness very high resolutions and very high contrast. These requirements make OLED microdisplays more applicable for both AR and VR. eMagin has achieved 10000 nits brightness in a 1920 X 1200 4K OLED microdisplay made by direct patterning (eliminating the color filter) of red green and blue (RGB) sub-pixel emitters on the backplane. The red and green emitters were made from phosphorescent materials and the blue from fluorescent material. This has enabled a significant improvement in efficiency and lifetime. eMagin has a roadmap to develop 30000 nits full color peak luminance.

Chinese Developments

A DSCC presentation by Chase Li about microOLED capacity development in China showed that nine companies have plans for constructions including BOE Lakeside SeeYa Sidtek Jicui. Most of them will adopt a white OLED+ colour filter approach. By 2025 81% of the capacity will be from OLED microdisplays made in 12-inch (300mm) fabs. BOE is expected to ramp up production in next two to three years. According to DSCC’s Chansin BOE’s 0.71inch displays are in a Qualcomm reference design for Smart Viewer glasses. SeeYa’s 1.03-inch display is being used in the Arpara VR headset in 2021. LG display from Korea has demonstrated a 0.42″ micro OLED display (3500PPI) at SID Display Week 2021.

MicroLED: Emerging presence with ultra high brightness high reliability and small form factor

MicroLED’s very high brightness high reliability (inorganic LED display) and ability to create ultra compact form factors will have major advantages for the see-through AR market. As presented by DSCC many companies including Vuzix Snap Xiomi TCL and Meta are introducing microLED display based AR/VR headsets. Vuzix’s next gen smart glass uses Jade Bird Display’s (JBD) microLED. Waveoptics (Snap) announced a developmental kit and projector using a JBD display and Kopin has announced collaboration with JBD to develop monochrome microLED displays. Xiaomi and TCL both introduced microLED-based smartglass prototypes in 2021.

Applied Material’s presentation by Nag Patibandla showed that they have demonstrated microLED direct view display using single wavelength UV-A microLED and CD free Quantum Dot technology in an innovative pixel architecture (reducing and simplifying mass transfer and repair). They have achieved higher efficiency higher resolution (high EQE uvMicroLED + Quantum Dot technology) (inkjet printing + self aligned curing) and higher yield (one time mass transfer). The company has demoed two displays: one with microLED 433PPI 1000nits the second one with microLED 318PPI 10000 nits. The company’s near-eye AR displays road map show of 1588 PPI and 3396PPI with uvMicroLED. (Applied Materials Overcomes Some Challenges in MicroLED for VR)

A presentation from JBD’s Leon Baruah showed that JBD is focusing on commercialization of microLED-based microdisplays. It is boosting its current pilot fab capacity in Shanghai and will start its Hefei fab in 2022 (operation will start in Q1 2023). JBD microLED microdisplays have achieved high brightness (up to 4.5million nits) power efficiency (6mW for 10K nits) small form factor (pixel pitch from 2.5micron to 5micron) and more than 100000:1 contrast deep black and 125Hz refresh rate. The company has introduced a very small (0.35cc in volume) monochrome microLED projector and a polychrome projector (1.35cc in volume).

A Mojo Vision presentation from Naamah Argaman showed that they have created a smart contact lens with built-in microLED (nanoLED) display (with1.8 micron pixel pitch monochrome green 14000 PPI) that gives information to users without interrupting their focus. They are building prototypes. They are also working on Quantum Dot color conversion from blue to get brighter pixels. MicroLED displays have great potential in AR/VR due to their high brightness and high contrast. (Mojo Vision Developing NanoLEDs)

Companies such as CEA-Leti MICLEDI and Coherent LaserSystems participated and presented in the AR/VR forum’s microLED manufacturing session.

Technology developments product introductions and higher investments will drive AR/VR growth in the next few years. Display technology developments will be an the integral part of AR/VR market growth. (SD)

Durante la reciente visita de la titular de la SIDE Angélica Granados Trespalacios a esta frontera personal de la secretaría sostuvo un encuentro con directivos a nivel Latinoamérica de estas compañías para conocer no sólo las necesidades de la empresa sino también para afrontar los cambios tecnológicos dentro de la industria automotriz.

Como parte de la reunión se hizo un recorrido por el Mexico Technical Center (MTC) donde se diseñan y prueban productos con nuevas tecnologías de acuerdo con las necesidades de los clientes de Aptiv.

Además se programó un recorrido por el Centro Técnico de BorgWarner para conocer los procesos de diseño así como las pruebas que se realizan en los prototipos y productos usados en los procesos de manufactura de la compañía en todas sus plantas.

“Como Gobierno del estado buscamos alternativas para trabajar en conjunto con Aptiv así como con otras empresas del sector en la capacitación y entrenamiento de la fuerza laboral actual y futura en estas nuevas capacidades” dijo Leonel Enrique Chavira Acosta director de Industria de la SIDE.

El pasado martes la titular de la SIDE estuvo en la frontera para participar en el grupo de trabajo ampliado del Consejo de Desarrollo Económico Regional Juárez A.C. (CODER).

Durante su intervención Granados Trespalacios aseguró que se hará las gestiones necesarias para que prosperen los proyectos prioritarios para el desarrollo económico de esta región.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

FRANCK FIFE / AFP

A eux les stades ventilés et la vue sur le golfe Persique. L’équipe de France s’envolera bien vers le Qatar en 2022 (du 21 novembre au 18 décembre) pour y disputer sa septième Coupe du monde d’affilée. Grâce à leur très large victoire (8-0) contre le Kazakhstan ce samedi 13 novembre les Bleus ont réglé la dernière formalité sur le chemin de Doha dans un groupe D de qualifications pas vraiment des plus relevés.

Parce qu’il y a peu à dire avant une rencontre face à la 125e nation FIFA certains avaient agité – influencés par le retour au Parc des Princes – le fantôme de l’automne 1993 avec les défaites contre Israël et la Bulgarie le tout sur fond de L’Amérique de Joe Dassin que la génération Papin ne verra pas à l’été 1994 pour sa « World Cup ».

A défaut de remonter les Champs-Elysées pour fêter la qualification les coéquipiers de Kylian Mbappé ont offert un long tour d’honneur à leur public dans un Parc à guichets fermés (45 551 spectateurs). Dans son jardin l’attaquant du Paris-Saint-Germain a marché sur les traces de Just Fontaine dernier tricolore auteur d’un quadruplé en 1958 contre l’Allemagne de l’Ouest (6-3). En l’espace de douze minutes Mbappé a torpillé la défense kazakhe bien servi par les deux pistons Theo Hernandez et Kingsley Coman.

Les digues sont ouvertes et ne vont jamais se refermer. Le Parisien offre même un spectacle rare chez lui : un but de la tête (32e). De quoi faire taire les sarcasmes de son sélectionneur. « Hier [vendredi] j’ai marqué de la tête à l’entraînement avec mon cache-cou et Didier Deschamps criait à la chance s’amusait l’attaquant au micro de M6. J’ai progressé aussi dans ce domaine et je vais continuer à travailler pour en marquer d’autres. »

Le gardien kazakh a déjà un début de lumbago à force de se pencher pour ramasser le ballon au fond de ses filets. En second période Karim Benzema se charge de tourmenter le malheureux Pokalitov sur deux offrandes de Theo Hernandez encore lui et d’un Mbappé altruiste (50e et 59e). « On savait que l’adversaire était plus faible que nous mais il fallait mettre la manière et c’est ce qu’on a fait résumait le Madrilène interrogé par M6. On a produit du beau jeu et je pense que les supporteurs ont apprécié. »

Coman en piston pas un « one shot » pour Deschamps

Entamée par une minute de silence émouvante aux victimes des attentats du 13-Novembre et une Marseillaise chantée a cappella la soirée s’est poursuivie avec plus de légèreté.

Libérés et inspirés les Bleus découvrent les possibilités offensives du 3-4-3. Pendant à droite du petit frère de Lucas Hernandez Kingsley Coman a régalé dans ce poste inédit pour lui. Certes sa charge défensive était négligeable face à un adversaire pas éligible à voir la surface de réparation de l’équipe de France mais le joueur du Bayern Munich prouve qu’une droite plus audacieuse est possible avec ses dribbles ses feintes et sa vitesse.

Simple coup d’audace d’un soir ? « Vous me connaissez je fais jamais de “one shot” a expliqué le sélectionneur en conférence de presse. A mon sens ce n’était pas une option risquée car je savais que l’on allait avoir le ballon. Cela demande des aménagements face à des adversaires plus forts. »

Parce que c’est le genre de soirée favorable aux premières Adrien Rabiot place une reprise de la tête imparable pour le but du 6-0 et débloque son compteur en sélection (75e). Les Kazakhs ont déjà la tête et les valises à Astana Antoine Griezmann transforme un penalty (84e) avant que Mbappé égale Just Fontaine (87e). « Je veux saluer aussi son état d’esprit. Kylian aurait pu mettre un quintuplé mais il a laissé Antoine marquer le penalty » a souligné Didier Deschamps. L’occasion était belle d’égaler Thadée Cisowski auteur d’un quintuplé en 1956 contre la Belgique.

Avant un voyage de villégiature mardi à Helsinki face à la Finlande les Bleus terminent une saison contrastée entre l’échec de l’Euro en juin le sursaut d’octobre avec la victoire en Ligue des nations confirmée ce samedi soir. Ces derniers mois Didier Deschamps a beaucoup essayé et tâtonné pour trouver le cadre tactique propice à la cohabitation de son trio Benzema-Mbappé-Griezmann.

Mal né contre la Suisse à l’Euro le 3-1-4-3 donne envie d’être revu en 2022. Et pourquoi pas à l’automne prochain au Qatar.

La Presse Canadienne

Après avoir battu Sakkari l’Espagnole de 23 ans a attendu quelques heures avant d’obtenir la confirmation qu’elle terminerait au sommet de son groupe.

La Biélorusse Aryna Sabalenka a défait la Polonaise Iga Swiatek en trois manches de 2-6 6-2 7-5 assurant le premier rang et une place en demi-finale à Badosa.

« C’était un match difficile. J’ai bien servi et je me suis battue sur chaque point. Je savais que ce serait une bataille contre Maria a dit Badosa à propos de son match. Je pense que je suis restée agressive et que j’ai bien bougé. Quand tu gagnes ce genre de match tu dois tout faire de la bonne façon. »

Les Finales de la WTA qui ont été annulées l’an dernier en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19 se jouent sous forme de tournoi à la ronde et les deux meilleures joueuses de chaque groupe accèdent aux demi-finales.

L’Estonienne Anett Kontaveit s’est déjà assuré une place en demi-finale.

Les demi-finales auront lieu mardi et la finale est prévue mercredi au Centre panaméricain de tennis de Zapopan en banlieue de Guadalajara la deuxième plus grosse ville du Mexique.

Badosa classée 63e au monde il y a un an a éclos cette saison. Elle a signé ses deux premiers titres en carrière à Belgrade et à Indian Wells et elle fait partie des six joueuses à être entrées dans le top-10 pour une première fois cette saison.

« En toute honnêteté je suis plutôt nouvelle sur le circuit. Je crois que j’ai signé ma première victoire contre une joueuse du top 10 il y a peut-être quatre mois. J’avais besoin d’expérience a insisté l’Espagnole. Quand j’ai eu cette expérience les choses se sont bien déroulées. J’ai eu besoin d’un peu de temps pour m’ajuster et pour apprendre. »

Swiatek Sakkari Kontaveit et Barbora Krejcikova qui participent aux Finales de la WTA sont les autres joueuses ainsi que la Tunisienne Ons Jabeur qui a tout juste raté sa qualification pour le tournoi.

« Je crois que c’était un match très relevé de notre part. Même si j’ai perdu ça me donne beaucoup de confiance pour mon dernier affrontement du tournoi à la ronde a déclaré Sakkari. Je sais que je vais me donner une meilleure chance de passer au prochain tour en gagnant. Je vais me concentrer là-dessus. »

Sakkari se mesurera à Sabalenka lundi pour l’obtention de la dernière place donnant accès aux demi-finales.

Sabalenka qui a triomphé cette saison à Abou Dabi et à Madrid est la première tête de série du tournoi en raison du retrait de l’Australienne Ashleigh Barty qui a choisi de ne pas défendre son titre en raison des restrictions liées à la COVID-19.

Yet the students and other demonstrators disrupting college campuses this spring are being taught the wrong lesson — for as admirable as it can be to stand up for your beliefs there are no guarantees that doing so will be without consequence.

The highest calling of a university is to craft a culture of open inquiry one where both free speech and academic freedom are held as ideals. Protest is part of that culture and the issue around which so many of the current demonstrations are centered — U.S. involvement in the Israel-Hamas conflict — ought to be fiercely and regularly debated on college campuses.

The Constitutional right to free speech is the protection against government interference restricting speech. Therefore leaders at public universities which are funded by government have a heightened duty to respect those boundaries. Private institutions don’t have the same legal obligations but that doesn’t relieve them of the responsibility to encourage open dialogue whenever and wherever possible on their campuses. It’s essential to the pursuit of learning.

In the real world though this can get messy and nuance is required when free speech comes into tension with protecting academic freedom. The earliest universities to adopt the principle of academic freedom did so to thwart interference and influence from totalitarian states and religious zealotry. Today the American Association of University Professors defines it as “the freedom of a teacher or researcher in higher education to investigate and discuss the issues in his or her academic field and to teach or publish findings without interference from political figures boards of trustees donors or other entities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC9tYXkvMTEvc2VjcmV0LWxpc3QtYWJ1c2Vycy1jYW5uZXMtZmlsbS1mZXN0aXZhbNIBXWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC9tYXkvMTEvc2VjcmV0LWxpc3QtYWJ1c2Vycy1jYW5uZXMtZmlsbS1mZXN0aXZhbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Explosive’ secret list of abusers set to upstage women’s big week at Cannes film festival,"For good and bad reasons on and off the red carpet the spotlight is trained on women in the run-up to the Cannes film festival this week. As the cream of female film talent including Hollywood’s Meryl Streep and Britain’s Andrea Arnold prepare to receive significant career awards a dark cloud is threatening. It is expected that new allegations of the abuse of women in the European entertainment industry will be made public which may overshadow the sparkle of a feminist Croisette.

Streep’s screen achievements will be celebrated with an honorary Palme d’Or at the opening ceremony while a day later Arnold the acclaimed British film director will receive the prestigious Carosse d’Or from the French director’s guild. And on Sunday another influential British film personality will be saluted when diversity champion Dame Donna Langley the chairman and chief content officer at NBCUniversal is to be honoured with the Women in Motion Award at a lavish dinner. All this comes in a year that also sees the American director Greta Gerwig best known for last summer’s Barbie presiding over a jury that features the campaigning stars Eva Green and Lily Gladstone. But the story of the 77th festival will not be all positive for women.

In the run-up to the annual gathering on the Côte d’Azur rumours have been widespread in France of the existence of a secret list of 10 men in the industry including leading actors and directors who have been abusive to women. The names described as “explosive” are believed to have been sent anonymously to the National Centre for Cinema in Paris along with other leading film finance companies in France.

According to reports in Le Figaro and the satirical magazine Le Canard enchaîné festival organisers have set up a crisis management team to respond to the accusations. Films might have to be dropped from the screening timetable if they involve implicated names.

The impending revelations may prove an apt curtain-raiser for the Wednesday premiere of a short French film Moi Aussi about abuse in the industry. The film which was added to the festival’s Un Certain Regard programme at the last minute is predicted to prove just as incendiary as the list owing to its emotive content.

Made by actor Judith Godrèche dubbed the “ambassador of #MeToo” in France it draws on the words of many female contributors and takes the form of a choral piece uniting different personal accounts. “Suddenly before me was a crowd of victims a reality that also represented France so many stories from all social backgrounds and generations” Godrèche has explained. “Then the question was what I was going to do with them? What do you do when you’re overwhelmed by what you hear by the sheer volume of testimonies?”

The 52-year-old actor first shook up French cinema in February when she accused the directors Jacques Doillon and Benoît Jacquot of having raped her in the 1980s when she was a teenager. Jacquot 77 Godrèche said had a relationship with her when she was under the age of consent. He denies committing any offences and has said that he was “under her spell”. She claims Doillon 80 forced her to take part in a gratuitous sex scene on his 1989 film La Fille de 15 ans (The 15-year-old Girl). He says she agreed to take part in the scene in which he also acted and he denies rape or assault. Godrèche followed up her accusations a month later with a speech at France’s high-profile Cesar awards in which she claimed the film industry had been a cover for exploiting underaged actors.

The effect of new abuse allegations and all the honours being heaped on influential women will certainly mean the opening of the 2024 festival is in strong contrast to last year. Last May demonstrators on the Croisette opposed Johnny Depp’s appearance in the opening film Jeanne du Barry. They were angry about recent abuse allegations against him involving his ex-wife Amber Heard that led to his defeat in a British libel trial although a month later he won a similar libel trial in an American court.

A more progressive tone should be set by Streep’s opening honour made in recognition of “countless masterpieces” over 50 years of cinema. “To stand in the shadow of those who have previously been honoured is humbling and thrilling in equal part” said Streep on hearing of the award.

London-born Langley a “trailblazing” studio chief is also being rewarded next weekend for fostering “a more inclusive industry” over two decades with films that “provide a platform for women”. Away from film sets Langley has also campaigned as a board member of Vital Voices and is a founder of the Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Film mentorship programme. Previous winners of the Women In Motion award include Jane Fonda Salma Hayek Viola Davis and last year Michelle Yeoh.

Arnold whose new film Bird is showing in the main competition this year will receive her award after a Wednesday screening of her 2006 film Red Road. Set in Glasgow it tells of a false accusation of rape made vengefully by a female CCTV operator.

Jury-member Green is one of the more prominent actors to have accused Harvey Weinstein of making inappropriate advances. In 2017 the actor said she had to push away the disgraced producer during a business meeting in Paris. “I got away without it going further but the experience left me shocked and disgusted” she said.

The reaction to the #MeToo movement in France has been slower and more nuanced than in America. The legendary actor Catherine Deneuve was among those to initially play down the importance of prosecuting the bad behaviour of men defending their so-called “right to pester”. But last week French legislators agreed to a government inquiry into sexual and gender-based violence across the country’s performing arts and fashion sectors. And in the autumn French actor Gérard Depardieu stands trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on the set of The Green Shutters. He faces rape charges in another case and is under investigation over allegations of assault. He denies all charges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9ucy8yMDI0LzA1LzExL3VjbGEtcHJvdGVzdHMtcG9saWNlLWluYWN0aW9uLWZpZ2h0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Violence at UCLA protest raged for hours before police stepped in,"Faculty had raised alarms in the days before the attack on pro-Palestinian protesters. That night one witness called emergency services 11 times before police intervened.

Despite warnings of violence at UCLA police didn’t step in for over 3 hours

Late on April 30 Sean Tabibian called 911 to say police were needed urgently at the University of California at Los Angeles. “All hell had broken loose” Tabibian recalled in an interview. Masked agitators were attacking pro-Palestinian protesters on a campus quad video footage shows and a team of hired security guards had retreated.

The call at 11:09 p.m. was the first of 11 that Tabibian made to police that night as the violence escalated according to his cellphone’s call log. Other witnesses called 911 as well records show.

“They said they were responding” said Tabibian a local business executive and UCLA alumnus who was near campus around the time commotion erupted at the encampment and who said he was concerned that protesters had been discriminating against Jewish students. “They kept saying they’re responding they’re responding.”

While a small UCLA patrol could be seen in footage briefly early on law enforcement agencies did not move in to stop the violence until 3 hours and 34 minutes after Tabibian’s first 911 call a Washington Post examination has found — a delay that prolonged one of the most violent altercations since pro-Palestinian protesters began setting up encampments on college campuses across the country this spring.

The examination — based on evidence including more than 200 videos emergency radio transmissions text messages and interviews with more than a dozen witnesses — illuminates the stakes for university and local officials as they decide if and when to call police to deal with pro-Palestinian encampments. Elsewhere police have been accused of using heavy-handed tactics but at UCLA where university policy discourages calling police preemptively campus police as well as the Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol are facing scrutiny for their hands-off approach that night.

It’s not clear why police waited so long to respond. But in the hours before they took action at least 16 people were visibly injured the majority of them pro-Palestinian including two protesters who could be seen with blood streaking across their faces and soaking into their clothes videos and images show. The counterprotesters ignited at least six fireworks; struck protesters at least 20 times with wooden planks metal poles and other objects; and punched or kicked at least eight protesters.

The protesters occasionally fought back. People on both sides sprayed their opponents with chemical irritants at least 48 times — in some instances in the face at close range. Unconfirmed reports of a gunshot on campus and a man armed with a knife were relayed to officers over radio recordings show.

As the violence raged some police remained stationed at a hastily convened command post near the encampment while others assembled in formation closer to the violence but held back for an hour video shows. Authorities did not report making any arrests and a review by The Post of video footage found no indication attackers were detained.

Law enforcement’s tepid response on April 30 contrasts starkly with their aggressive maneuvers the following night when officers in riot gear some firing projectiles swiftly dismantled the UCLA camp and arrested 210 people for refusing to leave.

The Post’s examination also found that faculty had raised concerns for days about harassment of pro-Palestinian activists and physical violence directed at people in the protest encampment raising questions about whether the school should have had more police on hand to prevent an altercation.

Skip to end of carousel College protests over Gaza war Waves of antiwar protests are spreading across colleges campuses with growing police arrests as graduation season approaches. See the universities where protests are intensifying Are you a college student? Tell us about protests on your campus (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post) End of carousel The college is typically policed by its own small force and university officials must ask outside departments for extra help when they determine it’s needed. UCLA follows a systemwide University of California policy “not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community” a spokeswoman said in a statement last month after protesters established their encampment. While LAPD would not answer questions about when they were summoned a senior UCLA official told a colleague that the college had asked LAPD for assistance by around 11:30 p.m. on the night of the attack according to text messages obtained by The Post. The California Highway Patrol has said UCLA requested its help an hour later at 12:30 a.m. UCLA police chief John Thomas told the Los Angeles Times that when he got to campus shortly before midnight he saw 19 officers from campus police the LAPD and three other local police departments but an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small to step in. It was not until about 1:30 a.m. that officers began staging with campus police in a parking lot near the encampment video shows. CHP confirmed the time UCLA requested its help but did not respond to further questions. In an unsigned email LAPD told The Post “The department is looking into its involvement on campus along with other law enforcement agencies and a detailed report is being completed.” Campus police referred questions to UCLA. A spokesperson for UCLA did not respond to requests for comment. UCLA and LAPD have said they are now jointly investigating perpetrators of the April 30 attack and that they have asked the FBI for help. Michael V. Drake the president of the University of California system has requested an external investigation of the university’s response that night. Mounting concerns On April 25 as protests emerged at universities nationwide over Israel’s war in Gaza students at UCLA’s Westwood campus began building a tent encampment on Dickson Plaza an open tree-lined quad in front of the college’s Royce Hall theater. Their demands to college leaders included calling for a cease-fire divesting from companies tied to Israel’s war effort and boycotting Israeli universities. Over the next several days videos show counterprotesters faced off with pro-Palestinian demonstrators. According to protesters they repeatedly tried to enter the encampment.

UCLA asked for assistance in policing the demonstrations from the wider University of California police system on April 25 and April 26 but then canceled those requests Wade Stern the president of the University of California’s police union told The Post. The cancellations first reported by the Los Angeles Times were frustrating Stern said. “Every cop wants to go and help” he said. “We all want to be there.”

Concerns about students’ safety mounted among some faculty ahead of a pro-Israeli counterprotest planned for April 28 and permitted by university officials. In a phone call on April 27 Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck assured Randall Kuhn a public health professor that counterprotesters did not want to “pick a fight” and that UCLA was stationing dozens of hired security guards around the encampment including 30 ready “to help address any provocations or potential attacks” according to an email Kuhn sent to colleagues summarizing Beck’s remarks. Beck referred questions to a UCLA spokesman.

On April 28 counterprotesters erected a massive TV screen to blast footage of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas at the protesters. UCLA’s police force was bolstered that day by additional officers from other University of California campuses. Still when an assault occurred they were outmanned and sought additional help from several local police departments according to a timeline compiled by police union officials.

By the next night tensions were rising again. Videos show a small group of agitators taunting people in the pro-Palestinian encampment. Police later separated fights between the two sides protesters said in interviews.

Hours later UCLA again asked for help from other UC police departments. But none was able to send reinforcements as they were monitoring protests on their own campuses according to the union timeline.

The attack

Agitators gathered outside the encampment the following day. Recordings posted on social media showed protesters refusing entry to a Jewish student who identified as a Zionist and a mother complaining to UCLA that Jewish students were being blocked from accessing a library.

At 2:35 p.m. Danielle Carr an assistant professor at UCLA’s Institute for Society and Genetics wrote an email seeking to sound an alarm about “truly unbelievable” aggression against protesters during the pro-Israeli counterprotest two days earlier. “I know that many faculty are wondering what the administration plans to do to protect our students” Carr wrote to an office responsible for handling complaints of sexual violence and harassment.

By the evening a large crowd had gathered outside the protest camp. One man was draped in an Israeli flag and others wore hoodies with slogans demanding the return of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. At 10:48 p.m. counterprotesters moved closer to the encampment’s southern barricades and blared “Harbu Darbu” — an Israeli wartime anthem calling for retribution for Oct. 7. Suddenly they rushed forward and started pulling metal fences away from security guards stationed at the perimeter of the encampment.

The guards were from Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC) which contracts with UCLA and specializes in crowd control at sporting events and concerts and a subsidiary. While some CSC guards attempted to push back attackers others stood aside.

“There are too many!” one of the security guards said recordings show. Another shouted “CSC pack it up!” as fellow guards walked away. CSC did not respond to questions from The Post.

The agitators pushed past the fencing and started ripping down plywood barriers on the perimeter of the camp’s south and north sides. Pro-Palestinian protesters attempted to hold their line.

Calls for help

When Tabibian the business executive placed his first 911 call at 11:09 p.m. he connected with a dispatcher and they spoke for 21 seconds. “I believe I told him that people were getting hurt — they needed to get over here and shut this down” Tabibian told The Post noting that it was difficult to differentiate between each of his 11 calls. Tabibian blamed pro-Palestinian protesters for provoking the chaos.

At 11:13 p.m. two UCLA patrol cars and an ambulance arrived near a UCLA campus police car that an observer said had been there all day. A third arrives shortly after. At least four officers stepped out of their cars and were soon surrounded by counterprotesters some shouting “Shut it down!” in an apparent reference to the encampment. One man was ushered to the ambulance and at 11:19 p.m. the three police cars and ambulance pulled away.

Reports of injuries rolled in. At 11:31 p.m. a fire department dispatcher asked an ambulance stationed nearby to respond to an injury at the college.

Kuhn the public health professor texted Beck the vice chancellor about his growing concern. Beck assured him that LAPD had been summoned.

Violence continues

Moments later a counterprotester lit a firework and lobbed it over the encampment perimeter. It exploded inside the encampment to terrified screams.

(Video: Mel Buer/The Real News Network)

The lack of police intervention frustrated witnesses. Jeremy López who supported the protest called 911 at 12:28 a.m. to report that students were being beaten. “The operator said ‘Yes we know already’ and hung up” López later told The Post.

Carr the assistant professor who had warned of potential violence arrived at the plaza a few minutes later and encountered what looked to her like a war zone. Students were sprawled on the ground some bleeding from their faces. Others were reeling from eye pain caused by irritants.

The violence continued “for hours and hours with nobody stepping in” said Bharat Venkat an associate professor. “I thought a student would be killed.”

A mob surrounded two pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had stepped outside of the encampment. While one was hit with a wooden stick the crowd rained punches on the other. He was later recorded receiving treatment from volunteer medics his face covered in blood.

At 12:32 a.m. a man on LAPD radio said they “might want to launch a UCLA unit” according to a review of radio communications archived by the platform Broadcastify. Seconds later an officer said he was at UCLA’s Murphy Hall — close to the violence — along with four other units. But no LAPD personnel were seen taking action in available video footage of the area.

After 1 a.m. police reported over radio that an “MFF” — mobile field force — and a helicopter had been requested at the college and officers were told that the incident was “code three” meaning they should use lights and sirens.

But over the subsequent hour the address of the temporary command post was misstated over radio confusing some officers.

People calling police continued to receive dismissive responses. “Didn’t you already call?” an operator said when a woman called UCLA police at 1:33 a.m. video shows. “I already told you we’re handling the situation. You can’t continue calling unless you have an emergency.”

Police emerge

Throughout the evening police vehicles had gathered on the outskirts of campus but the first mass of police visible in footage reviewed by The Post was a line of about 30 CHP officers that began to form at 1:43 a.m. Another row of officers in black lined up behind them. They did not advance.

At 2:17 a.m. counterprotesters rushed the encampment barricade physically assaulting protesters including slamming a plank of wood on someone’s head and spraying an irritant. Officers stood about 200 feet away. None moved to stop the violence the video shows.

(Video: Film the Police LA / KNN)

Nearly an hour after they assembled in line and nearly four hours after the attack began officers from CHP and LAPD began slowly moving in formation toward Dickson Plaza at 2:43 a.m.

By 3:10 a.m. police had separated the majority of attackers from the pro-Palestinian protesters. But law enforcement did not arrest or appear to question the attackers instead granting them an exit route away from the camp according to video.

“There have only been a couple times in my life where I’ve had trouble understanding what’s real and what’s maybe a nightmare and this was definitely one of them” Nicholas Shapiro an assistant professor and a former EMT who helped treat injured students later told The Post.

Shapiro arrived home with dark stains on his fingers and palms.

“Surreal” he texted a group of professor friends at 3:47 a.m. “to be ending the night cleaning a student’s blood off my hands.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMS9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1sYXRlLWZlZXMtcmVndWxhdGlvbi1jZnBiL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzExL2J1c2luZXNzL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWxhdGUtZmVlcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLWNmcGI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge blocks Biden administration rule capping credit card late fees at $8,"New York CNN —

A federal judge in Fort Worth Texas on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.

US District Judge Mark T. Pittman an appointee of former President Donald Trump granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.

These organizations led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule which was set to go into effect Tuesday would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32 the CFPB estimated.

A preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.

“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”

The US Chamber of Commerce has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.

“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week” said Chuck Bell advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”

The rule first proposed in February 2023 is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.

The new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt according to the CFPB.

The push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers especially millennials and those with lower incomes have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.

The new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.

According to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee."

TLDR: When comparing ThymeBoost to a few other popular time-series methods we find that it can generate very competitive forecasts. Spoiler warning: ThymeBoost wins. But beyond winning we see that there are many benefits of the ThymeBoost framework even in the cases where it loses.

For more examples you can view the ThymeBoost Github.

First post in the series: Time Series Forecasting with ThymeBoost. If you haven’t viewed it yet then check it out!

Introduction

The examples used in this competition are fairly popular but some of the code used for data wrangling has been taken from this article (thanks Tomonori Masui!). You should check out the article to see how a few other models perform on these datasets.

The first example is a fairly well known time-series: the Airline Passenger dataset. This data is widely available and one source is from Kaggle or from the Github. Make sure you have the latest ThymeBoost package which can be installed via pip:

pip install ThymeBoost --upgrade

Now that we are up-to-date let’s take a look!

Airline Passenger Dataset

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

from ThymeBoost import ThymeBoost as tb

import seaborn as sns

sns.set_style(""darkgrid"") #Airlines Data if your csv is in a different filepath adjust this

df = pd.read_csv('AirPassengers.csv')

df.index = pd.to_datetime(df['Month'])

y = df['#Passengers']

plt.plot(y)

plt.show()

Image by Author

This time series is quite interesting! A clear trend along with multiplicative seasonality. Definitely a good benchmark for any forecasting methodology.

In order to judge the forecasting methods we will split the data into a standard train/test split where the last 30% of the data is held out. The outcome of the testing procedure can change depending on this split. In an attempt to remain unbiased the train/test splits from the aforementioned article will be used.

Any tuning or model selection will be done on the training set while the test set will be used to judge the methods. The goal (at least for me) is to see if ThymeBoost can be competitive against other vetted methods. If you were to implement a forecasting model in production then you may want to use a more robust method to judge models such as time-series cross validation.

test_len = int(len(y) * 0.3)

al_train al_test = y.iloc[:-test_len] y.iloc[-test_len:]

First let’s try out an Auto-Arima implementation: Pmdarima.

import pmdarima as pm

# Fit a simple auto_arima model

arima = pm.auto_arima(al_train

seasonal=True

m=12

trace=True

error_action='warn'

n_fits=50) pmd_predictions = arima.predict(n_periods=len(al_test))

arima_mae = np.mean(np.abs(al_test - pmd_predictions))

arima_rmse = (np.mean((al_test - pmd_predictions)**2))**.5

arima_mape = np.sum(np.abs(pmd_predictions - al_test)) / (np.sum((np.abs(al_test))))

Next we will give Prophet a shot.

from fbprophet import Prophet prophet_train_df = al_train.reset_index()

prophet_train_df.columns = ['ds' 'y'] prophet = Prophet(seasonality_mode='multiplicative')

prophet.fit(prophet_train_df)

future_df = prophet.make_future_dataframe(periods=len(al_test) freq='M')

prophet_forecast = prophet.predict(future_df)

prophet_predictions = prophet_forecast['yhat'].iloc[-len(al_test):] prophet_mae = np.mean(np.abs(al_test - prophet_predictions.values))

prophet_rmse = (np.mean((al_test - prophet_predictions.values)**2))**.5

prophet_mape = np.sum(np.abs(prophet_predictions.values - al_test)) / (np.sum((np.abs(al_test))))

Finally implementing ThymeBoost. Here we are using a new method: ‘autofit’ from the latest version of the package. This method will try several simple implementations given a possible seasonality. It is an experimental feature and only works for traditional time-series. A current issue is that it tries several redundant parameter settings this will be fixed in a future release speeding up the process! Additionally if you intend to pass exogenous factors we recommend using the optimize method found in the README instead.

boosted_model = tb. ThymeBoost(verbose=0) output = boosted_model.autofit(al_train

seasonal_period=12)

predicted_output = boosted_model.predict(output len(al_test))

tb_mae = np.mean(np.abs(al_test - predicted_output['predictions']))

tb_rmse = (np.mean((al_test - predicted_output['predictions'])**2))**.5

tb_mape = np.sum(np.abs(predicted_output['predictions'] - al_test)) / (np.sum((np.abs(al_test))))

By setting verbose=0 when building the class it silences the logging of each individual model. Instead a progress bar will be displayed to denote progress through the different parameter settings as well as the ‘optimal’ settings found. By default ThymeBoost’s autofit method will do 3 rounds of fitting and forecasting. This process rolls through the last 6 values of the training set to choose the ‘best’ settings. For this data the optimal settings found were:

Optimal model configuration: {'trend_estimator': 'linear' 'fit_type': 'local' 'seasonal_period': [12 0] 'seasonal_estimator': 'fourier' 'connectivity_constraint': True 'global_cost': 'maicc' 'additive': False 'seasonality_weights': array([1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.

1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.

1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.

1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.

1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5.

5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5.]) 'exogenous': None}

Params ensembled: False

Some important things to note:

‘additive’ is set to false meaning that the entire process is ‘multiplicative’ i.e. the log is taken of the input series. Normal ‘multiplicative’ seasonality is not yet implemented. There is an array of ‘seasonality_weights’ where the last 2 ‘seasonal_periods’ are set to 5 meaning those periods impact the seasonality component 5 times more than the other periods. ‘seasonal_period’ is [12 0] so it cycles back and forth between measuring seasonality and not measuring it. This is interesting behavior but it essentially adds some regularization to the seasonality component.

Speaking of components let’s take a look:

boosted_model.plot_components(output predicted_output)

Image by Author

All in all ThymeBoost decided to take the log of the input series fit a linear changepoint model and add a ‘changepoint’ to the seasonality component.

Were these correct decisions? Let’s take a look at the error metrics:

Image by Author

These error metrics speak for themselves ThymeBoost outperformed the other methods across the board. But what do the forecasts actually look like?

plt.plot(pmd_predictions label='Pmdarima')

plt.plot(al_test.values label='Actuals')

plt.plot(prophet_predictions.values label='Prophet')

plt.plot(predicted_output['predictions'].values label='ThymeBoost')

plt.legend()

plt.show()

Image by Author

Clearly all methods picked up very similar signals. It seems as though ThymeBoost was just slightly better in terms of the seasonal shape potentially due to the seasonal weighting it decided to use.

WPI Dataset

The next dataset is the U.S. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) from 1960 to 1990 and once again the example is taken from the aforementioned article.

This dataset unfortunately does not come with ThymeBoost but we can access it via Statsmodels:

from statsmodels.datasets import webuse dta = webuse('wpi1')

ts_wpi = dta['wpi']

ts_wpi.index = pd.to_datetime(dta['t'])

test_len = int(len(ts_wpi) * 0.25)

ts_wpi = ts_wpi.astype(float)

wpi_train wpi_test = ts_wpi.iloc[:-test_len] ts_wpi.iloc[-test_len:]

plt.plot(ts_wpi)

plt.show()

Image by Author

This time-series is fairly different than the previous. It appears to lack any seasonality so those settings will be disabled (although if we accidentally feed seasonality settings to ThymeBoost it does not change much).

Let’s follow the same process as before and first fit Pmdarima:

import pmdarima as pm

# Fit a simple auto_arima model

arima = pm.auto_arima(wpi_train

seasonal=False

trace=True

error_action='warn'

n_fits=50)

pmd_predictions = arima.predict(n_periods=len(wpi_test))

arima_mae = np.mean(np.abs(wpi_test - pmd_predictions))

arima_rmse = (np.mean((wpi_test - pmd_predictions)**2))**.5

arima_mape = np.sum(np.abs(pmd_predictions - wpi_test)) / (np.sum((np.abs(wpi_test))))

Next Prophet:

from fbprophet import Prophet prophet_train_df = wpi_train.reset_index()

prophet_train_df.columns = ['ds' 'y'] prophet = Prophet(yearly_seasonality=False)

prophet.fit(prophet_train_df)

future_df = prophet.make_future_dataframe(periods=len(wpi_test))

prophet_forecast = prophet.predict(future_df)

prophet_predictions = prophet_forecast['yhat'].iloc[-len(wpi_test):] prophet_mae = np.mean(np.abs(wpi_test - prophet_predictions.values))

prophet_rmse = (np.mean((wpi_test - prophet_predictions.values)**2))**.5

prophet_mape = np.sum(np.abs(prophet_predictions.values - wpi_test)) / (np.sum((np.abs(wpi_test))))

And finally ThymeBoost:

boosted_model = tb. ThymeBoost(verbose=0) output = boosted_model.autofit(wpi_train

seasonal_period=0) predicted_output = boosted_model.predict(output forecast_horizon=len(wpi_test))

tb_mae = np.mean(np.abs((wpi_test.values) - predicted_output['predictions']))

tb_rmse = (np.mean((wpi_test.values - predicted_output['predictions'].values)**2))**.5

tb_mape = np.sum(np.abs(predicted_output['predictions'].values - wpi_test.values)) / (np.sum((np.abs(wpi_test.values))))

And the optimal settings which also can be accessed directly through:

print(boosted_model.optimized_params)

which returns:

{'trend_estimator': 'linear' 'fit_type': 'local' 'seasonal_period': 0 'seasonal_estimator': 'fourier' 'connectivity_constraint': False 'global_cost': 'mse' 'additive': True 'exogenous': None}

Like last time ThymeBoost chose a linear model with local fit a.k.a. a linear changepoint model for the trend component. Except this time ‘connectivity_constraint’ is set to False which relaxes that the trend lines at the changepoint connect AT the changepoint.

Let’s take a look at the error metrics:

Once again ThymeBoost outperforms the other two methods.

And the forecasts:

plt.plot(pmd_predictions label='Pmdarima')

plt.plot(wpi_test.values label='Actuals')

plt.plot(prophet_predictions.values label='Prophet')

plt.plot(predicted_output['predictions'].values label='ThymeBoost')

plt.legend()

plt.show()

Image by Author

Conclusion

The goal of this article was to see if ThymeBoost can compete against other popular methods it clearly can in these instances. But don’t be fooled into thinking ThymeBoost is a panacea (although I wish it was!). There are many times where it is outperformed however one major benefit is that any method which outperforms ThymeBoost could potentially be added into the framework. Once a method is added it gains access to some interesting features via the boosting process.

An example of this can be found in the article already referenced. For the sunspots dataset ThymeBoost’s autofit does not do any ARIMA modelling so it has poor results compared to the ARIMA(8 0 1) found from sktime. However if we use the standard fit method and pass that ARIMA order with a local fit (so we allow changepoints) we outperform sktime’s Auto-ARIMA.

I will leave that as an exercise for you to try simply use these settings:

output = boosted_model.fit(sun_train.values

trend_estimator='arima'

arima_order=(8 0 1)

global_cost='maicc'

seasonal_period=0

fit_type='local'

)

As mentioned before this package is still in early development. The sheer number of possible configurations makes debugging an involved procedure so use at your own risk.

Data frame structures and method eliminate the circuitous logic and extraneous data structures necessary in older procedural languages terry leitch · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 6 min read · Nov 13 2021 -- Listen Share

After recently refactoring code for calculating hospital ratings using public data from the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services (original code and data can be found at https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/sas) I thought I would capture my key insights here.

One observation from this conversion was that the power of data frames has completely changed the standard for readability and speed of delivery. Since SAS evolved out of the early procedural language world that included FORTRAN and COBOL with array type data structures with uniform data types and element-wise operations the level of abstraction that is available via heterogeneous data arrays which are looped over element by element to perform arithmetic or comparisons that often require parallel arrays for later processing.

Here’s an example. In the following SAS code the objective is to identify rating categories that have less than 100 observations and drop those columns from the dataset:

PROC SQL;

select measure_in_name into: measure_in separated by '' notrim

from include_measure0;

QUIT;

%put &measure_in; /* &measure_cnt: number of included measure */

PROC SQL;

select count(measure_in_name)

into: measure_cnt

from include_measure0;

QUIT;

%put &measure_cnt; /*COUNT # HOSPITALS PER MEASURE FOR ALL MEASURES*/

PROC TABULATE DATA=All_data_&year.&quarter out=measure_volume;

var &measure_all; table n*(&measure_all);

RUN; PROC TRANSPOSE data=Measure_volume out=measure_volume_t;

RUN; /* IDENTIFY MEASURES WITH VOLUMN <=100 */

DATA less100_measure (drop=_NAME_ _LABEL_ rename = (COL1=freq));

SET measure_volume_t (where = (col1<=100)); if _name_ ^= '_PAGE_' and _name_^='_TABLE_';

measure_name = tranwrd(_NAME_ '_N' ''); RUN;

DATA R.less100_measure;SET less100_measure;run;*OP-2; /* CREATE a measure list for count<=100 */

PROC SQL;

select measure_Name

into: measure_exclude separated by '' notrim

from Less100_measure;

QUIT; /* REMOVE MEASURES WHICH HAVE HOSPITAL COUNTS <=100*/

DATA initial_data_&year.&quarter;

SET All_data_&year.&quarter; /* measure volume <=100*/

drop &measure_exclude ;

RUN;

The code starts out creating a structure to hold the column names and then a structure it populates with the observation counts in each of the named named column. Next it identifies which columns have less than 100 observations and creates a structure to hold those column names and finally using those names drops them from the main data array.

Here is the equivalent python using a pandas dataframe of the same initial data:

# grab all columns with hospital counts>100

dfObs100=df[df.columns.intersection(df.columns[df.notna().sum()>=100])]

There are no explicit data structures created or element-wise calculation loops executed. Everything is happening inside the the pandas functions which means that you get the benefit of state of the art internal methods created by the package developers for looping over columns and rows.

Another example is the code for Program 1 in the package which consists of a SAS program file and a macro from another file which calculates the standardized group scores. Here is the SAS code for Program 1:

******************************************

* Outcomes - Mortality *

******************************************;

*option mprint;

/* count number of measures in Outcome Mortality Group */

PROC SQL;

select count(measure_in_name)

into: measure_OM_cnt /*number of measures in this domain*/

from Outcomes_mortality;/*Outcomes_mortality is generated from the SAS program '0 - Data and Measure Standardization_2021Apr'*/

QUIT; /*OM is used to define the data name for mortality Group;

Here is my equivalent Program 1 code in python:

# safety scores

safety=getScores(dfAllStddfsafetyFields)

# readmission scores

readmit=getScores(dfAllStddfreadmitFields)

# patient care scores

patient=getScores(dfAllStddfpxFields)

# process scores

process=getScores(dfAllStddfprocessFields)

with a supporting python function getScores() roughly the equivalent of the SAS macro:

def getScores(dfStddfAllfields):

# get fields counts and weights

cnt=dfStd[dfStd.columns.intersection(fields)].count(axis=1numeric_only=True)

wt=(1/cnt).replace(np.infnp.nan) #get raw scores

scoreB4=dfStd[dfAll.columns.intersection(fields)].mean(axis=1)

# standardize scores

sMean=np.nanmean(scoreB4)

sStddev=np.nanstd(scoreB4)

score=(scoreB4-sMean)/sStddev

#generate table of values

table5=pd.DataFrame({'id':df['PROVIDER_ID']'count':dfAllStd[dfAllStd.columns.intersection(fields)].count(axis=1numeric_only=True)

'measure_wt':wt'score_before':scoreB4'score_std':score})

return table5

As you can see again the python code is smaller and easier to read with implicit pandas loops.

Similar compact results could be achieved by using dataframes in R. In fact implicit “apply” function loops are critical for R computing performance.

Another lesson learned was that since an automated refactoring tool would just recreate the line by line structure of the original SAS code a typical translator would just duplicate the old structure along with its original design issues. This might make sense for operations where the data structure of the input and output is unlikely to change but as the availability of data grows and grows it is very likely that inputting more parallel fields will be increasingly desired and likely. And new models with new outputs will be more commonplace making it very likely that the code will need to be adaptable to new outputs derived from new modelling techniques.

If the intention of language transformation is to modernize and adapt the code to new data channels and modelling capability automated code refactoring would be an obstacle. So before you begin refactoring old data science code it is important you identify which parts of the code you want to leverage and plan for the use of the flexible capabilities available in the target language and then refactor using functional specifications with the old code as reference.

In summary key learnings were

Line-by-line conversion locks in old program structure which is likely suboptimal versus new language capabilities

Dataframes coupled with functions that operate on them create better more readable code thus easier to maintain

Simple translators that do line by line translation might enable access to new methods and models but lock critical program areas into an inferior data and logic paradigm

Using embedded functionals in pandas and other packages provides state-of-the-art performance for loops over column and row operations

Finally the same issue would exist for translating FORTRAN and COBOL which use similar data structures and loops. The real power of modern languages is in dataframes and functionals and unleashing it requires non-linear connections beyond simple machine translations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbGVtb253aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzE0L3RlbGVjb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy1zcGVjaWFsaXN0LWpvYi1pbi1tdWx0aXBsZS1sb2NhdGlvbnMtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1vZi1ob21lbGFuZC1zZWN1cml0eS0xNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telecommunications Specialist Job in Multiple Locations - Department of Homeland Security,"The United States government is a massive employer and is always looking for qualified candidates to fill a wide variety of open employment positions in locations across the country.

Countless if you ask the expert folks over at Miami Florida-based MetroWrapz. And they’re so proud of their work they’re not afraid to take up challenges of biblical proportions.

Quite literally judging (pun intended) by their latest creation. It's a 2004 Ferrari 360 Modena for sure. An “ old ” sports car by today’s standards but still quite capable of reaching 60 mph “in the blink of an eye.” But unless you’re an Italian connoisseur it’s going to be hard to make out the exact make and model of the sports car.Or perhaps even the experts will need to take a moment to indulge in the sweet artsy heresy behind this creation. It pays odes to so many ways of life that we really need to step back and try to become as unbiased as possible. So let’s get to the hard facts.This 360 Modena was MetroWrapz entry for the local Avery Dennison Graphics 2021 “Wrap Like a King” challenge. And it came out with a theme of truly epical (or should we say biblical) proportions. After all anyone who’s into Renaissance art should have no trouble noticing the Michelangelo/Sistine Chapel tribute. If not “The Last Judgement” title should provide all the necessary hints Now as always this hasn’t been painted. Instead everything – including the inner door jambs engine compartment trunk some of the windows and even the headlights – has been painstakingly wrapped and detailed. They used Avery Dennison SF 100 Conform Silver Chrome films with a matte lamination technique to keep the fresco atmosphere “alive.”They also had “gilded baroque pattern details” as a tribute to columns from cathedral architecture while the cracked background pattern reminds of the times when Michelangelo’s work of art hadn’t been restored just yet. And that’s not all considering the “stained glass” headlights... or the Swift 24k Gold Leaf that gives the final bespoke touches",,,,,,,,,,,,

He unleashed his wrath during the HMC’s regular monthly general meeting on Thursday following a presentation by an organisation called Friends of Watson Taylor Park which has expressed an interest in maintaining and updating the facility.

“It is a disgrace the state of the park right now knowing that we have been paying workers to take care of the park. Workers even live in the building down by the park and don’t do any work and let the park reach the stage where it is right now” said Samuels who is also councillor for the Cauldwell Division and a member of the Opposition People’s National Party.

“I am upset about it and I am happy that Friends of Watson Taylor Park is coming now to give us some assistance because we have been wasting money down there” he added.

Councillor Easton Edwards of the Lucea Division (Jamaica Labour Party) in which the park is located agreed that the HMC was to be blamed for conditions at the park. The facility is overrun by shrubs and access to the similarly unkempt beach area is only possible by navigating a dirt track.

“I feel that it is an indictment on the HMC as we should have been dealing with the care of the park which we have not been doing” he said. “But if we have individuals who want to come on board… we welcome it. The parish by extension belongs to all of us and [we welcome] anything that can make it better… What we pledge as an agency is to raise the bar [so] that we can have the park return to its original state in short order” added Edwards.

Member of the Friends of Watson Taylor Park John Campbell told the meeting that their goal is to be registered as a charitable organisation to create alliances with key stakeholders within the parish and overseas to return the park and beach to their former glory. Campbell is from Hanover and currently lives in Kingston.

He said the three-year-old organisation wants to put in place lawn cutting equipment to maintain the grassy areas of the park put in place a washroom and children’s play area as well as plant trees on the property. The group also wants to erect a monument in memory of Watson Taylor who donated the land to the people of Hanover.

They first outlined these plans in July of last year; however they have been waiting for the go ahead from the HMC which has custodial responsibility for the park.

Mayor Samuels who welcomed the group’s proposal explained that the novel coronavirus pandemic had played a role in the delay.

“We asked for a memorandum of understanding and I think some information came to us. We asked for some adjustment to take some points out of it and I know that it was done. It is up to us now to accept…” he said.

He later told the Jamaica Observer that the corporation is to meet hopefully before the next monthly meeting in December to decide on the group’s proposal to play a part in the maintenance and upgrade of the park.

There’s been no devaluation because existing tiers will remain unchanged; the updates simply include a couple of new tiers at the top end.

You can find more information about the existing Gold Platinum and Platinum Honors tiers here. The changes that have just been launched relate to two new tiers – Diamond and Diamond Honors. Here are the benefits you receive at both of those levels:

You can earn Platinum Honors status with Bank of America Preferred Rewards by having $100000 with them which can include retirement funds with Merrill Edge. For these two new tiers you’ll need significantly more funds saved with them – $1 million for Diamond status and $10 million for Diamond Honors; that’s based on a three month combined average daily balance.

Unfortunately that doesn’t come with a higher credit card reward bonus as both of these new tiers offer a 75% Rewards Bonus which is the same as Platinum Honors. At 20% the Savings Rate Booster is the same too.

Where these higher status tiers could be more useful is in different areas. For example if you have a Home Equity Line of Credit you can get a 0.625% or 0.75% discount for Diamond and Diamond Honors respectively. That’s higher than the 0.375% discount you get from having Platinum Honors status.

Mortgage origination fee or interest rate reduction on mortgages could represent significant savings depending on the size of said mortgage. Platinum Honors comes with a flat $600 reduction in the origination fee so the percentages on offer for Diamond and Diamond Honors customers could save far more depending on the size of the mortgage. The Platinum Honors benefit is also only available for origination fees whereas Diamond and Diamond Honors members can apply that discount towards the interest rate itself.

It seems like Lifestyle benefits are the other main enhancement with savings and/or unique opportunities being available for Diamond and Diamond Honors members in the following categories:

They of course think so and that is the reason they organized themselves into a panel discussion during the Law School’s 2021 Reunion Weekend in early November. By the time their storytelling hour and a half was over the audience couldn’t have agreed more.

Hosted by the BC Women’s Law Center the event featured a panel of eight classmates at the dais as well as several others among the crowd who shared cherished memories of the Law School—then housed in More Hall on BC’s main campus—along with tales from their diverse and impressive careers and the lessons they learned along the way.

Even from a strictly numerical perspective these women were important. The 1974 class represented a major shift in the presence of women at Boston College Law School. From 1965 to 1970 the number of women in each class ranged from 5 to 9 (3 percent to 9 percent). A slow increase began with the class of 1971 which included 17 women (10 percent) then rose to 22 in 1972 and 28 in 1973. In 1974 their number nearly doubled to 44 women (18 percent). Since then the count has consistently increased as has the normality of women pursuing careers in areas such as law. As evidence of the slow and steady rise women now comprise 54 percent of the Fall 2021 entering class at BC Law.

The Class of 1974 entered the law at a time when the field was dominated by men. Their group had to be self-selective and highly motivated to overcome the obstacles that existed simply because of being a woman. Many were raising families. Yet they not only succeeded they pioneered set trends led and innovated. They became law partners judges and public service advocates corporate executives policymakers and more. Not all were present at the event; all have impressive resumes.

A sampling: Susan Brooks shaped a new housing agency. Marilyn Blumberg Cane made a name on Wall Street. Katherine Coolidge did land use planning at the Boulder City Attorney’s office. Liz Cremens went from public defender to private practice lawyer to associate justice of the Massachusetts District Court. Lora Pepi rose to executive rank at Bank of America. Arlene Violet became the first female attorney general (Rhode Island) elected in the United States. Ruth-Arlene Howe was the first African American female to achieve tenure and the rank of full professor at BC Law. Kathy Galvin started in legal services in the Boston area did a stint in philanthropy in New York and was a supervisor in the federal San Francisco Asylum Office.

Part of what inspired the November 5 event was a reconnection effort 18 months ago by several of the women who decided to start getting together via Zoom. Janice Campbell who began her career in legal services and later did economic development work civil liberties projects and mediation—was among that core group. She explained that what began as a foursome of friends meeting weekly to check in grew to a 33-person network of 1974 alumni who continue to meet biweekly.

“They realized what a gift they were to each other as part of a very special community” said Interim Dean Diane Ring in her welcoming remarks to the panel “and after speaking with the Women’s Law Center they realized this gift was something they could also share with the BC Law community in the form of sharing their stories to inspire law students and alumni of today.”

The words “justice” “equality” and “resilience” came up often in the speakers’ recollections. A common piece of advice was the importance of taking risks and advocating for oneself as a woman in the field of law. “As I look back on my professional career I advise other people to take risks because every time I took a risk it turned out for the best” said Margaret Sofio who started in then-nascent cable television and rose to the top of the industry.

“You have to be willing to take risks throughout your career” agreed Lora Pepi the banking executive. “Take the risk to do something different and say ‘I can learn I don’t have to know 100 percent of it’ and you have to be your own advocate. No matter how hard you work—you may have others out there supporting you—but you have to be the one advocating for yourself.”

A consistent theme was the importance of giving back and how success in the field has allowed many of them to do so. For example Joan Lukey 74 whose trajectory as a trial attorney shattered several glass ceilings discussed her modest upbringing with a father who was a soldier and a mother who was a teacher. She said she will never forget when her father told her “I want you to remember that there’s a lot that you can do good with the money that I believe you have the talent to earn.”

Lukey added “I will keep working as long as I can not because my family and I need that any longer but because the longer I can do it the more I can give to the causes I care about. One of which is this law school.”

Summarizing her feelings toward the event and her classmates Regina Mandl whose path led from legal services to a Fortune 500 corporation to a lengthy law firm career said: “We’ve all gone our separate ways yet here we are to celebrate 50 years of a shared experience. We were competitive yes but we were also supportive as we had more in common than not. Today as I look back I marvel at the strength of these women and I am so grateful to be here with you all today.”

From academic training in Paris to exploration of the countryside landscape Whistler to Cassatt reveals both the visual and conceptual influences of France on American painters in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Thematically organized the exhibition will feature seven sections opening with a dramatic gallery reminiscent of the Paris Salon an annual showcase of artworks that determined the success of an artist’s career. Subsequent galleries will highlight a wide spectrum of artistic styles championed by American artists including classicism realism tonalism impressionism and hybrids of each—that were honed from lessons by Paris’ private ateliers official enrollment in École des BeauxArts and summer months spent at artist colonies throughout Normandy and Brittany.

The significant artistic contributions of James Abbott McNeill Whistler John Singer Sargent and Mary Cassatt also take the stage in the exhibition's narrative. These artists were known to be part of the first wave of Americans to cross the Atlantic Ocean to Europe and to Paris—then considered the center of the art world. Each contributed to the rich complexity of American painting which was in close dialogue with their French contemporaries during this period.

Following its presentation at DAM the exhibition will travel to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in 2022 April 16 to July 31.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZmludGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9maW5hbmNpYWwtc2VydmljZXMtZmluc2Vydi9uZW9iYW5rcy1zaG91bGQtdHJhZGl0aW9uYWwtYmFua3MtYmUtd29ycmllZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Neobanks – should traditional banks be worried?,"Instead of using traditional brick and mortar banks for financial transactions and investments consumers seem to increasingly be using neobanks.

So what exactly is a neobank? I would define it as any service that holds your money. Many neobanks exist in the space between traditional banks and check cashing or payday loans even if that isn’t really how their marketing portrays them. They started to become popular over a decade ago though they weren’t called neobanks back then. It began when retailers and non-financial-institutions started getting into financial services. An example that stands out is Wal-Mart partnering with Green Dot and offering some light banking services to their customers and employees. Likewise some neobanks today partner with traditional banking institutions behind the scenes.

More attractive to a younger generation

Neobanks are popular among younger consumers because the old model of traditional banking doesn’t make sense for the post-millennial generation. For example they don’t often or at least not yet feel the need to have multiple accounts in the way people in their 30s or older may have a checking account savings account and money market account or even possibly a stock trading account. This may change over time as the generation most often targeted by neobank marketing start building their savings and long-term financial plans.

In terms of marketing these neobanks often focus on a younger demographic. They seem friendlier and more “human” than say a Wells Fargo or Bank of America which tend to skew more aspirational in their messaging. To attract customers some neobanks may also try to add a veneer of social messaging whether it’s environmental or social justice.

Why “risky” may not be a problem

Neobanks are often considered a “riskier” approach to investing than traditional banking. For example one risk associated with neobanks is that assets may not be insured through a program like the FDIC. This however wasn’t a major issue during the 2008 financial crisis so it may be that today’s newest bank customers aren’t worried about it. This is certainly not the case with stock and crypto trading apps though which are riskier and tied to the market rather than the financial solvency of the bank itself.

Some neobanks like Robinhood combine regulated and unregulated financial services in one place. Consumers should always read the fine print and figure out which investments best fit their risk profile -- crypto being at the least regulated and riskiest and cash in an FDIC-insured account being highly regulated and stable.

That said these apps make it really easy for individual investors to dip their toes in the water of investing in intangible assets. It’s substantially easier now for a Robinhood user for example to buy a fraction of a stock or try investing in cryptocurrencies. This is a huge democratisation of investment opportunities and it’s also something that traditional banks can’t offer.

For younger adults who can’t or won’t be able to buy a home they may find these potentially riskier investments more attractive as well and may have more capital to experiment with.

Overlapping customer segments

The idea that these neobanks serve the “underbanked” -- and therefore don’t overlap in their customer base with traditional banks -- may be overhyped. It’s true that it’s certainly more convenient than going to a bank branch to open an account and fill out a form (or filling one out online) but traditional banks generally don’t require much more information than say Cash App or Venmo. Neobanks still need to comply with US laws including identity verification anti-money laundering and know your customer rules.

They also often offer lower or fewer fees and sometimes higher interest rates on their checking and savings accounts because of their lower overhead costs which can be appealing to a broader consumer segment. Luckily this has forced some traditional banks to get competitive with their fees as well so it’s been a win-win for consumers overall.

Customer service may be Achilles Heel

One perhaps surprising area where traditional banks still may edge out neobanks? Customer service. Granted there are plenty of horror stories for both. But with a conventional bank there’s often a physical branch a customer can visit if they have an issue. With neobanks you may not even be able to call someone when you encounter a problem. Before customers sign up they should see what their customer support options are -- and see what the app store customer reviews say.

In conclusion it’s fair to say that neobanks are here to stay. They’re an excellent option for consumers and they have revolutionised investing in particular. As these neobanks evolve and their customer base ages and starts to accumulate more wealth traditional banks should get worried. The switching cost of moving banks isn’t tremendously high but it’s also not just a few clicks. And if customers are used to say free stock trades they probably won’t suddenly get comfortable paying for them without some robust and clearly articulated benefits.

As part of this hiring campaign the bank is running a Virtual Career Event in Hong Kong and Singapore for both relationship managers with experience in financial services and those looking to change industry.

In the affluent wealth hubs of Singapore and Hong Kong Standard Chartered has an “open-ended approach to hiring” especially for roles that require client relationship management says Rajesh Kannan Head of Priority and Premium Banking for Asia at Standard Chartered.

“For RM roles we are primarily looking for people who can think ‘client first’ are self-motivated thrive in an international environment enjoy learning and are disciplined when it comes to managing client relationships” says Rajesh who will be speaking at the November 25 career event which Standard Chartered is running in partnership with eFinancialCareers. “Such skills are available in abundance in adjacent industries such as insurance and broking and even in hospitality and real estate. We are committed to supporting the right candidates to succeed with us” he adds.

In Singapore Standard Chartered plans to double the number of relationship managers over the next five years. “Singapore is uniquely positioned as an international wealth hub and the bank is well-positioned to serve the needs of our clients within the growing affluent segment thanks to our innovative digital solutions and comprehensive product suite” says Rajesh.

As mainland Chinese wealth particularly in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) grows rapidly Standard Chartered has also announced plans to hire 400 people across retail banking and wealth management in Hong Kong – especially RMs and wealth specialists. They will provide wealth management services to meet the rising demand for investment opportunities. “To support our strategic focus in the GBA we have and will nurture a diversified mix of RMs who have deep market knowledge in the region and are fully committed to support the banking and wealth management needs of our affluent and international banking clients” says Rajesh.

Standard Chartered RMs across the network receive competitive salaries and “flexible benefits” says Kannan. The firm’s structured incentive plan for example which is regarded as among the best in the industry is based on achievement of a transparent balanced scorecard and demonstration of the bank’s valued behaviours.

“Given our strong focus on client continuum and our current participation across segments a role at Standard Chartered opens the door to a diverse range of client relationships business experiences and career opportunities to an RM – both locally and internationally” says Rajesh.

Whether they are first-time RMs or experienced hires Standard Chartered offers a range of internal training and development programmes. “We use a mix of these along with external programmes and certifications to fulfil the needs of RMs both from a skills and a regulatory perspective” says Rajesh.

During their day-to-day work RMs at Standard Chartered build meaningful and trusted relationships with their clients supported by a team of specialists. “Delivering an outstanding service making sure clients have timely and effective resolutions and enabling all this via digital platforms with a human touch are key to the RM role” says Rajesh. “RMs also need to embrace a continuous learning mind-set and be focused on long-term relationship management not just tactical sales. We believe achieving the trust of the client team and organisation are crucial to helping you succeed” he adds.

Standard Chartered is an international bank with a heritage of over 160 years in some of the most dynamic markets of the world especially in Asia Africa and the Middle East. “With a sizeable footprint we participate in all client segments – from the mass market to emerging affluent affluent and high net worth – which gives us the advantage of a continuum of clients as we can acquire and serve them throughout various life stages which not many other banks in the region can do” says Rajesh.

The emerging affluent and affluent segments are a sweet spot for Standard Chartered which serves these client groups via its Premium and Priority Banking teams. “Our Priority Banking proposition which has been in existence for over 25 years is a pioneer in the affluent segment and is helping our clients build manage and protect their wealth. Whatever their financial priorities and investing style our relationship managers and wealth specialists work with our clients to offer superior investment advice and personalised products and services to meet clients’ financial goals” says Rajesh.

Rajesh started with Standard Chartered as a management trainee and has since progressed through a diverse range of roles across multiple businesses and countries. “Every time I felt the need to do something different to expand my learning or re-energize with a new challenge I have found that opportunity in the bank” he says.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL3J1Z2J5L2dhbGxhZ2hlci1wcmVtaWVyc2hpcC1zYWxlLWNsaW1iLWludG8tdG9wLWZvdXItd2l0aC1ib251cy1wb2ludC13aW4tb3Zlci1sZWljZXN0ZXItYmF0aC1icnVzaC1uZXdjYXNfc3RvMTAxMzk0NjIvc3Rvcnkuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallagher Premiership: Sale beat Leicester to climb into top four Bath close in on playoffs with Newcastle win,"Sam James of Sale Sharks celebrates scoring a try during the Gallagher Premiership Rugby match between Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers at AJ Bell Stadium on May 10 2024 in Salford England.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2Zvcm1lci1iZWQtYmF0aC1zdWVzLWh1ZHNvbi1iYXktZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRyYWRpbmctZ2FpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Bed Bath & Beyond Sues Hudson Bay for $300 Million in Trading Profits,"Why did this happen?

The modelling  released on Friday afternoon outlines Australia’s emissions will decrease by 85 per cent with the remaining 15 per cent expected to drop with “future technology breakthroughs”.





Experts are left puzzled at the modelling which they say have been founded upon assumptions on technological advancements that haven’t yet happened and is heavily reliant on offsets.

READ MORE Australians will be financially better off under net zero plan climate modelling shows

University of Melbourne climate science associate professor Malte Meinshausen says Australia missed an opportunity to maximise its renewable energy sector which is recommended in other countries' modelling.







""The modelling that we see is rather odd ... the Australian way is to continue ... to emit as you normally would do and do some accounting tricks to appear to reduce emissions"" Professor Meinshausen told SBS News.







""Australia is blessed with renewable energies and it would be a tremendous opportunity to embrace it ... but instead this modelling is supposed to continue into this status quo path.""







Instead Professor Meinshausen warned Australia will be perceived as a ""laggard"" to the rest of the world and will face the consequences.







""If Australia does not play a fair game here in the international effort to limit climate change then other trade partners will impose taxes on their exports and it will be at the disadvantage of Australia"" he said.









In the regions over 6000 farmers have expressed concern at the amount of pressure the government is putting on the agriculture industry to draw down emissions through offsetting.





""Rural and regional Australia are already being impacted by climate change. If we don’t act now farmers’ ability to continue feeding our nation and the world will be in question"" said the Farmers for Climate Action CEO Fiona Davis.





""We know the most important action to tackle climate change is to keep fossil fuels in the ground ... instead [the modelling] seems to be operating on a wing and a prayer that we'll figure it all out sometime in the future.""





Climate Council's Tim Baxter said the modelling ""may as well have been written in crayon"".





""This modelling doesn’t even consider climate impacts on our economy. It assumes a heroic performance from the federal government’s pet technologies without interrogating a single one of these wild assumptions. It downplays the potential of all other alternatives at every opportunity"" he said.





""If this wasn’t so serious it would be laughable"" he said.





Greenpeace Australia said the modelling relies on offsetting leaving the government accountable for only 29 per cent of total emissions.







“The report is comically flawed and isn’t worth the six million dollars of paper it's written on. Scott Morrison has tried to hide his failure but the lack of a credible plan is there for all to see” Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s Dr Nikola Casule said.



Australian National University professor Frank Jotzo told SBS News the assumptions need to be questioned.







“The report assumes an extremely low marginal cost of carbon rising to just $24 per tonne in 2050.







“The report also posits that any emissions reductions achieved are voluntary. These assumptions are clearly motivated by political considerations namely the legacy of the Coalition’s strong political rejection of carbon pricing.”







Professor Jotzo also criticised the Morrison government's timing to release the report saying ""it seems designed to minimise scrutiny"" on the final day of COP26.







""The government’s net zero ‘plan’ document was released two weeks ago and selectively quoted the modelling report but the modelling was withheld until the Friday afternoon of the end of the COP conference.







""There was no apparent consultation with key stakeholders or experts during the preparation of the modelling.""







Labor leader Anthony Albanese also weighed in telling reporters on Saturday that Prime Minister Scott Morrison has ""no plan or no vision for Australia's long-term future"".







""The fact is that this government can't be trusted on climate change.""







Greens MP Adam Bandt has called the modelling a “recipe for climate collapse” warning increased natural disasters to come as a result of the government’s plan “built on more coal and gas”.



The modelling anticipates Australia's major export markets to increase in value by 2050 and foreshadows the creation of more than 100000 jobs including up to 62000 in mining and heavy industries.







But it has also forecast a global temperature warming of 2C as opposed to the 1.5C that Australia had committed to under the Paris Agreement.





This has triggered criticisms from the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) who warns the Great Barrier Reef will be lost at a 2C temperature increase putting the ecosystem and 64000 jobs at risk.







“We know that 1.5C of warming is the threshold for coral reefs around the world. For Australia to want to delete a key reference to this is astounding” AMCS Great Barrier Reef campaign manager Dr Lissa Schindler said.

Most reversal reactions in PB patients (58/67; 87%) are observed within the first 2 years after discontinuing MDT. In contrast to this most of registered relapses (27/34; 79%) are observed more than 2 years after discontinuing MDT [13]. The recent symptoms of this patient were not considered to be a reversal reaction although MDT was administered eight years prior when facial numbness appeared as a symptom of the first leprosy relapse.

Various immunological tests may be useful for monitoring patients on chemotherapy as well as for confirming suspected cases of relapse [4]. The MPLA test using the Serodia leprae kit [6 7] and dipstick assay [14] both for detection of anti-PGL-I IgM antibodies have been used as a tool for classification of patients and for identification of those patients who have an increased risk of relapse. As a relatively new serological leprosy test NDO-LID [15 16] which is for both anti-PGL-I IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies specific to LID-1 (a synthetic mimetic conjugated to the recombinant fusion protein product of the M. leprae genes ML0405 and ML2331) detected larger proportions of multibacillary and paucibacillary leprosy than the alternative the Standard Diagnostics leprosy test for anti-PGL-I IgM antibodies (87.0% versus 81.7% and 32.3% versus 6.5% respectively). In paucibacillary leprosy the seropositivity rates of these tests were not very high at most approximately 43% by the MPLA test during multidrug therapy [7].

When anti-PGL-I IgM antibody levels were examined in either treated or untreated Japanese leprosy patients by ELISA it was found that only 19.5% of paucibacillary patients showed positive values [8]. The seropositivity rate for anti-major membrane protein(MMP)-II IgG antibodies in the same sera was 39.0% which was significantly higher than that for anti-PGL-I antibodies [8]. At the time of relapse the present patient’s serum tested negative with Serodia leprae which indicated that the patient did not have detectable anti-PGL-I antibodies. Therefore we performed an ELISA for the detection of anti-MMP-II IgG antibodies. However the optical density value was also lower than the cut-off value indicating that the patient tested negative also for anti-MMP-II antibodies.

We then stimulated PBMCs from the patient with MMP-II [17] of Mycobacterium leprae in this occasion by the same method described above and the test did not induce effective cytokine production so we evaluated the production of several cytokines after the stimulation with the M. leprae soluble fraction MLS [10].

In a study in leprosy endemic regions cytokine multiplex analysis demonstrated significant antigen-specific production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the relapsed multibacillary patients with extremely low IL-10 production which resulted in a high TNF/IL-10 ratio [18]. In this PB individual the TNF/IL-10 ratio was rather high upon stimulation with MLS at 6 months after relapse compared with the value obtained with no stimulus. Upon stimulation with MLS just before treatment if the IL-10 level was calculated although the value was actually lower than the standard range and not detected the TNF/IL-10 and IFN-γ/IL-10 ratios would be higher than those at six months after relapse. In response to M. leprae exposure the high TNF/IL-10 ratios in tuberculoid patients and the low TNF/IL-10 ratios in household contacts after BCG vaccination are explained to be demonstrating the ways in which IL-10-mediated immunosuppression may act to protect the host from the immunopathological consequences generally associated with the excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines [19].

Since both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines play a role in protection from and pathogenesis of mycobacterial diseases in this respect their balance i.e. the IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio has been described to correlate with potential disease development or response to treatment of tuberculosis or leprosy [20]. In this patient the IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio was high upon relapse even without the stimulation with MLS and decreased in the culture supernatant after treatment. Additionally in the serum this ratio was higher at the relapse than one year before the relapse occurred.

Regarding the elevation in IL-6 levels due to stimulation with both MLS and PHA this phenomenon is considered to be not related to the leprosy relapse. The elevation in IL-10 levels due to stimulation with MLS was not obvious compared with that with stimulation with PHA.

A study found an association of the Th17 response with the PB forms of leprosy [21]. In leprosy reactions an increase in Th17-associated cytokine levels in the supernatant of antigen stimulated PBMC cultures has been reported [22]. Although the Th17-associated cytokines of this case were not examined in the culture supernatant the level of IL-17A in the serum at relapse was examined and its value was significantly elevated compared with the value one year before even at very low concentrations.

According to the present study when relapse is suspected in a cured PB leprosy cytokines such as IFN-γ TNF and the IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio can be considered to be important markers in the analysis of PBMC culture supernatants. If we could accumulate additional data from the relapsed cases we might be able to make more reliable diagnoses by referring to the levels of these cytokines or the ratio of cytokines. Using the CBA Enhanced Sensitivity Flex Set system small amounts of IFN-γ TNF and IL-10 in the serum were detected more accurately [23 24]. Comparing the serum cytokine levels with this system before and after the occurrence of relapse may also be helpful for diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But there wasn’t too much hype surrounding Berkshire’s $7.6 billion purchase in Q3 — and for a good reason: The company was buying back its own shares.

Buybacks are a common way for companies to return capital to shareholders.

By repurchasing its shares Berkshire reduced the number of shares outstanding giving each remaining shareholder a larger stake of the company.

It’s not the first time that Buffett has bought back stock this year. Berkshire repurchased $6.6 billion of its shares in Q1 followed by another $6 billion worth of buybacks in Q2.

But Berkshire isn't alone. Here’s a look at three other companies that are returning billions of dollars of cash to investors through buybacks — one of them might be worth buying with some of your leftover pennies.

Meta Platforms (FB)

Facebook rebranded to Meta on Oct. 28 to reflect its vision “to help bring the metaverse to life.” The company has many endeavors beyond social media including virtual and augmented reality headsets and smart glasses.

That said Facebook remains the largest business at Meta. The app’s monthly active users grew 6% year-over-year to 2.91 billion as of Sept. 30. Factoring in Meta’s other platforms — namely Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp — the number of active users on at least one product totaled 3.58 billion.

Meta’s financials have grown faster than its user base. In Q3 revenue increased 35% from a year age to $29 billion while diluted earnings per share rose 19% to $3.22.

The company has returned a lot of cash to investors — and will continue to do so. Meta bought back $14.4 billion of its own stock in Q3 and increased its share repurchase authorization by $50 billion.

After a 23% climb this year FB shares trade at a pricey $331 apiece. If that’s too steep you can use a popular investing app to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.

Bank of America (BAC)

While many businesses fear rising interest rates banks love them. So it's no surprise that in today's environment well-capitalized banks aren't exactly shy about returning cash to shareholders.

Just take a look at financial giant Bank of America which bought back a whopping $9.9 billion of its common stock in Q3.

The buyback was part of the bank’s $25 billion share repurchase program announced in April. Last month the board renewed the $25 billion buyback plan replacing the previous program.

Bank of America also returns cash to investors through quarterly dividend payments. In June the company raised its quarterly payout by 17% to 21 cents per share.

Story continues

At the current share price the bank yields 1.8%.

Apple (AAPL)

Any discussion of buybacks in today’s market wouldn’t be complete without mentioning tech gorilla Apple.

The reason is simple: Among all of the stocks trading in the U.S. stock market Apple has been spending more on buybacks than any other company.

In Apple’s fiscal Q4 share repurchases totaled nearly $20 billion. In 2021 the company bought back $85.5 billion worth of stock.

It’s easy to see why: Apple is one of the largest companies in the world commanding over $2.4 trillion of market cap. It also has a huge pile of cash — $191.8 billion the last time it reported.

CFO Luca Maestri recently said that the company continues to make progress toward its goal of “reaching a net cash neutral position over time.” So more buybacks are likely on the way.

Apple has enjoyed a rally with its stock price doubling since the beginning of 2020. If you’re on the fence about jumping in at elevated levels some apps may give you a free share of Apple just for signing up.

Buybacks or Banksy?

Owning a piece of a company that’s buying back its shares sounds very enticing but don’t forget that stocks — even the best ones — are volatile.

If you want to invest in something that has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market consider a real but overlooked asset like fine art.

Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years according to the Citi Global Art Market chart.

Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultrarich.

But with a new investing platform you can invest in iconic artworks too just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do.

There was “one huge catch” as Munger an amateur architect put it: no windows.

“Our design is clever” Munger assured skeptics. “Our buildings are going to be efficient.” In addition to cutting costs and foiling potential defenestrations his design would force students out of their sleeping cubbies and into communal spaces—with real sunlight—where he said they would engage with one another.

Last month Munger’s plan was formally accepted by U.C.S.B. without apparent alteration: a nearly two-million-square-foot structure eleven stories tall that will house around forty-five hundred students in a hive of tiny bedrooms—the vast majority of which will indeed be windowless. Instead of the real thing there will be Disney-inspired fake windows of which Munger said in an interview with Architectural Record “We will give the students knobs and they can have whatever light they want. Real windows don’t do that.” A consulting architect named Dennis McFadden subsequently announced his resignation from U.C.S.B.’s design-review committee. In a letter which was later leaked he wrote that “Charlie’s Vision” was “unsupportable from my perspective as an architect a parent and a human being.”

McFadden called Munger’s U.C.S.B. building a “social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves.” Having no natural light was a problem. So were stale air and tight spaces. McFadden noted that the structure had just two main exits and would qualify “as the eighth densest neighborhood in the world falling just short of a portion of Dhaka Bangladesh.” Nearly all of Yale’s undergrad population could fit inside.

Munger who is now ninety-seven years old and lives in a house in Los Angeles with plenty of windows was unfazed by McFadden’s critique. “When an ignorant man leaves I regard it as a plus not a minus” Munger said. In Architectural Record he called McFadden an “idiot” who did not “look at the building intelligently.” McFadden countered “I understand the plans well and in detail.” He added that a famous architect had e-mailed him “about the horrors of the project and asked what he could do to help.” Munger had said that he expected the concrete structure inspired by a Le Corbusier building in Marseille to “last as long as the pyramids.”

Dormzilla as the building has been nicknamed by the local papers is not Munger’s first windowless lodging. A few years ago he donated a hundred and ten million dollars to the University of Michigan his alma mater to build the Munger Graduate Residences which opened in 2015. McFadden decried the “unknown impact” of windowless living on students but thousands of students in Michigan have already been guinea pigs for several years.

Matthew Moreno a computer scientist joined his partner in the Munger Graduate Residences last March. It seemed nice at first. There were slate floors and fancy fixtures. The basement had massage chairs along with a movie theatre that didn’t seem to play movies. A rooftop garden offered views of Ann Arbor but when it rained water ran straight into two stairwells. Moreno said “There was abundant seepage along with tons of dead crickets.”

“He moved in during the pandemic and now he won’t move out.” Cartoon by Victoria Roberts Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop

There were other technical problems: Errant fire alarms went off constantly. A trash-chute malfunction resulted in someone getting bombarded by falling waste. Moreno described poor ventilation and even poorer sleep. “Lots of talk of sunlamps and melatonin” he said.

Some residents adapted. Wilson Chen a former pharmacy student said “The windows thing was a big bummer but after a year I kind of got used to it. It got super dark.” A few rooms had a single real window but Chen said “you had to submit like a waiver stating your need for a window.”

Eventually Moreno moved from his sleeping cubby into his suite’s communal area. (In another such area he’d once watched a scantily clad fellow-resident train for a triathlon on a stationary bicycle set up over a tarp to catch his sweat as students played beer pong around him.)

After Moreno moved out he tweeted a message to Munger. “If you think you can make people make friends with randos just because u didn’t put a window in their bedroom” he wrote “u are wrong my man.”

Chen during four years without windows never thought to question the philosophical underpinning of the design. “There was a window theory?” he said of Munger’s notion. “Everyone I knew just kept to themselves.” ♦

The best way to be more successful today? Don’t be just a real estate professional. This seemingly contrary marketing advice was the overarching lesson shared in two technology sessions at the 2021 REALTORS® Conference & Expo in San Diego on Friday.

In his “Dominate Digital Marketing” session Kevin Tengan vice president of marketing with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Verani Realty reminded the audience that there are two types of marketing:

Marketing to sell when you advertise your products or services. Marketing to brand when you share how your services or products can make people feel.

Real estate professionals tend to focus on and excel at marketing to sell. There are dozens of companies and services that help practitioners advertise their listings purchase branded swag and mail Just Sold flyers. The more difficult task of brand marketing however cannot usually be delegated to a third party. It’s a personal message that must typically be developed and delivered by the practitioner themselves.

In her session “Designing a Mobile-First Business Profile to Scale Your Real Estate Business” Jordan Cain vice president of customer experience at Adwerx put it another way. “You can automate marketing that says ‘I just listed this’ or ‘I just sold this.’” But if you want to share a story or tell who you are Cain said that will require a more strategic and thoughtful content strategy.

In their sessions Tengan and Cain offered ideas for agents to master both types of marketing.

Marketing to Sell: Go Back to Basics

Deploy face-forward marketing. Humans are evolutionarily designed to pay attention to another face said Cain. That’s why even in the midst of a cluttered landscape on social media advertisements with faces tend to pay off. Cain said ads with a face and contact information are 11 times more effective than those without.

Tengan agreed saying that his brokerage “receives at least half a dozen leads a day” from Google’s Local Services ads which appear in the results after someone searches for a real estate professional in their market area. The ads include the agent’s head shot and a direct way to contact their business.

One important caveat: “Put your ‘today face’ in advertising” said Cain referencing the well-known trend for real estate professionals to use decades-old head shots. By using a face that will be recognizable to your target audience when they meet you in person you can begin building trust at the first meeting.

Market to your own network. “Think about how much business you generate with a once-a-year gift or regular mailers” to your sphere of influence said Cain. “Now think about what it would look like if they saw you 1000 times a year” due to targeted digital advertising campaigns. Cain said that customer relationship advertising can lead to a 15% increase in production for agents. Importantly that boost won’t come from repeat business but from referrals. “Advertising won’t make anyone sell faster” said Cain. The increase in production occurs because your contacts are more likely to remember you and refer you when they are consistently reminded of your profession and success.

Show up on mobile. More than 50% of global web traffic is now on mobile devices and the average adult spends about 7 hours a day on them said Cain. This means that agents can’t afford to overlook the mobile experience for their prospects and clients. Whether they focus on creating a mobile-optimized brand website or advertising on mobile-first apps like Facebook the investment will pay off.

Marketing to Brand: Go Deeper and Get More Personal

Limit buttons and forms. One key to building more trust in your brand is to prioritize a connection over data collection. This is especially critical on mobile where a form can take up the entire screen. “Think about how you behave on a phone” said Cain. “Do any of you want to fill out a form the moment you arrive on a page? No you don’t.” Instead “Make sure your brand ... your humanity some form of connection” are prioritized above a form or another call to action.

Make stronger online connections. While part of marketing to brand is putting out thoughtful and meaningful content another important component is to live up to your reputation. One way to do that said Tengan is to go beyond “likes'' to truly engage with others online. By regularly commenting on posts answering questions and showing support you’ll create stronger bonds and the trust you need to grow your business reputation.

Be the digital mayor. The overall goal of marketing to brand said Tengan is to “become the digital mayor of the community you represent.” Share information that will be relevant to your community including local events small business highlights school supply drives park updates and more. By acting as the information hub said Tengan you’ll not just be selling homes but a lifestyle too.

Mastering Both Kinds of Marketing

“As practitioners we need to both market to sell and market to brand” said Tengan. By doing so pros show that they care more about consumer experiences and outcomes than they do about transaction volume and commissions. “We’re not just in the real estate selling business. We’re in the relationship business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2hhdC1jYW4teW91LWxlYXJuLWZyb20tYS1jcnlwdG8tdHJhZGluZy1oYW1zdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Can You Learn From a Crypto-Trading Hamster?,"Trading cryptocurrencies is the latest popular investing fad and a German hamster named Mr. Goxx has jumped on the bandwagon along with millions of others.

The hamster's human business partner made an initial investment of just over $300 euros and the hamster runs around an ""intention wheel"" to select a particular coin. Next the hamster runs through either a buy tunnel or through a sell tunnel. Each time the hamster does this his human partner either buys or sells $20 worth of the chosen cryptocurrency.

The hamster's buy and sell orders have been posted on both Reddit and Twitch and his performance is fairly impressive. As of late September Mr. Goxx had earned around a 20% return on his initial investment since June -- beating both the S&P 500 as well as the performance of Warren Buffett's flagship Berkshire Hathaway fund.

So the big question is what can other investors learn from Mr Goxx -- because surprisingly there's a lesson to be had in the hamster's stellar performance.

Here's what the hamster's success means for investors

After reading about Mr. Goxx's stellar performance you may be tempted to think that anyone can make money from investing in cryptocurrency. After all if a hamster can do it humans can too right?

The reality however is that the actual lesson to learn here is that anyone -- including a hamster -- can get lucky for a period of time. That's especially true if a class of assets tends to be on the upswing because it's new popular among celebrities and on social media and is generating a lot of excitement.

But earning good returns for a short period of time cannot and should not be confused for investing prowess and you can't necessarily assume that earning a good return for a limited period means that you're going to end up making money forever.

It's often very easy for investors who start putting their money into a market at an opportune time to feel like they can't possibly lose or to get over confident. Making them think they've developed an investing strategy that can beat the experts and beat the market. But the reality is while sometimes that's the case (for those with a sound investment thesis) in other situations it's really just a whole lot of luck that's accounting for their returns.

The hamster isn't researching cryptocurrencies to determine which have solid long-term potential based on whether they solve real-world problems and whether their business model can be replicated. Yet he's still been able to beat some of the greatest investors of all time over a short time period. The odds of this continuing indefinitely are slim to none and that's the case for anyone who doesn't have a solid investing plan -- even if they get lucky in the short term.

So if you're investing and making money now -- especially with speculative cryptocurrency investments -- don't assume it's because you've necessarily cracked the code to beat the market. Instead focus on learning about the fundamentals and following sound investing principles including building a diversified portfolio with a mix of well-researched assets.

If you do that your portfolio is all-but-guaranteed to do a whole lot better than the crypto-trading hamster's investments over the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90aGVzZS1hcmUtdGhlLW5leHQtdGhyZWUtbWVnYS1jYXAtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MteW91bGwtYmUtaGVhcmluZy1tb3JlLWFib3V0LTExNjM2MzkyMDgz0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS90aGVzZS1hcmUtdGhlLW5leHQtdGhyZWUtbWVnYS1jYXAtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MteW91bGwtYmUtaGVhcmluZy1tb3JlLWFib3V0LTExNjM2MzkyMDgz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These are the next three mega-cap tech stocks you'll be hearing more about,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-are-the-next-three-mega-cap-tech-stocks-youll-be-hearing-more-about-11636392083 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90aGVzZS1hcmUtdGhlLW5leHQtdGhyZWUtbWVnYS1jYXAtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MteW91bGwtYmUtaGVhcmluZy1tb3JlLWFib3V0LTExNjM2MzkyMDgz0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS90aGVzZS1hcmUtdGhlLW5leHQtdGhyZWUtbWVnYS1jYXAtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MteW91bGwtYmUtaGVhcmluZy1tb3JlLWFib3V0LTExNjM2MzkyMDgz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The technology and appliance store has launched its holiday sales event.

Here are tips on how to make the most of Best Buy’s Black Friday deals.

What are Best Buy’s Black Friday 2021 store hours?

We’re back to being able to enjoy that extended nap following the Thanksgiving feast. Best Buy will be closed on Thanksgiving Day. Of course online shopping is always an option.

The company has not yet announced extended shopping hours for the holiday season.

What are Best Buy’s Black Friday 2021 deals?

Best Buy launched its first wave of Black Friday deals on Oct. 19 and promises to have deals available multiple times throughout the season. So far the retailer is not tipping its hand on closer-to-the-real-day discounts which will start Nov. 19. But there is a hack for that which we will tell you about shortly.

Here are some Black Friday deals we’ve found so far:

You’ll also find up to $540 off Samsung appliances but with inventory being tight these days — you may want to check in-stock selection before you start measuring your old fridge for a replacement. And that’s the challenge this year: You might find that your best deal is missing from the floor of a nearby store.

Let’s get to that.

How to save money at Best Buy

With inventories being what they are (skinny) retailers seem to be playing it safe with discounts. We’re not seeing the get-there-early and rush-the-doors kind of deals this year. But shopping early is still a good idea in these days of short supply.

Best Buy is taking the risk out of some early purchases. Look for items labeled “Black Friday Price Guarantee.” If Best Buy drops the price on those before Nov. 26 it will automatically refund the difference to members of its My Best Buy and Best Buy Totaltech programs.

“No need to email or show us your receipt” the company says.

The My Best Buy program has a free membership level but if you’re not a member you can still be reimbursed the difference under Best Buy’s price match guarantee. However that’s not automatically implemented so you’ll have to request it.

What were Best Buy’s Black Friday 2020 deals?

Best Buy can be a fun place to shop during the holidays. It’s one of the few remaining technology big box stores as TVs keep getting bigger and there’s always a new phone. Here’s what the buzz was at Best Buy last year:

A 70-inch Samsung 4K Smart TV for $529.99 ($220 savings).

Laptops starting at $119.99.

JBL Free True Wireless headphones for $59.99 ($90 savings).

Canon EOS RP Mirrorless Camera with RF 24-105mm lens with a free 12-inch tabletop ring light for $999.99 ($400 savings).

KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus Series stand mixer for $199 ($300 savings).

Lenovo Smart Clock with Google Assistant for $34.99 ($45 savings).

On the hunt for a bargain your eyes might have been drawn to the reduced price of refurbished tech but should you steer clear of these tempting offers or not?

Refurbished used and like-new devices may be less expensive than their out-of-the-box counterparts but they also come with a degree of uncertainty - is the item just a little scuffed or are we paying out for a plastic brick?

Thanks to our experience with buying tech secondhand we’re here to highlight why the refurbished tag shouldn’t immediately scare you away but also what you need to look out for when buying something used.

Old to them new to you

The reduced cost of refurbished tech is likely the biggest draw attracting those on the hunt for reasonable prices. Even outside of Black Friday you can typically find savings of around 10-20% on gadgets that might be only a few months old.

During Black Friday the deals will often get even sweeter as the sale prices on new products are carried over to their secondhand counterparts; with the refurbished discount being added on top you can potentially save a significant amount compared with the device’s usual RRP.

We’ve had success buying second-hand games consoles webcams smartphones and more - all of it at a much lower price than we would have otherwise paid. We further compounded the savings by trading in our own old tech at the same time sometimes paying nothing to get our hands on the device we were after.

Savings aren’t the only draw though with another driving force being that secondhand purchases reduce electronic waste.

Following the recent COP26 conference climate change its effects and what we can do to prevent the situation from worsening have been on the minds of citizens across the globe. One way we can do our bit is by buying up older but usable tech rather than sending it to landfill.

Recent efforts are only starting to make electronic waste easier to recycle - the UK’s Royal Mint unveiled its high-tech solution very recently - so for now we need to find other ways of keeping our old technology out of the trash and using it for as long as we can.

While this won’t convince as many people to buy used as the discounts available the feeling that you’re doing the right thing is an added benefit that you won’t get from buying new.

One person’s trash is another person’s... trash

Before you head straight for the secondhand sites you need to be careful though as not all refurbished and used items are equal. Like all things tech components will get worn out with use and if you aren’t careful you could end up buying a gadget that’s more worn down than its age might have you believe.

With any piece of secondhand kit you expect the odd scuff or scrape on the outer shell - but it’s the internal components (the ones you can’t see) that you need to worry about.

If you’re looking to save more over and above the best Black Friday OLED TV deals that are out there then a refurbished offering can seem like a good bet - especially given how expensive these screens can be.

Unfortunately we’d recommend you steer clear of second-hand OLEDs unless you can see them in action or they’re from a retailer with quality guarantees. That's because OLED screens can be damaged by an effect called burn-in - where an image has been on display for too long and becomes permanently branded into the screen.

Manufacturers say that - especially with newer OLED screens - burn-in is much less of a concern than it used to be and isn’t something that the average user should worry about. However it’s the kind of damage that might make someone else want to abandon their TV and get a new one - potentially leaving the damaged tech with whichever sucker buys it off them.

Customers after a high-end PC that takes advantage of Black Friday gaming laptop deals should be on the lookout too. Cryptocurrency mining has become massive these past few years causing most of the best components to be sold out almost instantly - laptops using GPUs like the RTX 3080 and equally powerful processors have also been snatched up quickly.

Mining is an intensive process that puts strain on these components though and eventually they’ll be too worn out to function properly. At this point a shady character might decide to sell them on as ‘used’ offering them up for a very reasonable price online; in actuality you're paying $500 for the equivalent of a pet rock.

How 'new' is that new GPU? (Image credit: Future)

Because of these fears we’d recommend steering clear of sites like Facebook Marketplace or eBay unless you are certain there are sufficient buyer protections and the seller is reliable. Also be sure to read the item description’s fine print - you don’t want to be sold a printed-out image rather than the real deal.

Instead we’d recommend buying from sites that offer a warranty on the refurbished items. In the US that’s stores like Best Buy Walmart and the device’s original manufacturer. If you’re in the UK you can also turn to the original manufacturers as well as the store CEX. Amazon also offers refurbished and used items but they aren’t always from Amazon-certified sellers so be sure you understand all the terms before you check out.

Beyond that our recommendation would be to make sure you’re actually paying less when buying secondhand.

Sometimes you’ll find secondhand items are actually more expensive than if you’d bought the item new and that's especially likely during Black Friday as some vendors may offer savings that beat out the savings from buying used.

Sought-after gadgets like the PS5 and Xbox Series X may also be sold at a premium second hand so it’s always worth double-checking the price against what you can find elsewhere - ur Black Friday guides are a great place to start if you want to compare prices you see online.

If Black Friday — the biggest shopping day of the year — is no longer the day after Thanksgiving is it still considered Black Friday? This year instead of one-day doorbuster deals the discounts are rolling out well before Thanksgiving week spurred by a number of challenges including supply chain setbacks and a labor crunch. These obstacles which are slowing the delivery of everything from consumer staples to hot holiday toys will only get worse before they get better according to Moody's Analytics economist Tim Uy. With limited inventory in stores and longer shipping times consumers are more motivated to kick start their holiday shopping as early as they can. If you can't afford to wait you can still get the some of the best prices of the season. Here's how:

FVBhuHER2-transgenic mice [19] obtained from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco CA USA) were bred in our animal facility and genetically screened as previously reported [20]. BALB/c Rag2-/-;Il2Rg-/- mice [21] were used as an immunodeficient model that lacked B T and NK immune components. Non-transgenic FVB female mice (FVB/NCrl) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Calco Como Italy). Blinding to assess the outcome of in vivo experiments was not done. For drug treatments animals from each litter were allocated random to the different treatments. Five mice were enrolled in each test group in order to have an 80% chance of showing with a 5% significance a 65% of success in the experimental group.

All animal procedures were performed in accordance with European directive 2010/63/UE and Italian Law (DL26/2014); experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (“Comitato per il Benessere Animale”) of the University of Bologna and by the Italian Ministry of Health with letter 688/2015.

Cell lines

MamBo cell lines were established from mammary tumors of FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice. Tumors were minced and set in culture with an appropriate medium as previously described [22]. Cell lines were stabilized and cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific Monza Italy) that was supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS Thermo Fisher Scientific) 30 µg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Corning Life Sciences Glendale AZ USA) and 0.5% v/v MITO Serum Extender (Corning). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humified 5% CO 2 atmosphere.

Tumorigenicity and metastatic ability of MamBo cell lines

To evaluate the tumorigenicity of the MamBo cell lines FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (12–20-week-old) received the injection of 106 cells into the mammary fat pad (m.f.p.) (MamBo89HER2stable cell line n = 8 MamBo43HER2labile cell line n = 3 MamBo38HER2loss cell line n = 5). Animals were inspected weekly to follow tumor development which was measured with a caliper. Tumor volume was calculated as π/12*(√ab)3 where a = maximal tumor diameter and b=maximal tumor diameter perpendicular to a. Mice were sacrificed before tumors reached 2.5 cm3 or 10% of mouse weight. At necropsy tumors were harvested and disaggregated with trypsin-0.05% EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for cytofluorimetric analysis.

Experimental metastatic potential was assessed in FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (8–17-week-old) via the injection of 105 cells into a caudal vein (n = 5). The general health status of the mice was checked weekly and the mice were either euthanized as previously described either at any sign of lung metastasis or 18 weeks after cell injection. Lungs were stained with ink fixed in Fekete’s solution and metastases were counted under a stereoscope.

To evaluate the dose-dependent tumor growth of MamBo43HER2labile cells in immunocompetent mice different doses of cells (106 107 and 2 × 107) were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into FVBhuHER2 virgin female 11-week-old mice. MamBo43HER2labile cells (105 cells) were also s.c. injected into Rag2-/-;Il2Rg-/- immunodeficient female 8-week-old mice (n = 3) compared to FVBhuHER2 virgin female 14-week-old mice (n = 3) to inspect the contribution of adaptive immunity to HER2 loss.

Cytofluorimetric analysis

Harvested cells and tumor samples which had previously been dissociated to yield single-cell suspensions were analyzed by immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis as previously described [22]. The antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence included: rat anti-mouse CD16-CD32 antibody Fc block (clone 2.4G2; diluted 1:100; BD Pharmingen CA USA); mouse anti-human HER2 (MGR2 diluted 1:100 Alexis Biochemical Enzo Life Sciences Lansen Swisse) and also kindly provided by Dr. Elda Tagliabue (IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori Milan Italy); rat anti-mouse CD140b (PDGFR-B) (APB5 diluted 1:100; BioLegend CA USA). Anti-mouse IgGAF488 (diluted 1:100; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anti-rat IgGFITC (diluted 1:40; KPL) were used as secondary antibodies. Direct immunofluorescence made use of: anti-human HER2PE (clone Neu 24.7 diluted 1:20 BD Pharmigen); anti-mouse CD24AF488 (clone M1/69; diluted 1:10; BioLegend); anti-mouse-CD44PE (clone IM7; diluted 1:10 BioLegend); anti-mouse Sca1PE (clone E13-161.7 1:100 dilution; BioLegend); and anti-mouse CD29PE (clone HMβ1-1; diluted 1:10; BioLegend). Data were acquired using CyFlow Space (Sysmex Partec Germany) and analyzed using FCSExpress (De Novo Software Glendale CA USA).

Mammosphere formation assay

The ability of MamBo cell lines to form mammospheres in vitro was assessed using the MammoCult Human Medium Kit (STEMCELL Technologies Vancouver Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (n = 4). Briefly 4 × 104 cells were seeded in 4 ml complete MammoCult medium without serum in 6 well UltraLow Adherence plates. Mammospheres that were bigger than 60 µm were counted on day 7. The same protocol was employed to evaluate the ability of MamBo38HER2loss to form mammospheres in a medium that contained sunitinib 5 µM (vehicle and sunitinib n = 4; two tests with untreated cells were also run in parallel).

Induction of HER2 loss in vitro and in vivo and trastuzumab treatment

MamBo43HER2labile cells were kept in culture with trastuzumab (Herceptin Roche) 120 h to evaluate the short-term growth inhibition and level of HER2 expression. A long-term culture 2 months was performed in the presence of 30 μg/ml trastuzumab. Cells were counted weekly and seeded at a concentration of either 1.6 × 105 cells/cm2 (high density also referred to as MamBo43HER2labile TRT cells) or 4 × 104 cells/cm2 (low density). In parallel cells were harvested for molecular analysis cytofluorimetric analysis of HER2 and stemness-marker expression. A third culture without trastuzumab was performed by seeding MamBo43HER2labile cells at a lower density (104 cells/cm2). Cells were split and harvested for cytofluorimetric analysis twice a week.

MamBo43HER2labile cells (106 cells) were s.c. injected into FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (13–16-week-old) that were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either saline (vehicle n = 5) or trastuzumab 4 mg/kg twice a week starting from day 3 after cell injection (n = 5 a censored mouse at 2 weeks from cell injection was not included in tumor growth analysis).

Sensitivity to demethylating agent

MamBo38HER2loss cells were seeded at 8 × 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h of seeding cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO 0.02%) 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Merck Life Science Milano Italy) 0.5 μM or 5 μM. Treatment was renewed after 72 h. Cells were harvested after 48 72 and 144 h of treatment (from the first treatment) and counted. HER2 expression was determined by cytofluorimetric analysis.

Sensitivity to sunitinib in vitro and in vivo

Sensitivity to sunitinib (sunitinib malate LC Laboratories MA USA) was determined using the WST-1 reagent (Merck) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on MamBo38HER2loss cells seeded at 3.125 × 103 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates (Corning Life Sciences) and treated with sunitinib 0.1 0.5 1 5 and 10 µM. Drug sensitivity was evaluated 72 h after treatment.

Sunitinib sensitivity in MamBo38HER2loss cells (0.5 × 103 cells/cm2) was also evaluated under 3D non-adherent conditions as previously described [22]. Colonies were counted after 14 days.

The migratory ability of MamBo38HER2loss cells in the presence of sunitinib was evaluated in a wound-healing test. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates in complete medium and allowed to sit until confluence. The cell monolayer was scratched with a pipette tip 200 μl the medium was changed with or without sunitinib 5 µM and wound width was measured at times 0 and 24 h after scratching (untreated n = 8 vehicle n = 6 sunitinib 5 µM n = 8). Migratory ability was calculated as width (24 h)/width(t0)*100. FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (8–16-week-old) that harbored tumors that were induced by the s.c. injection of MamBo43HER2labile cells (106 cells) were treated daily with sunitinib 60 mg/kg per os by gavage starting from 3 days after cell injection (n = 5 a censored mouse at 1 week from cell injection was not included in tumor growth analysis). Animals in the vehicle group received Methylcellulose 0.5%+Tween80 0.4% (all from Merck) (n = 5). FVB virgin female 8-week-old mice that harbored tumors that were induced by the s.c. injection of MamBo38HER2loss cells (2.5 × 104 cells) were treated daily with sunitinib 60 mg/kg per os by gavage starting from 1 day after cell injection (n = 5). Animals in the vehicle group received Methylcellulose 0.5%+Tween80 0.4% (n = 5).

RNA-sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using Trizol Reagent (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq libraries were generated using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. High-throughput sequencing was carried out on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) using 75 nucleotides in single-end mode. Reads were analyzed on a SeqBox [23]. The generation of Demultiplexing (bcl2fastq Illumina tool version 2.17.1.14-2) counts using STAR (version 2.5) /RSEM (version 1.3.0) and differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 (version 1.14.1 adjusted P-value < 0.1 and |log2 fold change | ≥1) were all performed within the SeqBox framework [23]. Two distinct analyses were performed on differentially expressed genes. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the EnrichR web tool (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) and protein-protein interactions were detected using the STRING database (www.string-db.org).

In the HER2-positive vs HER2-negative comparison we also included samples from MamBo89HER2stable cells and MamBo38HER2loss cells that were treated long-term with trastuzumab for either 30 days (then w/o 30 days) or 60 days both maintaining the initial shape HER2 expression level and stemness profile of correspondent untreated cells. In detail the HER2-positive samples included MamBo89HER2stable parental cells trastuzumab-treated MamBo89HER2stable cells a HER2-positive MamBo89HER2stable clone and MamBo43HER2labile cells. HER2-negative samples included MamBo38HER2loss parental cells trastuzumab-treated MamBo38HER2loss cells and high density seeding MamBo43HER2labile trastuzumab-treated (TRT) cells (30 days then w/o 30 days or 60 days) having lost HER2 expression. The comparison of HER2 stable vs HER2 labile cells only included MamBo89HER2stable parental cell line and its HER2-positive clone and MamBo43HER2labile cells. For each sample were tested three replicates at least (except for MamBo38HER2loss trastuzumab-treated cells since the analysis included only two samples).

IL6 production

Supernatants were collected from cells that were seeded 8 × 104 cells/cm2 in medium that contained either sunitinib 5 µM (LC Laboratories MA USA) or DMSO 0.05% (here referred as vehicle) (Merck) or no drug. mIL6 production was analyzed using mouse IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems Minneapolis MN USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of each sample was calculated by interpolating values on a standard curve. A stable IL6 producer mouse mammary cancer cell line (TS/A-IL6) was used as positive control of IL6 production [24].

Real-Time PCR

RNA was extracted quantified and reverse transcribed as previously reported [25]. cDNA was amplified using Sso Advanced SyBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories CA USA) reagents. Reactions were performed in a Thermal Cycler CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Analyses were performed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 Software and relative quantification was calculated as ΔCt= Ct gene -Ct housekeeping . We used the following Bio-Rad assays: Cdh1 (qMmuCID0006332); Col3a1 (qMmuCID0006332); Col5a2 (qMmuCID0011413); Dsp (qMmuCID0019458); Fgfbp1 (qMmuCID0007813); Igfbp4 (qMmuCID0006155); Il1rn (qMmuCID0009153); Mmp2 (qMmuCID00021124); Ocln (qMmuCID0005446); Pdgfrb (qMmuCID0025167); Sparc (qMmuCID0023536); Vcan (qMmuCID0005235); Snai1 (qMmuCID0024342); Zeb1 (qMmuCID0009095); Zeb2 (qMmuCED0046769); Twist1 (qMmuCED0004065); and Ltbp1 (qMmuCED0045004). Custom HER2 primers were also used [26]. Mouse TBP ([27] or Bio-Rad assay qMmuCID0040542) was used as housekeeping gene.

DNA was extracted using a PureLink Genomic DNA Mini kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HER2 copy number was detected by Real-Time PCR using HER2 qHsaCEP0052301 assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and was normalized over human/mouse Ptger2 [28]. Amplification was performed using Sso Advanced Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The copy number of the human and murine cell lines was inferred by considering that MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 harbor 2 copies of HER2 in the genome. Human cell-line culture conditions have previously been reported [29].

Western blot analysis

Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed as reported previously [20]. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-HER2 (clone 3B5 diluted 1:1000 Calbiochem Merck) anti-pNeu (Tyr 1248) (diluted 1:1000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA) anti-Stat3 (clone 124H6 diluted 1:1000 Cell Signaling Danvers MA) anti-pStat3 (clone D3A7 diluted 1:2000 Cell Signaling) anti-Actin (diluted 1:1000 Merck). Membranes were either incubated with polyclonal horse-radish-peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (diluted 1:3000 Bio-Rad Laboratories) or anti-mouse IgG antibody (diluted 1:1000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein presence was detected by chemiluminescent reaction (Bio-Rad Laboratories) before film exposure.

Statistical analysis

Experimental in vitro conditions analyzed with statistical measures were repeated two times at least. The number of samples was reported in the Materials and Methods and/or in the Figure Legend. Statistical analyses were performed through Prism 5 software (GraphPad software La Jolla CA USA). The two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test or t test with Welch’s correction were performed according to assumptions of the tests and the variance between the compared groups. The used test was reported in Figure Legend. All values are depicted as the mean and SEM.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Prince Harry and Meghan the Duchess of Sussex are getting into the investment business. They are joining Ethic a fintech asset manager in the fast-growing environmental social and governance space as “impact partners” and investors. Ethic has $1.3 billion under management and creates separately managed accounts to invest in social responsibility themes.

The couple could attract more attention to sustainable investing. Harry and Meghan can make E.S.G. investing part of pop culture in a way that say BlackRock’s Larry Fink can’t. “From the world I come from you don’t talk about investing right?” Meghan told DealBook in a joint interview with Harry. “You don’t have the luxury to invest. That sounds so fancy.”

“My husband has been saying for years ‘Gosh don’t you wish there was a place where if your values were aligned like this you could put your money to that same sort of thing?’” Meghan said. They were introduced to Ethic by friends she said.

Harry and Meghan said they hoped that their involvement would help democratize investing making people — especially younger people — more deliberate in their choices and conscious of investing in sustainable companies. “You already have the younger generation voting with their dollars and their pounds you know all over the world when it comes to brands they select and choose from” Harry said suggesting it was a natural extension to do the same with investments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2EwODI5YjJhLWU1ZmItNGU2Yi1hOWMwLTE0MjUyOWMwYTU2ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Authentic Brands buys UK photography archive Iconic,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Blackstone Group Inc. says the recent surge of investor interest in sports and media businesses is only the beginning.

Bloomberg — Blackstone Group Inc. says the recent surge of investor interest in sports and media businesses is only the beginning.

The world’s largest private equity firm and its rivals are pouring billions of dollars into film television and music rights companies in a bid to profit from the growing popularity of the content they generate. Expect more sports deals for similar reasons said Global Head of Blackstone’s Tactical Opportunities Group David Blitzer who owns stakes in sports teams including Premier League soccer club Crystal Palace FC.

“You are also seeing institutional capital come into the sports business in a dramatic way” Blitzer said in a Bloomberg TV interview at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin. “My guess is that is going to continue unabated so I think there will be more and more institutional investment opportunities.”

Content consumption and creation was “one of the big themes” Blackstone was exploring said Blitzer. In recent months the firm has snapped up assets including Moonbug Entertainment Ltd. the firm behind the popular YouTube children’s channels Cocomelon and Blippi and Hello Sunshine the production company founded by actress Reese Witherspoon.

PUBLICIDAD

The investment opportunity in sports teams was based on the value of their media rights and the content associated with televised matches Blitzer said. This appeal coupled with the fact that there are only a finite amount of assets has seen investment firms invest heavily in teams in recent years.

“People have realized at their core that these are amazing businesses in terms of the creation content and the ultimate value of media rights” Blitzer said.

High profile deals have included Silver Lake’s acquisition of a stake in U.K. soccer club Manchester City and U.S. private-equity firm Arctos Sports Partners acquiring a minority stake in National Basketball Association team Golden State Warriors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd2hhdHN1cG5ld3AuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvZnJhc2VyLWFuZC1oYWFzLXRvLXBsYXktc2NvdHRpc2gtZmlkZGxlLWFuZC1jZWxsby1ub3YtMTktYXQtYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1yaXZlci10aGVhdHJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fraser and Haas to play Scottish fiddle and cello Nov. 19 at Blackstone River Theatre,"Blackstone River Theatre will present Scottish fiddle and cello masters Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas on Friday November 19 8:00 p.m. at Blackstone River Theatre 549 Broad St. Cumberland RI. Admission is $27.00 advance $32.00 day of show. For reservations or information call Blackstone River Theatre at (401) 725-9272.

The musical partnership between consummate performer Alasdair Fraser long regarded as Scotland’s premier fiddle ambassador and brilliant Californian cellist Natalie Haas spans the full spectrum between intimate chamber music and ecstatic dance energy. Over the last 20 years of creating a buzz at festivals and concert halls across the world they have truly set the standard for fiddle and cello in traditional music.

Fraser and Haas continue to thrill audiences internationally with their virtuosic playing their near-telepathic understanding and the joyful spontaneity and sheer physical presence of their music. Fraser has a concert and recording career spanning over 30 years with a long list of awards radio and television credits on top movie soundtracks (Last of the Mohicans Titanic and more). In 2011 he was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.

Haas a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music is one of the most sought after cellists in traditional music today. She has performed and recorded with a who’s who of the fiddle world including Mark O’Connor Natalie MacMaster Solas Altan Liz Carroll and Hanneke Cassel. This seemingly unlikely pairing is the fulfillment of a long-standing musical dream for Fraser whose cutting-edge musical explorations took him full circle to find a cellist who could help him return the cello to its historical role at the rhythmic heart of Scottish dance music. “Going back to the 1700s and as late as the early 20th century” Fraser says “fiddle and cello made up the dance band of choice in Scotland with the cellist bowing bass lines and driving the rhythm. Pianos and accordions elbowed out the cello relegating it to an orchestral setting.”

- New conversion lines to open at KF Aerospace in Canada and at Boeing's London Gatwick MRO in the United Kingdom

- Icelease orders eleven 737-800BCF; will be launch customer for new conversion line at London Gatwick MRO facility

- 737-800BCF now has more than 200 orders and commitments from 19 customers

DUBAI United Arab Emirates Nov. 14 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- As global demand for freighters continues to soar Boeing [NYSE: BA] today announced plans to add three conversion lines for the market-leading 737-800BCF across North America and Europe. The company also signed a firm order with Icelease for eleven of the freighters as the launch customer for one of the new conversion lines.

In 2022 the company will open one conversion line at Boeing's London Gatwick Maintenance Repair & Overhaul (MRO) facility its state-of-the-art hangar in the United Kingdom; and two conversion lines in 2023 at KF Aerospace MRO in Kelowna British Columbia Canada.

""Building a diverse and global network of conversion facilities is critical to supporting our customers' growth and meeting regional demand"" said Jens Steinhagen director of Boeing Converted Freighters. ""KF Aerospace and our Boeing teammates at London Gatwick have the infrastructure capabilities and expertise required to deliver market-leading Boeing Converted Freighters to our customers.""

""We're very excited to be expanding our relationship with Boeing"" said Gregg Evjen chief operating officer KF Aerospace. ""We've been working with the Boeing product line for more than 30 years. With our cargo conversion experience our highly skilled workforce and all the technical requirements already in place we're ready to get to work and help serve Boeing's customers.""

For Icelease which recently expanded its cooperation with Corrum Capital through a joint venture called Carolus Cargo Leasing the order for eleven 737-800BCF will be their first converted freighter order with Boeing. The lessor will be the launch customer for conversions at Boeing's London Gatwick MRO facility.

""We are confident in the quality and proven record of Boeing's 737-800 converted freighter and pleased to be the launch customer for their new London MRO facility"" said Magnus Stephensen senior partner at Icelease. ""We look forward to bringing the freighter in to our fleet to serve our growing global customer base operating domestic and short-haul routes.""

Earlier this year Boeing announced it would create additional 737-800BCF conversion capacity at several sites including a third conversion line at Guangzhou Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Company Limited (GAMECO) and two conversion lines in 2022 with a new supplier Cooperativa Autogestionaria de Servicios Aeroindustriales (COOPESA) in Costa Rica. Once the new lines become active Boeing will have conversion sites in North America Asia and Europe.

Boeing forecasts 1720 freighter conversions will be needed over the next 20 years to meet demand. Of those 1200 will be standard-body conversions with nearly 20% of that demand coming from European carriers and 30% coming from North America and Latin America.

An August MOU calling for the establishment of an African aviation hub appears likely to yield more supply business for Ethiopian Airlines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9kdWJhaS1haXJzaG93L2JvZWluZy1zdHVkaWVzLWxhcmdlci03NzctOC1iYXNlbGluZS03Nzd4ZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing Studies Larger 777-8 As Baseline For 777XF,"Boeing is close to defining the freighter version of the 777X after discussions with cargo airlines and is thought to be narrowing in on a configuration based on a revised 777-8 derivative.

Although there has been speculation Boeing might offer a 777XF sized between the 777-8 and the 777-9—in a similar move to the A350-950F launched by Airbus which sits between the A350-900 and -1000 versions—the manufacturer is believed to have refocused on a larger 777-8 passenger baseline. The move prompted by input from commercial carriers for more capacity on the 777-8 also appears to have produced an optimum size for a freighter.

“Until we launch the aircraft we don't formally pin down all the specifications” says Tom Sanderson director of product marketing 787 Product Development and Boeing’s Confident Travel Initiative. “The challenge with freighters is always you are balancing payload against volume. Higher density tends to be higher value and in long-haul cargo weight is favored in which case body length is less sensitive because you typically will hit the weight limit first.”

However Sanderson adds that the growth of the e-commerce market drives other considerations in which low-density freight is key. “In that case cargo volume is much more important and it tends to drive you higher. So we are absolutely in those discussions and somewhere between the two [is] I think … a reasonable assumption” he adds.

As currently defined the 777-8 is a shortened 229-ft.-long derivative of the 242-ft.-long 777-9. However with added body length on the 777-8 baseline and a higher maximum take-off weight (MTOW) than previously discussed numbers of 775000 lb. and 788000 lb. it is likely the 777XF will be offered with an even higher capacity that what had been expected. Cargo sources tell ShowNews a likely MTOW target is around 805000 lb. compared to 766800 lb. for the current 777-200LR-based 777F model.

Boeing meanwhile says that although flight control changes required by regulators for the 777-9 have yet to be installed and tested the manufacturer remains confident the extended 777-9 certification campaign will likely be completed just under two years from now—putting it on track for certification and first deliveries in the last quarter of 2023.

The approximate 44-month schedule from first flight of the 777-9 in January 2020 to projected type certification in around October 2023 compares to 10 months and 20 months to achieve the same milestones on the original 777 and 787 respectively.

Although the actual certification timing will depend on regulators “it speaks to the amount of time that we've had on this airplane to fly it and to be able to work out any of the issues that we have had and get them incorporated” says Mike Fleming senior vice president of the 737 MAX return to service Commercial Customer Support and Commercial Derivative Programs. “We were very deliberate back in the beginning of this year when we moved the schedule on the 777X to encompass the changes that we've seen in the regulatory environment and changes that we wanted to make onto the airplane as well.”

The four test aircraft have amassed more than 1700 flight hours out of what is expected to be a roughly 3500-hour total test campaign or in the same “ballpark” as the 777 and 787 programs says Fleming. “When we look at where we are right now we still believe that we'll be positioned to certify the airplane and to deliver to our customers in late 2023.”

Type inspection authorization (TIA) from the FAA—the moment from which flight tests will count as credit towards certification—has yet to be granted and Fleming says Boeing’s team is “busy working hard to get that level of documentation in place and in the regulator's hands so that we can move forward with our final inspection authorization.” ShowNews understands however that ground certification tests—which do not require TIA—are now underway on at least one of the four development aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9wcm9kdWN0LXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvc2hvd3N0b3BwZXItYm9laW5ncy1uZXctNzc3eC1qZXQtbWFrZXMtaXRzLXB1YmxpYy1kZWJ1dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Showstopper: Boeing’s New 777X Jet Makes Its Public Debut At Dubai Airshow,"It took Boeing eight years to develop its newest widebody passenger jet the 777X but just 15 hours to fly it from Seattle to the United Arab Emirates where the plane made its public debut at the Dubai Airshow on Sunday. First impressions? “Magnificent 777X is out to impress” one frontpage headline declared. “X-pectant” said another.The trip to Dubai was also the plane’s first international flight and its longest. Propelled by a pair of GE9X engines from GE Aviation the largest and most powerful commercial jet engine ever built the 777-8 version of that jet is designed to carry 384 passenger 8730 nautical miles or 16170 kilometers enough to fly nonstop from New York to Auckland  New Zealand. The larger 777-9 version which is on display in Dubai can take 426 passengers 7285 nautical miles or 13500 kilometers.The GE9X engine which GE Aviation started testing in 2017 is one of the plane’s innovations. The engine can supply 134000 pounds of thrust more than the rocket used in America’s first manned space flight.

GE made the engine’s front fan from 16 fourth-generation carbon-fiber composite fan blades. The material allowed engineers to stretch the fan’s diameter to a whopping 11 feet in diameter — as wide as the body of an entire Boeing 737. Every inch is important. By expanding the front fan on commercial engines around the core the designers were able to preserve the aircraft speed passengers expect and make the engine more efficient.The GE9X has a bypass ratio of more than 10:1 which means engine is sending 10 times more air around the core and through the fan than through the core.The engine also has parts made from advanced materials like lightweight and heat-resistant ceramic matrix composites  and components made by advanced manufacturing technologies like 3D printing The design helped the team to improve fuel efficiency of the GE9X and lower its carbon emissions by 10% compared to the GE90 the engine it replaced. This is a big deal given that fuel costs represent a large share of an airline’s operating expenses.But GE Aviation is providing the Boeing 777X with more than just raw horsepower. It also supplies Boeing with the plane’s common core system (CCS). A bit like an airplane’s central nervous system and brain the CCS hosts the airplane’s avionics such as computers data networks sensors and other electronics. One is the enhanced airborne flight recorder (EAFR) which keeps a log of flight crew audio parametric flight data and data link communications. GE’s EAFRs are already on thousands of military aircraft and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jets.GE Aviation has also worked closely with Boeing as the provider of the electrical load management system (ELMS) backup generator and backup converter for the Boeing 777X. The new power generation system produces twice the power generation of the current 777 system while the ELMS controls 30% more power.This article originally appeared on GE Reports."

Premature atrial contractions weren't caused by coffee consumption whereas premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were reported Gregory Marcus MD of the University of California San Francisco at the American Heart Association (AHA) virtual meeting.

PVCs were 54% more likely on coffee-drinking days (P=0.001) with more than a doubling in risk with one or more cups of joe (RR 2.20 95% CI 1.24-3.92 after adjustment for day of week). Those with genetics expected to yield the fastest caffeine metabolism showed the highest relative risk of PVCs with significant trends for both CYP12 and polygenic risk scores.

Atrial arrhythmias weren't elevated overall during periods randomized to allow coffee. Supraventricular tachycardia was actually reduced 12% per coffee drink compared with no coffee (P=0.028).

""Overall the acute yet everyday physiologic effects of coffee are complex"" Marcus said. ""These data add to the growing evidence that those with supraventricular tachycardias or atrial fibrillation...or at risk for those diseases should not necessarily avoid coffee.""

It's a common question in practice for which there hasn't been a clear answer to give patients as data have been conflicting noted AHA press conference study discussant Sana M. Al-Khatib MD MHS of Duke University Medical Center in Durham North Carolina.

However the relatively young normal body-weight population studied without prior arrhythmias is ""really not representative of the average patient that we see in clinical practice"" she cautioned.

Small numbers didn't allow for a good look at non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Given that limitation along with use of surrogate endpoints ""I think it's going to be critically important for future researchers to try to validate these results and look at harder endpoints during a longer follow-up of time"" Al-Khatib said.

Press conference moderator Elaine Hylek MD MPH of Boston University who introduced her comments with the caveat that she is biased as a coffee drinker agreed that despite the small sample size of 100 patients she was ""somewhat reassured that it didn't appear to induce any atrial arrhythmias. If anything it seemed like individuals were somehow increasing their physical activity. Hopefully that would translate to better cardiovascular health weight blood pressure.""

Coffee consumers averaged 1058 more steps per day (P=0.0010) but got 36 less minutes sleep per night (P<0.001) after adjusting for day of week with each additional drink linked with 587 additional steps per day and 18 fewer minutes of sleep (both P<0.001).

With regard to the PVCs ""we don't have to get too too worried"" for normal hearts in healthy individuals Hylek suggested.

The trial enrolled 100 coffee-drinking adults and outfitted them with Fitbit Flex 2 devices continuous electrocardiography with the wearable Zio patch and a continuous glucose monitor. Participants were randomly assigned to consume at least one coffee (defined as one shot of espresso or a cup of regular caffeinated coffee) or as much as they wanted or to avoid all caffeine for 2 weeks in a 2 consecutive days-on 2 days-off schedule.

""One of the biggest challenges was finding individuals willing to go without coffee"" Marcus noted. ""We recognize that that could introduce some bias"" if people most prone to coffee-induced problems declined to enroll.

However he pointed out that adherence among those who did enroll was ""excellent"" by all measures which included participants pressing the button on the Zio patch each time they drank coffee answering text messages about their actual coffee consumption on the prior day reimbursement of coffee receipts and electronic monitoring of their phone location to show when they were in a coffee shop.

Prior studies that have generally concluded no association or lower risk of atrial fibrillation with coffee consumption have relied on longitudinal and observational data from self-report prone to confounding Marcus noted. The UK Biobank study for example suggested lower risk of supraventricular tachycardia consistent with the trial findings. There hadn't been much PVCs data and what was available was ""very conflicting"" he added.

Observational studies had also linked coffee with a reduction in mortality and in diabetes but the CRAVE trial turned up no signal of effect on glucose.

""This study was really designed to detect acute effects"" Marcus noted. ""There may be chronic effects that are different. It's not just that you add up all the acute effects and that leads to the chronic effect. Rather there may be some cumulative process that leads to the outcomes observed.""

""For example regular physical activity more commonly perhaps that leads to a reduction on overall mortality perhaps in diabetes whereas our data would suggest that these observations that coffee is associated with a lower risk of diabetes long-term does not appear to be an acute effect of caffeine on insulin sensitivity"" he stated.

Eighteen months ago Alina Chan co-wrote an explosive paper that said scientists should investigate the possibility that a virus from a laboratory in China caused the pandemic. Buffeted by a firestorm of criticism the Cambridge researcher now says she plans to change her name. But only after her book on the origins of COVID-19 is published.

“I don’t want to sound like I’m entering some sort of spy movie but I don’t know what to do” said the 33-year-old researcher. “I want to fade back into obscurity.”

But first she’d like your attention.

On Tuesday HarperCollins will publish “Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19” which Chan co-wrote with science writer Matt Ridley a Conservative member of the UK House of Lords. Building on her paper which appeared online in May 2020 but hasn’t been accepted by a peer-reviewed journal the book asserts that a growing body of circumstantial evidence supports her hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from a lab in Wuhan China.

The book doesn’t explicitly blame a “lab leak” for the pandemic but “Viral” does say that scenario has evolved from a “conspiracy theory to just barely a possibility to a plausible hypothesis worthy of a credible investigation.” She cites among other things the similarity between the new coronavirus and another virus at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The prevailing view has been that the illness resulted from natural spillover from animals to humans although no one knows for sure. An investigation by US intelligence agencies this year was inconclusive which the White House blamed on a lack of cooperation by the Chinese government. The World Health Organization last month announced that a group of international scientists will try again.

Chan says she was reluctant to write the book when Ridley a veteran journalist who contends the dangers of global warming are exaggerated approached her last year about collaborating. She says she finally signed a book deal because news reports and posts on Twitter ― which she uses prolifically to advance her theory and spar with opponents ― cannot tell the complex story of COVID-19′s origins.

“It has to be summed up in a book” she said. “I hope it will be a bestseller.”

She acknowledged that writing and promoting a book seems a bad way to achieve anonymity.

To her critics — and there are plenty — she’s motivated less by the pursuit of knowledge than of riches and notoriety.

“In my opinion she is an intellectually dishonest manipulative conspiracist with very little subject matter expertise who has offered nothing of value to the search for the origins of COVID-19 and has compensated for her mediocrity by pursuing personal profit” Angela Rasmussen an American virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada said in an e-mail. “Her supposed scientific contribution including this book is a scam disguised as an honest quest for the truth.”

Rasmussen has skewered Chan on Twitter noting that the Broad researcher is not a virologist or epidemiologist ― specialists with expertise in viruses and the spread of disease. Chan is a molecular biologist who focuses on gene therapy and cell engineering.

Chan has repeatedly fired back at critics tweeting in October 2020 that scientists who obscure the origins of the pandemic have “a hand in the deaths of millions of people.”

Other scientists however say Chan deserves credit for challenging the view that the virus almost certainly moved to humans from bats through an intermediary host animal.

Richard Ebright a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University called her “courageous.” In March he signed an open letter along with Chan and other scientists ― published in the Wall Street Journal and the French publication Le Monde ― calling for an international forensic investigation of COVID’s origins.

In an interview Ebright said Chan questioned a “false narrative” that scientists had ruled out the possibility the virus came from a lab and is “putting her reputation and career on the line.”

But in an example of the controversy’s many layers Ebright said the central argument for a lab leak that Chan made in the 2020 paper wasn’t all that compelling. She was right to say the virus could have come from a lab he says but for the wrong reasons. Still Ebright credits her and other scientists with prodding US intelligence agencies to conduct a 90-day inquiry earlier this year into the pandemic’s origins although the findings were inconclusive.

At first glance Chan seems an unlikely figure to provoke an international uproar among seasoned virologists government officials in multiple countries and Internet sleuths hunting for evidence of suspicious illnesses in China.

A Canadian citizen who was born in Vancouver and grew up in Singapore she is a junior scientist who arrived at the Broad in 2018. Chan says she did all her COVID research in her spare time. During interviews she seemed alternately wounded and amused by the criticism hurled by veteran scientists exclaiming “ouch!” and “holy cow!” when a reporter read aloud Rasmussen’s scathing e-mail.

Chan works in the field of gene therapy which involves altering or inserting genes inside human cells to treat diseases. Scientists sometimes use modified viruses to deliver a new gene into the cell but several experts said that background would not give Chan a deep understanding of coronaviruses.

“It’s like the difference between a car salesman and a car mechanic” said Benjamin Neuman a virologist at Texas A&M University who believes it’s far more likely that the coronavirus naturally spread from animals to humans like many other so-called zoonotic viruses. “It’s a different body of knowledge.”

Chan dismisses such criticism saying her knowledge of how viruses can be genetically modified is relevant and that virologists should be embarrassed for not taking the possibility of a lab leak more seriously.

By her account Chan began researching that scenario early last year as a result of encouraging reports that the new coronavirus appeared to be mutating very slowly improving the prospects for developing medicines and vaccines to target it.

As she worked on her laptop at her kitchen counter in Cambridge during the 2020 lockdown Chan said she wondered whether the relatively stable virus had somehow “pre-adapted” to infect humans before the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. Could it have adapted to humans while being studied in a lab and then accidentally escaped?

At the time many experts theorized the virus likely spread from an animal to humans at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan given that two-thirds of the initial 41 people hospitalized with COVID-related pneumonia in early 2020 had direct exposure to the market. Chan had her doubts.

She contacted Shing Hei Zhan a friend and bioinformatics expert from her days at the University of British Columbia. Together they began a genetic analysis comparing the evolution of the new coronavirus with the SARS-CoV virus that caused a far smaller outbreak that began in China in 2002 and disappeared two years later.

In the paper that the two friends wrote with Ben Deverman Chan’s boss at the Broad they concluded that by the time the new coronavirus emerged in December 2019 it was “already pre-adapted to human transmission” so that it resembled the earlier SARS virus during the latter phase of that outbreak.

They also couldn’t rule out that it had come from a lab such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology about 8 miles from the market. The institute acknowledged in early 2020 that it had a virus in its database with a genome sequence that was 96.2 percent similar to SARS-CoV-2 but it dismissed the idea of a leak as a conspiracy theory.

The paper appeared at a time when the politics surrounding the genesis of the pandemic were fraught. President Trump called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus.” Critics accused him of stirring anti-Asian hatred. The study Chan coauthored swiftly made headlines. “Coronavirus did NOT come from animals in Wuhan market” The Daily Mail on Sunday in Britain trumpeted.

The state-backed Chinese newspaper Global Times attacked Chan saying her “filthy behavior and lack of basic academic ethics have also aroused the disgust of many international experts” according to an account she translated for the Globe. Chan said she was accused of being a “race traitor” because of her Chinese heritage. She said she also received “some quite terrifying e-mails” and that Broad security guards were put on alert.

Fearing she had “committed career suicide” Chan said she apologized to Deverman. He told her “he still believed in what I wrote” in the study she recalled.

Deverman who directs a vector engineering group at the Broad declined to discuss his communications with Chan but called her “fearless.” He said he too was surprised by the blowback. To him the study simply reported that no scenarios for COVID’s origin could be ruled out based on known scientific evidence.

Chan shows no signs of retreat in “Viral.” Indeed she expands on her arguments and credits Internet detectives who combed online records for gathering important evidence. They include a group of activists called DRASTIC or Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team Investigating COVID-19 which formed on Twitter and has pushed the lab leak theory.

Among the key evidence she cites is the virus that the Wuhan institute collected in 2013 in Yunnan province that shares 96.2 percent of the genomic identity of the virus that causes COVID. Researchers obtained the virus known as RaTG13 a year after six workers at a bat-infested copper mine in the province fell ill with severe pneumonia caused by a “SARS-like” coronavirus. Three of the workers died. In September 2019 she writes the institute took its pathogen database offline while studying that virus and eight similar ones.

The Wuhan institute has conducted experiments on coronaviruses. But Shi Zhengli a top Chinese virologist at the lab has repeatedly denied it was the source of SARS-CoV-2 telling The New York Times in June “How on earth can I offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?”

Chan raises the possibility in her book that SARS-CoV-2 was a bioweapon being developed in a lab but then brushes that aside as a “distraction.” She writes “If the virus came from a laboratory it is much more likely that it was a leak from experiments designed to understand viruses that pose potential pandemic threats.”

Other scientists say there’s a world of difference between two viruses that are 96.2 percent genetically identical.

“It’s not that close” said Michael Worobey an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. He noted that researchers recently discovered a virus in bats in Laos that is even more similar to SARS-CoV-2 as reported in September in Nature. “The science has moved on” he said.

Worobey signed a second letter with 17 other scientists including Chan and Deverman that was published in Science in May that called for further investigation of COVID’s origins. Since then he has grown more convinced that the virus jumped from animals to humans naturally he said most likely spreading from bats to raccoon dogs that researchers found were sold at the market.

Ridley the coauthor of “Viral” says Chan has played a crucial role in the debate. They talked on video calls for months and rewrote each other’s drafts he said but met in person for the first time on Wednesday in Kendall Square. Standing outside the Area Four pizzeria they opened a box containing the first US edition of their book.

Ridley says he plans to donate half of his advance to charities. Chan says she will donate half of everything she makes on the book. Neither would say how much money they have received.

“I felt very strongly about not profiteering” Chan said. “It was never about the money for me. ... It’s not like I can retire.”

Findings from the “SPIRIT-HCM Study: Quality of Life after Septal Myectomy in Obstructive Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” were reported today during a featured science session at the American Heart Association’s virtual Scientific Sessions 2021. This is the first prospective report in which patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy reported improved quality of life following surgery.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically an inherited disease that affects an estimated 600000 to 1.5 million Americans or one in 500 people. People with the condition may develop heart ailments that shorten life or decrease the person’s quality of life including sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death and heart failure. Symptoms can include chest pain shortness of breath and fatigue syncope (fainting or passing out) and heart palpitations.

Treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically includes lifestyle changes medications and surgery. During a septal myectomy – the procedure performed in this study – the surgeon removes a small amount of the thickened septal wall to widen the outflow tract from the left ventricle to the aorta. Myectomy is considered when medications are not effective in treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This frequently eliminates the mitral valve leakage.

The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a widely used quality-of-life questionnaire originally designed and validated in the heart-failure population and recently employed as an endpoint in a clinical trial of patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

For the SPIRIT-HCM trial in 136 patients who underwent surgical myectomy and completed follow-up 125 (92%) achieved the primary endpoint (≥5 point improvement in KCCQ summary score) with 109 (80%) showing a large (>20 point) improvement. Also 117 (86%) patients reported good to excellent health status (KCCQ summary score ≥75) at follow-up. In addition to KCCQ there was a marked improvement in all other quality-of-life metrics including PROMIS DASI and EQ-5D scores with a significant improvement observed in more than 80% patients.

“The primary goal of septal myectomy is to alleviate the symptoms and improve the quality of life in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients when medication is no longer effective” said Milind Desai M.D. MBA director Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center and clinical operations in Cleveland Clinic’s Heart Vascular & Thoracic Institute and principal investigator of the study. “However its impact on quality of life physical and social health has not been prospectively studied until now.

Steven Nissen M.D. Chief Academic Officer of the Heart Vascular and Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic said “These findings demonstrate that septal myectomy in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy significantly improves overall quality of life physical and social health status left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and functional capacity.”

This prospective study was investigator-initiated and entirely funded by philanthropic research support to Cleveland Clinic. Drs. Desai and Nissen serve on the Executive Steering Committee of “A Study to Evaluate Mavacamten in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive HCM Who Are Eligible for Septal Reduction Therapy” (VALOR-HCM) sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb.

Kelly had presided over a massive expansion of stop-and-frisk police tactics during his tenure along with a host of other surveillance measures.

At the time I was a vociferous critic of America’s criminal-justice system and I was skeptical of stop-and-frisk. Under Kelly’s leadership black New Yorkers were being stopped on the street and searched under the thinnest of pretexts.

I had actually been detained by the NYPD in Harlem in 2010 while working as a visiting professor at Columbia for the pretextual offense of “riding a bicycle on the sidewalk.”

6 Loury explains in his book that conservative speakers on college campuses are now almost always met by rowdy protesters. Watson Institute

Regardless of my feelings about his policies I wanted to hear what Kelly had to say.

He was an extremely powerful figure at the forefront of a controversial development in policing and I wanted to hear his justification for these tactics.

There was plenty I wanted to say back to him too. And I had a prime spot near the front of the stage to ask questions during the Q&A.

Kelly took the stage but before he could get a word out students in the audience began shouting him down. “Racism is not up for debate!” “No Justice! No Peace! No Racist Police!” “We’re asking you to stop frisking people!” The interruptions were met with scattered cheers.

Marion Orr the political-science professor who’d invited Kelly asked the crowd to settle down and to wait for the Q&A but the disruptions continued.

After 15 minutes it was clear that Kelly wouldn’t be allowed to speak so he turned around and returned to New York.

I was stunned.

I’d attended plenty of raucous contentious lectures where members of the audience were clearly unhappy with the speaker.

Hell I’d even been the guy they were mad at! But whoever the speaker was he needed to be heard out.

Then when the time came whoever had the microphone could tell him just how wrong he was — and why.

To shout down the speaker to prevent him from presenting his argument and to replace reasoned discourse with mob tactics was not what we did in the university.

6 Glenn C. Loury is a professor at Brown University.

I had always prized academia as a place where even unpopular thinking could be examined and debated without fear of repression.

Even abominable ideas needed to be analyzed and subjected to examination rather than passed over in silence or repressed entirely.

How else could we be sure that we could understand these ideas?

How could we know they were so bad unless we engaged with them ourselves?

The free exchange of ideas is one of the foundations of the modern university indeed of modern democratic society.

Without that exchange it seemed doubtful that we could have either.

6 Glenn C. Loury’s new book is called “Late Admissions.”

Brown’s president Christina Paxson immediately issued a statement condemning the protesters’ actions and reaffirming the university’s commitment to the free exchange of ideas.

But when the university investigated the protesters they were given a slap on the wrist and sent on their way.

And worse the university produced a navel-gazing report which concluded that while the protesters should not have disrupted Kelly’s lecture the university should have taken into consideration Kelly’s presence at Brown.

The commissioner it seems had the potential to “harm” students who had experienced trauma possibly triggered by ideas like stop-and-frisk.

In essence the university was apologizing for doing exactly what it was supposed to do: expose its students to ideas and teach them how to formulate ideas of their own in response!

A precedent was set.

At universities around the country when a controversial almost always conservative figure was invited to give a lecture they could find themselves met by protesters who saw it as their mission to make sure the event never took place.

Activists and some members of the media refer to these tactics with the rather genteel term deplatforming. A more honest term would be censorship.

6 Today’s college protesters including those at Columbia risk obscuring the noble causes for which they are fighting Loury writes. Getty Images

In one sense the students protesting Kelly’s appearance at Brown achieved their goal: he was silenced and he left.

But in another more important sense they missed the mark entirely: The reason for their protests — opposition to racially biased stop-and-frisk policing — was lost amid the controversy over their methods.

The same pattern repeats itself today in the pro-Palestine demonstrations on college campuses across the nation.

There are many reasons to oppose Israel’s ongoing siege of Gaza and its dealings with the Palestinians.

Yet the encampments and building occupations have once again turned the public’s attention to the protesters and their methods rather than the righteous cause the best of them represent.

6 Brown President Christina Paxson (here with Jeb Bush in 2018) has been vocal in condemning campus protestors who shut down free speech. AP

If these students like those who opposed stop-and-frisk in 2013 want to bring about change in the way America goes about its business they need to get out of their own way.

Otherwise 10 years hence the public may remember the tents and the arrests while struggling to recall what all that sound and fury signified.

That would be a shame.

Why Trust Us?

Bobbi Brown shared exactly how to use each shade of her iconic .

“I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said.

The versatile formula can be used as a skin tint blush and highlighter.

Bobbi Brown’s have disrupted the makeup scene over the last few years. Since their launch Brown has expanded the shade range from four to 12 colors allowing each to serve a specific purpose for different skin tones. In a new video the makeup artist explained exactly how to use Miracle Balm and offered tips for application for every shade.

In general the Miracle Balms are an enhancement a problem solver and a lifter Brown said. “If you’re someone who is of a certain age and you feel like you’ve been not looking your best you’ve been looking tired when you put this on it automatically makes you look better. And usually by the way when you look better you start feeling better.”

Below is Brown’s guide to wearing her hero product—plus how you can layer them to get an angelic natural glow.

Jones Road Miracle Balm skin tints

Tints essentially give the face a healthy wash of color. is “great for women who have fair to medium skin” Brown said. is her personal go-to she added as the deep mauve is ideal for those who have olive-yellow skin tones and want to counteract it. “There’s enough red in it so it just looks like a combination of bronzer tint and blush” she said. “It also looks great on the lips.” she uses all over when she “want[s] to look healthy like I have a tan.” is great for those who have red undertones because it helps “cut the redness” she said. Lastly there’s  which works great on medium to dark skin tones as an all over tint—it can even be used on the lips.

To apply the skin tints Brown suggested using your fingers to blend it into to your cheeks forehead nose and chin.

Jones Road Miracle Balm blushes

If you’d rather not apply the balm all over opt for one of the blush shades. is the “most beautiful pink” that some people also use on their lips Brown explained. “I use it on top of Tawny.” Then there’s  which is more of a peachy coral and the newest blush shade is . “It sits somewhere between Dusty Rose and Flushed” Brown explained. “It’s great for very fair to dark skin tones.”

Jones Road Miracle Balm highlighters

is a cool-toned highlight with silvery hues and is like its “warm sister” Brown said. The latter shade is great for people with dark skin or those who prefer bronze tones she explained. The newest highlighter shade is  a frosty pink. “As a mom of three boys I never got to do the pink thing ... I love sequins I love ballerinas I love tulle. So Happy Hour reminds me of that.” Lastly is colorless for those who don’t like sparkle. Instead it uses its emollient texture to give the high points of the face—cheekbones bridge of the nose forehead cupids bow—a lit-from-within gleam.

Jones Road Miracle Balm application tips

The shades you choose may determine how you apply your balm but Brown cleared the air by saying you can really put it wherever you want. For a natural full-face routine however you can use one from each category—a tint to start a blush on the cheeks and lips and a highlight on cheekbones. If you have oily skin Brown recommended putting your balms of choice over a light veil of loose powder. On the flip side they float effortlessly over and hydrate dry mature skin. “I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said."

This time: Early Times Bottled-in-Bond a bottom-shelf gem only you and the liquor store owner know about.

For all the moaning whiskey fans do about price inflation in the bourbon world few true value bourbons are celebrated with the usual #crotchshot fanfare — such treatment is reserved for high-profile limited edition pickups (especially when found near their retail prices) like Buffalo Trace’s Antique Collection or 18-year-Old Elijah Craig. For most of those that spend leisure time hunting bottles of whiskey they’re closer to show pieces than something to be opened and poured — sort of like sneakerheads that don’t wear their sneakers. Those looking to open and drink whiskey regularly (and responsibly) are left out in the cold in most internet whiskey discussions. Early Times’ Bottled-in-Bond is an exception.

Per government statute all Bottled-in-Bond whiskey is at least 4 years old bottled at 100 proof and made at one distillery in one distilling season. Whiskey bargain hunter translation: $25 a liter (which translates to roughly $18.75 for a standard 750mL bottle) for Early Times Bottled-in-Bond is a wicked deal.

Its price proof and age guarantee put it in league with the Evan Williams Bottled-in-Bonds Four Roses Yellow Labels Wild Turkey 101s of the world all of which represent the best bang for one’s bourbon buck in the whiskey world.

It goes down easy too. The whiskey sports a 79% corn 11% rye and 10% malted barley mashbill and serves up less of a bite than the likes of Wild Turkey or Old Grand-Dad expressions. To me it tastes like Basil Hayden’s with a stronger boozey backbone.

Before this summer all Early Times products were produced by Brown-Forman the company that owns the likes of Jack Daniel’s Old Forester and Woodford Reserve. Then Brown-Forman sold the 160-year-old brand to Sazerac the company behind Buffalo Trace and its many hard-to-find whiskeys. My advice: buy three liters before the whiskey world wakes up and realizes what they’re missing out on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMS8xMS8xMy8yMzMzNzEwLzAvZW4vTXVoYW1tYWQtQWxpLUh1bWFuaXRhcmlhbi1Bd2FyZHMtVG9vay1QbGFjZS1Ob3ZlbWJlci0xMnRoLWF0LXRoZS1NdWhhbW1hZC1BbGktQ2VudGVyLWluLVRoZS1DaGFtcC1zLUhvbWV0b3duLW9mLUxvdWlzdmlsbGUtS2VudHVja3kuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards Took Place November 12th at the Muhammad Ali Center in The Champ's ...,"Eleven Awardees from Four Countries Receive Awards for Inspiring Unity Compassion Activism and Risk-Taking

The chairman and CEO of Florida-based Fontainebleau Development who walked away from the planned $2 billion development when his financing disappeared was perplexed. He couldn’t understand why another builder didn’t finish the planned nearly-3800-room hotel-casino project at the north end of the Strip.

“I was surprised it sat here that long” Soffer told The Nevada Independent last week.

“I saw the articles over the years that it should be torn down crazy stuff like that” Soffer said while sitting in a conference room built inside the parking garage attached to the 67-story blue-tinted glass tower. “The building itself was very well-built as a physical structure. It’s in pristine shape.”

An hour later Soffer participated in a second groundbreaking and commencement ceremony with Gov. Steve Sisolak Clark County officials Las Vegas tourism leaders and his partners 14 years and nine months after the initial groundbreaking event. Soffer announced plans to “finish what I started” and have the 25-acre Fontainebleau site open by the fourth quarter of 2023.

“It’s a crazy story but I could never understand why no one really had the vision to follow this through” Soffer said. “[Fontainebleau President Brett Mufson] came to me and said we had an opportunity to buy it back and I said ‘yeah let’s do it.’”

Much has changed on the Strip’s north end since the 9-million-square-foot development was halted.

The Sahara and Circus Circus have new owners the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opened in June and a $1 billion expansion to the Las Vegas Convention Center opened next door to the Fontainebleau on land that once housed the aging Riviera.

“My plan from day one was to have two properties one in Miami and one in Las Vegas” Soffer said referencing the company’s flagship Fontainebleau resort on Miami Beach. “I always thought Las Vegas was a good fit for our brand.”

He reacquired the Las Vegas project in February with a new financial partner: Koch Real Estate Investments the Dallas-based subsidiary of Koch Industries. Neither Soffer nor Koch Real Estate Investments President Jake Francis revealed what they paid to buy back the project nor did they provide details on the costs expected to complete the development.

Both companies said Soffer’s Fontainebleau team will manage the resort. A deal with hotel chain Marriott International reached with a previous owner was scrapped; Soffer said Fontainebleau’s worldwide customer database would fill the property.

“We generate a lot of traffic and a lot of revenue” Soffer said. “We have a brand that is known all around the world.”

Soffer who was married to supermodel Elle MacPherson from 2013 to 2017 and first made the Forbes billionaire rankings in 2015 is the son of Miami real estate developer Donald Soffer who built a large mall office building and condominium towers on a 785-acre parcel in Miami-Dade County.

Various parts of the Koch business empire have made investments in Las Vegas over the years including multi-family housing developments and industrial projects but the Fontainebleau marks the company’s first gaming investment.

Francis said the Fontainebleau presented “an opportunity” for Koch Industries to enter the Las Vegas market “at a significant discount” rather than the start-up costs associated with building a property from the ground up.

He was quite familiar with the Las Vegas resort industry’s revenue mix where pre-pandemic non-gaming spending by visitors accounted for roughly 65 percent of the Strip’s revenue market.

“We're big believers in the continued movement of Las Vegas towards the north end of the Strip” Francis said. He views the Fontainebleau as the “third leg of the stool” that includes Resorts World and the convention center expansion.

“There is only more to come here” Francis added. “There's more sports teams bigger conventions. So just with the growth of the market in general [the Fontainebleau] is definitely a better location today than it was 14 years ago.”

Is Vegas ready for another resort?

Gaming revenue has rebounded in 2021 after the pandemic closed the casino industry statewide for nearly three months in 2020 and handed the Strip its lowest gaming revenue total since 1996. But through September Strip gaming revenue was less than 1 percent ahead of 2019’s pre-pandemic figures.

Analysts said they would question the viability of the Fontainebleau if the project were opening next month. Mid-week convention business has been slow to return to pre-pandemic numbers and international airline passenger travel into Las Vegas is still 85.6 percent below 2019. The day before the Fontainebleau’s ribbon-cutting event Las Vegas welcomed the arrival of its first transcontinental flight from the United Kingdom in 20 months.

The two-year wait could make a difference in Fontainebleau’s success analysts said.

Fitch Ratings Service gaming analyst Colin Mansfield reiterated his previous view that Las Vegas could return to the 2019 pre-pandemic levels by 2023. In an interview he said time is probably on the side of the Fontainebleau.

“If you’re talking about a two-year window it’s something that will create an incremental positive for the city” Mansfield said. “Resorts World added a little over 2 percent room inventory increase and this project will add another 2 percent or so which should be absorbed by the market given all the good things going on in Las Vegas.”

Mansfield added that any new Las Vegas resort immediately “creates a buzz” that will drive visitors to the market.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said the “fast recovery” of Las Vegas gaming revenue and the anticipated return of non-gaming spending by customers lead him to believe the market is ready for a new property by late 2023 or early 2024.

“The revenues that we’ve seen during the past few months without any international travel and convention business have clearly shown that Las Vegas’ recovery is faster than anybody expected” Beynon said.

Brendan Bussmann a partner in Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors agreed the arrival of the Fontainebleau could coincide with the Strip’s return to pre-pandemic market conditions.

“If things remain on track we should be at recovery sometime in the second half of 2023 which would bode well for an expansion” Bussmann said. “The challenge is the headwinds we are seeing right now between inflation fuel costs and other economic concerns that are quickly reducing those lines of disposable income. That look[s] very recessionary. This will only elongate our recovery that may hamper a significant amount of room growth in the second half of 2023.”

Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas said by the time Fontainebleau opens the Las Vegas Strip could have several new operators.

Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International both announced plans two weeks ago to sell Strip resorts early next year. Also the gaming arm of Southern California’s San Manuel Indian Tribe is expected to take control of the off-Strip Palms Casino Resort if approved by gaming regulators next month.

Jonas also suggested the off-Strip Rio Resort Casino could eventually be operated by its New York-based investment firm ownership after a management deal with Caesars expires.

“You’re probably going to see new parties come to town so Fontainebleau is not going to be the only new guy fighting for market share” Jonas said. “We will have to see how competitive the market gets because the fourth quarter of 2023 is going to be a lot different than the fourth quarter of 2021.”

A few design changes

Soffer said the revived Fontainebleau will follow much of the original blueprint launched in 2007 – 3780 hotel rooms and suites 550000 square feet of convention and meeting space a casino restaurants and other amenities. The plan is to hire roughly 6000 full-time employees.

Condominium units are not part of the development something that was part of the original design. Soffer said the residential component was to help finance the project.

“It’s not the right fit and we don’t have to do that now” he said. “The condo thing is sort of a thing of the past.”

Another change is “greatly reducing” the once-planned 245000 square feet of retail space. Soffer also said a 20000-square-foot attraction on the Fontainebleau’s roof will be revealed at a later date.

“We’ll have announcements over the next two years” Soffer said.

More than 1800 of the Fontainebleau’s hotel rooms were ready for furniture when construction was halted. He said those rooms will need to be remodeled.

Soffer said the “bones” of the building – concrete steel plumbing and glass – remain strong after 14 years thanks to Southern Nevada’s dry climate although he noted some glass on the tower is missing and will be replaced. He added that the “finishes and the level of details” will take time to complete.

“We’re making some changes market-driven changes for the direction of where we want to go with the property” he said.

Plus growth on the north end of the Strip is likely to be a benefit. Having the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention just a short distance from Fontainebleau’s front door is a key marketing opportunity Soffer said.

“You can stay here and walk across the street where CES or another big show is here” he said. “Companies can use us as a headquarters for a special event.”

A long history

The Great Recession caused banks to pull financing from the Fontainebleau in June 2009. Soffer’s company lost the project a year later in a bankruptcy court foreclosure sale to corporate raider Carl Icahn who paid $150 million for the unfinished building.

Icahn’s company stripped the Fontainebleau bare selling furnishings specially-made escalators and a construction crane atop the tower. Elected leaders at the time thought the unfinished building was an eyesore and Icahn was asked to beautify the site.

Instead he sold the project in 2017 for $600 million to New York developer Steven Witkoff whose plans included renaming the development Drew Las Vegas in honor of his son Andrew who died of a drug overdose in 2011.

Nevada gaming regulators found Witkoff suitable as an operator in January 2020 a designation he hoped would help secure $2 billion in financing to finish the building. Instead the financing dried up and Soffer got a second chance to complete Fontainebleau Las Vegas.

“I feel very privileged and honored to be in this situation” Soffer said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2FuZG1vdG9yY29hY2huZXdzLmNvbS93ZXN0LWNvYXN0LW9wZXJhdG9ycy10aHJpbGxlZC10by1nYXRoZXItZm9yLWZpcnN0LWNiYS1zaG93LWluLTIteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Coast operators ‘thrilled’ to gather for first CBA show in 2 years,"After last year’s pandemic shutdown West Coast operators finally gathered in person at a busy California Bus Association (CBA) Annual Convention & Trade Show Oct. 24-26 at the Westin Lake Resort Las Vegas. Recruiting drivers and building back business were topics that also attracted operators from Idaho Oregon Nevada Arizona and beyond to the 47th annual event.

However even the latest innovations and up-to-the-minute education sessions couldn’t trump CBA’s main event —the first face-to-face contact between members suppliers and industry colleagues after a nearly two-year absence.

“I was thrilled to see a lot of old friends” said Curtis Riggs President of VIA Trailways with offices in Merced and Fresno California and Tempe Arizona. “The sessions were very informative but for me the most exciting part was reconnecting and seeing our vendors and sponsors join us in Nevada.”

Tom Miller owner of Antelope Valley Express and Santa Clarita Express remarked “I was telling others it felt like we were not alone. Everyone had the same stories of what we went through and how we are now all facing the same driver shortage issues.”

“We initially planned for a modest 175 attendees and exceeded that number by 25% in same-day registrations and new member registration on site” said Vicki Bowman CBA’s Executive Director. “CBA’s annual convention has always had strong regional attendance but this year operators in surrounding states were particularly eager to see our program and supplier exhibits as everyone is getting their businesses up to speed.”

‘Forward together’

The meeting’s keynote speaker was Donald Ross VP Meeting Operations Caesar’s Entertainment who explained how the Las Vegas casino giant managed the pandemic and is ramping operations up now.

Educational panel sessions covered everything from financial preparedness for regrowth to ongoing advocacy in the fight for greater government funding for the industry. American Bus Association’s Brandon Buchanan and DATTCO Motor Coach’s Pamela Martinez hosted roundtable panel discussions covering a wide range of topics including telematics driver hiring and recruitment insurance issues California regulatory compliance and new bus safety laws.

Vickie Cole CBA President and Co-Owner of American Stage Tours Concord California said: “After 18 months of Zoom calls it was great to be back meeting face-to-face. We put a lot of information out to our membership to communicate how the industry has changed during COVID and how CBA is fighting for national relief and for our members statewide.” Two years ago the association also began a membership drive for operators in neighboring states.

“Many of our surrounding states are without a state or regional association” said Cole. “Carriers making trips to Disneyland or California’s state parks need to better understand state compliance and can benefit from our ongoing educational and safety programs.” CBA’s most recent legislative achievement was working with the California State Assembly to refund 2020 DMV registration fees a valuable part of membership.

Awards and more

Recognizing excellence among its members CBA honored Best Tours & Travel Fresno California as 2021 Operator of the Year. Steve Tesconi of Royal Coach Tours San Jose California received CBA’s Maintenance Technician of the Year award and John Gilb Royal Coach Tours San Jose California was named Driver of the Year.

CBA made sure members also had plenty of networking opportunities during the convention with evening events sponsored by ABC Companies Irizar Motor Coach Industries Prevost Temsa and Icomera.

The annual golf outing also brought many operators back together. Antelope Valley/Santa Clarita Express’ Miller thought this year’s annual golf outing – sponsored by TIB Transportation Insurance Brokers and Republic Indemnity Insurance Company – was especially worthwhile because he was paired with Eric Onnen of Santa Barbara Airbus. “We both run scheduled service into LAX and have sat across from each other in meetings but this was the first time we got chance to become better acquainted. And it didn’t hurt we won second place.”

The next two CBA in-person annual conventions are already scheduled — Oct. 23-25 for the 2022 event at the Omni Resort & Spa Rancho Mirage CA and Nov. 5-7 at Silver Legacy Resort Reno in 2023. CBA sponsored Legislative Day and Maintenance Programs also return in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vVHJhdmVsLU5ld3MvSG90ZWwtTmV3cy9NR00tZG9lc250LXNlZS1hLWZ1dHVyZS1mb3ItdGhlLU1pcmFnZS1idXQtZXhwZXJ0cy1zYXktb3RoZXJzLW1pZ2h00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MGM doesn't see a future for the Mirage but experts say others might,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Hotel-News/MGM-doesnt-see-a-future-for-the-Mirage-but-experts-say-others-might on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vVHJhdmVsLU5ld3MvSG90ZWwtTmV3cy9NR00tZG9lc250LXNlZS1hLWZ1dHVyZS1mb3ItdGhlLU1pcmFnZS1idXQtZXhwZXJ0cy1zYXktb3RoZXJzLW1pZ2h00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL21vcmUtc3RhdGVzLWNvbnNpZGVyaW5nLWNhc2luby1nYW1ibGluZy1leHBhbnNpb24tMjQ3ODU1My_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy9tb3JlLXN0YXRlcy1jb25zaWRlcmluZy1jYXNpbm8tZ2FtYmxpbmctZXhwYW5zaW9uLTI0Nzg1NTMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More states considering casino gambling expansion,"With gaming on a revenue hot streak in 2021 several U.S. states are in various stages to bring casino gambling to their citizens — and to generate tax revenue.

It’s no wonder why states across the nation are in various stages of introducing some form of gaming to their citizens.

The American Gaming Association last week reported that commercial gaming revenue hit a quarterly record for the months of July August and September and that revenue is on a record pace for 2021.

The AGA said that with $38.67 billion in revenue through the first nine months of the year the industry has already passed revenue generated for the full year 2020 and is on pace to smash its annual record of $43.65 billion set in 2019.

For states that already offer some form of gaming that means the generation of tax revenue to help solve a multitude of problems ranging from underfunded education to homelessness and housing issues.

“Two straight quarters of record gaming revenue is an incredible accomplishment in any context let alone after the most challenging year in industry history” said AGA President and CEO Bill Miller. “Our recovery is not a flash in the pan but rather a sustained result of our leadership in responsible reopening world-class entertainment offerings and widespread favorability.”

The explosive growth which industry executives and analysts attribute to pent-up demand resulting from being cooped up during the coronavirus pandemic and available cash from stimulus checks also is being felt in Nevada.

In a year in which gross gaming revenue across the Silver State is on the verge of hitting its record-breaking eighth consecutive month of gaming win exceeding $1 billion the third quarter was particularly impressive.

For July September and October the state’s casinos collected $3.683 billion a 58.7 percent increase over the third quarter of 2020. The Control Board said revenue broke down to $2.479 billion won on slot machines and $1.205 billion on table games.

The total won in Nevada in the third quarter was 26.5 percent of the nationwide third-quarter amount.

The list of future projects already underway for the next wave of expansion is short but the pipeline of new proposals is lengthy.

Here’s a summary of gaming expansion being contemplated in other states:

Virginia

The expansion of commercial gaming in Virginia seemed to be going smoothly up until just recently.

The state’s Legislature legalized sports betting in 2020 and legal bets were wagered in the Old Dominion commonwealth starting in January.

And last November voters in four Virginia cities voted to allow for casino gambling through partnerships with gaming companies. Those included the cities of Danville which partnered with Caesars Entertainment Bristol (Hard Rock International) Portsmouth (Rush Street Gaming) and Norfolk (Pamunkey Indian Tribe).

So when Richmond voters went to the polls Nov. 2 to decide if it would become the fifth Virginia city to make the jump through a referendum that would allow Urban One to build a 250-room resort with 1800 slots it seemed like momentum was on expansion’s side. The city’s mayor Levar Stoney had even thrown his support behind the project.

But the referendum failed by a narrow 51-49 margin.

The other four cities that voted in favor of casino gambling should be well positioned for their respective markets said Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors.

“Obviously these aren’t going to be the next Las Vegas but you’ll see a good regional product” he said.

Bussmann said he doesn’t expect much movement on additional expansion proposals in Virginia anytime soon.

Colorado

Another sure expansion is in Cripple Creek Colorado where Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts is building Chamonix a 300-room property next door to its existing Bronco Billy’s casino in the small mountain town near Colorado Springs. The company said the property would have the first luxury guest rooms in the market.

Colorado already is seeing a boost in revenue thanks to the elimination of betting limits in Black Hawk Central City and Cripple Creek in May.

Full House President and CEO Dan Lee said laborers have been working on utility relocation and the installation of foundation footings and walls for Chamonix named for a resort in the French Alps. Lee said the project would go vertical after steel arrives onsite in the next three weeks. One tower is expected to top out in April and another in August.

Illinois Indiana and Chicago

Chicago may have the largest potential for gaming expansion as the country’s third-largest metropolitan area with 9.5 million residents.

“It’s a huge opportunity for a great city” Bussmann said.

But a high tax rate of 40 percent scared off some potential developers. When the deadline for submittals came five proposals from four different companies came in.

“The submission of bid responses represents a major step toward the thoughtful development of a casino-resort that uplifts our businesses employs and empowers our residents and encourages tourism” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “We are thrilled to have received five high-caliber proposals from Bally’s Corp.; HR Chicago LLC; Rivers Chicago at McCormick LLC; and Rivers 78 Gaming LLC” she said.

The Chicago proposal is the largest among six regions where the Illinois Legislature authorized casinos. Regions include Danville Rockford South Suburbs Waukegan and Williamson County.

Winning bids are expected to be selected by the Illinois Gaming Board in January.

In Indiana four companies have submitted proposals for a casino in Vigo County and four in Terre Haute. Full House Resorts is in the mix at Terre Haute.

The company could get an answer as soon as Wednesday on its Terre Haute plan. Lee said his company is among four prospective developers that will make presentations to the Indiana Gaming Commission on that day. The commission has indicated it would deliberate and make a decision on the development later that day.

The Full House proposal called American Place would include a 100-room hotel elevated above an interior greenscape with a rooftop pool and restaurant.

New York

Two processes are in place in New York a market with the nation’s greatest population base a strong tourism economy and entertainment that could easily connect with gaming.

Nine companies are in line to have sports wagering licenses with a 51 percent tax rate and a requirement that operators can’t deduct promotion play when calculating gross income.

Operators expect to take wagers before the end of the National Football League season.

The second gaming process involves a request for information for three downstate casinos with licensing expected to occur by 2023 although the New York Legislature could move that up.

Las Vegas Sands Corp. made headlines after Sportico a sports business website reported that Sands was in preliminary talks with Steven Cohen the majority owner of the New York Mets baseball team to build a casino next door to the Mets’ Citi Field at Flushing in Queens.

Sands has not confirmed that report; however it has expressed interest in the New York City region.

“If the state were to activate the three gaming licenses available for the New York City region it would undoubtedly attract significant interest and ultimately investment from interested parties like us” the company said in a statement. “The amount of good paying middle-class jobs and the tax revenue generated by these projects would be meaningful to the state and the local communities as well.”

Texas

Texas always has been considered one of the best prospects for casino gambling because of its large population base low taxes and an appreciation for entertainment Bussmann said.

Sands hired a team of lobbyists to explain how the state would benefit from the development of four integrated resorts across the state.

Now that the state Legislature has adjourned efforts to lobby lawmakers have scaled back but they’re expected to ramp up again when a new session begins in 2023 which means it’s likely there won’t be anything on the ballot for Texans to consider until 2024.

Still the gaming industry will continue to be visible.

Next month the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States will convene in Austin and one of the event’s speakers will be Sands executive Andy Abboud.

Florida

The Florida Legislature approved of a compact negotiated by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Seminole Tribe of Florida that gave the tribe control of sports betting in the nation’s third most populous state. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland approved the compact in August.

But multiple groups have filed lawsuits against Haaland challenging her authority to approve the compact and arguing that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or IGRA allows the Seminoles to accept bets that are placed off -property as would be allowed under Florida’s agreement with the tribe.

A federal judge in October dismissed one lawsuit but another is still moving forward.

Other groups meanwhile are going to the state’s voters to push for further expansion. And those efforts have major backing from some of the biggest gaming companies.

FanDuel and DraftKings each wrote $10 million checks to Florida Education Champions which is pushing for a 2022 ballot measure that would allow for online sports betting across the state.

Las Vegas Sands had as of July donated $17 million to Florida Voters in Charge which is pushing for two measures that would allow for as many as three new casinos in north Florida.

With more than 20 million residents it’s understandable why major companies want to carve out a piece of what the Seminole Tribe has.

“It’s one of the largest population states where there’s tremendous opportunity to diversify a gaming product” Bussmann said.

Nebraska

Nebraska voters had to pass three initiatives in order to introduce casino gambling to the state one to amend the Constitution to allow games of chance to be played one to establish a tax rate of 20 percent and one to establish the Nebraska Gaming and Racing Commission to regulate the industry.

Now that the voters have passed them state legislators went to work cleaning up the bills and expanding the number of locations gaming will be allowed.

The initial bill enabled casinos linked with horse tracks at Lincoln Omaha Grand Island Hastings Columbus and South Sioux City. In the cleanup process lawmakers added tracks in Bellevue York Norfolk North Platte and Gering.

The regulatory structure in Nebraska is expected to be approved in mid-December and when the Legislature convenes in January another cleanup bill is anticipated that could expand games and regulate sports wagering.

Georgia

The debates over legalizing casino gambling and sports betting are not new to Georgia. For the better part of a decade the state has toyed with the ideas but each time they’ve run into a brick wall.

Casino gaming expansion would require a ballot initiative to be approved by voters in the nation’s eighth most populous state. Lawyers for the state’s legislature think that there is a legal avenue to pass sports betting simply through legislation however and gaming industry watchers like Bussmann expect that debate to come up when the body convenes next January.

And it will be backed by a coalition of Atlanta’s pro sports teams including the Braves Falcons Hawks and Atlanta United.

Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has said that while he opposes casino gambling he would not stand in the way if voters were to approve it as long as it’s written so that the revenue will benefit the state’s merit-based scholarship program that is entirely funded by the state lottery.

Getting that support at the polls would be one of the biggest issues according to Bussmann given that the state leans more conservative and religious — two groups historically opposed casino gambling on moral grounds.

“My fear with Georgia is overcoming what happens at the pulpit every Sunday” Bussmann said.

But those long-held anti-gambling beliefs could be shifting. Tennessee’s Legislature passed a bill to legalize sports betting in the state in 2019 and that law went live in November 2020.

But there will be other challenges.

Any ballot measures in 2022 will be fighting for the political airwaves against several huge state and federal races including what will be nationally watched races for governor and U.S. Senate.

“Georgia’s gonna be expensive” Bussmann said.

Capital One saw what was out there and raised the stakes this past week.

The launch of the Venture X card is being toted as a “new class of travel card” and it’s very clearly taking aim at current competitors in the premium card market like Amex Platinum and the Chase Sapphire Reserve.

Where the card shines is simplicity and borderline insane value: you’re making your annual fee back practically from day one with perks like lounge access and up to 10X earning on travel that make the card worthwhile many times over. Earning 10X points is the equivalent of 10% back or better on some purchases.

Plus Venture Miles now benefit from 15 1:1 airline transfer partners which means the card’s generous 100000 point welcome bonus can be converted into 100000 airline miles with top loyalty programs in addition to cash back options.

Few other cards if any can really compete with the bar Capital One is setting. The only issue so far has been history. Capital One was notorious for a strict approvals process in particular for people with excellent credit. With nearly a week of data points rolling in here’s what we’ve seen so far.

Venture X Approvals For Previous Denials

When Capital One offered a 100000 point bonus on the Venture Card many readers with excellent credit were surprised to be turned down. At the time rumors suggested Capital One might’ve preferred people with lesser credit profiles or those who carry balances.

No one will really ever know exactly what the hold ups were but it’s exciting that those hold ups seem to be gone on this exciting new premium card.

Approvals were easy for my family and I’ve heard from many readers who were among the “surprised” denials on previous cards that they’ve had absolutely no issue with an approval for the Venture X. Here are a few positive trends that appear to be emerging.

Spoiler alert: people are getting approved!

“Ok” To Hold Both Venture And Venture X

Many readers with current Capital One Venture accounts were worried that they wouldn’t be approved for the Venture X too. So far it seems there’s no issue at all in getting approved for both. If you have one it shouldn’t exclude you from the other.

I’ve heard from many who even received their Venture approval within the last 6 months who have been instantly approved for the Venture X. To me it makes a lot of sense – this is a new premium card with plenty of key differences to Venture so why not let people have both right?

Capital One Venture.

More Than 2 Capital One Cards “Ok” Too

Approvals and underwriting are a very secretive process in the credit card world and rumors and past data points always indicated that it wasn’t possible to hold more than two Capital One personal cards at a time.

As seen by GSTP and other blogs happy readers are chiming in that even though they already have two Capital one personal cards such as dining centric Savor and Venture they’ve also now been approved for the Venture X too. This creates quite an incredible card arsenal with top rates on dining travel and every day spend.

What Will The Venture X Credit Limit Be?

Capital One Venture X is a Visa Infinite Card which is the most premium level of card offered by Visa. Accordingly each Capital One Venture X card comes with a minimum credit limit of $10000 but most people have reported higher figures on approvals.

In addition to all the rather awesome benefits offered directly by Capital One Visa Infinite cards come with a variety of perks which can be extremely handy particularly when traveling or dealing with merchants.

Is There A Specific Credit Score Needed To Be Approved?

Capital One Venture X is designed as a product for people with “excellent” credit. Plus the points game is also always best played without carrying balances and by paying any card balances in full each month whenever possible.

There’s no specific score mentioned for this lucrative rewards card but generally excellent credit is deemed to be scores in the 700’s or ideally above.

This means people don’t necessarily need to have perfect credit to be approved but should have an excellent history of paying on time each month and keeping any balances well below 30% of credit lines. High balances rarely work well on new apps.

Capital One Venture X: Worth Applying?

Travel is personal and so are rewards credit cards.

For my family and I this card is a no brainer. I know I’ll more than make my annual fee back each year while enjoying some truly innovative travel perks like price drop protection through Capital One Travel and lounge access without pesky guest fees thanks to free authorized users.

Capital One pulls from all three credit bureaus and applying for new cards can always cause a temporary (usually single digit) point drop on scores but this may be the best card launched in years so for me it’s worth it. It may even replace another card with a higher annual fee…

This week at Frequent Miler

Have you been reading these emails and thinking that you could do this job? Do you know your miles points and deals and have good attention to detail? If yes Frequent Miler might be looking for someone like you. Responding to an opportunity like this one was one of the best decisions I ever made. Now it’s your turn — and I’m excited to see who joins us next.

The Capital One Venture X went live for applications this week and while we already knew it would have a great bonus it was exciting to get a closer look at the benefits as well (see Capital One Venture X live benefits as good as hoped and our previous coverage of the announcement of the card which has more detail about its structure and benefits: Capital One Venture X Card: A strong new ultra-premium contender). Capital One has long shut out customers with a lot of credit cards but this week many have been surprised with approvals. Since most didn’t have much previous experience with Capital One and the Venture ecosystem I wrote this post to answer some of the most common questions and highlight some of the key benefits you might have previously missed.

A lot of newly-minted Venture X cardholders have asked us what the card means for others in their wallets. With free authorized users who each get free Priority Pass Capital One lounge access and Hertz President’s Circle status and more solid benefits this updated tool can help you determine whether your existing cards are keepers in comparison.

Now that we have a new ultra-premium card on the market it made sense for Greg to revisit this ultra-premium travel protections post to include the Venture X so that you can compare and know which card to use when booking your trips. How does the new kid on the block compare to the establishment? See this post for more.

Frequent Miler has moved the time and frequency for our Ask Us Anything Youtube Live show — we now answer your questions live online on the second Wednesday of each month at 9pm. This week was our first evening episode and we fielded a lot of questions about the Venture X including whether it is too good to be true (will it last?). But that’s not all — we also answered your questions about phone insurance Marriott cards whether Barclays is going to exit the US market Amex upgrade offers and a lot more. See this post for the timestamps so you can hunt around for the questions that interest you most.

They say that cash is king. Whether or not you subscribe to that philosophy when it comes to your credit card rewards isn’t the point but rather that if you choose to collect points and miles you should be aware of the cost. With hotel programs continuing to devalue and mileage sales a regular fixture of the landscape cash back is looking better and better for unbonused spend. On the other hand with the glut of opportunities to earn 4x 5x 10x or even 15x points on purchases in some cases the cost is lower than ever — which might make now an ideal time to stock up on rewards while the math makes sense.

Rewards points enthusiasts have long trumpeted the great value to be had with Choice Privileges points in Scandinavia thanks to Nordic Choice but if you haven’t ever actually looked at it you may be very surprised to see just how good it can be. In this post Greg highlights a host of high-end properties that are fantastic values for Choice points and downright steals with Citi points now that they transfer 1 Citi point to 2 Choice Privileges points. Keep in mind also that many Nordic Choice properties (I believe all “Clarion Collection” properties and perhaps some others) offer both free breakfast and free dinner. Considering a McDonald’s meal in Oslo cost my wife and I about $35 a decade ago that can be a better value than you may expect.

I’m including this quick tip post in week in review because I know there are many relatively newly-minted Hyatt Globalists who may have both a Category 1-4 and 1-7 free night certificate thanks to Milestone benefits. Unfortunately Hyatt doesn’t provide a way to choose which certificate to use nor do they make it clear which one has been applied to your stay. You’ll want to avoid using a 1-7 on a Category 4 (or lower) property. A technique to “solve” that problem would be to attach that 1-7 cert to a placeholder reservation far in order to make sure it doesn’t accidentally get pulled though if you have more than one 1-4 certificate you’ll still want to pay attention to make sure that your sooner-expiring cert gets pulled first. This is frustrating stuff but good to know.

That’s it for this week at Frequent Miler. As always keep an eye out for this week’s last chance deals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xMy9jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS1qdXN0LXJvbGxlZC1vdXQtdGhlaXItbmV3LXZlbnR1cmUteC1wcmVtaXVtLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLXdoYXRzLWFsbC10aGUtaHlwZS1hYm91dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capital One Just Rolled Out Their New Venture X Premium Credit Card What's All The Hype About?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2021/11/13/capital-one-just-rolled-out-their-new-venture-x-premium-credit-card-whats-all-the-hype-about/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xMy9jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS1qdXN0LXJvbGxlZC1vdXQtdGhlaXItbmV3LXZlbnR1cmUteC1wcmVtaXVtLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLXdoYXRzLWFsbC10aGUtaHlwZS1hYm91dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdmVybm9yLm55Lmdvdi9uZXdzL2dvdmVybm9yLWhvY2h1bC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtdHJveS1vbmUtMTAtbWlsbGlvbi1jYXBpdGFsLXJlZ2lvbi13aW5uZXJzLWZpZnRoLXJvdW5kLWRvd250b3du0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Governor Hochul Announces Troy as One of the $10 Million Capital Region Winners of Fifth-Round Downtown ...,"Empire State Development Chief Operating Officer and Executive Deputy Commissioner Kevin Younis said ""Placemaking is at the heart of our economic development efforts with strategic investments that support projects designed to create vibrant and engaging communities.

A public relations firestorm erupted when the Green Bay Packers quarterback tested positive for COVID-19 and it was revealed he was unvaccinated although when asked the question in August he equivocated giving the impression to some that he was. After his diagnosis he then made the situation worse by talking about ""woke mobs"" ""cancel culture"" and NFL protocols he ignored because he didn't agree with them.

One business partner Prevea Health of Ashwaubenon cut ties with Rodgers immediately after he said he had not been vaccinated and was using unproven or disproved practices such as taking Ivermectin an anti-parasitic drug most often used in horses. Prevea has been an early and consistent promoter of vaccinations.

Rodgers won't resume being a spokesman for Prevea and likely won't become one for other health care organizations but his other endorsements might survive. According to Rodgers' page on the Online Sports Database he has endorsement deals with Adidas State Farm Sharpie IZOD Bose Capital One Bergstrom Automotive Zenith Watches TaylorMade Golf QuickBooks FedEx and Cash App.

Cash App said its deal was only for a couple of days on social media and ended before the COVID-19 issue came up. QuickBooks said its association with Rodgers was for a short campaign that ended in August. Capital One which responded after the story was published said it does not have an endorsement deal with Rodgers. Rodgers was a participant in a four-person celebrity golf match in July that was sponsored by Capital One.

Other companies contacted about Rodgers either declined to comment or did not respond with the exception of State Farm which said early on that it would stand behind Rodgers while simultaneously reducing the number of aired advertisements featuring him.

Although health care is not a part of the Rodgers appearances for State Farm trust is an important part of what the insurance company is selling said James Pokrywczynski associate professor of strategic communications at Marquette University in Milwaukee.

""I think what their strategy is they are going to bury his appearances deep in the vault and see how this thing plays out for a month or so. If he gets the team back in the playoffs State Farm will believe this has blown over"" he said.

None of his other endorsement partners has a direct tie to medical services or has Rodgers as an on-camera spokesman so they can afford to wait out the controversy which they appear to be doing.

""Those other brands there’s less of an issue there regarding the importance of trust in brand decision-making"" Pokrywczynski said.

But given a choice those brands prefer positive messages to surviving a public relations hullaballoo.

James Harris assistant professor of business administration-marketing at St. Norbert College in De Pere also said patience makes sense. While controversial Rodgers' actions likely have not damaged their brands.

""We do know this if somebody’s done a lot of harm and a company just cut ties their stock price goes up a notch. The sooner it's done the better. It's kind of a damage-control device"" he said. ""In this particular case I don’t think it’s a direct harm so the wait-and-see approach is probably what they are doing on purpose.""

If a company has taken a strong pro-vaccination stance an association with Rodgers could be problematic especially in its relationship with its own employees said Phil Clampitt professor of communications at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

""Otherwise their smart strategy would be to pull back and wait for this controversy to play out"" he said.

There is good reason why companies might be reluctant to cut ties with Rodgers. In a study completed in early October before Rodgers tested positive for COVID-19 The Action Network ranked Rodgers as the fourth most marketable player in the NFL behind Tom Brady Odell Beckham Jr. and Russell Wilson. Its formula looked at 20 factors across three core metrics: social media performance audience performance and overall likability.

The Action Network's rankings have not been recalculated in the wake of the COVID controversy but Rodgers may have a reservoir of goodwill in a marketing sense to draw on.

""As long as his teammates and coaches are supportive of him and he wins the Super Bowl this all goes away"" Clampitt said.

Also Rodgers will have to avoid the temptation to reassert his case. Shutting up might be difficult for him both because of his personality and because he'll certainly be asked about it the next time he faces reporters. But from a public relations standpoint deflection would be the prudent course Pokrywczynski said.

""There was a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that he acknowledged he was mistaken on a few claims. I think he should continue with that stance"" he said. ""'I’m here to talk about the game. I’ve answered that question as far as I’m going to answer it.'""

To be clear Rodgers offered a non-apology apology. He said he was sorry if people were offended by what he said but he isn't changing his opinion on any of it.

Pokrywczynski said the Packers organization also missed an opportunity to rein in the crisis.

""The coach said we are following all the protocols and it was pretty obvious all the protocols weren’t being followed"" he said. ""The team had a chance to say we are going to seriously review all our protocols and see where we can do better. That would have softened it. I think the team missed that.""

The Packers were fined $300000 by the NFL for not following protocols and Rodgers and teammate Allen Lazard were fined $14650 each for the same offense.

Social media can make public relations problems worse and it might have an effect on how soon this controversy passes. Social media can amplify a controversy but it also rushes to the next issue when it comes along leaving current controversies behind. In either case it is another reason why companies might lie low instead of reacting to what Rodgers did and said.

The typical reaction to a such a crisis is to address the issue offer a solution and follow through quickly which usually tamps down the fuss but social media changes that calculation Harris said. The better action now by less-affected brands may be to do and say nothing that will poke the social media bear.

""We have an environment right now where things that weren’t controversial before are. And now you have to take a political edge to it. And 'Wow this is just amplified noise and feeling'"" Harris said.

Rightly or wrongly winning could be the fastest way to make the controversy dissipate.

""If he wins people tend to forget about things. Some of them will forgive him"" Harris said. ""We are talking about a fan base that is broad and deep and represents all kinds of interests.""

Clampitt said Rodgers previously had a squeaky-clean image. That might not hold true going forward.

""He didn’t lie he equivocated. When you equivocate you run the risk people are going to take it the wrong way. People delay judgment. Now the judgment came"" he said.

In the end there's no question Rodgers was duplicitous and people can put that wherever they like on the continuum of lies Harris said.

""It's not a great look"" he said. ""When you talk about celebrity and endorsers one of the aspects that goes into it is trust and expertise. He was trusted because he is an aspirant person and he does well on the football field and everybody likes ‘go team.’

""The problem is some of these folks start thinking they are experts in every area because they tend to be listened to. And that expertise just got whacked and whacked down.""

Kicking off a program of seven-night cruises to the Bahamas the Spirit-class vessel is returning to service after a 20-month break.

As the 15th vessel to resume commercial operations for Carnival Cruise Line the Legend is now set to depart Maryland every Sunday.

While in 2021 the ship’s regular itinerary includes calls in Freeport and Nassau in addition to Half Moon Cay or Princess Cays cruises to additional destinations are featured in 2022.

In January for instance the Legend is offering a one-time 14-night cruise to the Panama Canal visiting four ports in the Caribbean and the Bahamas.

The Carnival Legend originally entered service in 2002 as the third vessel of Carnival’s Spirit Class.

Designed to travel to a wider array of destinations the ships in this class were built to the Panamax specs allowing them to pass through the original Panama Canal.

Built with a multi-deck atrium a glass-enclosed pool deck and a large number of cabins with private balconies the ship underwent a major refurbishment in 2014.

The multi-million-dollar renovation added an array of innovations including the WaterWorks aqua park highlighted by Green Thunder one of the steepest and fastest waterslide at sea the tropics-inspired RedFrog Pub and a full-service sushi restaurant called Bonsai Sushi.

While being prepared for its service resumption the 2100-guest ship also visited the shipyard. At a drydock in France it underwent regular maintenance and a change of hull colors receiving Carnival’s new blue red and white livery.

The Legend is the second ship to resume service for Carnival in Baltimore. After welcoming guests back in Maryland in September the Carnival Pride recently repositioned to Tampa where it’s launching a series of Western Caribbean cruises.

In November Carnival Cruise Line continued its restart plan with the addition of two more ships to the active lineup. In addition to the Carnival Legend the brand reactivated the Carnival Valor for a series of sailing from New Orleans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9wYXJpcy1oaWx0b24tY2FydGVyLXJldW0td2VkZGluZy1jYXJuaXZhbC1uZW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paris Hilton Celebrates Wedding Weekend with Neon Carnival Party,"Paris Hilton took her wedding festivities to a whole new level with a carnival afterparty.

The reality star 40 and her new husband Carter Reum celebrated getting hitched with a themed event at the Santa Monica Pier on Friday.

Hilton and Reum 40 wed in Los Angeles on Thursday and carried their celebration over into the next day with a couple's carnival. The colorful bash featured carnival treats like lemonade funnel cakes and hot dogs plus Hilton-themed games a ferris wheel a DJ and performers plus more classic attractions all of which Hilton featured on her Instagram Story.

Diplo provided a soundtrack for the night with Hilton recording snippets of his set.

""Thank you Diplo for making my fairytale wedding weekend even more lit! Love you bro"" Hilton wrote over a video of herself and the DJ.

In another video she wrote ""Best wedding weekend ever"" and tagged Diplo her sister Nicky Hilton and fashion journalist Derek Blasberg who all attended the Friday festivities.

For her party on the pier Hilton wore head-to-toe neon pink. The newlywed arrived in a hot pink Alice and Olivia dress featuring a sequined mesh top and an asymmetrical tulle skirt which she accessorized with a pink leather purse and matching platform boots sparkly heart-shaped shades and of course a pink veil by Maison Ava.

Reum coordinated with the bride sporting a navy tracksuit with a hot pink sweatshirt underneath. In one photo from their celebration Reum can be seen holding Hilton as the two grin in their matching looks while posing in front of a Paris-themed ring toss game.

Hilton invited plenty of famous friends to her bash including Gigi Gorgeous and Lance Bass plus her mom Kathy Hilton and aunt Kyle Richards. Demi Lovato was also at the party and they posed for a photo with Hilton while dressed in an all-green outfit featuring a furry coat and matching sunglasses.

Lovato stopped by Hilton's carnival reception after attending her Thursday wedding where Lovato performed ""I Will Always Love You"" at the reception.

Hilton and Reum tied the knot about two years after they first began dating in November 2019. The couple got engaged in February when Reum got down on one knee during a beachside proposal on a private island.

Hilton — who was previously engaged to Chris Zylka before the pair split in 2018 — added ""After my last breakup I thought I was going to be alone forever.""

""I was like I give up. I'll just focus on myself. I don't need anyone"" she shared.

In that time the ship has been waiting for the first guests to embark while also getting a new livery and going through dry-dock.

Carnival Legend will be based year-round in Baltimore initially sailing cruises to the Bahamas; next year the itinerary will include cruises to Bermuda The Panama Canal Canada & New England and the Eastern Caribbean. In 2023 the ship will sail on two extraordinary Greenland cruises from Baltimore.

Sailing the Bahamas from Baltimore

Carnival Legend will be operating cruises to the Bahamas from the port of Baltimore giving guests from Maryland and nearby Washington D.C. a welcome break in the sun. The 7-day cruises will visit a variety of ports in the Bahamas. The Carnival cruise ship replaced Carnival Pride which starts operating from Tampa Bay on November 14.

Carnival Legend’s cruise departs this Sunday November 14 on a course towards Nassau Princess Cays and Freeport which will be the same on her next voyage on November 21. On November 28 the ship will sail on a cruise calling in Nassau Half Moon Cay and Freeport.

In the new year sailing on January 9 guests can enjoy a more extended cruise including a visit to the Panama Canal. The 14-day cruise will first call at Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas the private island for Carnival.

After that the ship will make its way to Ocho Rios Jamaica Puerto Limon Costa Rica and the Panama Canal on January 17. After a visit to Grand Turk Island the ship will return to Baltimore on January 23.

Dry Dock A New Livery and a new Flag State

Carnival Legend first sailed in 2002; the 88500 gross tons cruise ship has a guest capacity of 2124 at double occupancy. Although she is already 21 years old guests boarding Carnival Legend will enjoy a fresh look to the vessel. In September of this year she left her dry dock in Marseille France sporting the new red white and blue livery.

During the 20-month pause in operations other works done onboard include The Arcade being relocated to Deck 3 and now branded as The Warehouse. This replaces the chapel and library on Deck 3. The space where the Arcade was has been converted to The Cove a kids retreat.

Another change for Carnival Legend is her new flag-state. The ship was reflagged to the Bahamas at the end of October and she is now the sixth Carnival Cruise Ship sailing under the Bahamian flag.

More Excitement to Come for Carnival Legend

Greenland is perhaps not the first place where one would imagine a Carnival Cruise ship operating; however when Carnival released a one-time Greenland cruise onboard Carnival Legend the head office must have been surprised that the cruise sold out in less than 24 hours.

So much was the demand for the Greenland cruise sailing from Baltimore that Carnival decided to include one more cruise to the wild and remote island. The first cruise that sold out will sail on September 2 2023 while the second Greenland cruise that Carnival scheduled will sail earlier on August 13 2023.

With cruises to a wide variety of locations year-round there is more than enough choice for guests from Baltimore. Whether warm or cold weather cruises it looks like Carnival Legend is an excellent and more than convenient choice to sail with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmNhY3Rpb25uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlZ2lvbi10YW1wYS9mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUtaW4tbmVhcmx5LTIteWVhcnMtYS1jYXJuaXZhbC1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcC1zZXQtc2FpbC1mcm9tLXRoZS1wb3J0LW9mLXRhbXBh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Pride sets sail from Port Tampa Bay,"TAMPA Fla. — Carnival Cruises are back in the Tampa Bay area. The Carnival Pride is the first Carnival ship to set sail from Port Tampa Bay since the pandemic shut down.

“I am extremely excited” said passenger Philip Piant.

Piant isn’t the only one excited. In fact even with masks on you could still see the huge smiles and joy on everyone’s face as they waited to board the ship.

“There is a lot of fun to have on the ship and a lot of good times” Piant said. “That’s why we sail as much as we do.”

Piant is cruising with his special lady Maribeth Kring. They’re VIP guests like the hundreds of others who got on the ship first.

“We are making up for lost time” Kring said. “To have the cruises back means a lot for our local economy and anybody who depends on cruising. A lot of people have been hurting for long time.”

According to the city one ship alone brings in more than $334000 to small businesses. And for the port cruise ships make up 20% of the revenue.

“We have been very busy working maintaining the terminals preparing for this day” said Raul Alfonso Executive Vice President for the Port of Tampa. “We are glad to be here at this day. Back to fun and be safe.""

There are nearly 1600 passengers on board and all of the passengers on board must be vaccinated. There are exceptions for guests under 12. All guests must take a COVID-19 test and show proof of their negative results before boarding. The crew and staff are all also required to be vaccinated.

“We do have a mask policy in doors in some areas where we can not social distance” said Sara Beth Reno Vice President of guest operations. “Guests will still have fun and enjoy their time on board like they did before the pandemic even started.”

Russia’s behemoth Admiral Nakhimov cruiser is set to return to service after spending the past two decades in the shipyard.

“We can say that our work is proceeding on schedule… I believe that the cruiser will enter trials in 2023” Deputy CEO of Russia’s United Shipbuilding Corporation for Military Shipbuilding Vladimir Korolyov told reporters earlier this week. Nakhimov was stowed in Russia’s Sevmash shipyard for repairs by 1999; however work on the cruiser began in earnest only after 2013. Admiral Nakhimov was previously scheduled to begin trials in 2021 and rejoin the Navy in 2022 but that timeline was reportedly pushed back due to unspecified “problems with suppliers.”

Boasting a displacement of 28000 tons under full load the Kirov class is the largest and heaviest class of surface combatant ships in the world. Within Russia’s Navy the Kirov cruisers come second only to the problem-ridden 58000-ton Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier. Meant to serve alongside a planned but never-realized line of nuclear-powered Soviet aircraft carriers The Kirov class was to herald a new age of global Soviet power projection.

The warship that became Admiral Nakhimov was commissioned in 1988 under the name Kalinin and—as with all the other Kirov cruisers—renamed in the early 1990’s following the Soviet collapse. The warship was armed to the teeth in keeping with its main purpose of holding U.S strategic submarines and carrier strike groups at risk. Nakhimov carried as many as twenty P-700 Granit cruise missiles ten torpedo tubes that likewise supported anti-submarine missiles four anti-submarine rocket launchers from RBU family the naval variant of the S-300 surface-to-air missile system and six units of the Kashtan close-in weapon system.

The Vladimir Putin administration considered modernizing all four of the cruisers that the Russian Navy inherited from its Soviet predecessor but eventually decided to sacrifice one-half of the Kirov fleet to free up the funds needed to save the other. Admiral Ushakov and Admiral Lazarev are scheduled to be scrapped in 2021 while Nakhimov and Petr Velikiy will be repaired and refitted. There are few details on the progress of the work being done on Nakhimov. Korolyov noted without elaborating that the engineers conducting the refit had to address numerous issues surrounding the cruiser’s power plant. He added that the Sevmash team is in the midst of revamping the ship’s missile launch systems.

Nakhimov is expected to be upgraded with a deeply revamped weapons arsenal as part of its ongoing modernization. It is widely believed that both Nakhimov and Petr Velikiy will receive Russia’s new 3M22 Tsirkon is a winged anti-ship hypersonic cruise missile as well as a naval variant of the S-400 missile defense system P-800 Oniks supersonic anti-ship missiles and Kalibr cruise missiles.

The full extent of Moscow’s deployment plans for Nakhimov are unclear but the cruiser is projected to remain in the Northern Fleet after entering service. Both Admiral Nakhimov and Petr Velikiy are expected to serve well into the coming decades.

These military exercises are taking place in China’s Taklamakan desert.

Images received by USNI from satellite imaging firm Maxar revealed that there are full-scale outlines of at least two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers together with a U.S. aircraft carrier. They are set up as targets in the Ruoqiang region in Central China. The new target range could be proof that Beijing is continuing to focus on reinforcing and refining its anti-carrier capabilities with a special focus on U.S. Navy warships.

The large aircraft carrier-shaped target appears relatively simple with no major detailing. However other warship targets shown in the images revealed substantial detailing with upright poles strategically placed on them. The poles could potentially be designed for installing instrumentation. They can also be used for radar reflectors so as to simulate the vessels’ superstructure.

“The mockups of several probable U.S. warships (mounted on rails and mobile) could simulate targets related to seeking/target acquisition testing. This and the extensive detail of the mockups including the placement of multiple sensors on and around the vessel targets it is probable that this area is intended for multiple uses over time” according to a summary provided by AllSource Analysis the company that provided the Maxar satellite images to USNI News.

In the past communist China has built similar aircraft carrier targets in deserts. In 2003 Beijing constructed a large concrete pad the size of an aircraft carrier as part of the Shuangchengzi missile test range. The pad has undergone frequent firing exercises and is regularly repaired for further testing.

The new site in the Taklamakan desert is located 600 miles away from Shuangchengzi and is far more advanced. It has been designed with target structures that have much more technical detailing so as to provide improved representations of the vessels being targeted. Although the Iranian Navy also has a target structure based on the profile of an aircraft carrier China’s new facility in the desert is more sophisticated.

Communist China has been intently focused on the development and testing of anti-ship ballistic missiles for years. The Pentagon has raised concerns about communist China’s rapidly expanding nuclear capabilities. This military unease between two global superpowers is developing just as China amps up tensions in the South China Sea and aggressively threatens Taiwan.

John Kirby a spokesperson for the Pentagon recently stated that communist China is building up maritime and aviation capabilities with the specific aim of blocking the United States from accessing parts of the Indo-Pacific region.

A Pentagon report warned of Beijing’s increasing missile capabilities. DF-21D and DF-26 called carrier-killers are two China-made ballistic missiles that can target ships. DF-21D “gives the PLA the capability to conduct long range precision strikes against ships including aircraft carriers out to the Western Pacific from mainland China” the report stated."

You don't have to tell anyone in Ontario or Quebec about the damage that can be done by Lymantria dispar also known to some as gypsy moth caterpillars.

The invasive species ate its way through Central Canada this summer gobbling up all the leaves they could find.

In addition to terrorizing trees though the caterpillars left a lesser-known problem for local waterways.

In this week's Riskin Report CTV News Science and Technology Specialist Dan Riskin explains what scientists have just learned about how Lymantria dispar can affect the careful chemical balance of lakes and streams.

IFAS

Found in the Eastern US from Maine to Florida the pine webworm (Pococera robustella) impacts several species of pines in the first year or two of growth.

While less common older saplings and branches of larger trees can also be impacted by these unsightly larval nests. While this can be a worry to see they are often of little concern for the long-term health of the infected plants.

The pine webworm is the larval stage of the pine webworm moth. Females lay eggs in masses of 1-10 on the flat surface of the pine needles from about April-October. The youngest larvae feed by mining into the needles (1st-3rd instar stages). As the larvae grow they no longer fit inside the needle causing them to move outside for the final instar stages (4th-6th instar stages). It is as this time that they become more obvious on the plant. These older larvae work together to build a nest using fecal matter pine needles and silk. This is referred to as a frass nest and can be found on the main stem of young plants.

Management of the pest is usually not warranted as natural predators keep populations in check. If you notice them in your landscape you can handpick the nests and larvae for removal. If your property is too large to manage in this way you can apply Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis). This is a bacterium that infects any caterpillar larvae once ingested. It can take a few days to see the results. These management methods are not practical for larger plants or forested areas. In those cases it is best to let the natural predators manage the population.

Common Florida pines that can be impacted include loblolly (Pinus taeda) longleaf (Pinus palustris) sand (Pinus clausa) and slash (Pinus elliotii).

It was that period between bag phones and smartphones when you really had the classics like well any phone that had the word Nokia emblazoned on the front.

Then you had the clamshell-shaped phones starting with the Motorola StarTAC in 1996 and culminating with the most popular ever released the Motorola RAZR from 2004. While you might think flip phones mostly disappeared with the emergence of touchscreen smartphones they’ve slowly started making a comeback in the form of flexible screen devices from Samsung and others.

There’s another that just hit the market from a brand you might not expect: Cat the flagship brand of construction and mining equipment company Caterpillar. They actually produce several phones including this new take on a classic design packing modern features a rugged build and a refreshingly low price.

Meet the Cat S22 Flip

The product description page sums it up pretty well: “The Cat S22 Flip takes the cell phone back to what it should be … a phone.” Sure it’s a flip phone reminiscent of what you would see 20 years ago complete with a physical T9 keyboard and large buttons but that’s not all — this phone is also designed to take a beating.

IP68 rating: sand dust dirt humidity and salt mist resistant

Waterproof up to 5 feet for 35 minutes

Drop tested up to 6 feet onto steel

T-Mobile exclusive available now for $234

As you can see it’s not just a flip phone. The color display is a touchscreen that also works with wet fingers and through gloves. Although it is a more limited version of Android 11 you still have access to the Google Play Store apps.

The most important part is the fact that it’s supposed to be rugged. That could very well appeal to people in many different fields including industrial roles construction drivers first responders military farmers — basically any job where your phone is at risk of being damaged.

Going back in time

I was pretty excited when offered the opportunity to review the Cat S22 Flip and opening the box was like a blast from the past. It reminded me of a bulkier version of a Samsung flip phone I carried about two decades ago.

It’s 4.7″ x 2.4″ and is nearly an inch thick when closed so it is a little larger than flip phones of days gone by. Below see how the Flip compares to my iPhone 13 Pro Max.

I charged it up installed the SIM card and powered it on. Since it runs on Android the first thing to do is sign into your Google account where you have the option to import information like contacts payment methods and apps.

I actually didn’t mind using the smaller touchscreen with haptic feedback that reminded me of an old Blackberry Pearl. Yes it’s a smaller screen than you’re used to so precise finger placement is a must. Another thing I noticed is that it wasn’t as snappy to respond as modern smartphones which is due to the much less powerful processor.

It’s a strange experience using such a small touchscreen to try shopping on the Amazon app. Needless to say I didn’t complete a purchase.

What about the whole phone thing?

Again the Cat S22 Flip isn’t meant to take on a smartphone — it’s supposed to first and foremost be a phone like these things used to be. And it succeeds.

This is an exclusive from our sponsor T-Mobile and service quality will depend on where you live. I’m in a northwest Phoenix suburb with typically so-so cell coverage (see my other recent review on a whole home cell booster) and as expected I had about two bars of service.

Regardless phone calls sounded good as I moved through the house. The speakerphone sounded okay but the external speaker was obviously designed to be loud not to be that perfect mix of vocals treble and bass. You can also easily pair this phone with Bluetooth earbuds.

As far as texting goes no you don’t have to relive the dark days of using a T9 keyboard (pressing the 9 key three times to type a Y for instance). You can instead use the keyboard on the small touchscreen but precision is vital.

A few other things

Since it runs Android 11 Go Edition you can install apps from the Google Play Store. That is after you complete the initial setup.

I also tried the built-in FM radio. Reception on certain stations was acceptable not so much on others. But it’s a neat novelty to have built-in for those who have no interest in streaming music apps.

As you can see below the 5MP rear camera works just fine but don’t expect the quality you’ll find in smartphones with multiple lenses and advanced software. In case you’re wondering that’s Daphne my 4-month-old yellow Labrador.

Final thoughts: Is the Cat S22 Flip worth it?

To sum things up this is a well-built phone that’s certainly made to take on harsh conditions. With that said that means it’s also not going to be for everyone.

The Cat S22 Flip is marketed towards people who want a rugged device and one that’s first and foremost just a phone. While you can’t beat the $234 price tag remember that it is a T-Mobile exclusive and will not work with any other carrier.

If that still manages to check all the boxes for what you’re searching for then this flip phone will fit the bill."

The landmarked but empty and construction-marred Martinique Hotel will soon rise from the ashes thanks to a just-closed hard-won leasehold purchase of the long-troubled property at Greeley Square.



The previously bankrupt hotel will reopen in stages starting as early as December although 12 to 18 months of mostly exterior work lie ahead. It will again be branded as Curio Collection by Hilton the flag it last carried before the pandemic shut it down.

The rebirth reflects the rising fortunes of the Broadway Nomad-area corridor south of 34th Street where new Ritz-Carlton and Virgin hotels and hip restaurants such as The Smith have replaced wholesalers and an ugly sidewalk bazaar.



“Turning the lights back on at the Martinique will be a booster shot for Greeley Square and Herald Square” said a plugged-in Midtown South observer.

4 Investors from the Midwest are pouring tens of millions into renovating the Martinique Hotel. Nelson Lee

The Martinique’s rescue didn’t come easily. The buyer is surprisingly not an overseas investor but a little-known company in the Midwest — Oklahoma City-based developer Burnett Equity. Burnett closed on the $55 million leasehold purchase last week sources revealed. Burnett is mostly active in Oklahoma with commercial and residential projects. It’s expected to pump up to $60 million more into the Martinique’s stalled restoration project.

The 1897-vintage Martinique at 1260 Broadway at West 32nd Street was believed to be the city’s longest continuously-operating hotel until it closed for the pandemic. At different periods in its history it was a luxury hotel an SRO and most recently a sound destination for middle-market travelers.

We first reported the leasehold offering back in March. Marcus & Millichap brokers Eric Anton and Nelson Lee were tapped by the landowner a private investor from Florida in December 2020 to market the bankrupt leasehold which had 68 years left on it.

The mortgage fell into foreclosure after the leaseholder died in late 2020. Adding to the challenge the 530-room property also had 34000 square feet of retail space that was vacant except for a small Chase bank branch. The property’s landmark status meant that the renovation work had to be handled with kid gloves and construction was years behind schedule.

But the toughest obstacle facing a new owner was that the ground lease had “very onerous terms” a source told us.

“Appraisers told the brokers not to waste their time — the whole ball of wax was worthless” we’re told.

But Anton and Lee pressed the search for a buyer. “They expected to receive offers from overseas investors who regard New York as cheap. They did but they were surprised to also hear from Oklahoma City” an insider related.

Analysts speculated last winter that the leasehold could fetch $70 million to $75 million. But two circumstances resulted in a price cut. The unfinished facade restoration faced more costs to complete than were expected. Plus the ground lease needed adjusting to make it more finance-able. The parties were able to agree on altered terms after several months of negotiating.

Mission Capital a division of Marcus & Millichap stepped in to secure acquisition financing for Burnett Equity.

Meanwhile retail brokers Danny Volk and Andy Kim were tapped to fill the empty storefronts. Even before the leasehold deal was done they managed to score leases for yet-to-be-named Korean-themed cafes on the 32nd Street side and an upscale American bistro on Broadway.

The stores and eateries will open over the next year.

An exuberant Anton said “After a year of working on this complicated deal during the dark days of Covid I can’t wait to embarrass myself singing karaoke at the new Martinique. It will be the most fun hotel in the city with five restaurants at the crossroads of Koreatown and Nomad.”

Expanding workplace provider Industrious signed a 10-year 43874-square-foot partnership agreement with Sapir Organization’s 261 Madison Ave. a midcentury tower two blocks from Grand Central Terminal. It will take over the entire ninth and tenth floors which were previously part of WeWork.

Landlord CEO Alex Sapir said “As more companies return to work and look for cutting-edge space near transit hubs 261 and 260 Madison are poised to play a leading role in Midtown’s office recovery.”



Industrious real estate director Doug Feinberg said that small and mid-sized companies are “looking for solutions to their return-to-work plans” and flex space is the answer for many.



Industrious has provided workplaces for companies including RR Donnelley Cisco Lyft Spotify Heineken Chipotle Pinterest and Salesforce.



CBRE repped both sides on the deal — Sacha Zarba and Alice Fair for Industrious and a team led by Peter Turchin and Gregg Rothkin for Sapir.





Lefrak’s 40 W. 57th St. is one of those successful midtown towers that rarely has much available space. The 800000-square-footer is 97 percent leased after five new and renewal leases totaling 100000 square feet were just signed.



The largest deal was a 50000-square-foot renewal for Givaudan a Swiss manufacturer of flavors fragrances and “active cosmetic ingredients.”



New leases were signed for A&E Real Estate and Lightyear Capital while Drasana Capital and Elmwood Asset Management Capital both expanded within the building.

Lincoln based estate planning and will writing specialists Simpler Law has bought a new 8000 sq ft headquarters building in the city – and created 20 new jobs

The property formerly owned by Allocate Software was acquired as part of Simpler Law’s ongoing expansion programme which has also included the growth of its team from 15 people to now over 60 within the last couple of years.

Working on behalf of the vendor with joint agent CBRE the commercial property agency team at Banks Long & Co brokered the deal. Simpler Law has now left its former 2000 sq ft premises in Pioneer Way in 2016 to the new offices on Low Moor Road.

Andy Townsend Simpler Law managing director who initially set up the business in 2004 said: “The business continues on its journey of rapid growth. Since 2016 our team has grown by over four times its original size. It came to a stage where we simply outgrew our surroundings. Banks Long & Co suggested that Nibley House might suit our needs and on viewing we could see that it gives us the space to future proof our plans for further growth as we look to recruit an additional 20 colleagues within the next 12 months to meet demand.

“Last year alone the business took on an additional 12000 clients and we plan to add a further 15000 again this year. It’s a great success story for a Lincoln organisation and we’re proud to be able to create local jobs and keep our roots firmly in the county with our new office.”

Will Wall director at Banks Long & Co said: “It’s great to see a growing local business like Simpler Law showing such a commitment to growth. We’re sure that this prominent extensive building will enable them to build on their success to date. We’ve noted an increasing number of similar employers encouraging staff to return to the office even on a part-time hybrid model. This has resulted in a rise in office enquiries and we’ve therefore agreed deals for several large Lincoln offices such as Nibley House.”",,,,,,

Unmut am Industriepark Höchst in Frankfurt: Der neue Winter-Fahrplan des RMV bringt Verschlechterungen für zahlreiche Pendler mit sich.

Frankfurt – Der neue Winter-Fahrplan des Rhein-Main Verkehrsverbunds (RMV) ist da - und für hunderte Mitarbeiter im Industriepark Höchst in Frankfurt könnte er Ärger mit sich bringen. Grund: Mit Beginn des neuen Fahrplans am 12. Dezember werden drei Züge aus Richtung Limburg nicht mehr wie bisher am Industriepark an der Station Farbwerke halten sondern weiter bis zum etwa zwei Kilometer entfernten Bahnhof in Höchst fahren. Betroffen sind die Züge in der Hauptverkehrszeit zwischen 6.30 und 7.30 Uhr. Und auch für den Heimweg am Abend hält ein Zug der Regionalbahn nicht mehr am Industriepark an.

Dagegen regt sich nun Widerstand auf breiter Front. „Die vielen Kolleginnen und Kollegen aus dem Raum Limburg die mit der Bahn zu ihrem Arbeitsplatz im Industriepark fahren wollen sind verärgert - und das zu Recht“ erklärt Ralf Erkens von der Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau Chemie Energie. Er fährt fort: „Ohne Not wird ihnen nun ein deutlich längerer Weg zur Arbeit zugemutet“. Mancher überlege schon aufs Auto umzusteigen um Zeit zu sparen. In Zeiten des Klimawandels und der dringend nötigen Einsparung von CO2 könne das aber natürlich nicht die Lösung sein.

Neuer RMV-Fahrplan in Frankfurt: Hoffen auf Hilfe aus der Politik

Die Betroffenen fordern laut Erkens den Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV) auf die Entscheidung rückgängig zu machen. Um ihre Position zu untermauern hätten Betriebsräte in vielen der rund 90 Chemie- und Pharmaunternehmen im Industriepark eine Unterschriftenaktion gestartet.

Erste Politiker wie Frank Groos der Bürgermeister von Brechen haben sich bereits gegen den Wegfall der Station „Farbwerke“ ausgesprochen erklärt Wolfgang Röpke stellvertretender Betriebsratsvorsitzender von Celanese einem der Nachfolgeunternehmen der ehemaligen Hoechst AG. In Nicht-Corona-Zeiten wenn das Home Office entfalle so schätzt er seien um die 200 oder mehr Leute davon betroffen.

RMV-Züge in Frankfurt gestrichen: „Wann klappt es mit der S-Bahn schon mal reibungslos?“

Sie hätten dann abgesehen vom Umstieg aufs Auto nur zwei Möglichkeiten: „Entweder sie steigen vorher in Hofheim vom Zug auf die S-Bahn um - und erreichen dann mit viel viel Glück ohne allzu großen Zeitverlust den Industriepark“ zählt Röpke auf und fügt mit Blick auf mögliche Stellwerkstörungen hinzu: „Aber wann klappt es mit der S-Bahn schon mal reibungslos?“ Oder aber die dritte Variante sie führen mit dem Zug nach Höchst weiter um entweder zu Fuß zum Nord-Tor zu laufen oder die S-Bahn zum Farbwerke-Halt zu nehmen. „In jedem Fall bedeutet dies aber eine zusätzlich Tarifstufe“ gibt er zu bedenken. Damit entstünden zusätzliche Kosten die sich nach seiner Rechnung pro Kollegen auf etwa 400 bis 700 Euro im Jahr belaufen dürften.

Derweil bestätigt eine Sprecherin der Deutschen Bahn auf Anfrage „dass drei Halte der Regionalzüge aus Limburg am Morgen und der Halt eines Zuges nach Limburg am Nachmittag mit dem Fahrplanwechsel nicht mehr möglich sind“.

Züge am Industriepark Höchst in Frankfurt gestrichen: Entscheidung für „stabileren Fahrplan“

Dies liege aber weder an fehlender Relevanz oder Home Office sondern vielmehr daran dass das Schienennetz am Bahnknoten Frankfurt zum Teil überlastet sei. Die DB Netz AG die für die Vergabe der Trassen an die Eisenbahnverkehrsunternehmen zuständig sei könne leider nicht immer alle Bestellungen erfüllen. „Von dem Verzicht auf die zusätzlichen Halte in der Hauptverkehrszeit versprechen wir uns eine bessere Fahrplanstabilität auf der gesamten vielbefahrenen Strecke“ erklärte die Sprecherin weiter.

Fahrgäste aus Richtung Limburg mit dem Ziel Farbwerke Höchst könnten ab dem 12. Dezember in Hofheim am selben Bahnsteig in die S2 einsteigen. „Da dies nur mit einer geringen Fahrzeitverlängerung einhergeht hoffen wir sehr auf die Akzeptanz und das Verständnis der Reisenden“ sagt sie abschließend.

Its Managed Care segment offers health plan coverage to individuals through government-subsidized programs including Medicaid state children's health insurance programs long-term services and support foster care and Medicare-Medicaid plans . The Specialty Services segment provides pharmacy benefits management services; nurse advice line and after-hours support services; and vision and dental services as well as staffing services to correctional systems and other government agencies; and services to Military Health System eligible beneficiaries. This segment offers its services and products to state programs correctional facilities healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations.

Activist Commentary: Politan Capital Management was founded by Quentin Koffey. Most recently Koffey led the activism strategy at Senator Investment Group. Prior to that he led the activist practice at DE Shaw and before that he was at Elliott Associates. Koffey is operating Politan more like a private equity fund than a traditional long-short equity hedge fund as it can draw down locked up capital to give it enough time to accomplish its goals through active engagement with boards and management teams to improve governance operations or strategic direction. Politan looks for (i) high quality businesses that underperform their peers or potential (ii) where there is a clear fix and (iii) a clear pathway to implement that fix.

Centene is a managed care organization that provides health plan coverage to individuals through government-subsidized and commercial programs. Centene is hired by states and it works to improve the quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries as well as those of other government programs. The company receives a contracted premium per member and is responsible for medical costs. This reprices annually. Centene provides its services to many states which in turn also work with Centene's peers. This leads to a very stable predictable revenue flow for Centene. Moreover the states work with Centene and its peers to produce actuarially sound margins preventing these companies from making or losing a windfall on their services.

This is a very low margin business with net profit margins from 2% to 4%. When 2 percentage points of margin is the difference between doubling your profits or not the valuation of these businesses largely depends on how costs are managed. In this regard Centene has been significantly underperforming its peers with a 2.4% profit margin versus WellCare (which Centene recently acquired) at 4.2% and Molina Healthcare at 4.5%. Part of the reason why Centene's margins lag its peers is because it has been growing primarily through acquisitions most recently acquiring WellCare at a transaction valued at $19.6 billion. These acquisitions need to be integrated and operations need to be centralized.

Fortunately there is clear a roadmap to success here as this is exactly what management at WellCare and Molina did to bring their margins up. But this process has to start at the Board and this is where Koffey's activist expertise will come into play. Historically he has partnered with experienced industry operators as board candidates (i.e. CoreLogic – Bill Foley Lowe's – David Batchelder) and in this situation he has brought in Kenneth Burdick and Wayne DeVeydt. Burdick is the former CEO of WellCare who oversaw its margin improvement and DeVeydt is the former CFO of Anthem Inc. They are obvious choices to add to the board and with five spots up this year on the company's Board we expect Politan to name two additional and likely diverse nominees.

This is a board that is desperately in need of refreshment – the average tenure of the current Board is 11 years and the average age of the directors is 70 (both would be higher but for the new directors added only because of the WellCare merger). Over half the board has a tenure of over 15 years (versus 1% of all S&P 500 directors). The company's CEO is 78 years old and has served on the board for 25 years. Its lead director is 87 years old has also served on the board for 25 years and has been lead director that entire time (versus an average lead director's tenure of four years for S&P 500 companies). This company needs for the first time since it went public a board of experienced directors and fresh eyes to hold management accountable and develop a comprehensive succession plan.

Politan's style is to amicably and quietly work with management to achieve its objectives. They do not send angry public letters and they do not seek proxy fights. However they will also not back down from a proxy fight if their hand is forced: Koffey showed that at CoreLogic and Hess. Politan is likely going to strongly advocate for Burdick and DeVeydt as directors. In the end they will be more focused on how qualified and engaged the directors are – and less concerned with where they came from. This is a situation that should settle but if this does go to a proxy fight we expect that Politan will prevail. A new board that holds the right management team accountable can replicate what Burdick did at WellCare and getting the margins to 4.5% could lead to a tripling of the company's stock price.

It’s a serious shortfall that’s expected to leave plans for roads bridges and other infrastructure throughout the state waiting on the drawing board for years to come.

Earlier this year the shortfall had been estimated at $7 billion. The NCDOT has been warning of funding shortfalls since 2020 when significantly less driving caused gas tax revenue to dry up.

The new problem though is sharply rising costs which NCDOT massively underestimated. These costs are tied to rising prices for materials labor land acquisition and fuel all of which make construction more expensive.

While projects already underway are likely to continue some could be scaled back. The financial troubles probably mean some projects that were anticipated to start in just a few years could be pushed back to an undetermined date. In Charlotte that includes dozens of projects big and small from adding lanes to Independence Boulevard to widening N.C. 51 in Matthews and Statesville Road in Huntersville. The NCDOT is responsible for many of the biggest roads in Charlotte including major thoroughfares like Independence Boulevard Pineville-Matthews Road and W.T. Harris Boulevard.

Since last summer the state has revised more than 1000 separate estimates for right-of-way utility and construction costs in more than 450 transportation projects according to an NCDOT presentation. In some cases costs have more than doubled from their initial projections.

“I doubt that there is much of the public or even the elected officials that understands exactly what’s going on” said Andy Wells an NCDOT board member from Hickory in an interview this week with Transit Time. “This is a really big deal.”

The concerns are starting to rise statewide. In Hickory officials worry about delays in widening I-40. In Wilmington officials said in September that they’re concerned that a replacement for the aging Cape Fear Memorial Bridge could get delayed because of NCDOT's future shortfall. In Charlotte officials are starting to express concern about plans for Independence and W.T. Harris boulevards.

Effect on Charlotte

Tony Lathrop a Charlotte attorney who serves on the NCDOT board and chairs its finance committee said it’s too early to say what exact effects the funding problems will have on Charlotte transportation developments. But he said there will be impacts.

“It’s really pretty preliminary right now. There's no way to say yet which projects here in our area are going to be affected unfortunately” he said. “It’s pretty clear there's going to be some shuffling around.”

In some cases officials are anticipating that local money will have to replace funding that would otherwise come from the state.

An NCDOT manager told Charlotte-area transportation planners at a meeting in September that the department is “value engineering” its existing projects in an attempt to reduce their costs. Value engineering is planner-speak for looking at ways to reduce costs by removing or altering nonessential features in a project.

‘Sticks and strings’ in University City: In Charlotte’s University City area for example that could mean eliminating nonessential improvements to N.C. 49 in front of UNC Charlotte. Tobe Holmes interim executive director of University City Partners said he heard recently from the Charlotte Department of Transportation that promised projects in the University area would be shaved down in order to cut costs in light of the funding shortfall.

The state has been planning for years to convert more than a mile of N.C. 49 near UNC Charlotte into a six-lane “superstreet” with limited turns designed to speed traffic. Holmes said some of the features the state considers “betterments” — such as wide sidewalks and design features that enhance walkability — would be in jeopardy if NCDOT finishes projects with only the “bare minimum” required.

“Instead of doing the 12-foot wide multi-use path they’re going to put in the standard sidewalk” he said. “Instead of doing the nice signal (utility) poles they’ll put in those sticks and strings that aren’t great-looking.”

He said the planned cutbacks in Charlotte especially are “giving people heartburn because a lot of the roads are in urbanizing areas.”

Shifting costs to the city? Monday’s City Council meeting could presage more of what’s to come as the state grapples with its funding shortfall. City staff recommended that Charlotte pick up about half the cost of improving two intersections on Mallard Creek Church Road in University City at an expense to the city of about $6.6 million.

Those intersections at I-85 and Claude Freeman Drive are the state’s responsibility but the city would like the projects accelerated because of next year’s anticipated opening of the large East Coast headquarters of insurance giant Centene Corp. Centene would pay the other half of the costs.

A slide from Monday night’s Charlotte City Council meeting shows two projects that would add turn lanes on Mallard Creek Church Road in University City. It’s a state road but the city is proposing to split the $13.5 million cost with Centene Corp. to get the work done more quickly than the state will do it.

Some council members expressed concern that having Charlotte foot the bill for state projects would set a poor precedent.

“It sends a message — the message is Charlotte can afford to pay for itself” said council member Ed Driggs. “Are we inviting an attitude on the part of NCDOT that our projects can be deferred because if it gets really critical we’ll just pay for it ourselves?”

Behind the shortfall

The state’s latest projections show that from 2024 to 2033 the NCDOT will be $11.6 billion short of having enough money to cover all of its committed projects. That’s a gap bigger than half of the total projected $21.7 billion available to spend over that decade.

The amount of the shortfall varies for each of the 22 budget “buckets” NCDOT divides its funding into. For Division 10 the geographic area that includes Charlotte and much of the surrounding region the state’s projections show the NCDOT coming up $147 million short. But that doesn’t include the local impact of funding gaps on projects classified as having statewide or regional impact for which the funding shortfall totals a whopping $9.5 billion.

In an interview Joey Hopkins NCDOT’s deputy chief engineer of planning emphasizes that NCDOT is not low on cash. Rather it is looking ahead and realizing that estimated costs for road projects are far higher than initially projected.

For the first time projects that NCDOT has designated as having “committed” funding are likely to be revised as unfunded and delayed.

”This is a difficult process to go through” he said. “I’ve been here 30 years and I’ve never seen anything to this scale.”

One key reason the state’s funding shortfall projections increased so much is because the department switched from assuming 1% annual inflation to 3%. This year economists have said prices are rising at their fastest levels in three decades.

Hopkins also said that part of the problem is the way NCDOT estimated costs.

“Some of it too was tied to us having outdated estimates us using a tool to figure out estimates on these projects before you have design work done before surveying is done before you know how much right of way you’ll need” he said. “We were using a cost estimating tool that highly undervalued estimates on some of these projects.”

He said the department has since changed the way it estimates project costs.

The NCDOT is headed by Transportation Secretary Eric Boyette who has more than 25 years of state government experience including financial and technical leadership roles. He was appointed to the post in February 2020 by Gov. Roy Cooper.

Neil Burke a program manager with the Charlotte Regional Transportation Planning Organization said the state’s estimates seemed to be off dramatically in metro areas where the cost of land needed for road expansions is soaring.

A document shared at a recent local transportation planning meeting showed huge changes in projected costs.

At a recent meeting of Charlotte-area transportation planners an NCDOT representative shared examples of some of the surging cost estimates of local road projects which rose between 59.7% (Mallard Creek Road) and 966.2% (Matthews Township Parkway).

For instance:

The largest increase in cost on an NCDOT project in the Charlotte region is for widening N.C. 51 in Matthews to six lanes from four lanes. It was initially estimated at $4 million but NCDOT now says it will be $42.5 million.

One of the biggest projects likely to be delayed or scaled back because of surging cost estimates is the addition of express toll lanes on Independence Boulevard. ​​

“That will definitely be a project that will have to be delivered over a longer period of time” Burke said. The department is also “value engineering” the Independence project and recommendations on what to pare back could come later this year or early next.

Hope from infrastructure bill? Statewide the NCDOT plans to release its new draft funding plan in December 2022.

Transportation planners say they are studying the recently passed federal infrastructure funding bill to determine how it might help. The initial read is that it might help some projects from being postponed but can’t overcome the magnitude of the shortfall.

“They don’t think it’s going to solve all of their problems but it might mean lessening some of the delays that are about to happen” Burke said.",,,,,,,,,

Bernhard Langer added another chapter to the history books. Jim Furyk kept things interesting right till the end. It all made for an eventful finish to the PGA Tour Champions season.

Playing in his sixth Champions event Mickelson won for the fourth time after shooting a final-round 65 at Phoenix Country Club to claim the Charles Schwab Cup Championship for the first time. Mickelson joins Jack Nicklaus as the only players to win four of their first six starts on the Champions tour.

Mickelson went bogey-free Sunday with birdies on Nos. 1 7 11 15 and 16 before making a clutch par putt on No. 17. Mickelson closed his round with a birdie on the par-5 finishing hole to get to 19 under completing his rally from a three-shot deficit to win the tournament. He won by a shot over Steven Alker who birdied the 18th to finish 18 under. It’s Alker’s 10th top-10 finish in 11 tries since he turned 50 and joined the senior tour.

After his round Mickelson was quick to praise the 64-year-old Langer.

“I want to congratulate Bernhard because he really is the gold standard for work ethic discipline as well as talent and a great golf game. At 64 to win the season-long championship that’s pretty impressive pretty inspiring.”

By virtue of his final-round 69 and solo 17th-place finish Langer clinched the season-long Charles Schwab Cup points race for a record sixth time.

Langer came into the week leading the points fell behind to Jim Furyk after the second and third rounds but reclaimed the top spot Sunday. Langer competed in all 39 events during the Champions tour’s “super” season which combined the 2020 and 2021 campaigns. Langer claims a $1 million prize to be paid out in an annuity for winning the points.

“There’s so many things to say after 39 events and two very unusual years” he said. “I’d like to first of all thank my wife Vikki and my family support. She’s back there and my daughter Jackie and son Jason and grandson Jackson they’ve been amazing throughout the years. None of us could do what we’re doing without our loved ones fully behind us.”

Furyk shot 65-67-65 in the first three rounds and was looking to cap the week with a couple of firsts. He would’ve been the first Champions tour rookie to win the Schwab Cup points title. He also was attempting to become the first golfer to win the season-long title on the senior circuit after winning the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup which he did in 2010.

On 18 Furyk stood on the tee box needing an eagle on the par-5 closing hole to get to 18 under and finish solo second. That would’ve been enough to surpass Langer to claim the points race but after driving it in the fairway Furyk pulled his second into the grandstands down the left side of the fairway.

With Mickelson signing autographs for fans and Langer watching the Golf Channel coverage in the clubhouse Furyk needed to hole his third shot for eagle to win it but he blasted it well past the hole and watched it nestle in the thick rough off the green. He got up and down for par for a 71 to finish in a tie for fifth with Brandt Jobe.

Darren Clarke made a run up the leaderboard Sunday closing his round with a birdie on 18 for a 64 to briefly take the clubhouse lead at 17 under. A year ago after winning the TimberTech Championship he faced visa issues which kept him from traveling to Phoenix to the Schwab Cup. Clarke finished tied for third with David Toms who closed with a 65.

Paul Goydos had the round of the day making a birdie on the last to shoot a 8-under 63 to finish 15 under for the week. The 63 also matches the low round of the week also shot by Langer on Saturday.

Mickelson will deposit $440000 into his bank account for the win. He then plans to take some extended time off.

“I’m going to shut it down for the rest of the year. In two days Amy and I are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary which is really cool. We’re going to go on a few trips have fun” he said.

When asked about his upcoming playing schedule: “I’m set to host the American Express” he said regarding the PGA Tour event in Palm Desert California in January. “I’m not really sure of my scheduled yet a lot of things are up in the air but I know I’ll put in some time this offseason. I’m looking forward to having a great year next year as well and hopefully have some more special moments and play more consistently at the highest level.”

He added that it’s too early to commit to playing the 2022 Waste Management Phoenix Open an event he last played in 2019.

Mickelson will be in the TV booth on the Friday after Thanksgiving working alongside good friend and fellow trash talker Charles Barkley for Capital One’s The Match in Las Vegas.

“I got myself in a good position” Furyk said. “I don’t know where it will be compared to the lead but if I give myself a good opportunity and I go out if I play a good one tomorrow have a chance to win the tournament.”

Furyk has been comfortable all week at Phoenix Country Club less than two hours from where he was a two-time All-American at Arizona.

He started the round three behind leader Kirk Triplett and quickly made up ground with an eagle on the par-5 first hole at Phoenix Country Club. Playing with fan favorite and Arizona State alum Phil Mickelson Furyk heard plenty of ASU chants during his round but got the nice serenade from Arizona fans after his near ace on No. 15.

Furyk closed out his day by getting up-and-down for par on the par-5 18th for a bogey-free round that put at 16 under — one ahead of Triplett who shot 69. Furyk can win his first Schwab Cup with a victory or with a high finish and if Bernard Langer falters.

“Today really just wanted to go out and play a really solid round” Furyk said. “The scores are low but you still have to be patient.”

Langer who’s been battling back pain all weekend bookended his third round with eagles for a bogey-free 63 to remain in the hunt for his sixth Schwab Cup. He was 10 under six off the lead heading into the final round Sunday.

Stephen Ames shot 65 to reach 14 under and was tied with New Zealander Steven Alker a qualifier less than four months ago who shot 68. Mickelson was another shot back after a 68.

Furyk won the 2003 U.S. Open at Olympia Fields was the 2010 FedExCup champion and won 17 times on the PGA Tour. The 51-year-old has won three times since joining the PGA Tour Champions tour last year including the U.S. Senior Open in July.

Furyk has a chance add to his resume after a steady first three days at the Schwab Cup Championship. He has three bogeys through 54 holes and had four birdies to go with his eagle in Saturday’s round.

Langer played through intense pain to shoot an opening 68 then overcame more pain and three shots into penalty areas for a second-round 72.

Trailing Triplett by 11 shots the 64-year-old German was feeling somewhat better in the third round even if it was a strain to bend down to his ball.

Langer opened with an eagle on the par-5 first hole and added two birdies on his front nine. He had birdies on Nos. 10 and 17 then closed his round by making a roughly 20-foot eagle putt on the par-5 18th.

Langer’s low round — one less than his age — puts him in the hunt for a fifth Schwab Cup in seven years.

“It’s one of my best rounds ever under the circumstances for sure” Langer said. “Played very solid. “Finally found the groove with the driver and hit some good iron shots as well.”

Triplett was unable to back up his second-round 64 with another low round finishing with four birdies and two bogeys.

Alker had no status after turning 50 in July and qualified for the Boeing Classic in August. He got on a roll stringing together top-10 finishes every week to keep playing and become eligible for the postseason including a win last weekend at the TimberTech Championship in Florida.

Alker followed up a second-round 66 with four birdies and a bogey on Saturday.

It is now clear that new oil gas and coal developments cannot be allowed to continue if we are to stay within safe climate limits. Despite this it is estimated that the fossil fuel industry receives $11 million in subsidies every minute. This growing call has historical legacies in local resistance to corporate land grabs; over the past decade alone indigenous-led resistance in the United States and Canada has prevented the equivalent of a quarter of those countries’ annual emissions. As a consequence the complicity of fossil fuel giants like Chevron and Shell in human rights violations globally is becoming increasingly visible — an issue which gained international attention in 1995 in the case of the Ogoni Nine. Twenty-six years ago the Ogoni Nine were executed by the Nigerian dictatorship after a campaign of resistance against Shell’s pursuit of profit at the expense of their community. The fight for environmental justice continues to be an international struggle against corporate exploitation and today we should honor the activists whose resistance cost them their lives.

Extractivism in the Niger Delta Nigeria is the largest oil and gas producer in Africa and since 1975 the Niger Delta region has accounted for over three quarters of Nigeria’s export income. In the last decade Shell has reported over a thousand spills with 17.5 million liters released into the Niger Delta killing fish contaminating water supplies and destroying local livelihoods. In 2008 and 2009 there were two massive oil spills in Bodo a fishing town in Nigeria. Shell initially offered an insulting $4000 compensation to the community but following legal action alongside Amnesty International the company admitted it had lied about the size of the oil spills and the community received £55 million. Cases like this are not a rare occurrence. Communities in the Global South continue to be rendered collateral damage as they face the worst consequences of climate collapse. Ogoniland is located in the Niger Delta. It has a population of nearly 832000 predominantly fishermen. While its rivers have long been fundamental to local livelihoods they’ve now become a source of harm. Since Shell began its operations there in 1958 Ogoniland has become one of the most polluted places in the world. The Environmental Assessment of Ogoniland found that in one community families drink water from wells contaminated with carcinogen benzene at levels over nine hundred times World Health Organization guidelines. The region has produced $30 billion worth of oil since 1957 when oil was first discovered there. Between 1976 and 1991 Ogoniland experienced 2976 oil spills accounting for over 2 million barrels of pollution.

Resistance In 1990 in response to the continued violations against the Ogoni people by the oil industry and the Nigerian state writer and political activist Ken Saro-Wiwa founded the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP). This movement consisted of over seven hundred thousand Ogoni people all united in campaigning for social economic and environmental justice through nonviolent resistance and protest. The group published the Ogoni Bill of Rights which aimed to realize political and economic autonomy for the Ogoni people and protect Ogoniland from further environmental degradation. The bill called on international governments and development institutions to take action and to stand in solidarity with the Ogoni people including calling for those seeking protection from political persecution by the Federal Government of Nigeria to be granted refugee status. However MOSOP’s calls for international action fell on deaf ears and after multiple arrests Ken Saro-Wiwa alongside eight of his fellow leaders — Saturday Dobee Nordu Eawo Daniel Gbooko Paul Levera Felix Nuate Baribor Bera Barinem Kiobel and John Kpuine — were put on trial under the pretext that the group had incited the murder of four Ogoni chiefs. The trial was widely discredited with critics worldwide speaking out against the military regime of General Sani Abacha who was then in power. Despite that the Nine were found guilty and on the morning of November 10 hanged.

Blood on Shell’s Hands MOSOP’s campaigning had led to the suspension of oil operations in Ogoniland in 1993 but Shell’s presence continued to endanger the community. In the same year troops guarding Shell opened fire on protesters injuring eleven people. Later a backlash from the Nigerian military saw around thirty thousand were made homeless by the burning of villages in the region and approximately a thousand people killed. Evidence from company documents and witness statements have shown that Shell encouraged the Nigerian military to violently suppress resistance and managed a unit of undercover police that surveilled local activists. Esther Kiobel widow of Barinem Kiobel filed a case against Shell in 2002 and although the company denied complicity in the activists’ murders they eventually agreed a $15.5 million out-of-court settlement with the families. Today although the Shell pipelines have remained inactive its oil spills continue to affect the region. The United Nations predict that cleaning up the pollution in the Niger Delta would take up to thirty years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYnVoYXJpLWNvbmdyYXR1bGF0ZXMtZm9ybWVyLW50YS1kZy1vbW9sZS1hdC03MC_SAUdodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL2J1aGFyaS1jb25ncmF0dWxhdGVzLWZvcm1lci1udGEtZGctb21vbGUtYXQtNzAvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buhari congratulates former NTA DG Omole at 70,"The President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) sends warm felicitations to former Director-General of Nigerian Television Authority Olusola Omole on his 70th birthday November 14 2021.

Like hermit crabs taking up residence in empty shells new restaurants and eateries are filling up vacant properties around town bringing with them new opportunities for dining and noshing in Gig Harbor.

Crumbl Cookies the Utah-based franchise with a nationwide following of devotees opened in late October in the former Yo! G’s Frozen Yogurt location on Borgen Boulevard.

KettleFish offering steam kettle-cooked clams mussels and fresh seafood dishes will expand from its Silverdale flagship store to open a second location this spring on Pioneer Way in the former Kelly’s Café & Espresso.

New owners of the former Harvester Restaurant property are in negotiations with several potential occupants and are closing in on a deal Carl Swanes of Gig Harvest LLC shared Friday.

And a Chipotle Mexican Grill is coming to the Uptown Gig Harbor complex. The restaurant chain has obtained a conditional use permit to renovate the old Opus Bank location on Point Fosdick Drive (near Applebee’s) according to Laura Pettitt communications and tourism director for the city of Gig Harbor.

Could this be a glimmer of light at the end of the pandemic tunnel?

Miriam Battson president and CEO of the Gig Harbor Chamber of Commerce says local restaurants that have survived the pandemic “have been getting as creative as they can for how to work within the constraints of regulations coming down from the state.”

Adaptation for most has involved a beefed-up takeout process Battson said and staffing issues are likely to hamper (though not doom) the food service industry for a while yet. That said Batten is encouraged by the new activity filling old spaces and the resilience of those places that have weathered the pandemic.

“The restaurants are doing what they can to come back” Battson said. “Some have done incredibly well. Some have struggled a little bit you know and they’ve all each been on a different journey.”

One thing is certain the new eateries will have the loyal support of locals.

“There are Facebook groups that are all about supporting local businesses” Battson said. “The thing that I love about Gig Harbor is our community takes care of itself and we watch out for each other.”

Cookies “to die for”

OK Battson may not be an unbiased bystander but she has officially fallen for Crumbl Cookies calling them “crazy decadent.”

“Last week they had this Key Lime cookie that was to die for” she said. “It’s all cookies. They are huge and delicious. Don’t look at the calories.”

Owner Amy Beam of Olalla has been a Crumbl fan since 2019 when she first walked into a Crumbl bakery. The pink box of cookies was still warm on her lap when she applied for a franchise in Washington.

“You walk in and you get this warm welcome to Crumbl and you can see the open kitchen see every step of the cookies being made” she said. “I just fell in love with it. And to be honest I applied for a franchise without even trying a cookie.”

Beam was looking for “Phase 2” of her life now that her kids are all in school. She wasn’t daunted even when the pandemic hit small businesses hard.

“There’s delivery options curbside pickup and carry-out that were already established even before the pandemic” she said. “We spoke to several franchise owners before we made our decision and everyone had amazing things to say.”

Crumbl which opened its first store in 2017 in Utah now has more than 264 shops in 36 states.

Each Sunday evening the fandom waits for the weekly rotating menu announcement. Beam knows people who set an alarm to see what cookies will be available on Monday. The recent menu proffered Dulce de Leche Pecan Pie and Chocolate Cookies and Cream among other flavors.

Beam and her staff of 93 full- and part-time employees (yes 93) make 3000 to 4000 cookies a week. Open Monday through Saturday they almost always sell out.

“It’s kind of like the most amazing first job I think you can have” Beam said. “We spend a lot of time at the table balling cookies and we get to chat about our day and you know team building is super easy. It’s just a fun place to be.”

KettleFish to open downtown

KettleFish seafood restaurant opened in May 2019 in Silverdale’s Old Town district. From the start the vision of owners Dave Montoure and Paddy O’Brien was to add other locations.

When the Pioneer Way location became available the partners saw it as an opportunity to bring their fresh and responsibly sourced seafood dishes to Gig Harbor tourists and locals alike.

The restaurant uses steam kettle cooking to whip up made-to-order fish soups and stews like cioppino and bouillabaisse along with steamed clams and mussels. The method popular in southern cooking uses stainless steel vessels heated by pressurized steam instead of other heat sources. KettleFish uses two-quart vessels to quickly cook single- or double-serving orders.

Their signature dish is cioppino an Italian-American style tomato-based fish soup. Also popular are their Northwest-style fish and chips (not steam-cooked) and clam chowder.

Dishes are accompanied by local craft brews and wines.

Montoure said they’ve ridden out the pandemic and are on a trajectory to increase sales. The new Gig Harbor location will be about three times larger than the Silverdale restaurant with 43 seats indoors and about six seats outside.

Montoure on Friday said they’d just gotten the keys to the new place and have considerable work ahead to renovate and equip it. He hesitated to say exactly when they will be up and running given supply chain issues but said it will be sometime this spring. Montoure said he’s gotten positive feedback from folks around town.

“It’s really exciting that people are picking up on it” he said. “And they’re talking about it they’re excited about it. So now the pressure is on us to deliver. So we’re excited.”

Harvester property owners still mum on new occupant

The Harvester a landmark in Gig Harbor known for its comfort food dishes closed in June after 38 years when owner Kirby Tweten retired.

Despite rumors swirling around the fate of the property no firm deals have been made yet said Carl Swanes of Gig Harvest LLC the investment group that bought the property at 5601 Soundview Drive this summer for $1.35 million.

“There’s been a lot of interest” said Swanes an attorney and former Gig Harbor resident now living in Seattle. “I mean from national brands local brands really all over the map. It’s just you know everyone’s kind of nervous to jump in the pool I guess so to speak. So that’s kind of where it is. I’m pretty confident that one of the three or four we’re talking about will come through and that will be a great fit for Gig Harbor.”

Swanes (pronounced Swan-esh from the Norwegian) said he still feels strong ties to Gig Harbor as do most of the other investment partners. “The group has their fingers crossed” that an agreement with a new occupant will be reached soon he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL25ldy15b3JrL3NoaXJsZXktbWFzdGljL3Rvcm5hZG8tZGlkLXRvdWNoLWRvd24tc2hpcmxleS1ud3MtbWV0ZXJvbG9naXN0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Tornado 'Likely Touched Down' In Shirley: NWS Meteorologists,"Weather A Tornado ‘Likely Touched Down’ In Shirley: NWS Meteorologists It was an EF1 with gusts of 86 to 110 mph the National Weather Service said at about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday.

SHIRLEY NY — The force of nature that ripped off part of a shopping center’s awning at a Long Island beachfront community — leaving many to question its strength — was confirmed a tornado by the National Weather Service on Sunday night.

An EF1 tornado which was the strongest of three confirmed on Long Island on Saturday “likely touched down” in the hamlets of Shirley Mastic and Manorville in Suffolk County officials said. JUST IN: An EF1 tornado was just confirmed in Suffolk County from Shirley to Manorville. This is the 3rd confirmed tornado in Long Island from Saturday. #NYwx

— Storm Team 4 NY (@StormTeam4NY) November 15 2021 It touched down just southwest of Francine Place and Mastic Boulevard then traveled northeast along the Long Island Rail Road and the backyards that were adjacent said officials at about 8:30 p.m. as they released the results from an earlier survey.

Numerous oak maples and pine trees were uprooted and laid in a northerly direction and several trees were also snapped at the trunk or had large branches sheared off along the path officials said. There was minor roof and siding damage and leaf splatter on the south and east sides said officials adding that the damage swath was “only about 25 yards wide.”

The tornado “hooked northeast over the Lidl supermarket and flipped over a 50-ton air handler unit on the roof before tearing off the parapet and collapsing the covered walkway” over Chipotle Mexican Grill officials said. But the damage path remained about 25 yards “consistent with” gusts of wind from 95 to 105 mph.

— Mark Doucet (@MarkDoucet55) November 13 2021 Siding and shingles from Chipotle were thrown northeast about 250 yards across the intersection and into the shopping center with Applebee’s according to officials. Small trees were “uprooted in the parking lot” and they were laying to the northeast and flashing was ripped off the south side of the restaurant and an adjacent unoccupied retail space.

“The tornadic circulation may have been briefly lifted at this point with about a 50-yard swath of 65 t0 75 mph straight-line winds across the shopping center” officials said adding the “tornadic circulation then touched down once again in the northeast of the Applebee’s shopping center” and it “lifted the entire roof off of a two-story multi-family home on the corner of Grand Avenue and McGraw Street.” “The roof was tossed as far as 150 yards to the north into the backyard of neighboring houses to the north on Grand Avenue” officials said adding that one of the sections of the roof “actually impaled itself into the side of the neighboring house to the north and made such a strong impact that it skewed the vertical structure of that house.” The adjacent 50-yard swath of trees were uprooted snapped or sheared and this was consistent with EF1’s “of around 110 mph” which is when the tornado strength “likely peaked” officials said. The entirety of the path was around one-quarter mile and it made its way across Sunrise Highway — skipping its way northeast for four-and-a-half miles — and its path continued to Brookhaven Calabro Airport where it flipped over small planes according to officials. It then moved northeast to Pancho and Titmus drives Abbot Avenue and Burney Boulevard just east of the airport and where there were several large trees uprooted trunks snapped or branches sheared officials said.

The tornado went as far east as Barnes Road in Manorville. An EF0 tornado was confirmed in East Islip by the NWS just after 6 p.m. NWS officials also confirmed just after 3:15 p.m. that the first tornado in the region was that of another EF0 tornado that touched down in Nassau County in the hamlets of Woodwere and Levittown. After a survey in Nassau officials said that they found the first touchdown was in Woodmere where several trees and powerlines were downed and from there the tornado “lifted and skipped in a few locations as it traveled nearly 50 mph” north to Hempstead Uniondale and Levittown.

Damage reports were “sporadic” officials said adding that the tornado “touched down again and tore a roof off a two-story colonial home on Liberty Street and “it landed on a nearby house. “Scattered debris including shingles insulation and twisted siding was thrown into the next block up including the intersection of Emerson and Goodrich Street” officials said. “Significant damage” was also noted near Clover Lane in Levittown where a large tree was felled onto a house before the tornado lifted” officials said.

Storm Team 4 says Long Island has never seen a tornado in the month of November

Not one not two but three tornadoes touched down on Long Island Saturday in a first for Nassau and Suffolk counties which have no records of a tornado striking in November.

The National Weather Service confirmed two EF-0 tornadoes and an EF-1 tornado hit a series of towns across both Long Island counties as a line of severe thunderstorms pushed east after blowing through New Jersey and New York City.

A team of NWS surveyors spent Sunday crisscrossing storm damage tracking the paths of the systems and confirming the rare events for communities shocked to see tornadoes blow through.

In Nassau County officials first confirmed an EF-0 tornado with maximum wind speeds of 85 mph touched down in Woodmere Uniondale and Levittown. Two separate tornadoes another EF-0 and a more powerful EF-1 also formed in Suffolk County within an hour of the first system. The former struck East Islip and Oakdale while the latter and flew from Shirley to Manorville according to the NWS.

According to their report issued Sunday the first EF-0 tornado touched down shortly after 2:30 p.m. in Woodmere where it knocked down multiple trees and powerlines. Then the tornado ""lifted and skipped"" traveling 50 miles per hour as it moved toward Hempstead.

The next touchdown appeared to be in Uniondale surveyors found where the tornado tore a roof off of a two-story colonial building. The roof landed on a nearby house. Debris from other structures including shingles siding and insulation was found a block over.

This is the *first* November tornado on record in Long Island.



The New York tornado database goes back to 1950 & there’s no record of any others. We’re still waiting on confirmation of a second in Suffolk Co. #NYwx https://t.co/Zc632B29yR — Matt Brickman (@Matt_Brickman) November 14 2021

The weather agency also confirmed a touchdown in Levittown where the system was responsible for uprooting a giant tree that split a house nearly in two. The house on Clover Lane had been under construction and was empty at the time Saturday's storms raced through.

The tree was big enough to rip up part of the sidewalk along the front of the property.

""I couldn't believe it. It's a huge tree you can see it's off the slab it's crazy. This house has to be completely taken down and started over"" Nick Barberio told News 4.

The tornado's fury ended in Levittown minutes before 3 p.m. where some of the worst destruction in the county was observed. It only took 20 minutes for the second EF-0 system to appear over in Suffolk County.

A second report Sunday by the NWS confirmed the Suffolk tornado dropped down in East Islip where its winds uprooted a few dozen large trees. Then the tornado ""likely lifted over the John F. Kennedy Elementary School sport fields becoming a funnel cloud.""

The surveyors believe that funnel cloud briefly touched back down as a weak tornado in Oakdale where it toppled a tree destroying a home in the area of Frog lane and Jade Street.

The damage is still being surveyed after a line of powerful storms caused havoc across the tri-state. NBC New York's Adam Harding reports.

And finally around 3:45 p.m. Saturday a third and significantly stronger tornado appeared in Suffolk County. The NWS said the tornado touched down in Shirley around Francine Place and Mastic Boulevard where trees and homes felt the brunt of the system.

""The tornado then hooked northeast over the Lidl supermarket flipping over a 5-ton air handler unit on the roof before tearing off the parapet and collapsing the covered walkway of the Chipotle Mexican Grill on the northeast corner of the shopping center"" the latest report from the NWS said.

Sidings and shingles were thrown around as winds between 95 and 105 mph uprooted trees around town. The tornado peaked soon after when the roof of a two-story residence flew off and 150 yards away into the a nearby home and several backyards.

The Brookhaven Calabro Airport became the tornado's next target moving northeast and briefly sent several small engine planes into the air. Storm surveyors say the tornado weakened to an EF-0 around this time. Within winds still around 85 mph it moved toward Manorville while shearing tree tops and snapping trunks before flipping over a large camper.

Storm Team 4 says the tornadoes are the first on record to touchdown on Long Island in the month of November.

Saturday's line of severe thunderstorms also left significant damage in Suffolk County. The NWS team had planned to visit Mastic and Shirley in addition to Stonington Old Lyme Branford and Cheshire in Connecticut.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL25ldy15b3JrL2xldml0dG93bi1ueS90b3JuYWRvLXRvdWNoZWQtZG93bi1uYXNzYXUtY291bnR5LW5hdGlvbmFsLXdlYXRoZXItc2VydmljZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Tornadoes Touched Down On LI: Planes Flipped Home Destroyed,"Weather 3 Tornadoes Touched Down On LI: Planes Flipped Home Destroyed They are reportedly the first ever November tornadoes on Long Island.

LONG ISLAND NY — Three tornadoes touched down on Long Island Saturday afternoon the National Weather Service confirmed Sunday night after wrapping up its final storm survey in eastern Suffolk County.

They are the first November tornadoes on record on the island according to a tweet by Matt Brickman an NBC New York meteorologist. ""The New York tornado database goes back to 1950 & there’s no record of any others"" Brickman said.

The first report of a tornado on the island was at 2:37 p.m. in Woodmere where several trees and power lines were knocked down. From there the tornado with peak winds of 85 mph lifted and traveled toward the northeast toward Hempstead Uniondale and Levittown. In Uniondale the tornado touched down again tearing a roof off a two-story Colonial building on Liberty Street. The roof landed on a nearby house the weather service said.

Scattered debris including shingles insulation and twisted siding was thrown into the next block up. Significant damage was also noted near Clover Lane in Levittown where a large tree feel onto a home before the tornado lifted at 2:55 p.m.

About a half hour later a brief tornado touched down in East Islip. The narrow tornado with top winds of 85 mph likely touched down at the southwestern end of Hollins Lane at 3:20 p.m. and then continued over Brushwood Court Bayview Avenue Josephine Lane and Kay Court before lifting over the JFK Elementary School sport fields and becoming a funnel cloud at 3:22 p.m. the storm survey report says.

A few dozen large trees were uprooted and minor roof and siding damage was observed on several houses the report says of the damage in East Islip. After departing East Islip the funnel cloud briefly touched down as a weak tornado in the Frog Land and Jade Street area of Oakdale causing a very large partially rotted oak tree to ""topple onto and destroy a home"" the weather service says. The final and strongest tornado of the three with maximum winds of about 110 mph touched down just southwest of Francine Place and Mastic Boulevard in Shirley at 3:42 p.m. and then traveled northeast along the Long Island Rail Road and adjacent backyards. After uprooting numerous trees the tornado ""hooked northeast over the Lidl supermarket and flipped over a 50-ton air handler unit on the roof before tearing off the parapet and collapsing the covered walkway"" over Chipotle Mexican Grill officials said. ""Public video showed the apparent tornadic circulation lifting northeast across the intersection of William Floyd Parkway and Montauk Highway"" toward a shopping center ""with debris being thrown in one direction or another"" officials said.

""The tornadic circulation may have been briefly lifted at this point with about a 50-yard swath of 65 t0 75 mph straight-line winds across the shopping center"" officials said adding the ""tornadic circulation then touched down once again in the northeast of the Applebee's shopping center"" and it ""lifted the entire roof off of a two-story multi-family home on the corner of Grand Avenue and McGraw Street."" Its path continued to Brookhaven Calabro Airport where it flipped over small planes before the tornado ended in Manorville according to officials. No injuries were reported in any of the tornadoes.

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics. Once completed it will be Qatar’s second Catholic church joining the existing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.

While precise statistics on the Christian population in Qatar are lacking Mhanna estimates there are close to 1 million Christians there of which about 70% are Catholic. Approximately 12000 belong to the Maronite rite which is in full communion with the pope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9icml0aXNoLWNvbHVtYmlhL2dyZWVud29vZC1iYy1maXJlLWNodXJjaC1kZXN0cm95ZWQtMS43MjAwNDQ10gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjcyMDA0NDU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fire destroys 123-year-old church in Greenwood B.C.,"A devastating overnight fire in the tiny city of Greenwood B.C. has razed a historic church vacant elementary school one home and a neighbouring garage.

""No lives are lost thank God"" said Greenwood Mayor John Bolt speaking to CBC Kelowna on Friday morning. ""Everything is under control now.""

Firefighters from Greenwood Midway and Grand Forks attended the fire which is believed to have started in the 123-year-old St. Jude's Anglican Church at around 2:30 a.m. PT Friday.

Officials say the cause of the fire is under investigation.

Bishop Lynne McNaughton of the Anglican Diocese of Kootenay said the church has not been used as a site of worship for a number of years. She said half of the property had been turned into a community garden with beehives.

""There's not a congregation that's been displaced by this"" said McNaughton. ""Obviously there's a shock and sadness about the building.

""I spoke to the local priest this morning ... and what she said was that there's nothing of historical value inside nothing of monetary value [or] sentimental value.""

McNaughton said the church was not a designated heritage building.

Midway fire chief Mike Daloise said the buildings were fully engulfed when firefighters arrived.

He said crews worked hard to stop the fire from spreading to adjacent homes although three did sustain heat damage to their sidings.

Firefighters had switched to mop-up stage by Friday morning according to Greenwood Fire Chief Roy Terashita and were thankful for the food locals were delivering to the site to feed them.

""It was a great effort from all three fire departments"" said Terashita.

Hardy Skott owner of the Copper Creek Country Store located about a block away from the fire said things could have turned out much worse.

""This could have burned down the whole town"" said Skott. ""Embers were falling from the sky blocks away.""

Skott said he wished officials had alerted residents and business owners when news of the fire broke. He said the area around Greenwood like many parts of the province has been extremely dry with a heightened fire risk.

McNaughton said the community was rallying to support the woman who has been displaced by the fire.

""My prayers go out to the person who lost their home"" she said. ""I know that the Greenwood community will surround that person and we've reached out to [her] to say 'what can we do?'""

Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

Corbett. Rosenthal. Taft.

The names of Cincinnati area benefactors easily roll off our tongues – and find themselves in bronze letters on buildings auditoriums theaters and universities.

But there’s another name that should be on the Mount Rushmore of local philanthropists.

Let me make the case for Mary Emery.

Perhaps it’s because she died in 1927 or because she was a woman or because she didn’t seek the spotlight but Emery’s contributions to the area are as impressive in their significance as they are in their diversity.

Making the case for Mary Emery

In the late 19th century Mary Emery turned family tragedy and the conspicuous consumption of the Gilded Age into a legacy Cincinnatians are lucky to enjoy to this day.

But the crazy thing is: We’ve enjoyed her art we’ve traveled streets she created she’s even saved us money – and we may have no idea.

Emery was a New York native but she made her mark in Cincinnati. You don’t have to go far before you see her name on museums colleges and even a village here.

Her husband Thomas died in 1906 and she had already lost both her sons. She inherited millions and set her sights on using them to improve her community through philanthropy and doing so in her family’s name.

She started at the Cincinnati Art Museum.

Emery was already a budding art collector when she funded free Saturday admission to the CAM in 1906 that continues to this day. (Admission to the CAM is free every day now thanks to a 2003 donation from the Rosenthal Family Foundation.) And that’s just the beginning of her impact at the museum.

“Her art gifts and 1927 bequest of European Old Master paintings is considered by many to be the most important gift ever made to the Museum” said Jill Dunne director of marketing and communications at the Cincinnati Art Museum. That donation valued at $3.5 million at the time included masterpieces by Van Dyck Mantegna Murillo Gainsborough Hals and Titian. The Emery Wing where many of those pieces are now displayed opened at the museum in 1930.

Contributions from 'Lady Bountiful' around the city

There must have been a love for animals as well. She and her friend fellow benefactor Anna Sinton Taft heard the Cincinnati Zoo was in dire financial straits in 1916. So they bought it. And they ran it until their deaths when the city of Cincinnati took over. Now it’s the second oldest zoo in the country.

You’ll find Emery’s name on a building at the University of Cincinnati’s famed College-Conservatory of Music. I taught media ethics inside that building for several years and had no idea the impact its namesake truly has.

She’s the Mary for whom the Village of Mariemont is named. In fact Mariemont was a planned community – planned and funded by Emery in part to allow people of all income levels to afford appropriate housing.

She endowed a building for the Ohio Mechanics Institute which included a world-class auditorium – surely an interesting choice for a place that taught machine tooling. But the Emery Theatre was so universally lauded for its “perfect acoustics” that the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra played there from 1912-1936.

Over her years of service to Cincinnati she donated the land where Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center is today created orphanages for Black children and gave enough money to build two parish halls for Christ Church downtown.

Her biography by former CAM director Millard F. Rogers Jr. is called “Rich in Good Works.” The title is from I Timothy 6:18 “Instruct them to do good to be rich in good works and to be generous and ready to share.”

Cincinnati’s “Lady Bountiful” no doubt committed that verse to heart. And we are all the better for it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9kZWxvaXR0ZS1jaW5jaW5uYXRpLTEwMC1qdG0tY2VvLXRvbnktbWFhcy13aW5zLWxpbmRuZXItYXdhcmQvODUwNTM3ODAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deloitte Cincinnati 100: JTM CEO Tony Maas wins Lindner award,"Tony Maas president and CEO of J.T.M. Food Group says he's as devoted to the business as he is to his Catholic faith and he's quick to point out that the two are not mutually exclusive.

""I’m here to tell you if you serve God first the money will follow'' said the 61-year-old Maas who for the past 33 years has been running the business that started in 1960 as a family-owned butcher shop in Delhi Township.

Maas has enjoyed the best of both worlds – secular and sacred – by allowing his faith to inform his business decisions and charitable giving including donating 10% of the company's profits each year to Catholic ministries and other charitable organizations.

""It's a blessing that we can make an eternal difference with the business and a monetary difference with the business'' Maas said during an interview from his office on the sprawling J.T.M. campus in Harrison.

Maas will be recognized for his business acumen and charitable giving as the winner of the 2021 Carl H. Lindner Award for Entrepreneurship and Civic Spirit.

The award is named for the late chairman of Downtown-based American Financial Group who was known for his business and public accomplishments.

Maas who will receive the award at a luncheon on Nov. 17 said he was ""humbled'' for being recognized with the award named for one of the families he admires most in Cincinnati.

""The Lindner family is unbelievable'' he said. ""They've helped this community like no other family and they’re humble servants to this day. I’m just blessed to have this award in honor of their father.''

Like the Lindners' Maas' altruism has created a windfall for area churches and nonprofits over the years as well as his company and its approximately 650 employees.

J.T.M. which became known by its present name in 1980 is one of the nation's leading producers of fully cooked kettle products such as burrito fillings macaroni and cheese sauces soups and dips.

The company which moved up from 55th last year to 51st on the 2021 Deloitte Cincinnati 100 list of the region’s largest privately held companies has grown annual revenues from about $8 million in 1988 to more than $280 million this year he said.

J.T.M. serves thousands of schools restaurants military and government organizations food distributors and retailers throughout North America.

And Maas readily admits he spends most of his waking hours working or ""worrying"" about work especially in today's business climate marked by supply chain disruptions and product shortages that have made certain ingredients hard to come by.

""Just simple things like buying beef and pork and chicken; if you want something next week you can't get it'' Maas lamented. ""Along with that the price is way higher than it should be.''

Still Maas continues to serve his customers with the same commitment and determination he credits for his success in business and in life.

“I believe you should never go to work you should go to your life purpose'' he said. ""I’ve been blessed to have that here at J.T.M.''

While the business is constantly on his mind Maas makes time for outside pursuits including his love of sports.

“You’re not going to find a bigger Bengals fan than me'' he said. ""The Bengals the Reds and UC Bearcats basketball are the three teams that I love.''

Maas who coached basketball and other sports for 22 years at Our Lady of the Visitation Parish and School in Mack said sports have taken him many places – including to ""heaven.''

""Baseball Heaven"" that is or the annual week-long Reds Fantasy Camp for men and women held at the team's training camp in Goodyear Arizona.

Maas said he's played on fantasy camp teams each year since 1989 except last year when the camp was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

And he's proud to say his teams have won four fantasy camp world championships.

""I love baseball'' he said with a grin.

Meskipun masih belia dia serius menekuni cabang olahraga skateboard yang termasuk olahraga baru di Indonesia. Bermain skateboard memberinya tantangan baru untuk menyingkirkan rasa takut dan merasakan kenikmatan ” terbang ” sambil beraksi.

Cabang olahraga skateboard tak hanya untuk cowok. Nyimas Bunga Cinta (15) pun menyukainya. Lompatan dan aksinya ”terbang” dengan papan skateboard menjadikan dirinya sebagai atlet perempuan skateboard Indonesia yang tahun ini berada di peringkat ke-23 dunia.

”Kadang-kadang muncul rasa ngilu takut ketika akan mulai bermain. Pokoknya uji nyali banget” kata anak pertama dari tiga bersaudara itu. Ia menambahkan rasa takut tersebut kemudian kalah dengan kesenangan saat ia bisa meloncat tinggi ke udara di gaya bowl. ”Rasa senang itu nagih” katanya sambil tertawa. Nyimas bersyukur selama tujuh tahun bermain skateboard hanya mengalami luka ringan karena benturan atau terserempet tembok.

Sejak awal ia suka pada olahraga ekstrem tersebut walau tahu risiko yang harus dihadapi. Jika salah mendarat setelah meloncat atau beraksi dengan berbagai gaya bisa saja ia mengalami cedera dari ringan sampai yang paling berat. ”Sampai sekarang kalau akan main skateboard masih sering muncul rasa takut tapi lalu ingat doa orangtua. Takutnya hilang karena hati tenang” jelas Nyimas.

Didiet Piryo Sugiharto ayah Nyimas yang pertama kali mengenalkan skateboard kepadanya lewat berita dan aksi Tony Hawk skateboarder ternama asal Amerika Serikat. Tahun 2014 Nyimas yang masih berusia delapan tahun mulai berlatih olahraga itu dari ayahnya yang juga senang bermain skateboard. Saat makin tertarik ayahnya mengikutkan Nyimas les skateboard kepada pemain skateboard di Taman Mini Indonesia Indah yang tak jauh dari rumahnya.

ARSIP DIDIET PRIYO SUGIHARTO Nyimas Bunga Cinta atlet skateboard

Setahun kemudian ia mulai menjuarai berbagai lomba skateboard tingkat lokal dan regional. Untuk menambah kemampuannya Nyimas bermain dengan anggota komunitas skateboard di Jakarta Timur dan Selatan. Dari merekalah ia mendapat masukan beragam gaya. Keterampilannya pun makin terasah.

Kemampuannya sebagai skateboarder mendapat perhatian dari pencari bakat untuk bertanding mewakili Indonesia di ajang Asian Games Jakarta dan Palembang tahun 2018. Saat itu skateboard menjadi cabang olahraga yang pertama kali dipertandingkan di Asian Games. Nyimas dan beberapa atlet lain langsung masuk pusat pelatihan nasional. Di Asian Games 2018 Nyimas langsung menyabet medali perunggu. Setahun kemudian Nyimas berlaga pada Sea Games 2019 di Filipina dan menyabet medali perak.

Sebenarnya dara bertinggi tubuh 155 sentimeter itu lebih banyak berlatih gaya streetpark. Ia piawai melompat ke tangga lalu menuruninya dengan papan beroda yang ia tunggangi dengan mulus. Tangga-tangga itu banyak dijumpai di taman bermain skateboard. ”Aku pilih streetpark tapi tidak bermain di jalanan atau trotoar. Mainnya hanya di taman skate” ujar Nyimas.

Namun saat berada di pelatnas pelatih meminta ia bermain di gaya bowl (tempat bermain berupa bangunan berbentuk setengah mangkuk dengan ketinggian hingga 3 meter). Beruntung ia sudah punya keterampilan dasar pada kelas tersebut sehingga bisa meraih medali di gaya bowl perempuan.

Fokus ke Olimpiade

Ketika pandemi tiba pelatnas ditiadakan. Nyimas meneruskan latihan secara mandiri. Ia diantar ayahnya ke taman-taman skate tetapi untuk latihan rutin Nyimas memilih taman skate Pasar Rebo Jakarta. ”Fasilitasnya banyak yang baru sehingga aku bisa menambah keterampilan. Di sana juga ada pembimbing. Dia pemain senior skateboard” ujar Nyimas. Ia kini fokus latihan agar bisa lolos bertanding ke Olimpiade.

ARSIP DIDIET PRIYO SUGIHARTO Nyimas Bunga Cinta atlet skateboard

Ia rajin ikut kompetisi untuk mengumpulkan poin. Mei 2021 Nyimas mengikuti Dew Tour 2021 di Des Miones Iowa Amerika Serikat yang merupakan kualifikasi untuk bertanding di Olimpiade. Pada kompetisi itu Nyimas menduduki peringkat ke-23 dari 41 peserta dari sejumlah negara. Ia sudah mendekati syarat bertanding ke Olimpiade yang minimal menduduki peringkat ke-20.

Ke depan Nyimas ingin menjadi atlet skateboard profesional. ”Main skateboard selalu memberikan tantangan baru. Bagaimana mengalahkan rasa takut dan bisa bermain dengan bagus. Selain itu hadiahnya juga besar he-he-he..” kata Nyimas.

Ia menceritakan dari kejuaraan yang ia ikuti mendapat hadiah uang cukup besar tetapi hadiah paling besar Nyimas dapatkan dari negara ketika meraih medali di Asian Games dan SEA Games.

ARSIP YUDI 50 Nyimas Bunga Cinta atlet skateboard

Nyimas berharap Indonesia segera punya induk organisasi skateboard sendiri agar pembinaan ke atlet lebih fokus dan latihan bagi atlet berkesinambungan. Pada masa pandemi pembinaan kepada atlet skateboard seperti dirinya terhenti. Hal itu menyulitkan karena meski terus berlatih tetapi kurang membuahkan hasil maksimal. Nyimas kini menghadapi problem kegemukan yang bisa mengganggu pergerakan bermain skateboard.

They are real they are here and they’re about to fundamentally change the way we work and collaborate.

These new technologies create a digital immersive experience that closes the gap between virtual and in-person collaboration in the world of hybrid work.

Cisco’s Webex Hologram is an industry first using 3D holograms to take virtual meetings to a whole new level. With 64 percent of employees agreeing that being able to work remotely directly affects whether they stay or leave a job (source: Cisco Hybrid Work Index) organizations are only too aware that they need to be able to offer a range of flexible working solutions. But that’s not always easy particularly when teams need to get hands-on and interact with physical objects.

Webex Hologram is the kind of innovation that will be essential in a world forever changed by the Covid-19 pandemic. People are still navigating the challenges and concerns brought by the pandemicBut one thing is certain: This new world of work is hybrid. That means connecting and collaborating with colleagues around the world in all-new ways And those connections need to be seamless collaborative and secure.

At Cisco we look at powering hybrid work in two distinct ways: enabling a Hybrid Workforce and transforming Hybrid Workspaces. A Hybrid Workforce must be able to collaborate securely from anywhere anytime. Transforming a Hybrid Workspace must bring together networking security and collaboration tools to enhance health and well-being as well as safety and efficiencies.

Webex Hologram is opening our minds to new ways of working together. Photorealism transforms an individual’s presence in a far more realistic way than say an avatar could. That’s because the hologram is in effect you in real time not an imagined representation. As holograms presenters can share both physical content and digital content co-creating and collaborating within a single immersive interactive shared experience. Take a car manufacturer for instance. Engineers can work together on a physical prototype of the vehicle and provide feedback on the design.

As cool as all that seems Jeetu Patel Cisco’s executive vice president and general manager for Security and Collaboration put it into a wider context.

“Our mission at Cisco is to empower the three billion digital workers on the planet to participate equally from anywhere in the world” he said. “Webex Hologram represents a large step toward our mission of delivering a delivering a work experience so seamless that there is no gap between virtual and in-person collaboration.”

(Courtesy photo)

As children Elizabeth Dugan and Ellen Stark grew up listening to their father tell stories at the dinner table about his days as a justice with the state Supreme Court.

Recently the sisters helped preserve those stories — and completed a journey back in time — by publishing a book that their late father Judge Thomas Stark had written called “Horrific Homicides: A Judge Looks Back at the Amityville Horror Murders and Other Infamous Long Island Crimes.”

A lifelong Riverhead resident Judge Stark’s career spanned more than three decades including 29 years on the state Supreme Court. He also served as a town councilman school board member historian and more.

“Horrific Homicides” released Oct. 29 by Archway Publishing recounts four of the most notorious trials Judge Stark presided over during his career.

The judge completed the manuscript in early 2014 but died in April of that year at the age of 89 before it could be published. His daughters wanted to publish it shortly after his death but over the years there were distractions in their lives that didn’t allow that to happen. When the pandemic came they took advantage of the extra time at home and completed it as a tribute to their father.

“I think COVID forced this to happen” Ms. Dugan said. “The world shut down all of a sudden and gave us time to focus.”

Ms. Dugan has written and edited for publications including Psychology Today Health and Science 80 and Ms. Stark is a former deputy editor at Money magazine. They both used their backgrounds in journalism to rigorously fact check and update the manuscript with details taken from some of Judge Stark’s extremely detailed notes court filings and news reports.

Ms. Dugan who now lives in Maryland said it was a daunting task because there was so much material to go through at their family home in Aquebogue.

“I just remember coming in the den — I hadn’t been there for a while — and there was this hard table with files and the couch had files the whole room was just piles of files” she said.

The book opens with Judge Stark’s most notorious case: the1974 murders of the DeFeo family which prompted the best-seller “The Amityville Horror: A True Story” as well as various film adaptations. He ultimately sentenced Ronald DeFeo Jr. to six consecutive jail terms of 25 years to life for the murder of six family members.

Readers then dive into the story of Frances “Vikki” Ardito of Lloyd Harbor who hired two gunmen in 1976 to kill her unfaithful lover Benjamin Mattana Jr.

The third case concerns East Northport deli owner Anthony Cisco who murdered a mother and three young children in 1980 by persuading his teenage clerk to throw an Army smoke grenade through the front window of his neighbor’s house.

The final case involves New York City police patrolman Daniel Gallagher who shot and killed a fellow officer Sgt. Jack Sweeny in a moving car in Brentwood during an alcohol-fueled 1981 St. Patrick’s Day celebration.

The book allows readers to understand why Judge Stark ruled as he did in each case and dives into the details of the complex legal issues that were raised in each one.

“The book is sort of a window into how a judge thinks about crimes and the trials that follow” said Ms. Stark who lives in Manhattan. “It’s very much sort of straightforward story telling of how he saw these crimes and the trials that followed.”

The book is available in soft cover and e-book from Amazon Barnes and Noble and Archway Publishing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9yYWlkZXJzL3JhaWRlcnMtZmFucy1oZWFydHMtcmVtYWluLXdpdGgtdGludG9yLWZhbWlsedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raiders fans' hearts remain with Tintor family,"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — As the Silver and Black played Kansas City Sunday night the mind of Raider Nation wasn’t just on what happened on the field but what’s going on off of it as well.

“Raiders are a rare team a rare breed.”

Raider Nation continues to stand behind their team despite all of the news that’s happened this season — from the resignation and lawsuit of former head coach Jon Gruden to the release of Raiders player Damon Arnette over social media threats.

“We prevailed through all adversity. We’ve gone through so many things here in Vegas.”

Cisco Ortega is the president of the Las Vegas Black Hole chapter. He says the most challenging time for the fandom came after the DUI crash that involved former Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs IIIearlier this month. 23-year-old Tina Tintor was killed in the crash.

“It’s something near and dear to my heart. A poor 23-year-old girl died” he said.

Ortega says local fans banded together to raise money toward the Tintor family’s GoFundMe. He says the northeast chapters alone raised about $2500 and that all their hearts are with the family.

“We’re not here supporting Henry Ruggs and his decision to get behind the wheel and do what he did. We’re here to support the family and I hope we’re doing it well” he said.

Ortega says when it comes to whatever is happening on the field he hopes the team remains focused.

“I just hope the Raiders organization Coach (Rich) Bisaccia’s got the team in tune and let’s just keep going"" he said.

Ortega says he was glad to see Raiders owner Mark Davis attend the funeral of Tina Tintor and hopes the team can continue to work with the family.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3NoYW5ub24tcmlkZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE1NTI5ODTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shannon Rider Obituary (1952 - 2021) - Dallas TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/shannon-rider-obituary?id=31552984 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3NoYW5ub24tcmlkZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE1NTI5ODTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Although the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in 2001 unleashed huge growth in Nigeria’s Gross domestic product GDP it has however not fulfilled its target in the country’s journey to financial inclusion of people living in un-served and under-served areas of the country.

This according to different industry stakeholders is down to poor broadband penetration.

From research since 1970s Nigeria has always put up unsustainable initiatives to bring unbanked citizens which have largely failed.

Such initiatives include: Rural banking program in the 1970s with the aim of having at least one bank branch in each local government. It didn’t survive because armed robbers pursued all of them from business because it was by bricks and mortar.

Then there was also the launch of People’s bank in 1989 to cater for poor professional people and traders it was not sustainable. There was also the establishment of Community bank in the 1990s owned by different communities yet the benefits were short-lived.

The next was the launch of the National Economic Reconstruction Fund NERF to provide fund for Small and Medium Enterprises SME and the middle skill enterprises and Family Economic Advancement program to assist rural women it also failed.

However with the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in 2001 and the attendant boom it brought to other sectors of the economy the financial sector felt the solution has finally arrived.

The journey to revitalise the sector against all the failed initiatives came alive again. The digital banking evolution kicked off. It began with the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data USSD regime.

This uses a short code to transfer funds through the mobile phones. It was an agreement between the telecom operators and the banks and proceeds of the charges were shared between the two parties on an agreed ratio.

Although this brought some revolution to the banking sector and truly portray technology as huge enabler it was also to fall short of the huge expectations of thriving Nigerian banking public who needed to do huge transactions but could only do N20000 at a go through USSD.

As expected technology breeds innovations; Internet/digital banking methods gradually crept into the scene. Now the problem is that the broadband facilities to make it ubiquitous are lacking. Where it is even available penetration to the rural populace has dragged surprisingly in a country considered the fastest emerging economy in the world.

Group Managing Director Zenith Bank PLC Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu while commenting on the revolution by digital banking at a telecommunications summit recently agreed that all the previous financial inclusion initiatives failed.

He said: “In 2012 the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN adopted the national financial inclusion strategy which was aimed at reducing the percentage of financially excluded adults in Nigeria from 46 percent in 2010 to 20 percent by 2020 it was expected that physical branches of banks will drive financial inclusion.

“However the emergence of digital financial products and services such as USSD enabled feature phone users to have access to banking transactions through the help of telecommunications.

“When CBN saw that such development will enable it to onboard a number of the unbanked and reaching so many unbanked CBN in 2018 revised the strategy for the national financial inclusion project.

“So in 2018 CBN now prioritised digital financial services as the main financial inclusion driver identifying various stakeholders roles and responsibilities.

The services employed are agent banking mobile banking USSD among others. USSD made it possible for anybody that has a telephone line to have access to financial services. All you need is dial the code of whatever bank.

“But the experience we are also seeing is that the transactions you can do with USSD are negligible you can’t do transaction above N20 000. And those who are doing it are now migrating from the USSD to the higher level of platforms.

“There are some who are moving from feature phone buying smartphone and enrol in mobile banking. But when they enrol in mobile banking where is the broadband to cover them?

The man in the remotest village in this country do we have the broadband covering him and even when the broadband is there what is the cost?

“So to achieve expected results stakeholders within the telecommunications and banking sectors should work towards getting broadband across the remotest villages but making it affordable to poor masses” he added .

“Broadband penetration as at June 2020 was 41.23 percent in Nigeria while Kenya was 46 percent. China and United States have over 70 and 80 percent respectively. The penetration affordability and cost of broadband are the major issues that we need to deal with”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhhdGJhbGxzb3V0dGFoZXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzEzL3RoZS1wZXJmZWN0LXRheWxvci1zd2lmdC1zb25ncy1mb3ItdGhlLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1waGlsbGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The perfect Taylor Swift songs for the Philadelphia Phillies,Trending. 1 Free agent the Philadelphia Phillies can steal from each division rival. light,,,,,,,,,

After Lexi Thompson’s winning putt skirted the edge it was back to the 18th tee for Sei Young Kim Lydia Ko Rolex Rankings world No. 1 Nelly Korda and Lexi setting the stage for a battle of epic proportions.

Though Korda ended up lifting the trophy after burying a 22ft birdie putt for the win it’s hard to ignore just how good Ko has played of late. It was just seven days ago that the 24-year-old won the Aramco Saudi Ladies International by five shots. Before that it was a T-3 for the Kiwi at the BMW Ladies Championship. Her T-2 finish at the Pelican Women’s Championship rounds out a stellar month of golf for Ko and sets her up nicely ahead of the CME Group Tour Championship.

“I played really solid this week” she said after rounds of 67-66-64-66. “I think my ball-striking overall was really good. I felt like I left a lot of putts out there. But this is a really tricky golf course especially on the greens. I feel like a lot of the distance putts that normally you would think are pretty good birdie range you're looking at it double looking at it again and again. It's hard. You've got three- four-footers and playing like a cup of break and still misses low. Overall I played solid. Hopefully I will be able to keep the positives from this week going into next week. Hope for a few more putts to drop.”

As Ko looks ahead to Tiburón Golf Club her confidence can’t help but be bolstered by her performances over the last couple of weeks. Sitting at third in the Race to the CME Globe the New Zealander has as good a chance as anyone to take home the title maybe even more so after the tear she’s been on as of late.

“Tiburon I think is a golf course where you can go low but at the same time it can get away from you as well” Ko said of next week’s event. “The weather looked pretty similar to this week so that's nice there is not a huge change in temperature. Other than that just going to enjoy it and see what the week ahead is going to be like. Tiburon there are some holes that you need to be pretty accurate off the tee. Then the greens are pretty big. Probably the most similarity is just the grass being Bermuda the run-off areas. In the past I felt like your short game needed to be really on at Tiburon so hopefully that will be the case for next week. I think when you kind of get into tournament mode the week goes by pretty quick. It's only four more competitive rounds until the season is over. Hopefully I'll be able to finish off in a solid way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXJzcG9ydHNlZGdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzE0L2VtbWEtdGFsbGV5LW1ha2VzLXRoZS1maWVsZC1mb3Itc2Vhc29uLWVuZGluZy10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC9mZWF0dXJlZC90b2RkZ3JpZmZpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emma Talley Makes the Field for Season-Ending Tour Championship,"Getty Images photo

Emma Talley has qualified for next week’s season-ending CME Group Tour Championship after a 60th place finish in the LPGA Pelican Women’s Championship.

Talley earned $4247 by finishing at 1-under-par overall in Belleair Florida. She shot rounds of 70 70 71 and 68.

Nelly Korda won the event in a playoff after she and three others finished regulation at 17-under.

Talley actually slipped one spot in the Race to the CME Globe point standings after this week’s showing. Talley went from 60th to 61st.

Only the Top 60 qualify for the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples Florida. However two players ahead of Talley are not in the field this week opening the door for Talley and Jenny Coleman at Nos. 61 and 62 to squeeze into the event.

The Tour Championship is a no-cut event with a $5 million purse with $1.5 million going to the winner.

The 72-hole event gets underway on Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9nb2xmL25ld3MvbmVsbHkta29yZGEtbGV4aS10aG9tcHNvbi1sZWFkLXBlbGljYW4td29tZW5zLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1hZnRlci01NC1ob2xlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nelly Korda Lexi Thompson Lead Pelican Women's Championship Headed to Final Round,"BELLEAIR Fla. — Nelly Korda started with two birdies and finished the same way Saturday making up plenty of ground along the way for a 7-under 63 that gave her a share of the lead with Lexi Thompson in the Pelican Women’s Championship.

Low scores ruled the day again at Pelican Golf Club with 10 rounds at 65 or better.

Thompson did her part with a 65 that allowed her to join Korda at 16-under 194 with no shortage of contenders right behind them heading into the final round.

“I’ve been hitting it actually really close this week giving myself a lot of opportunities” Korda said. “Capitalized a little bit more today. But it’s going to probably take a low one tomorrow.”

Eight players were separated by four shots a list that included defending champion Sei Young Kim (65) and long-shot Christina Kim (65) who earned a late sponsor exemption that all but ensured she would keep a full LPGA Tour card for next year.

Jennifer Kupcho was tied for the lead until she ended a streak of 45 consecutive holes at par or better by closing with a bogey for a 66. She was along in third with Kim and Kim two behind.

Korda finished her round with a 9-iron from 128 yards that floated out of the sky to 3 feet. In the week she returned to No. 1 in the women’s world ranking Korda now has a chance to make up ground on Jin Young Ko in the points-based award for LPGA player of the year.

Ko who has won four times in her last seven starts to take over the top spot leads by 15 points with 30 points available to this week’s winner.

ANA Inspiration winner Patty Tavatanakit having already clinched LPGA rookie of the year would need to win to have a mathematical chance at player of the year. She had a 64 and was three shots behind along with Lydia Ko (64).“I just want to keep it light. I don’t want to think about winning tomorrow just because if it were to be mine it will be mine tomorrow if I can hold putts hit good shots execute” Tavatanakit said. “If not I’ll just go out there and just finish another round and one step closer to offseason.”

Korda already has three victories this year on the LPGA Tour — her Olympic gold medal does not — and could join Ko with a fourth win.

Ko finished with a birdie for a 67 but she was slowed by three bogeys and fell seven behind.

Thompson has even more at stake. She has gone more than two years since her last LPGA Tour victory having already squandered a great chance earlier this year at the U.S. Women’s Open.

Thompson tied with Kupcho to start the round had three straight birdies on the front nine to get in front and stay there for most of the day.

“It’s amazing what she’s accomplished” Thompson said about Korda. “Everybody knows how good the Korda sisters are as players and athletes. The whole family is. It’ll be a good final day. Looking forward to it. Hopefully we just make a lot of birdies out there.”

The top 60 in the Race to CME Globe after this week advance to the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship which offers $1.5 million to whoever wins.

That appears set barring a big charge Sunday by Maria Fassi of Mexico who bogeyed her final hole for a 68 and was six shots behind. Fassi likely needs to be runner-up to have any chance at getting into the top 60.

Even more critical for some players is finishing in the top 100 in the Race to CME Globe standings to keep full cards for next year. Lauren Coughlin was a late entry into the field at Pelican Golf Club and is making the most of it. She was No. 106 in the standings and shot 60 to tie for 11th which would put her among the top 100 if she can stay there.

“I’ve been trying not to pay attention to it just not give myself any added pressure” Coughlin said. “I’m just trying to keep making birdies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZi9wZWxpY2FuLXdvbWVuLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1scGdhLW5vdi0xNC0xLjYyNDg4NzbSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjI0ODg3Ng?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Korda wins 4th LPGA victory this year after 4-way playoff at Pelican Women's Championship,"Nelly Korda made such a mess of the 17th hole that missing what amounts to a tap-in barely registered. She made triple bogey and part of her couldn't help but think she had thrown away her chances in the Pelican Women's Championship.

""I honestly lost hope"" Korda said. ""I was like 'OK just try to make a solid par' — 18 is a really tough hole — 'If you have a chance or birdie then try and go after it.' My caddie really kept me in the moment and I didn't give up.

""Thank God I didn't.""

She birdied the 18th and got a second chance when Lexi Thompson had another late collapse this time going bogey-bogey that turned an epic duel between Korda and Thompson into a four-way playoff.

Korda ended it quickly making a 12-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole at No. 18 to win for the four time this year on the LPGA Tour.

None were this wild.

Korda fell out of the lead on the 17th hole at Pelican Golf Club by chopping her way to a triple bogey to fall two shots behind. She answered with an 18-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a 1-under 69 and got into a playoff when Thompson missed another par putt and shot 69.

They were joined at 17-under 263 by defending champion Sei Young Kim (67) and Lydia Ko (66) neither of whom expected to be playing extra holes until Thompson and Korda imploded over the final two holes.

""It was a heated battle. I actually really enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun"" Korda said. ""She played some solid golf. Unfortunate on 17 18. Seventeen there were a lot of spike marks around the hole so I don't know if she hit one to three-putt. But that's how golf is sometimes.

""You're going to lose these and sometimes you're going to win them.""

Canada's Henderson in 5th

The victory paid off handsomely for the 23-year-old American.

She secured her spot at No. 1 in the women's world ranking and moved 12 points ahead of Jin Young Ko for LPGA player of the year going into the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship next week in Naples.

Meanwhile Canada's Brooke Henderson finished in fifth place at 14-under. The Smiths Falls Ont. golfer notched six birdies and one bogey on Sunday for another 65 round.

Alena Sharp of Hamilton Ont. tied for 52nd after shooting a 69 with three bogeys on the front nine and four birdies throughout.

Korda now has five wins this year — four on the LPGA Tour to match Jin Young Ko's total one a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

She lost a two-shot lead on the par-3 12th hole when Korda made bogey and Thompson made birdie and they matched par for the next four holes in a two-player race.

And then it was four players.

Kim birdied the 18th and figured she had tied for third with Jin Young Ko who played bogey-free. It was a matter of whether Korda or Thompson would win the tournament.

And then it changed so quickly. Korda pulled her second shot to the 17th dumped a wedge into a bunker and missed what appeared to be a tap-in. It added to a triple bogey with one hole left.

Instead Thompson added to reputation of struggling to close out tournaments. She bogeyed the 17th but still had a one-shot lead until making another bogey on the 18th.

Korda made good on her second chance.

38 tournaments since last win for Thompson

Thompson took only one question and spoke about an ""amazing week"" with hospitality ""like no other."" It wasn't clear if she was talking about her own hospitality.

Thompson now has gone 38 tournaments since her last LPGA Tour victory. At the U.S. Women's Open this year at Olympic Club she lost a five-shot lead on the back nine and finished with two bogeys to miss the playoff by one shot.

Korda wasn't the only winner.

Yu Liu closed with a 66 and tied for 16th enough to move into the top 60 in the Race to CME Globe and qualify for the season-ending tournament next week. All 60 players — from Jin Young Ko at No. 1 to Wichanee Meechai at No. 60 — only has to win the tournament to claim the $1.5 million prize and the Race to CME Globe title.

Lauren Coughlin who earned a spot in the field through Monday qualifying closed with a 70 and tied for 16th. She moved from No. 106 to No. 97 to keep a full LPGA card for next season. Stephanie Meadow moved up one spot to No. 100 the cutoff for full status.

Turkey's Council of State has ordered experts to examine whether soft drink Coca-Cola includes harmful ingredients Deutsche Welle's Turkish service reported on Nov. 13.

The court reversed the judgement of a local court which rejected an application by Ethem Öztürk who wanted the examination of Coca-Cola for chemicals carcinogens and other harmful ingredients.

Öztürk who said that he works on children's health and education filed an application with the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry in 2014 in order for the authorities to determine the said ingredients and prevent them if there are any.

The applicant also asked for the ministry to ban all types of advertisement sales and marketing methods of Coca-Cola citing their ""adverse affects on children.""

Upon getting rejected Öztürk filed a complaint with an Ankara court in order for the ministry's rejection to be overturned. The court rejected the case in 2015 saying that the ingredients have already been analyzed and the fact that the drink is being sold shows that it's safe.

The court also said that the flavorings in Coca-Cola were previously approved following risk analyses.

Undeterred by both rejections Öztürk took the case to the Council of State which accepted his complaint saying that the local court rejected the case without carrying out examinations of the said ingredients.

""The solution of this issue requires special and technical knowledge so an expert analysis is needed"" the court said noting that the result should also be conveyed to the company since the outcome would affect its interests.

The local court is expected to assign an expert to analyze Coca-Cola and review the report that will be prepared afterwards. The court's ruling will be determined in line with the expert's findings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZXdib3VuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXllcy1iZWVyLWRpdmlzaW9uLWNsb3Nlcy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1jbGFzc2ljLWJldmVyYWdlLWluLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reyes Beer Division Closes Agreement with Classic Beverage in California,"ROSEMONT IL – Effective today Reyes Beer Division (RBD) has officially closed on its exchange of certain brand distribution rights with Classic Beverage in Southern California.

Of the 20 highest-rated programs in U.S. television history only the ""M*A*S*H"" finale earned a spot on the list. Every other program is a Super Bowl. The game is the obvious draw but it's the commercials and massive halftime show performances that bring millions of casual football fans to the game every February.

Back on October 1 1979 Coca-Cola first aired a commercial starring Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle ""Mean"" Joe Greene and a 9-year-old superfan who was played by Tommy Okon. The story the advertisement portrayed stood the test of time and anyone who watches it today gets all the feels when Mean Joe famously calls out ""Hey kid catch!""

Limping down the tunnel toward the Steelers' locker room a young fan offers to help the future NFL Hall of Fame inductee. The young boy tells 'Mean' Joe that he thinks Pittsburgh's superstar is the best ever and offers him a bottle of Coke. After downing the entire bottle Greene makes his iconic jersey toss to the kid in an exchange that still puts a smile on everyone's face to this day.

Stock up on some classic bottled Coca-Colas and watch one of the most memorable Super Bowl ads to ever air.

Mean Joe Greene's Coca-Cola Commercial

RELATED: 'Chicks Dig The Long Ball"" Remains Baseball's Best Commercial

This Coke commercial still ranks as one of the greatest Super Bowl ads in history. Not only did Coca-Cola capitalize at the height of the Steelers' dynasty in the 1970s which culminated with the team's fourth title of the decade in Super Bowl XIV over the Los Angeles Rams but 'Mean Joe's commercial also famously re-aired during that very game on CBS.

The Super Bowl commercial from McCann-Erickson won a Clio Award for one of the best T.V. commercials of 1979 and ""Have a Coke and a Smile"" stamped the iconic ad campaign and jingle as one of the most effective ever thanks to the writing of Penny Hawkey and director Roger Mosconi.

In 2017 the co-stars reunited once again inside Apogee Stadium in Denton Texas where Greene recalls chugging 18 bottles of Coke before getting the commercial right.

For someone with a classically ""mean"" reputation on the field the commercial pulled back the veil to show that football players even a Hall of Famer who was a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year are nice guys with a softer side off the football field.

During Super Bowl XLIII which also happened to be Steelers' victory Pittsburgh safety Troy Polamalu brought the great commercial back to life with a few hilarious twists for the company's Coke Zero products.

Famous Recreations of the Commercial

Heck even Shaquille O'Neal teamed up with Coca-Cola rival Pepsi to create their own spoof of the classic commercial:

The big game's greatest commercials are more than just good laughs to get us thinking about what products we'll buy during our next grocery trip. The best have an emotional connection which remind us all that it's only a football game and even tough guy football stars aren't any more important than a little boy looking to dish out a smile.

Its retro styling is somewhere between art deco and 50s American diner and by serving up limited editions of it Smeg has turned it into something of a pop art icon. The latest is a collaboration with Coca-Cola and draws on the brief portion of the early 70s when Coke was a beacon of love peace and general grooviness baby yeah.

The limited edition 'Unity' fridge marks the 50th anniversary of the Coca-Cola ad where a bunch of bright-eyed hippies summoned the Age of Aquarius by singing things like 'I'd like to teach the world to sing' and 'I'd like to buy the world a Coke' whilst standing on a hilltop. Afterwards they probably held a 'happening' or swingers party or something.

The Unity fridge is just the latest in a proud line of pop art FAB28 fridge makeovers from Smeg and one of the best. Scroll through. the gallery below to take a look at some splendid efforts from years gone by…

Image 1 of 6 Probably the best known of the FAB28 fridges is this Union flag-adorned one. It's so Brit-pop you could imagine Oasis storing their tambourines in it (Image credit: Smeg) This one features Mickey Mouse reaching up to open your fridge – probably to steal cheese (Image credit: Smeg) Snoopy chills out on the door of this one. His bird pal is called Woodstock which is also very groovy man (Image credit: Smeg) These over-the-top designs were furnished by Italian fashionistas Dolce and Gabbanna no less (Image credit: Smeg) Okay this one isn't a FAB28 – it's a beer fridge modelled on the original Fiat 500 (Image credit: Smeg) Finally there's the new Coke Unity fridge. You could keep cans of Pepsi in it for extra irony (Image credit: Smeg)

A lot of Coca-Cola's design these days is quite corporate and dull but the Smeg Unity fridge is bold colourful and really far out man. There's psychedelic fonts acid colours and the word 'Love'. Smeg says that the design 'showcases Smeg’s signature retro style and high-quality design as well as celebrating Coca-Cola’s enduring influence on popular culture since the ground-breaking impact of its Harmony commercial in 1971.'

You could reasonably say that the styling is more 60s than 70s but then to be fair 1971 was not that long after the 60s. It's the first kitchen appliance I can think of to be inspired by an advert.

There will only be 25 of these fridges made and each one comes with an engraved plaque bearing its unique number.

Earlier this year Smeg also created this Diet Coke fridge with a rather more restrained design (Image credit: Smeg)

Appropriately Smeg has not gone overboard with futuristic features in its retro fridge. The interior features glass shelves that are removable to 'maximise and utilise the space to your individual needs.' A Life Plus compartment adds extra longevity to perishable foods and there's also a fruit and vegetable drawer and an icebox for all your ice cube needs. A multi-flow cooling system 'ensures the ideal temperature and humidity for food storage.' The overall capacity is a whopping 270 litres.

The Unity fridge is the most over-the-top Smeg collab since it teamed up with the fashion house of Dolce and Gabanna to make fridges and other kitchen appliances painted with everything from lemons to medieval battle scenes by Sicilian artists. The D&G fridges are actually quite reminiscent of this Dolce & Gabanna panetonne box that I found in my local deli the other day.

(Image credit: Duncan Bell)

As you can see from the gallery up top Smeg has also made fridges to celebrate Mickey Mouse Charlie Brown and the Fiat 500 – the latter costing nearly £10000 which is about what an actual Fiat 500 would have cost you back in the day once you factor in repairs.

The Unity fridge is part of an entire collection of Coca-Cola collabs that it's calling the 1971 Unity Collection. Also available are Popsocket wallets Timex watches and a range of apparel. Kate Dwyer Senior Director of Global Licensing for Coca-Cola stood on a hilltop and trilled out “These new collections showcase the timeless values of peace inclusiveness diversity and optimism.""

Here's the original Hilltop ad that inspired the 1971 Unity Collection. They don't make 'em like that anymore.

Smeg Unity fridge: price and availability

The special edition Unity fridge will be exclusively available in Smeg’s UK flagship store in London St James and worldwide at shop.smeguk.com where only 25 will be available. The price? A cool £2399/$3200/AU$4400."

The 32-year-old took to social media on Saturday revealing she picked up the injury during the team’s quarterfinal match against the North Carolina Courage.

“I tore my Achilles in last Sunday’s match and have surgery next week” Huster writes. “An injury at such a critical point in the season and in my career is devastating as you can imagine.”

Working with people across the gender identity spectrum isn’t just about being inclusive it’s smart business.

That’s the takeaway Lisa Kenney CEO of Reimagine Gender wants to impart to real estate professionals to help them better serve their clients. Kenney who presented during the “Reimagining Gender: Are REALTORS® Ready to Navigate this New Reality?” session at the 2021 REALTORS® Conference & Expo in San Diego said 56% of Gen Z knows someone who uses gender neutral pronouns according to J. Walter Thompson data. And a Harris poll found that 12% of millennials identify as transgender or gender nonconforming.

“We’re not talking about a small number of folks. The Gen Zs are really changing the expectations of how we think see and talk about gender” Kenney said. “We’re all affected by constructs of gender ... it’s a conversation for all of us.”

Millennials and Gen Z are a major demographic component of current and future buyers so it’s critical not only to be cognizant of using proper pronouns but also other gendered terms.

Sarah Gustafson ABR CRS PSA SRES with Janice Mitchell Real Estate Inc. in North Oxford Mass. sends all of her new clients an “all about you” client intake form to fill out. One of the questions she includes is what pronouns they want her to use.

Real estate pros should also avoid gendering their communications. Instead of using Ms. Mr. or other gendered language in an email simply use contacts’ names or lead with “good morning” Gustafson suggests. Don’t assume gender based on name appearance or sex.

When you write listing descriptions for the MLS avoid phrases like “his and hers closets” “man cave” and “she shed” and avoid talking about a garage being a place for “all the boys’ toys.”

Kenney who identifies as nonbinary shared a personal experience working with an agent to sell a house. The agent did a great job they said except for referring to Kenney and their wife as “ladies.” And even after Kenney asked the agent to not use the term the agent continued.

“This can cost us business without even realizing it” said Gustafson. “Someone might not say something and then never refer you down the line or they could be mad and post it on social media.”

When people traditionally think of gender they also think of sex Kenney said. However those two separate concepts are often conflated. The gender reveal party for instance is actually a sex reveal party.

Gender identity is a person’s internal experience and the language used to describe it typically falls into three categories:

Binary: man woman

man woman Nonbinary: genderqueer or genderfluid. They don’t see the world as made up of one of two genders but rather a continuum or mosaic Kenney said.

genderqueer or genderfluid. They don’t see the world as made up of one of two genders but rather a continuum or mosaic Kenney said. Ungendered agender or genderless: This is someone who doesn’t identify with any gender Kenney said.

The social dimension of gender is how we present our gender to the world and how individuals societies and cultures perceive interact and try to shape our gender. Often gender cues vary from person to person such as how they dress their hairstyle and more. But gender cues can be stereotyped and a person’s reaction to other people’s gender cues can be misread or interpreted based on their own biases or preconceived notions of gender.

Sexual orientation refers to the relational interpersonal relationships a person has that involve physical sexual and romantic attraction to others.

Gustafson suggests understanding your own gender story and how it impacts your understanding and perceptions of gender to better serve your clients. Use a gender lens in your real estate business by examining the ways gender impacts your people processes and systems. And ensure agents on your team or at your company and key stakeholders have a common framework and language for gender Gustafson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vanVzdHdvbWVuc3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vc2FtLWtlcnItZnJhbi1raXJieS1zY29yZS1pbi1jaGVsc2VhLXJvdXQtb2YtbWFuY2hlc3Rlci1jaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sam Kerr Fran Kirby score in Chelsea’s rout of Manchester City,"Chelsea put on a dominant showing Sunday cruising past Manchester City 4-0 for three points in the Women’s Super League standings.

The Blues put the pressure on Manchester City early stifling their backline. Sam Kerr triggered Chelsea’s first goal committing to a high press before forcing a turnover from Manchester City’s goalkeeper.

The US ISP hasn't provided any reason for taking this action so in response MangaDex has been working on a solution. Over the past few months the team has developed a workaround and while it may not last forever the site is accessible to all once again.

It is extremely common for internet service providers to prevent their customers from accessing pirate sites. Often they are required to do so by after being ordered by a court but in the United States this is almost unknown.

That’s why in the summer it was a surprise to see reports flooding in from Verizon customers alleging they could no longer access a number of pirate sites including MangaDex NYAA and Kemono.party.

These sites have a few things in common. They all operate in the manga niche they all have issues with copyright holders and they all use (or have used) DDoS-Guard a Russian CDN provider that’s considered a safe haven for pirate sites.

That raised the question of whether the nature of the sites themselves was behind Verizon’s decision to block (or more accurately null-route) or whether the use of DDoS-Guard was the key factor.

Verizon Fails to Unblock MangaDex

With Verizon failing to fix or even acknowledge the issues subscribers of the ISP have not been able to access MangaDex by ordinary means. VPNs still worked of course but as the image of MangaDex’s network map shows when Verizon interferes with user connections to DDoS-Guard (the straight line pointing down from ‘Users’) none of the infrastructure behind it can be accessed.

Of course MangaDex could’ve told Verizon subscribers to use a VPN or even cast them aside completely. However that clearly isn’t the platform’s style. Finding some way to bypass Verizon’s blocking appears to have become a challenge so over the past several months the team has been working on it.

MangaDex Nullifies Verizon’s Null-Route

In a recent announcement MangaDex revealed that its team has been successful. How they achieved this is being kept a secret for now but the site confirms that its solution works and they received zero help from Verizon.

“To eliminate some misinformation we’ve seen circulate we would very much like to not thank [Verizon] as they didn’t lift the ban on their end to this day. However we are really glad to have found a workaround and happy to welcome their users back on the platform” the team writes.

While this will be a cause for celebration for some Verizon users MangaDex says that it doesn’t know if the fix will be a permanent one. The best solution then would be to switch to an ISP that doesn’t quietly block sites and then offer no explanation.

“We also must mention that there is absolutely no guarantee that our current workaround will last forever so you might want to consider switching to an ISP that doesn’t censor your internet access at some point. That means pretty much any other one in the world” the team concludes.

The above image is courtesy of MangaDex which recently published an intriguing overview of its operations

Update November 14: MangaDex has responded to some of the questions we asked earlier. The site didn’t reach out to Verizon directly before taking countermeasures.

“MangaDex has not attempted to reach out to Verizon. Outside of utilizing the typical support channels we have found no clear way to reach out for such an issue. MangaDex is a large enough site so Verizon should be aware of the issue. Some of our users have reached out to Verizon but as far as we know none have had any favorable results.”

MangaDex believes that the blockade could be related to its CDN provider DDoS Guard as we also hinted at in our original coverage. However it could also be a more direct attack.

“The issue could possibly be MangaDex/Nyaa specific. We feel it’s an odd choice to target us instead of larger aggregators and other sites in the same category” MangaDex tells us.

This isn’t the only issue MangaDex is facing. The site explains that it’s also marked as “dangerous” by TrendMicro and appeals appear to be instantly rejected. SURBL meanwhile marked mangadex.network as spam",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZXNub2JlZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvbW91bnRhaW4td2VzdC9mcmVzbm8tc3RhdGUvYnVsbGRvZ3MtZm9vdGJhbGwvYXJ0aWNsZTI1NTc3NzgyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fresno State Bulldogs football vs New Mexico Lobos game blog,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fresnobee.com', port=443): Read timed out.

At one point he joked to the small crowd that he wanted to introduce a young drummer looking for a break in the biz. And so up came his Stones pal Charlie Watts the rocker with the striking silver hair and graceful touch at the drum kit to join Ries’ ensemble for a pair of numbers.

One of the songs they performed together that evening at the Max M. Fisher Music Center with Watts playing brushes was poignant in retrospect — a rendition of a 1930s standard with a famous opening line: “For all we know we may never meet again.”

“It was perfect Charlie” Ries says. “Sitting there smiling and having a wonderful time playing jazz.”

For Ries a Tecumseh native who has been part of the Rolling Stones’ touring band for more than two decades it was the latest in a slew of memorable nights with Watts a friendship forged through a shared love of jazz. Beyond the bright lights and packed stadiums onstage with the Stones they’d done dozens of these small gigs together.

Watts died in August at age 80 two years to the week after his final concert. It had already been announced the ailing drummer would be replaced by Steve Jordan for the band’s soon-to-resume No Filter Tour which will bring Mick Jagger Keith Richards Ronnie Wood and company to Ford Field on Monday.

Ries remembers Watts as an encyclopedia when it came to the vintage stuff — the Duke Ellingtons Charlie Parkers Elvin Joneses. When an old song’s name eluded the sax player he could bang out a few notes and Watts would pipe up with the title. For Watts ever eager to get tuned into the latest great players the younger Ries was an entree to the newer stuff on the scene.

Ries a University of Michigan grad raised in a musical family wasn’t a rock 'n' roll guy when he got the Stones call-up in ’98 having been recommended to the band by a horn-player friend.

“I’m a person who grew up playing mostly jazz” says Ries. “And being from Michigan I loved Motown and soul music. Aretha and Stevie are heroes. Of course Duke Ellington and Coltrane. And that’s the music Charlie loved as well. That was his passion since he was a kid.”

It didn’t take long for Ries to pick up on Watts’ jazz stylings — the traditional stick grip the lilting swing he lent to the rhythms the elegant fills. It wasn’t a conventional rock approach but it made the Stones’ music distinctive and unique

“I was noticing how he played” Ries recalls. “There’s a certain way a jazz drummer hits the instrument. You never saw Charlie bashing the drums.”

Eventually they got to talking about musicians and by 2002 — after catching a Kenny Garrett show together in Chicago — they were regularly heading out for late nights in the clubs. Watts always got a seat near the drummer and made it a point to go backstage to meet the musicians. He and Ries were often the last to leave.

“He was always wanting to go hear music” says Ries. “Charlie was such a sweetheart such a nice human being like this hip uncle everybody wishes they had. He was a super famous guy but never came off like that. It wasn’t ‘Charlie Watts the star drummer of the Stones.’ He was there to watch the bands.”

Watts’ jazzy touches with the Stones inspired Ries to embark on his own take on the band’s music: The two-part “Rolling Stones Project” — featuring jazz arrangements of hits and including guests such as Sheryl Crow and Norah Jones — was released in 2005 and 2008.

Ries also began setting up his own little jazz gigs while on the road with the Stones. He estimates he did about 50 of them over the years — nearly all of them attended by Watts who invariably hopped onstage for cameo spots.

'Every night is inspiring'

The saxophonist has pulled the plug for now on his side performances while out on the No Filter Tour. Amid the pandemic the Stones’ 200-person touring crew is operating very much in a restrictive bubble getting tested weekly and traveling with a doctor and nurse. Ries said he won’t even get to see his sisters during this week’s Detroit visit and he hasn’t eaten in a restaurant in months.

Still after a year-plus of downtime that prompted him to write a couple of hundred songs on the piano at home (and “I’ve never practiced more saxophone since I was in my 20s”) he’s thrilled to be back at it. And he says the Rolling Stones are playing at a stunningly high level.

“The audience can feel that — they can sense we’re having a good time” Ries says. “You look at Mick Jagger who’s almost 80 and running around like a 20-year-old the consummate entertainer who makes the person in the last row feel like he’s connecting with them. I’m in my 60s and I couldn’t do that if you paid me a million dollars. Seeing that every night is inspiring.”

For now Detroit is the third-to-last stop on the No Filter schedule. But 2022 is the Rolling Stones’ 60th anniversary and while there’s no word yet Ries says his sense is “they would love to tour.”

“People have been asking me since my first Stones tour ‘Is this the last one?’” Ries says. “But musicians play until they die. And why not? We got into it for the love not money. Your thing is putting an instrument in your hands and creating sounds. And that energy creates a buzz for the audience. This great shared thing we have with live music is unlike anything else. You’re around people all feeling that same energy and that collective joy.”

Ries’ versatile body of work most recently included the 2019 album “Life Changes” and the film “How Far the Stars” chronicling his work with a group of Roma players in Budapest. Just before the pandemic he and L.A. director Jordan Walker-Pearlman embarked on a documentary titled “The Jazz Griots: Liberty in Cadence” capturing the living elders in African American jazz.

Jazz is the music running through his veins but Reis says his tenure with the Stones has informed his own work over time.

“It’s not that their songs are simplistic but there’s something about having a song that people retain in their minds 60 years later. That’s something they don’t teach you in university” he says. “There’s something in popular music this thing where you remember for the rest of your life. That’s influenced me too. Not that I’m trying to write a hit but trying to write something that appeals to me and hopefully translates to others.”

And Ries certainly isn't taking the experience for granted. He has after all become a fixture in the World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band.

“I look out every night still kind of amazed. It’s wonderful to be part of this living history” he says. “With the passing of Charlie you really realize how special it is. Because it won’t be forever. Twenty years from now it would be a miracle if I’m still touring with the Rolling Stones. But you never know. I mean Keith is so strong. Mick is so great.

“But I’m not thinking about that. I’m just enjoying this time and with Charlie’s passing it means that much more. We’re playing this music and missing him like crazy but we’re still appreciative we’re doing it.”

Constellation Brands: Activists Demand WATER RIGHTS and FREEDOM USA - English - USA,"SAN FRANCISCO Nov. 13 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- On November 9th Mexicali Resiste led dozens of activists including representatives from Alcohol Justice in a march on alcohol giant Constellation Brands to save three compatriots from dubious charges filed in Mexican court. These charges stem from Mexicali Resiste's work four years ago to prevent Constellation a U.S.-based corporation with offices in San Francisco from acquiring exclusive water rights in the drought-stricken Mexicali Valley. This trial is just the latest salvo in an ongoing struggle against Big Alcohol's takeovers of dwindling aquifers a struggle that already has a body count. The trial is currently scheduled for the 16th of November.

""We can't pretend that alcohol harm is just a physical thing that happens to drinkers"" said Cruz Avila Executive Director of Alcohol Justice. ""When Big Alcohol gets involved it becomes economic harm. Political harm. It's another incarnation of the oppression and exploitation that has cast a long shadow over the US and its neighbors.""

The San Francisco march was held to call for a boycott of Constellation and demand the company use its outsize influence—it is currently in negotiations with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration to open a new factory elsewhere in Mexico—to get the charges against Mexicali water protestors dropped. The group which brought together both Mexico- and US-based organizations peacefully occupied the sidewalk in front of the 101 Mission St. building where Constellation is housed letting the affected members have their voices heard.

""We ask Constellations Brands to stop their plans to build gigantic breweries in water starved regions"" stated Brenda Villanueva Program Director - Pueblo y Salud. ""This precious natural resource would best be used by the people for drinking and growing food instead of making more alcoholic beverages that are saturating and harming our youth and other members of our community.""

In 2015 the governor of Baja California awarded Constellation Brands rights to draw from the aquifer in Mexicali in service of a new factory. Details of the contract were shrouded behind confidentiality clauses but the plant was expected to produce over 4 million bottles of beer and experts estimated it would have consumed as much as 25% of the available water reserves.

""We denounce the criminalization of the Mexicali Resiste Activists for choosing to protect the most sacred element for survival and a dignified quality of life – WATER"" said Mayra Jimenez Advocacy Manager at Alcohol Justice. ""We denounce Constellation Brands for commodifying water in a region that is experiencing severe water shortage. This is an environmental catastrophe!""

Local outrage peaked in 2017 when over 12000 residents of Mexicali took to the streets including the members of Mexicali Resiste who now stand trial. Following the protests they were charged with ""dispossession of state buildings"" and ""deprivation of liberty of the police."" Investigators subsequently cleared them of the charges but this year as Constellation began seeking a new location for the plant the Congress of Baja California suddenly decided to overrule the police decision and refile the charges.

The stakes are high both for the protestors themselves and for impacted communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. For the members of Mexicali Resiste they are being confronted with charges that the Mexican government deemed important enough to justify detention during the trial which may last several years. For indigenous and community groups fighting water monopolization in Mexico it adds state sanctions to existing efforts to chill resistance.

""The objectives are to instill fear in those who have not yet become protestors"" stated Mexicali Resiste member Jesus Galaz Duarte one of the three scheduled to be tried on Tuesday in a statement posted to YouTube.

That fear is already there. Óscar Eyraud Adams a member of the Kumiai people of Baja California and a resident of Tecate (west of Mexicali) fought the diversion of water supplies away from local farmers to the Heineken brewery in that city. He was assassinated on the street in September 2020. The Yaqui people of neighboring Sonora state have had similar experiences with multiple activists being murdered in or near Ciudad Obregón. Now Constellation Brands is seeking to expand its Ciudad Obregón facility—and therefore its draw from the water supplies—with those activists' blood still fresh on the streets. Now with the reopened Mexicali Resiste trial Mexican activists are being told in no uncertain terms they will not find protection from the government.

""Choosing to criminalize fighting for human rights is a crime against the people"" added Jimenez. ""Government officials that condone this degree of corporate extraction are complicit in crimes against humanity on both sides of the border. We STAND UP and FIGHT for JUSTICE because we are all Mexicali Resiste.""

As crushing droughts cripple the West of both the U.S. and Mexico water-intensive industries like industrial-scale brewing take on a new and more sinister cast. The Mexicali Valley aquifer is recharged in no small part by the waters of the Colorado River which have been largely claimed by states in the U.S. long before it reaches the border. According to researchers the aquifer was overdrawn by 456 million cubic meters—enough water to fill 50 Levis Stadiums—in 2015 an overdraft that has undoubtedly increased during the drought.

As water tables drop the water that goes into beer becomes an extracted semi- or even unrenewable resource much like oil minerals coal or lumber. In the case of Constellation which thanks to antitrust action has the rights to sell Corona Pacifico and Modelo in the United States but not in Mexico this is classic instance of resource exploitation—Mexican water resources are extracted by U.S. companies and shipped back over the border.

Yet water still stands alone among resources. It is the only one that the human body requires to survive. The loss of water supplies therefore forms an existential threat everywhere it occurs often taking the form of civil unrest.

""You cannot ignore what this means for the future of both countries"" said Avila. ""Every country even. Justice for the Mexicali Resiste members safety for the residents of Mexican border states accountability for Big Alcohol and access to water are not separate issues. They are different faces of one issue and it effects everyone in the west.""

So why are sales slow?,"Open this photo in gallery: Cannabis drinks were at one point in time expected to be the future of cannabis.Giordano Ciampini/The Canadian Press

For anyone who wants to drink their cannabis 2021 has been a good year. Consumers can now choose between THC-infused beverages in cans bottles powders and tea bags. Hot chocolate and kombucha options are on the table.

The reason for this surfeit of choice is that drinks were at one point in time expected to be the future of cannabis. A 2018 Deloitte survey for example estimated that the annual Canadian market for cannabis beverages could be worth $529-million. One in three likely cannabis consumers said they were eager to try them.

But despite the industry’s enthusiasm sales of the beverages have lagged expectations leading some observers to say that the category’s potential was exaggerated. Canadian consumers have been deterred by high prices and legislated limits on the potency of the products. Analysts and cannabis companies meanwhile remain optimistic about the segment’s future saying product development and regulation are slowing its expansion.

Whatever their future the current struggles of cannabis beverages add to the tumultuous story of Canada’s cannabis market which has seen underwhelming results since legalization.

According to data from the Ontario Cannabis Store the province’s online retailer and wholesale distributor cannabis beverage sales between April 1 and June 30 amounted to $4.8-million or 2 per cent of Ontario’s total cannabis market during that time. During the same period in 2020 Ontario beverage sales totalled $1.5-million or 1.2 per cent.

Frederico Gomes a cannabis analyst at ATB Capital Markets estimates that the total Canadian wholesale market for cannabis beverages in 2021 could amount to $60-million or close to $100-million at retail. But he noted that the totals could be larger than his estimate given the rapid expansion of the market.

“Obviously the market did not grow as expected” Mr. Gomes said. “You had these large companies investing in the space and they invested because they saw some potential. But you’re talking about manufacturing technology – you need volume to make that profitable and that’s not there yet.”

Beginning in 2017 beverage companies poured into the Canadian cannabis sector making huge investments to prepare for the development of a new drinks industry.

In 2017 beer and wine distributor Constellation Brands bought a $245-million stake in Canopy Growth – the start of a series of investments that now total more than $5-billion. The following year Hexo Corp. and brewer Molson Coors Canada partnered to create Truss Beverages. The two companies have since contributed over $100-million to the venture.

In 2019 Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev partnered with Tilray on Fluent Beverages a $100-million joint venture aimed at developing cannabis drinks. Later that year cannabis producer Valens GroWorks Corp. acquired beverage company Pommies Cider Co. for $7.5-million and said it would dedicate a further $10-million to facility upgrades.

There is data that suggests cannabis beverages are heading toward an upswing. According to Headset a cannabis research firm based in Seattle growth of cannabis beverage sales in Canada is expected to outpace the growth of the total cannabis market. Beverage sales nationally grew by 27 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 and another 34 per cent in the third quarter. This compares with total cannabis market growth of 12 per cent and 13 per cent for the same quarters.

Hexo one of only a few cannabis companies that separately reports its drink revenue says its products account for 50 per cent of cannabis beverage sales in Canada. It reported total fourth-quarter net revenue of around $5.1-million from the sale of beverages to provincial distributors up 70 per cent from the previous quarter.

Other companies have avoided the drinks category. Mandesh Dosanjh president of B.C.-based licensed cannabis producer Pure Sunfarms said that although he was initially interested in beverages further research into production costs regulations and demand dissuaded him.

“Given the headwinds that I see in beverages there’s no point for us to move into it. There’s no money to be made there” he said. “I think a lot of other people are trying to create demand that just doesn’t exist. They’re trying to push a rock up a hill.”

He said he would reconsider if cannabis beverages started to be sold alongside alcohol in government-run liquor stores – although at the moment there are no plans for that to happen. As for the slew of new product announcements in the space Mr. Dosanjh said big players are locked into their plans after “overhyping” the possibilities of the beverage market.

“They’ve got themselves in a pickle now where they put all their eggs in the basket of beverages. The only other alternative they have is to start shutting down and retracting and I think their ego stands in the way of making any pivots” he said.

Recently Hexo announced it was closing down two facilities and laying off 155 employees just weeks after the company’s auditors raised concerns about overwhelming debt payments.

“At the beginning it was about who could spread the fastest and cover the most real estate” said Lucas C. McCann chief scientific officer at Toronto cannabis consultancy CannDelta Inc.

“Now that’s shifting. We’re seeing companies centralizing their operations selling facilities at a fraction of the price and cutting jobs. They’re focusing much more on quality instead of world domination” he said.

Where beverages are concerned improving quality has meant advancing the science of the drinks themselves. In 2019 U.S.-based Lagunitas Brewing Company revealed that it was having trouble mixing oil-based cannabis ingredients with water. Now some manufacturers are using “nano-emulsification” a process that breaks down cannabis particles so they can distribute evenly within a drink.

This process also speeds up the onset of psychological effects Mr. McCann said. Users of the most potent cannabis beverages can expect the effects to peak around 10 minutes after consumption whereas other edibles can take as long as two hours to kick in.

Mr. McCann said the industry was betting on approval for cannabis lounges – bar-like spaces where people could use cannabis products in public – to help introduce both new and experienced cannabis users to beverage products but the pandemic halted progress.

“It’s not going happen any time soon. Until we see the opening of consumption lounges I don’t expect that beverage sales are going to change too much.”

Others say that regulation is to blame for slow sales. Toronto cannabis lawyer Harrison Jordan said possession limits as well as restrictions on product potency are suppressing interest in beverages.

Cannabis products including drinks are currently capped at a maximum 10 milligrams of THC (cannabis’s active ingredient) a package. This is at the bottom of the range of what a habitual user would consume in a sitting and it’s much more expensive per psychoactive unit than dried flower. In other words for regular cannabis users getting high with a drink is much more expensive than smoking.

The OCS charges $10.95 for the Regal Pink Grape Sparkler drink which contains the maximum 10 milligrams. Cheaper less potent options are also available. Houseplant’s Lemon Sparkling Water which contains 2.5 milligrams sells for $3.95 making it comparable in price to some craft beers.

Analysts say possession limits are an equally vexing problem. Current regulations require retailers to cap total sales to a customer at 30 grams of cannabis per visit. Some drinks like Canopy Growth’s 355-mililitre formats count for as many 5.1 grams towards that limit meaning consumers can only buy five at a time.

Despite the barriers cannabis producers continue to create new drinks: in early November Truss launched a beer-style cannabis beverage and Canopy launched a lemon-lime tonic under its Deep Space brand.

“It’s a very small market in Canada but obviously growing” Mr. Gomes said. “I think it has a good chance of becoming a real market but it’s going to take a while.”

Running one day late because of stormy weather the rocket's first stage engines ignited at 7:19 a.m. ET throttled up to full power and smoothly pushed the booster away from pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station with 1.7 million pounds of thrust.

Climbing out of low fog in spectacular fashion the 229-foot-tall rocket arced away to the northeast and quickly faded from view. Two-and-a-half minutes later the first stage making its ninth flight fell away and flew itself to a landing on an offshore droneship while the second stage continued on to orbit.

The Starlinks were released in a single batch about 15 minutes after launch slowly spreading apart as they drifted away from the Falcon 9's second stage. SpaceX has now launched 1844 Starlinks since the first two prototypes were sent up in 2018.

The California rocket builder plans to launch thousands more in multiple orbital planes to ensure uninterrupted space-based broadband connectivity with customers anywhere in the world using laser cross links to pass user data from satellite to satellite as they fly into and out of range.

London-based OneWeb has launched 358 internet satellites so far in a planned fleet of 648 while multiple other companies including Amazon are planning networks of many thousands more.

Critics fear the potentially vast number of satellites in low-Earth orbit will increase the odds of catastrophic collisions and compromise ground-based optical and radio astronomy.

But proponents say providing broadband services to users anywhere in the world will be a boon to commerce and education adding that safety protocols will minimize the threat of collisions.

Saturday's flight capped an especially busy week for SpaceX. The company brought four astronauts home from the International Space Station aboard a Crew Dragon capsule Monday launched four replacement astronauts Wednesday and helped guide them to a smooth docking at the lab complex Thursday.

The launch Saturday marked SpaceX's 31st dedicated Starlink flight the 25th Falcon 9 launch so far this year and the 131st overall including three triple-core Falcon Heavy boosters. The successful landing of the Falcon 9's first stage marked the company's 71st recovery at sea and its 94th overall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbm1lLmNvbS9hc3Ryb2xvZ3kvc2FnaXR0YXJpdXMtdGF0dG9vLWlkZWFzLXRoYXQtYXJlbnQtYS10b3RhbC1zbm9vemUtZmVzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,49 Sagittarius tattoo ideas that aren't a total snooze-fest,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.cosmopolitanme.com/astrology/sagittarius-tattoo-ideas-that-arent-a-total-snooze-fest on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbm1lLmNvbS9hc3Ryb2xvZ3kvc2FnaXR0YXJpdXMtdGF0dG9vLWlkZWFzLXRoYXQtYXJlbnQtYS10b3RhbC1zbm9vemUtZmVzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The pandemic has already felled a number of famous properties including the landmark Roosevelt Hotel near Grand Central Terminal the Excelsior Hotel on the Upper West Side and the century-old Hotel Pennsylvania across from Madison Square Garden which now faces the wrecking ball.

More than 30 other hotels mostly smaller ones that haven’t yet reopened are at risk of being sold or going dark for good The Post has learned. The list tallied by GAM Hospitality Advisors includes swanky boutiques like The Hudson — the chic Midtown venue launched by Ian Schrager in 2000 — as well as the Paramount Avalon and Roger hotels.

“The burdens that have been put on them by the lack of tourism over the last 20 months and by the city and the labor union will likely result in their permanent closure” said GAM Hospitality president Geoffrey Mills.

The websites of the Roger and Paramount hotels both say they’re set to reopen in spring of next year despite being on GAM’s list of hotels that are at risk of closing. The Hudson and Avalon meanwhile remain closed and haven’t communicated any reopening plans. The Roger Paramount and Avalon didn’t immediately respond for comment. The Hudson couldn’t be reached for comment.

While tourists are coming back in force filling up many hotels over the weekend business travelers are largely missing leaving gaping holes on their balance sheets. On Wednesday the occupancy rate was just 63 percent compared with the “low 90s” on the same Wednesday in 2019 according to Jan Freitag National Director of Hospitality Analytics for CoStar Group.

The massive Jacob K. Javits Convention Center began hosting meetings and trade shows in August but the events are smaller attracting fewer attendees and the calendar for 2022 has been slow to fill up. About 17 shows are listed on the 2022 calendar compared with the 175 shows a year the convention center normally books.

“The calendar is fluid and changes daily” Javits spokesman Tony Sclafani told The Post.

The city’s tourism bureau NYC & Company doesn’t expect business travel to fully recover until 2025 spokesman Chris Heywood said.

Some large hotels that had closed last year recently reopened to catch the wave of holiday tourists as Broadway and the borders reopened — but also to avoid incurring hefty severance payments to furloughed hotel workers industry experts said.

In October Mayor de Blasio signed legislation requiring closed hotels to pay laid-off employees $500 a week starting on Nov. 1 for at least six months if the hotel has more than 100 rooms and laid off more than 75 percent of its employees during the pandemic.

In addition to reopening at the start of the month the hotels avoided the payments by hiring back 25 percent of their staff.

The Hotel Association of New York City sued the city over the law last month arguing that it is battering an industry that has already suffered great losses.

The New York Hotel and Gaming Trades Council meanwhile says that just under half of its members are still laid off from their hotel jobs.

“The [hotel] unemployment rate remains significantly higher than almost any other occupation” Trades Council President Rich Maroko told The Post defending the severance policy.

Since the law was announced the New York Hilton Midtown — the city’s largest hotel with 1878 rooms — reopened in October. The Hyatt Grand Central New York reopened on Nov. 1 as did Omni Berkshire Place which had announced its closure earlier this year.

But these large hotels are not opening all of their rooms because the demand is simply not there.

One of the city’s five biggest hotels for example is “maintaining an artificially low occupancy level as a labor management tool because it’s presently not able to hire and train all the employees to open fully” according to Sean Hennessey president of Lodging Advisors and a New York University professor of hospitality. Hennessey declined to name the hotel.

Still the Langham on Fifth Avenue was jubilant as 35 international travelers arrived in its lobby last Monday the first day they were allowed to come to the US. The guests filled up 10 percent of the property’s rooms according to a spokeswoman. Meanwhile the two Fitzpatrick hotels in Midtown Manhattan which draw a lot of travelers from Ireland are counting on occupancy rates between 90 percent and 100 percent during the first two weekends in December according to owner John Fitzpatrick.

Hackers compromised media and pro-democracy websites in the region to distribute malware to any visitors from an iPhone or Mac placing a backdoor that let them steal data download files and more. Google didn't attribute the campaign to any specific actor but did note that “the activity and targeting is consistent with a government-backed actor.” The incident echoes the 2019 revelation that China had targeted thousands of iPhones in a similar manner—at the time a wake-up call that iOS security isn't as infallible as it's perceived.

The Justice Department also announced its most significant ransomware enforcement actions yet arresting one alleged hacker associated with the notorious REvil group and seizing $6.1 million of cryptocurrency from another. There's still a long way to go to rein in the broader ransomware threat but showing that law enforcement can actually extract a consequence is an important start.

If you've noticed that TikTok is pushing you to connect more with friends and family—rather than limiting your feed to talented and engaging strangers—you're not alone. The platform has taken some unprecedented steps in recent months to figure out who your friends are in real life raising concerns about both privacy and whether TikTok's changes will undermine what makes the social network so appealing in the first place.

Lastly at this week's RE:WIRED conference we spoke with Jen Easterly director of the Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency about the challenges she and the US government as a whole face from increasingly sophisticated adversaries. Having come up through the ranks via the NSA and the Pentagon Easterly is used to offensive cyber operations. Her job now? Play some defense.

You may normally associate card-skimmer attacks—which impersonate credit card readers to steal your payment info—with ATMs and gas pumps to the extent that you think of them at all. But recently someone placed a card-skimming device in a Costco warehouse of all places. An employee discovered the interloping equipment during a “routine check” according to a report from BleepingComputer. The company has informed people whose credit card info may have been stolen. It's a good reminder to double-check where you stick your plastic—or stick with NFC payments.

Earlier this week Robinhood disclosed a “security incident” in which a hacker used social engineering to access an email list of 5 million people the full names of 2 million people and the name date of birth and zip codes of 310 people. Motherboard went on to report that the attackers had in fact accessed internal tools that could have let them disable two-factor authentication for users log them out of their accounts and view their balance and trading information. Robinhood says that customer accounts weren't tampered with but that doesn't help much with the fact that they apparently could have been quite easily.

Spyware manufacturer NSO Group has been no stranger to controversy lately and was recently placed on the US Entity List because it allegedly “developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used these tools to maliciously target government officials journalists businesspeople activists academics and embassy workers.” Now researchers at the nonprofit Frontline Defenders say they've found the company's Pegasus malware on the phones of six Palestinian activists. They couldn't definitively tie the origin of the malware to a specific country or organization but the incident is just the latest in a long line of surveillance malware being used where it expressly shouldn't.

Pierluigi Paganini November 13 2021 November 13 2021

Costco Wholesale Corporation discloses a data breach threat actors had access to customers’ payment card information.

Retail giant Costco Wholesale Corporation notified its customers of a data breach that might have exposed their payment card information. Data was allegedly exposed while customers were shopping at one of its stores.

Costco discovered the security breach after its staff spotted a card skimming device in one of its warehouses as part of a routine check. The company is investigating the incident with the help of law enforcement and notified the authorities.

The retail giant has 737 membership-only retail stores across the U.S. it is the fifth-largest retailer in the world and the 10th-largest corporation in the country by total revenue. The company also operates eCommerce websites for shoppers in North and South America Europe and Asia.

“We recently discovered a payment card skimming device at a Costco warehouse you recently visited” reads the notification letter sent to potentially impacted customers. “Our member records indicate that you swiped your payment card to make a purchase at the affected terminal during the time the device may have been operating.”

Costco revealed that threat actors might have obtained customers’ payment information through the skimmer.

Bleeping Computer reported that some customers claim that the security breach could have taken place in February.

Don’t use your cards at Costco in Inglewood ! My mom got her account hacked and some fraudulent charges and my mom is old school she only uses cash/checks lol this was the first time she ever used her card 😒 — Meli (@_Melii11) February 4 2021

“If unauthorized parties were able to remove information from the device before it was discovered they may have acquired the magnetic stripe of your payment card including your name card number card expiration date and CVV” Costco added.

The company recommends customers monitor their bank accounts and credit card statements for fraudulent activities.

At this time it is not clear the extent of the security breach the company did not reveal the number of potentially affected individuals either the warehouse where the skimmer device was discovered.

The Netflix drama is delicious tea for royal fans but it's understandably a much more stressful thing for the real-life people whose lives it pulls from for said drama.

When The Crown started it focused on the early days of Queen Elizabeth's rule long before most of the modern royal family were even born. The series' upcoming fifth season however is much more modern and is expected to cover much more recent events (including the later years of Princess Diana's life in the '90s).

""This series will be the most controversial ever"" a source said (per The Sun). ""It deals with events that are still incredibly raw for many.""



As such not only are members of the royal family reportedly less and less happy that the show exists but even friends of the royals are starting to get antsy about the possibility that characters based on them could grace the screen—and have a not-so-great impact on their IRL reps.

According to The Sun members of the royal family's inner circle have been actively reaching out to top law firms (including the Queen's preferred firms Farrer & Co and Harbottle & Lewis) to brush up on their legal rights and what options they have if The Crown sullies their images. Not only were these friends told that they would be entitled to sue the creative team behind The Crown but The Sun reports they've passed that legal advice along to the actual royals themselves who would also have grounds for lawsuits apparently.

""Friends of the Royal Family sought legal advice"" a source close to the royals told the British paper. ""The advice they received would also apply to the Royal Family. Although this is not direct legal advice given to the Queen and her family — they have been made aware of this advice.""

Semi-serious question: If the royals *do* sue Netflix though will The Crown do a season 7 to cover the trial?",,,,,,,,,,,,

For starters the Civic Si bits and pieces aren’t particularly exciting. The 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine is easily outperformed by the 2.0-liter Accord Sport and the six-speed manual transmission is “available” rather than “standard” as per the automaker’s press release for the Integra.I’m aware that dual-clutch and some torque-converter automatics are quicker but come on! In my honest opinion the long-awaited revival of the Integra should’ve been more focused on the driving experience rather than how quickly the driver can upshift in auto mode or with the paddle shifters.Another problem with the five-door liftback is the number of doors which is understandable because the Integra replaces the ILX in Acura’s lineup. But for a low-volume car that is expected to appeal to enthusiasts a three- or two-door Integra would’ve been more suitable. Finally look at it!The INTEGRA decals look completely out of place the Diamond Pentagon grille has this “look at me” aesthetics to it and the automaker goes fully obnoxious with the INTEGRA embossings under the driver-side headlight and passenger-side taillight. Given this vanilla approach to exterior design pixel artist Marouane Bembli is much obliged to fix up the Integra in Photoshop with a few notable mods starting with the number of doors.Described as “a missed opportunity” the virtual tuner also works his magic on the front-end styling wheels and the rear by adding a humongous wing inspired by the DC2. The DC2 Integra Type R also inspired the aforementioned embossings but as opposed to the original the 2023 model year will never ever be featured in a top 10 list of best-handlingcars.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This increases the risk of injury.

This recall is an expansion of a previous recall comes on the back of multiple fires and customer complaints and includes the following vehicles with Cummins 6.7L Turbo Diesel engine :

2021 Ram 2500

2022 Ram 2500

2021 Ram 3500

Recall summary

The engines of the vehicles that are part of this Ram truck recall have an electrical heater that warms up the air coming into the engine to help it get to running temperatures faster. The heater is controlled by an electrical relay or a switch.

Recalled vehicles’ switches may short circuit and overheat causing a fire inside the engine compartment. This can happen both while driving as well as when the vehicle is parked and the engine is turned off.

The component in question is a solid-state intake heater grid relay with part number 68444169AA.

Background of the recall

This recall appears to be an expansion of a smaller recall conducted in April. The first recall involved the relay with the same part number and affected about 19000 of the 2021 RAM trucks as reported. Both relays were made by German manufacturer Eberspaecher. The manufacturer became aware of at least eight fires leading up to the recall.

Recall risks

The flames and smoke may distract the driver and other motorists which may lead to a crash. In addition the driver may fail to stop the vehicle in time for its occupants to leave it in a safe manner. Both increase the risk of an injury or an accident.

Safety tips

Park your vehicle away from buildings and other vehicles until the final repair is completed.

For tips on what to do if your vehicle catches fire please read this article relating to car fire safety.

Other Ram recalls

Over 23000 RAM ProMaster City vans were recalled in late October because of turn signal indicators that may stop working increasing the risk of an accident.

The 2020 model-years included in this recall are also being investigated by the U.S. auto safety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) because they may stall while in motion as reported.

The repair

Dealers will inspect and replace the relays if necessary. Notifications about the repair will be sent to vehicle owners around December 3 2021.

Australia pacer Pat Cummins feels that playing the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the UAE has helped his side to adapt to the conditions easily as the team from Down Under defeated New Zealand in the final clash of the ongoing T20 World Cup on Sunday. Mitchell Marsh and David Warner played knocks of 77 and 53 respectively as Australia lifted its maiden T20 World Cup title here at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday. In the summit clash Australia outclassed New Zealand by eight wickets with seven balls to spare while chasing a target of 173.

""Pretty pumped. Once we go back home it will sink in. A lot of support back home they've gotten up at 1 am. It's a good thing to play some IPL here. Even Hazlewood was able to adapt quickly because of that"" said Pat Cummins in a post-match presentation. Chasing 173 Australia got off to a bad start as the side lost its skipper Aaron Finch (5) in the third over of the innings as he was sent back to the pavilion by Trent Boult. Mitchell Marsh joined David Warner in the middle and the duo took the team's score to 43/1 after the end of the powerplay.

Warner took a special liking to Kiwi spinners Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner and the left-handed batter brought up his half-century in the 11th over of the innings. However the introduction of Trent Boult paid a dividend straight away as he clean bowled Warner (53) in the 13th over reducing Australia to 107/2.

Marsh continued with his carnage and he smashed Ish Sodhi for 16 runs in the 14th over bringing up his half-century and Australia needed just 48 runs to win from six overs. In the end Marsh and Glenn Maxwell (28*) guided Australia home by eight wickets.

Earlier Kane Williamson played brilliant innings of 85 runs as New Zealand posted 172/4 against Australia.

Australia were not the favourite to win the T20 World Cup and a lot of that can be contributed to their performances in the format in the recent past and Mitchell Starc was not dismissive of their past. Starc said that the current level of performance is the closes they always aspired to produce and credited the win to players’ bonding.

“It's not been an ideal lead up. But this is the closest the guys were and it has shown in the way we played our cricket. Different guys in different games and the closeness with the guys has taken us through” Starc said.

He was also highly appreciative of the leg spinner Adam Zampa who has been one of the most crucial elements of Australia’s success in the tournament.

“Zampa has been the best bowler by far in the white ball over the last two years. We know how to bowl around him. The bowling group just know our roles a lot clearer” Starc added.

Starc’s partner Pat Cummins who was at his best with the ball in the final was ridging o high emotions and could not sink the historic moment. He also credited his IPL performance and the third pacer in the Australian team—Josh Hazlewood for their dream run to the championship.

[On his innings in the semi-final] When we sit down I will reflect probably closely on that. I think more than my innings the partnership we spoke about me and [Marcus] Stoinis in the rooms when we're chasing just saying that we probably didn't realise that we scored as many runs as we did the other night. And then coming into this game we felt really confident that if the boys could get off to a good start then we could contribute at the end but thankfully Mitch [Marsh] and Davey [Warner] and Maxie [Glenn Maxwell] at the end there did the job for us. As Stoinis said just so proud of this group. Yeah we're stoked.

Marcus Stoinis: The key…this group of boys we absolutely we actually love each other. It is beautiful. I can't wait to keep playing with this team. I'm so proud of them. You won't find bigger supporters of Mitch Marsh than right here and probably his family. We're so happy for him. : The key…this group of boys we absolutely we actually love each other.

Adam Zampa: I just tried to use my strengths to the best of my ability. I knew the wickets were going to be pretty low. I bowled at a good time; we won the toss and bowled first. So it was probably a little bit drier when I was bowling so I tried to use that to the best of my ability tried to get tickets when we needed them and tried to defend when we need to do that as well. : I just tried to use my strengths to the best of my ability.

[On backroom staff] A lot of credit goes to those guys. We've been in bubbles for almost two years now. And that takes a toll on everyone including the staff. Our preparation from their side of things has been great. And it's their win as well.

I was able to give myself a few days off before the tournament to really freshen up and I felt like I was hitting the ball really well. Luckily that wasn't really required a whole heap. But it was nice to be out there at the end and get the winning runs.

Steven Smith: [This win means] a lot. We've worked hard for a long time. This is a trophy that has eluded us for a very long time.

His [Warner's] last two weeks have been amazing. A lot of people were writing him off at the start saying he was out of form but it took one good innings and he was away. Today I thought he came out with exceptional intent again. Him and Mitchell Marsh that partnership really set us up for the game. I am really proud of those two boys. I think they've had great tournament both of them.

Josh Hazlewood: There's always pressure the batters are coming at you from ball one basically. But we started really well we kept the powerplay to I think around 40. Some pretty good effort there and I obviously got away at the end. But we saw the wicket was pretty good and the exceptional chase from our guys. : There's always pressure the batters are coming at you from ball one basically.

[On Williamson's knock] He's a superb player and he has been for a long time now. Another classical Kane innings really scored all around the ground and hurts you when you bowl poorly.

Justin Langer: I suppose everyone who wins a World Cup says it's hard to process it's hard to put it into words. But this is such a special group of people. I know every coach every captain says the same thing. But we've got some amazing cricketers here we haven't had a chance to play together because of different reasons for last 12 months. So when we all got back together it was almost like a reunion. And they're such close there're so many close relationships there. It's a very very special moment for everyone. : I suppose everyone who wins a World Cup says it's hard to process it's hard to put it into words. But this is such a special group of people.

We knew that when we came back together how much talent we had. That's for one. I mean there's enormous talent in this team. When we're in the West Indies and Bangladesh leading into this series there were a few missing pieces. And Mitch Marsh took one of those pieces. And he's been brilliant. And we also embraced fun. In this situation where everyone talks about bubble these guys had so much fun on and off the ground. In this form of the game actually in the game of cricket it's important to have fun and enjoy it and the guys have done that. I think it was a really important part of our success here.

Zamps puts a smile on my face every time because he's a little bit different. He's a little hippie but he's so competitive and he's been so good in this form of the game. We see legspinners have an impact around the world and he's doing that for Australia now.

And Josh Hazlewood well he didn't play the last one-day World Cup because he had some issues with his back. He has come in here he's been sublime so it's just been a great team effort.

Pat Cummins: Pretty pumped. I think once we get back home and get back in there will it only sink in. A lot of support from back home like getting up at 1am to watch this game so a great feeling. : Pretty pumped. I think once we get back home and get back in there will it only sink in.

It was a good thing playing a little bit of the IPL over here. Even someone like Joshy Hazlewood coming straight from the IPL here he is seeing to adapt really quickly and I mean you don't have to get too funky. It's just part of what we do again more with the red ball stuff with a few slower balls thrown in there. This is really great it's such a complete squad of 15 guys here so really happy.

Mitchell Starc: It's not been the ideal lead-up but I think just the closeness of the group we had a great time here. We've had some great times off the field getting around one another. And I think that showed in the way we played our cricket. We've had everyone contribute guys off the field on the field different guys in different games. And we saw that again tonight. So I think that the closeness of the group is what really got us through this tournament and then hopefully that leads into the summer as well. : It's not been the ideal lead-up but I think just the closeness of the group we had a great time here.

Is that a good thing?,"Source: Eric Glenn on Shutterstock

Mental health is having a moment. As online counseling holistic medicine and unlicensed alternatives to therapy proliferate psychotherapy remains a critical high-quality service. However as the world shifts to accommodate more interest in (and access to) psychotherapy corporation- or government-driven directives often compromise our ability to provide a consistently valuable service.

A recent New York Times article described a new project by CVS: to provide mental health services in their drugstores complete with a rationale about how this would provide cheap services that were much more available to the public than current services. My colleague Dr. Linda Michaels with whom I serve on a Covid-19 advisory committee of the American Psychoanalytic Association called this article to my attention. Her published New York Times letter written with her colleagues Drs. Janice Muhr and Nancy Burke as co-chairs of the Psychotherapy Action Network could not have said it better:

While we face a growing mental health pandemic following the Covid-19 pandemic the retail offerings from CVS Walmart and Walgreens are unlikely to help in significant ways.

Selling mental health assessments and offering a short series of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to the masses is what Britain and Sweden have already done in their national health care programs and those programs have been costly and unmitigated failures. Not only was short-term CBT unhelpful but mental illness actually increased in Sweden and Britain is still reeling from the cost overruns and dismal results of its CBT program.

We know what helps people who are suffering — a trusted relationship with a well-trained professional who will help get to the root of issues. CVS’s services seem unlikely to provide that and may be mainly designed to reduce expenses for its partner Aetna. We see insurance industry reform as much more helpful than new programs that offer watered-down services marketed as “therapy.”

A compelling op-ed letter to the Times — as difficult as these are to get published — is not a loud-enough alarm bell to warn of the dangers here. Tempting though it may be the practice of “marketing” rigorous psychotherapy through untested mediums is fraught with complications.

Admittedly it’s easy to understand the appeal of this idea. For starters CVS and other popular pharmacy chains have enormous marketing potential; they lead with the message that psychotherapy is too difficult to access — and too expensive — and they can do it cheaper faster and better. (We have only to cite the example of the way CVS and their few competitors have cornered the market not only on drugstores forcing smaller stores out of business but have contributed to the rising prices of pharmaceuticals in the process.) The implications for sole practitioners or small businesses are not encouraging.

Moreover there is also the issue of motive. Few consumers may know that CVS merged with Aetna in 2018 — like other insurance companies Aetna has an incentive to limit coverage and reduce reimbursements. By conflating psychotherapy with retail therapy CVS has taken on Aetna’s goals. The end result will not be a “cheaper faster better” treatment but rather a full-scale reduction in standards of practice and professional compensation: a profit-driven model that considers the needs of the company before the needs of the client. (As you can tell I’m not a fan.)

It’s not just CVS angling for industry inroads. Consider the proliferation of apps and online offerings that market their services by promising that you’ll be connected with a licensed therapist — “from anywhere at any time. Save money while receiving high-quality care.”

The marketing materials for such therapy establishments do not mention that monthly out-of-pocket costs can far exceed the costs of seeing a quality therapist in person. A full-service package can run about $400 a month far in excess of what most people in therapy would pay using their insurance. The marketing materials of companies also do not clearly disclose that information about customers may be used and sold for advertising purposes.

It behooves all of us to be familiar with these developments. Certainly some of our colleagues will sign up for these platforms but I believe they will run into serious problems namely not being free to conduct therapy well or as long as or frequently as may be indicated and of being captured by corporate machinery. Many therapists already feel constrained by insurance companies like Aetna that second guess clinicians’ judgment. And as other industries demonstrate the benefits of mass production come at a significant cost.

The one-stop-shop approach might work well when you need to develop some photos and pick up some Tylenol but the limits of this service are obvious. For one: The critical intimate relationship between patient and psychotherapist is not something one can buy at a store. CVS’ “therapist of your choice” has of course already been vetted and chosen for you through a business model not necessarily for quality of service.

Consider two case studies on the efficacy of such programs: Sweden and Britain offered CBT on a large scale hyping their national plans as providing better service at large savings. Launched in 2008 Great Britain’s disastrous program forced the closing of effective local services and then the program was found to provide insubstantial relief to its patients. The service lost so many referrals that the number of people who befitted was very small; meanwhile practitioners felt depressed that their work was so often a failure even while they were pressured to work long hours. Under the pressure of the new system many talented psychotherapists simply burned out. (Paul Atkinson 17th February 2020)

A comparable national experiment in Sweden found similar results: with respect to psychotherapy narrowed choice disables a functional system. I cite one report (quoted here as translated from Swedish):

Rehabilitation Warranty strong economic governance of only cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has quickly made the Swedish mental health narrower less competent and less accurate. . . During the same period according to the OECD for a share of poor mental health sick leave and psychotropic drug consumption is one of the West’s largest. (Svenska Dagbladet: January 13 2016.) (Emphasis my own).

These two national programs were “sold” to legislators and the public. They ultimately and tragically impoverished their country’s mental health by displacing and replacing what had been competent and flexible local services in the name of cost savings and efficiency. Now in our country the advent of full-service online therapy as well as the merging of psychotherapy and pharmacy services likewise threaten the demise of the industry as we know it.

Large-scale changes to the messy nuanced deeply personal and highly effective practice of psychotherapy must be scrutinized from every angle. The fate of the practice of psychotherapy must be taken seriously. As we witness the next chapter in the corporatization of mental health we should do all we can to warn against the dangers of shopping for psychotherapists at the same place you shop for bubble gum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3lvcmsvbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay1jaXR5LWRlcGFydG1lbnQtb2Ytc2FuaXRhdGlvbi1mYWtlLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtY2FyZHMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3lvcmsvbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay1jaXR5LWRlcGFydG1lbnQtb2Ytc2FuaXRhdGlvbi1mYWtlLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtY2FyZHMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sources Tell CBS2 Dozens Of Sanitation Employees Provided Fake COVID Vaccine Cards After Mandate Took Effect,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- Ninety-three percent of New York City employees are vaccinated but now two weeks after the mandate took effect there's word that dozens may have submitted fake vaccine cards.

Eighty-seven percent of sanitation workers are vaccinated and for the last two weeks they've been picking up the slack working Sundays to make up for those who chose not to get the shot by Nov. 1.

But now a source from the Department of Sanitation tells CBS2 even fewer employees may be vaccinated alleging at least 50 workers provided fake vaccine verification.

The source says multiple employees claimed to have received the Johnson & Johnson shot at CVS locations on Staten Island and in Brooklyn but those locations were not administering the brand.

New Yorkers had mixed reactions to the reports.

""How can you get something fake? It's not fair. You have to do the truth"" one person told CBS2's Lisa Rozner.

""At the end of the day if you have to pay rent if you really need to get food on your table then you gotta do what you gotta do"" Bronx resident Joel Espinosa said.

""I think it's horrible. Like just get the shot. But at the same time I don't blame them"" one person said.

""I took it because it was mandatory at my work"" one woman said. ""It's not fair for us.""

""Lying is a problem in general"" one man said.

The sanitation workers union did not get back to us but a DSNY spokesperson said the agency is ""actively investigating the situation"" and that ""anyone found to have faked their vaccination will be suspended without pay.""

There are also allegations involving the FDNY.

The New York Post reports blank cards were stolen from vaccination sites administered by the department and forged.

The FDNY had no comment and the head of the firefighters union told CBS2 he is not aware of any member being under investigation.

The city's Department of Investigation says: ""DOI is aware of allegations involving the issuance of bogus vaccination cards and declines further comment.""

Ninety-three percent of city workers are vaccinated but thousands have requested religious and medical exemptions. The most applications have been filed by the NYPD -- more than 6000.

This comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 1.1 million children under the age of 12 have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine including more than 50000 in New York City alone.

For the first time in two months COVID cases are rising again across the country with Thanksgiving fast approaching.

""We're going to see a post-holiday spike there's no questions about that. People are exhausted right now but we need to remain vigilant"" former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.

Colorado is among the country's biggest hotspots for COVID-19 despite a high vaccination rate. Gov. Jared Polis is joining other state leaders including California and New Mexico to ignore federal recommendations and make booster shots available to all adults.

In regards to the alleged scheme a CVS spokesperson says ""We've contacted New York City's Department of Investigation and have been told that CVS Pharmacy is not a target of their investigation into this matter. We'll cooperate fully with investigators as the case moves forward.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXRsYW50YWRhaWx5d29ybGQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTMvdHJhdmlzLXNjb3R0LWRpZG50LWtub3ctYWJvdXQtYXN0cm93b3JsZC10cmFnZWR5LWZvci1ob3Vycy1hbmQtaG91cnMtMi_SAXZodHRwczovL2F0bGFudGFkYWlseXdvcmxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzEzL3RyYXZpcy1zY290dC1kaWRudC1rbm93LWFib3V0LWFzdHJvd29ybGQtdHJhZ2VkeS1mb3ItaG91cnMtYW5kLWhvdXJzLTIvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Scott Didn’t Know About Astroworld Tragedy For ‘Hours And Hours’,"Photo: Getty Images

A spokesperson for Travis Scott is reiterating what his attorney said earlier this week: he did not have the authority to stop the Astroworld festival.

Stephanie Rawlings-Blake former mayor of Baltimore and Travis’ spokesperson told Gayle King Friday (November 12) that the rapper didn’t know what was going on until several hours after the event ended.

“There’s a lot of confusion it was chaotic” Rawlings said when asked when the rapper actually found out about the tragic events of the festival.

“Just like the police officers who were standing in the front of the stage with Travis nearly 30 minutes after declared a public safety emergency Travis had no idea what was going on until well later hours and hours later” she added.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf34KDEV5ns?feature=oembed]

According to Travis’ spokesperson it was the rapper’s team who notified him of the multiple confirmed deaths and hundreds of injuries “after he had gone from event.” Reports indicated that Travis went to Dave & Buster’s after the concert which Rawlings-Blake confirmed adding that he was “trying to regroup with his team” and figure out what had taken place.

“While a lot of people are trying to place the blame Travis is taking responsibility for moving forward and trying to make sure this never happens again to anyone’s child” Rawlings-Blake said later clarifying that the responsibility to stop that show was not on Travis.

“This notion that Travis had the ability to stop the concert is ludicrous. They have a 59-page operations plan and it clearly says that the only two people that have the authority to stop the concert were the executive producer and concert producer” she said.

“He was not responsible for this but he wants to be responsible for the solution” Rawlings-Blake added noting that the rapper and his team prioritized safety and that he’d “learned” from previous concerts about the importance of safety.

“The video shows he stopped multiple times to try to get a sense of what was going on” Rawlings-Blake said. “And just like those police officers standing in front of the stage he could not tell what was going on.”

The rapper reportedly reached out to the victims’ families and has teamed up with Better Health to provide mental health counseling to concertgoers. The rapper also offered to pay for funeral expenses for the victims.

It contains a person's clinical information including vaccination history and comes with a QR code that needs to be uploaded on the VTL application portal before arrival.

While more states are rolling out the SHC VTL travellers to Singapore can provide their digital vaccination record retrieved through their state's or local health authority's public health database said Ms Margaret Tan CAAS' director of airport operations regulation and aviation security in a response to CNA queries.

They can also use their physical vaccination record and a letter signed by their vaccination provider to attest to their vaccination status. The letter should contain the traveller’s details and details about the vaccination.

Singaporeans and permanent residents do not need to apply for the vaccinated travel pass (VTP) and can show either of the above documents for verification at the airlines' check-in counter pre-departure and on arrival in Singapore added Ms Tan.

Short-term visitors and long-term pass holders who need to apply for the VTP but cannot upload their vaccination certificate can apply to the Safe Travel Office with either of the above documents attached for verification.",,,

Kaiser Permanente reached a tentative agreement with its workers’ unions Saturday handing its workers a big victory and averting what would have been a historic strike by two days.

More than 30000 employees had vowed to strike on Monday if the company did not reach an agreement with the unions. As my colleague Noah Lanard wrote last month the health care workers threatening to walk off the job were particularly upset over the so-called two-tiered pay structure that Kaiser had proposed:

Workers’ biggest problem with the wage proposal is that it would cut starting pay for new hires by between 26 percent and 39 percent beginning in 2023. They believe it would deepen an existing staffing crisis at Kaiser’s facilities and put patients at risk by making the nonprofit unable to recruit and retain talented workers. There are also fears that it would lead to resentment among those paid less for the same work or cause Kaiser to replace the more expensive workers covered by the old contract with new hires. Kaiser’s push for two-tier pay resembles similar proposals from Kellogg and John Deere that have already led to strikes this fall.

Essentially workers feared that Kaiser was trying to create a caste system within their ranks paying workers who do the same jobs even side by side different salaries and benefits. These kinds of moves can splinter workers into different groups of have-somes and have-lesses making it harder for them to organize in the future. In the end Kaiser dropped its push for the two-tiered pay system.

The health care giant had defended the proposed cuts as necessary to stay competitive but the numbers tell a different story. In 2019 Kaiser gave its outgoing CEO Bernard Tyson a $35 million pay and retirement package. During the pandemic it made $10 billion. And it made that money while its workers were ground down by the grueling conditions of laboring through a global pandemic.

In his October story Noah detailed the intense situations that some of these workers have had to endure while their company’s bottom line has thrived. Take the case of Hollie Sili an emergency room technician:

These days Sili usually works a 12-hour shift from noon to midnight. But due to staffing shortages she often ends up staying until 4 a.m. before returning for another shift eight hours later. Last year she had a stroke which she attributes to the physical and mental stress she’s experienced at work.

Or Daniel Stretch a hospital engineer:

Stretch the hospital engineer estimates that his workload and stress levels have doubled during the pandemic while pay has remained the same. He and roughly two dozen other engineers are responsible for keeping air conditioners humidifiers sterilization machines cooking equipment TVs nurse call buttons and much more running at their Southern California facility. In pandemic times they scrambled to push air circulation systems beyond their normal limits to protect patients from COVID-19.

Or Katie Johnson an oncology infusion nurse at a Kaiser clinic in Longview:

Johnson an oncology infusion nurse at a Kaiser clinic in Longview Washington doesn’t see how new hires would be able to pay off their nursing school debts and maintain a decent standard of living after a 39 percent cut to starting salaries. Even at today’s higher rates she ended up moving to Longview after being priced out of the housing market 50 miles south in Hillsboro Oregon. She says Kaiser has always operated on a lean staffing model but that things have only gotten worse as colleagues left the field during the pandemic. “If we can’t attract the talent now” she asks “how are we going to attract talent at a lower rate?”

Had the strike happened it would have been one of the largest in American health care history and it would’ve come on the heels of an uptick of labor activism that observers have dubbed Striketober."

Delta Air Lines is restarting 12 transatlantic routes as it responds to increasing international demand.

Delta has seen a 450% surge in bookings since the US announced it would open its borders to vaccinated travelers.

Restored service includes flights to European hotspots like Edinburgh Zurich and Copenhagen.

Delta Air Lines is ramping up its 2022 transatlantic flight schedule with 12 restored routes as the surge in air travel continues to spike.

Delta Air Lines has seen a significant increase in international bookings since the US government announced the country's borders would be open to vaccinated travelers on Monday November 8. According to Delta in the six weeks since the announcement the airline has had a 450% spike in bookings compared to the six weeks prior to the announcement.

With the US opening its borders to vaccinated travelers Delta is expanding its flight schedule with new routes resumed service and increased flight frequencies. According to the carrier Delta is the largest transatlantic airline out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Boston Logan International Airport and is upping its capacity by 90% by summer 2022 compared to the same time in 2021. Overall the expansion will see Delta serve 25 destinations from ten US cities according to the airline.

Under the FAA’s Restricted-Airline Transport Pilot authority Kreck and other Aviation students at MSU Denver can apply for FAA Part 121 pilot jobs – including those with major and regional carriers – after they complete 1000 hours of flight time instead of 1500 hours.

“The reduction in the time requirement lets me and pilots like me join the airline world at least two years before we could have otherwise” said Kreck a sophomore majoring in Aviation and Aerospace Science who hopes to fly for a major air carrier after he graduates. “Time is everything in flying.”

In the wake of the 2009 Colgan Air crash in New York Congress increased the minimum number of flight training hours from 250 to 1500 for pilots to fly commercial passenger airliners.

However the FAA allows graduates of authorized bachelor-degree programs to obtain a Restricted-Airline Transport License with 1000 hours.

“It’s the quality of the ground and flight training curriculum and coursework in those programs where the FAA after approval allows for a reduction of time towards becoming an airline pilot” said Chad Kendall an associate professor in MSU Denver’s Department of Aviation and Aerospace Science.

In the airline world a pilot’s seniority number or date of hire impacts the time it takes to upgrade to captain and to move on to a major carrier Kendall said. He added that it also affects monthly schedules salary and vacation time. The new authorization starts the clock sooner for MSU students.

“This will in turn mean more student pilots coming to MSU Denver and provide a shortened pathway for those with dreams of being an airline pilot” Kendall said.

The faster track couldn’t come at a more crucial time as the airline industry faces a serious pilot shortage that “has come roaring back” following months of steep declines in air travel due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 13% increase in pilot jobs by 2030 compared with 8% for all other occupations.

Delta Airlines recently announced it plans to hire more than 1000 pilots by next summer. American Airlines is looking for more than 1300 pilots by the end of 2022 and United Airlines is hiring 1500.

And aerospace giant Boeing is projecting that airlines worldwide will need 612000 new pilots in the next 20 years. Long-term demand for pilots “remains strong” Boeing said.

Kendall who worked with the FAA in Denver and Washington D.C. for the past 20 months to earn the authorization said U.S. airlines are hiring “in full force” and offering bonuses across the industry.

He added that MSU Denver is the only four-year brick-and-mortar location in Colorado to have received R-ATP authorization which could benefit 105 current MSU Denver Aviation students.

Kreck said that in addition to being pleased with the FAA authorization he appreciates the access to quality airports that partner with MSU Denver to help students accumulate flying time and gain experience in the cockpit.

MSU Denver has a long history of alliances with Colorado’s aviation hub which includes companies such as Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. Raytheon Technology Jeppesen-Boeing United Airlines Envoy Mesa Airlines Express Jet and others along with several area airports.

This past summer MSU Denver announced a pilot-training partnership with McAir Aviation’s flight-training facility at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield. This alliance gives MSU Denver students access to McAir’s fleet of aircraft during their aviation training.

The University is also finalizing agreements with other flight-training providers in Centennial and Colorado Springs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9wb2ludHMtYW5kLW1pbGVzLWd1aWRlLXRvLXRlbC1hdml2LWlzcmFlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your points and miles guide to Tel Aviv Israel,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Getting there

Flights from North America to Tel Aviv (TLV) consistently hover around $1000 round-trip in economy and over $3000 in business so award redemptions are the way to go when booking travel to Israel. Luckily thanks to new diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and recent route additions by the major U.S. airlines there are now plentiful routing options.

After years of not offering nonstop service to Israel American now offers flights to Tel Aviv from three U.S. gateways — New York-JFK Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Miami (MIA). You can book these flights through the AAdvantage program from 40000 American miles in economy 62500 in premium economy or 70000 in business. That said finding saver-level business-class award space on the nonstop routes is extremely difficult. You might have better luck with American's partners like British Airways through London (LHR) Iberia through Madrid (MAD) and Royal Jordanian through Amman (AMM). The redemption rates are the same but you'll typically face higher taxes and carrier surcharges with the partners.

If you need to earn more American miles consider picking up a cobranded American Airlines credit card. New cardholders of the Citi® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard® (see rates and fees) can earn a sign-up bonus of 50000 bonus miles after spending $2500 on purchases in the first three months of account opening. Alternatively opening the CitiBusiness® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® Mastercard® can snag you a bonus of 65000 bonus miles after you spend $4000 in purchases within the first four months of account opening.

United operates nonstop flights to Tel Aviv as well including from Newark (EWR) Chicago (ORD) San Francisco (SFO) and Washington Dulles (IAD). Even better most flights offer the ""true"" Polaris business class product. The MileagePlus program's redemption rates are dynamic but economy awards start at 42500 miles one-way and business at 75000 miles.

A potentially better option for booking United and other Star Alliance member airline awards would be through ANA Mileage Club a 1:1 transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards. Round-trip awards cost just 65000 miles in economy and 104000 miles in business. However there are two caveats: You can only book round-trip awards and ANA passes on fuel surcharges for partner awards. Otherwise consider booking through programs like Avianca LifeMiles or Aeroplan which also charge fairly reasonable rates and are partners of most transferable points programs.

If SkyTeam is your preferred alliance you can either fly Delta nonstop from New York (JFK) or fly with a partner like Air France or KLM and connect through a city like Paris (CDG) or Amsterdam (AMS). However since Delta SkyMiles and Air France/KLM Flying Blue don't have award charts redemptions can vary greatly depending on your travel dates and class of service. For instance it's not uncommon for Delta One awards to cost over 400000 Delta miles one-way though you can occasionally book them for half that.

Luckily Delta has relatively fixed prices for award flights operated by partner airlines. Partner awards will set you back a much more reasonable 37500 miles one-way in economy and 85000 miles in business class. Alternatively when prices for Delta-operated flights are sky-high you may be able to get a better deal through Virgin Atlantic's Flying Club program a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards.

Israel's flag carrier El Al operates the most nonstop flights from North America to Israel and offers a competitive business-class product on its Dreamliners. However there aren't many ways to book these flights with points and miles especially now that El Al is no longer a transfer partner of Amex Membership Rewards.

Your best option for booking El Al awards would be through Qantas Frequent Flyer. Redemption rates vary by distance but to give you an idea one-way awards from Newark (EWR) to Tel Aviv cost 37800 Qantas miles in economy or 90800 in business class while flights from Chicago cost 45000 Qantas points in economy or 104500 in business class. You can transfer points to Qantas from American Express Membership Rewards Capital One Miles or Citi ThankYou earned with cards like American Express® Gold Card and the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card.

Getting around

Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion International Airport (TLV) is located about 15 miles from the city center. Although you could use the app to request a metered taxi you won't find an Uber in Tel Aviv. That said the taxi drivers at the airport are under strict supervision and as long as you request one via the taxi booth outside the terminals you shouldn't get ripped off. You'll have the choice of either a private taxi or a ""sherut"" which is essentially a shared taxi service carrying up to 10 passengers. Another option is public transportation. The airport offers both bus and rail services but buses are a much more convenient (and cheaper) option since the trains stop at the edge of the city.

Once you've made it into the city the best way to explore Tel Aviv is on foot. That said the city offers high-frequency bus routes which can help get you to many different places quickly. There are also plenty of shared electric bike and scooter services available. Just keep in mind that no public transportation operates in Israel from mid-afternoon Friday until Saturday night in observance of Shabbat.

Where to stay

While the selection of points hotels — more specifically luxury points hotels — in Tel Aviv is lacking it's definitely on the rise and you shouldn't have trouble finding somewhere to stay.

The nicest option is easily the Jaffa Hotel part of Marriott's Luxury Collection brand. It's set within set within a restored 19th-century neo-Gothic complex. Aside from being a gorgeous hotel it's located in a fun and convenient neighborhood and has friendly staff. It's a Category 7 Marriott Bonvoy property meaning free nights will cost you 50000 60000 or 70000 points per night depending on the dates of your stay. But keep in mind you could score lower rates by leveraging Marriott's fifth-night-free benefit.

If you're looking to spend slightly fewer points Marriott also offers the Renaissance Tel Aviv and Sheraton Tel Aviv both of which cost 40000 to 60000 points per night. Or if you'd rather have a quieter beach experience consider staying at the Ritz-Carlton (50000 to 70000 points per night) or Publica Isrotel (30000 to 40000 points per night) in Herzliya a roughly 20-minute drive from Tel Aviv.

The other main luxury points hotel is the Norman Tel Aviv. It's World of Hyatt's only option in the city and costs a whopping 35000 to 45000 points per night. On the bright side the hotel is part of Small Luxury Hotels of the World (SLH) so all World of Hyatt members get extra perks like free breakfast early check-in late checkout and a room upgrade — including general members.

You can earn enough Hyatt points for at least one free night here by adding the World of Hyatt Credit Card to your wallet. It's currently offering a welcome bonus of up to 60000 bonus points: 30000 bonus points after you spend $3000 within your first three months from account opening plus up to 30000 more points by earning 2x bonus points total on purchases that normally earn 1x bonus point on up to $15000 in the first six months of account opening. Alternatively you can transfer points from Chase Ultimate Rewards to Hyatt at a 1:1 ratio.

If you're looking to be in the heart of the action there's the Hilton Tel Aviv. This property often costs around 80000 points per night and isn't that exciting. But its beachfront location is unbeatable and it has a massive pool. It also offers an executive lounge which you can access through the automatic elite status provided by several Hilton credit cards.

Other solid options include the InterContinental David Tel Aviv (50000+ IHG points per night) Crowne Plaza Tel Aviv Beach (34000+ IHG points per night) the Crowne Plaza Tel Aviv City Center (31000+ IHG points per night) and the Hotel Indigo Tel Aviv Diamond District (31000+ IHG points per night).

Activities

Soak up the culture

Jerusalem isn't the only Israeli city rich in culture and history — Tel Aviv is too. Specifically Tel Aviv offers an exuberant art scene that you can embrace sans admission fees. The city's streets feature vibrant graffiti and thought-provoking messages — with art that is generally inoffensive and doesn't involve politics. Although this feature has now spread throughout the city you'll find a high concentration of art in the Florentine section of south Tel Aviv.

Hit the beach

While Israel is best known for its historical sites it's also a fantastic beach destination. Tel Aviv offers 13 white sand beaches that sprawl out over nearly 10 miles of sand. The most popular stretches are Gordon Beach Frishman Beach and Hilton Beach which draws a predominantly gay crowd. You can comfortably swim in the Mediterranean and enjoy the sunshine from April through mid-November. If you want to fit in with the locals be sure to pick up a Matkot set (Israeli beach tennis). Chairs loungers and umbrellas are available for rent at most beaches for 6 NIS ($1.93) 12 NIS ($3.86) and 6 NIS ($1.93) respectively. The city sets the rates so you shouldn't pay more than that.

Eat your heart out

Tel Aviv is basically heaven for foodies. Delicious hummus shawarma and falafel are readily available (the best is in the Carmel Market) but the city offers much more than the standard Middle Eastern fare. Since Tel Aviv is largely a city of immigrants you can enjoy phenomenal international cuisine as well.

Bottom line

Tel Aviv is back open and ready for visitors. Thanks to recent route additions and hotel openings there are more ways to get to and stay in Tel Aviv with your points and miles than ever before. Just make sure to avoid these mistakes on your first trip there."

We saw this in 2016 shortly after Savaree Careem and Tripda went mainstream. We saw this recently in 2020 when the All Pakistan Restaurant Association announced the suspension of business with Foodpanda citing unfair business practices.

That is not to say that these tech forward start-ups do not then become exploitative entities in and of themselves but for a brief glowing moment they offer respite. And for every one of those brief moments there is panic and outrage. And now the start-ups are coming for something that is perhaps and nearest and dearest to the hearts of the Pakistani Whatsapp uncle – real estate.

Having a ‘plot’ (pronounced pee-lat) in Pakistan particularly in Lahore and Punjab is a concept that both boggles the mind and makes a person sad. There is such little investment opportunity in the country and markets and financial institutions are so far removed from the middle and upper middle class that most people find themselves investing in things like real estate and gold. And because people park outrageous sums of money in these properties the market maintains a self fulfilling prophecy of prices remaining high.

Now the start-ups are planning on tapping into the same obsessions and offering small term investments in real estate in a bid to offer the true middle class of Pakistan a chance to own and flip a slice of the real estate bubble. The Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) model is facing disruption from several stealth startups.

Notably these include xState and FracEstate which allow budding investors to own a piece of Pakistani real estate through fractional ownership using digital security tokens. Investors can buy and sell their property tokens on a digital exchange or keep and gain a yield.

“The solution is to create liquidity in real estate allow investors to liquidate their investments in real estate quickly” said Asif Khan co-founder & CEO of xState. “There is a need for an exchange for real estates like Nasdaq or Binance for real estate properties.”

Khan said that xState plans to give liquidation to the traditional real estate holdings and transactions help Pakistani expatriates invest in premium locations without needing to visit the country to transfer their money and empower real estate agents to earn a 1% commission through a partner program.

“Pakistan’s GDP is USD $280 billion but $400 billion are parked in Pakistani real estate” said Khan. “Comparing it to the USA their economy is over $20 trillion but only $10 trillion are parked in real estate. xState is a real estate investment platform that enables anyone to invest in real estate with as low as Rs. 5000 and allows for an exchange in real-time. Think of xState as Binance for real estate.”

Promising greater efficiency higher security and lower costs to the financial industry xState is a real estate equity crowdfunding and exchange platform that intends to use tokenization which enables investment in the form of digital tokens backed by real-world securities or assets to transform the real estate investment landscape in Pakistan.

Signaling confidence

It is a concept that has SECP approval under the 2nd Cohort of Regulatory Sandbox shortly after publishing a position paper in 2020 titled Regulation of Digital Asset Trading Platforms which introduced the concept of digital assets and gauge the opportunities and risks of introducing the same in Pakistan under a bespoke regulatory framework.

With the position paper from the SECP signaling to investors and business builders that the financial regulatory agency would recognize the need to allow the new middle class to invest in real estate at affordable prices through fractional ownership three companies have emerged: DAO PropTech in September 2020 xState in January 2021 and FracEstate in July 2021.

In an RFP from Karandaaz from mid-2021 the financial inclusion nonprofit sought a landscape study and framework for the regulation of digital assets & digital asset trading platforms in Pakistan. Industry insiders told Profit that the outcome of the RFP will become law.

Within a month of this news industry insiders learned that Foodem.com co-founder Kash Rehman – who recently joined Sarmayacar Ventures as a limited partner – was in Pakistan and meeting with various mobility industry co-founders in a bid to find partners for a service around real estate tokenization and another InsurTech service around offering extended warranties.

Sources close to Kash told Profit that the drawbacks with real estate tokenizing such as lack of management and deeds scalability problems and liquidity paradoxes led Kash to seek alternative business models for investment such as cloud kitchens and InsurTech.

As reported by Profit Kash recently invested an undisclosed amount towards Lettus Kitchens a cloud kitchen business at a rumored $3 million valuation. Sources said that upon studying the Pakistan market at length he was bearish about fractional ownership.

“The biggest challenge is to ensure that the title of the underlying property is clear” said Mubariz Siddiqui a legal practitioner with a demonstrated history of working with early-stage businesses and investors in the technology industry. “So for fractional ownership the customer gets shares of a company. The company owns the property. While the customer’s ownership of the shares is fine (record with the SECP) the company’s ownership of the property could be disputed easily.”

Among the barriers to the idea that Kash came across were the capital gains tax structures which create a disincentive for the sale of real estate before the holding period. As reported by Profit a longer holding period indicates that property was not bought for the purpose of making a profit on its resale and hence leads to lower taxes. On the other hand a higher amount of capital gains earned is subjected to a higher tax rate by the authorities leading to higher taxes.

“The first property we listed had a holding period of 2 years as we overlooked this” said Azfar Kashif the VP of business development at xState. “In that case xState will bear the CGT on its own and not let its investors get affected by that. All of our next properties including the current one have a holding period of 4 years in which case CGT won’t be applicable. If anyone wants to sell their shares in our properties they’ll be able to do it on the xState Xchange launching next month. Since that is P2P trading CGT won’t be applicable to that. The property itself will only be sold after the holding period.”

The second challenge with regards to real estate tokenization is how the token will remain linked to the asset regardless of what occurs in the real world: the most common example for land in Pakistan is the creation of a mosque on the property by land grabbers which inevitably hurts the token owners.

“This burden of responsibility lies on us” said Kashif. “We pick prime properties in trusted societies like DHA Faisal Town / Hills Eighteen and others where there are no NOC or litigation issues. It’s because we don’t need to go for cheap properties. That is exactly the benefit we’re providing to our investors that through us they can invest in those safe properties that were previously out of their budget. We stay away from all those projects where there is high speculation & are still pending NOCs etc. This is also the reason we have expensive but few properties listed on the portal.”

The third challenge is the uncertainty of the value proposition in the eyes of regulators central banks private companies and even local communities. Regulators will be focused on striking a balance between supporting innovation and ensuring systemic financial stability. Furthermore they will need to consider whether to include tokenization under existing legal frameworks or develop new ones.

“This is an unregulated space as of now. e.g. In Dubai this is being regulated by DFSA” said Kashif. “Here SECP is yet to regulate this space. Since we lie in equity crowdfunding it’s a space that is not prohibited by any laws as of now. However it would be great if there were regulations that would actually add a further layer of security for our investors. This will also increase the element of trust in a business like ours.”

The fourth challenge pertains to the extensive nature of real estate scams wherein either the same plot is sold repeatedly to multiple investors or they are charged an unfair premium without understanding the basis behind the unfair pricing.

“The real estate market is home to a lot of scams with people dividing properties in the form of kiosks pearls and cubes while calling this approach fractional ownership” said Owais Barlas the co-founder & chief sales officer at DAO Proptech. “And as a result of those deals being exposed as scams it has left a bad taste for prospective buyers and investors. So now people associate fractionalization with a scam.”

Speaking with Profit Barlas said that an inherent problem with fractional ownership is the tendency of double-spend: wherein one property can be oversold which happens when the seller does not know or does not disclose the total supply of investments available for the real estate they are selling.

“If there’s a building it matters to know whether it’s half a million square feet or what the total area in terms of square foot per floor is” he said. “Even if the seller knows this there is no way for a buyer to verify the number of transactions completed and the number of investors who have purchased the available units and whether the property has more area available to sell. To resolve this we need a distributed ledger for that particular property.”

Similar to how Binance and Nasdaq operate an exchange for real estate properties would help investors evade sellers that intend to sell the same property to them that has already been promised to countless others.

“To address this we need a database or a blockchain where the transactions are transparent and irreversible” he said. “The lack of transparency also creates resistance for investors that want to dabble in fractional ownership – buyers are unsure about where they are investing whether the price being set is fair what premium – if any – is being charged to them.”

He added that when it comes to fractional ownership of land plots it enables liquidity and if not monitored properly it can lead to high speculation which may artificially drive up the price within hours and days which usually does not happen with regular real estate transactions that are relatively opaque by their nature and thus can heighten FOMO and trigger frequent trading of fraction of a plot at speculative prices.

“While fractional ownership won’t solve all the problems in the real estate industry it will create a new generation of financial freedom by giving investors data on the valuations the premium being charged and transparency around all reactions surrounding that asset” he said.

Global acceptance

A report from Moore Global stated that tokenization is going to be a disrupter in global property markets because it has the potential to lower the cost of capital increase the pool of potential investors and increase liquidity.

Dan Natale Global Leader of Moore Global’s Real Estate Group said that it could take time for a critical mass of institutions to invest with confidence in tokenized real estate adding that if even just 0.5% of the total $280 trillion global property market were tokenized in the next five years it would become a $1.4 trillion market.

“The concept of a REIT is significantly different” said Kashif. “In that the company has its investment holdings in real estate and people buy shares of the company. In our case people only use our platform to buy shares in particular assets that they choose themselves based on the info provided by us. We have one property live right now but will have multiple options pretty soon. Investors will only hold shares & “investment certificates” for those assets not xState itself. We’re a centralized platform right now but in the future will be moving to decentralized and will be blockchain-based. There are similar models in the rest of the world including Dubai the UK Australia etc.”

In the United Arab Emirates Emaar Properties partnered with the distributed ledger technology of IBM in 2020 to pilot the tokenization of its real estate assets. Lead Real Estate plans to tokenize Tokyo real estate projects on a platform built by Securitize. And Tokai Tokyo and iStox invested in Hash Dash Holdings. Last month real estate tokenization platform RedSwan CRE began efforts towards raising $5 million preferred equity capital with the company reporting that it has already tokenized more than $2 billion worth of the commercial real estate.

Working with Japanese blockchain startup LayerX last month Mitsui Bussan Digital Asset Management announced plans to issue regulated digital asset securities linked to real estate. The company claims to have a project pipeline of $170 million for assets to be tokenized with plans to reach $910 million within three years. Using its Progmat security token platform Japanese firm MUFG Trust is planning real estate asset-backed securities.

“The cons with real estate tokenizing exceed the pros although the phenomenon has great potential in a more mature market” said the former CTO of a leading bank. “In Pakistan real estate tokenization will face implementation obstacles when converting the real estate industry to blockchain technology. As such the success of FracEstate or xState is dependent on the regulator’s view of blockchain technology which we know is bearish.”

Establishing trust

An advisor to the central bank told Profit that real estate tokenization companies such as xState would have to think about the incentive mechanism and the type of participant behavior that could add the most value to the platform adding that xState needs to consider which type of tokens it plans on using and whether those tokens have additional applications.

“The tokens used by xState and FracEstate will impact its tax treatment and if it has additional applications this may create a wide tax implication depending on the jurisdiction at hand” said Ali Rehman founder of Allee and co-founder of Find The Venue. “They need to make the distinction between utility equity and security tokens and deciding which rights are available to token holders are vital to determining how it will be taxed and regulated.”

An incentive mechanism that is developing rapidly tokenization has the potential to become the new means of generating stronger indirect network effects and subsequent. In the Pakistan market tokenization could address challenges such as multihoming and disintermediation.

“Both xState and FracEstate would do well to get the necessary certifications and accreditations to become 100% Shariah-compliant and use state of the art on-demand cloud computing platforms to secure their service infrastructure” said Rehman. “They should also implement two-factor authentications at every step.”

Kashif told Profit that xState is in the process of converting to a public limited company and has initiated the process with the SECP. This will ensure higher levels of transparency as xState’s records & audits will be public.

“I am hugely bullish on fractional ownership in real estate” said Habibullah Khan a strategy and branding advisor for early-stage companies. “Wheels [are in] motion to set regulations.”",,,,,,,,,

The theme for this edition was DevSecOps the integration of security at every step of the software development lifecycle. The radar team highlighted there are many DevSecOps tools today and the space is growing and changing rapidly.

Courtesy of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation

The Technology Radar team reported three key themes that came out of this survey. The first theme is that available tools today are designed to meet the needs of security teams better than developers. While there are many promising tools available there is no one tool that can provide a holistic approach to solving all the challenges.

According to the radar team findings some of the very promising tools available include Cilium Linkerd and Trivy. Such tools are good at solving at least one problem but there is room for consolidation.

Keith Nielsen director of cloud architecture at Discover Financial Services one of participating companies in the survey illustrated how his organization is dealing with such challenge:

Unless you’re going all-in with a cloud provider set of tools you’re stitching things together yourself. The tools have gotten better in terms of how you interact with them and the information they give you back. However there is no silver bullet here.

The second theme is that the DevSecOps space is changing rapidly. The radar team underscored that practitioners today have a plethora of security tools to evaluate decide on and integrate into their environments. In part because the rate of new services coming out of the major cloud providers is increasing combined with the rise of Kubernetes. Those two factors make it harder to consume services securely and integrate them with emerging security tools.

Sergiu Petean head of DevOps at Allianz Direct commented on the struggles practitioners are facing today:

The speed of innovation and digitization currently is a very important factor. Often you find yourself in a place where the old way of doing security doesn’t work anymore and you’re looking for different ways of doing security.

The third theme is about microsegmentation a network security technique of logically dividing and isolating workloads and then applying security controls on such individual units. The radar team pointed out that microsegmentation is a significant challenge not only in terms of adopting the right technology but in terms of changing the mindset of practitioners in the enterprise who are used to traditional network security practices.

Some of the tools included in the radar for microsegmentation include Istio Calico and the Open Policy Agent (OPA).

In this survey 21 companies participated and contributed 171 data points with a total of 252 votes from end-users.

Per the webinar about this edition the results of the survey conducted in September 2021 were limited to 21 end-user companies including Spotify Intuit Squarespace Zendesk and Discover Financial Services.

Delegates from nearly 200 countries met in Glasgow in Scotland between October 31 and November 12 during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26). The meeting’s purpose was to outline climate change commitments and decide how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.

However Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg called the UN climate summit a “failure” during a mass protest in the Scottish city. She demanded quicker action from leaders to address the world’s climate emergency.

Young climate change activists call out world governments

Some nations made pledges during COP26 to speed up their emissions cuts. But Thunberg said that amounted to little more than “a two-week long celebration of business as usual and ‘blah blah blah’.”

“It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure” she told the thousands of people gathered at the protest. “This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival.”

“They cannot ignore the scientific consensus and they cannot ignore us.”

Demonstrations have been carried out by activist groups worldwide at the same time as the climate change conference. The protesters hope to highlight the disconnect between the slow pace of emissions reductions and the global climate emergency.

During the high-level leaders’ summit at the start of COP26 more than 100 nations committed to cutting methane emissions by at least 30 per cent this decade. Experts said this would have a real short-term impact on global heating.

But environmental groups pointed out that governments particularly wealthy polluters had a habit of failing to live up to their climate promises.

Greta Thunberg speaks to YP about why adults need to act

“I expect this protest to remind world leaders and negotiators and politicians that young people are watching them” said Brianna Fruean 23 who is from Western Samoa and took part in one of the marches in Glasgow.

“Scientists have done what they need to do – they’ve told us about the problem. Young people have done what they need to do by calling attention to this issue” said Natalie Tariro Chido Mangondo a Zimbabwean climate and gender advocate.

“And it’s just up to our leaders to get their act together.”

News: Carbon offset projects slammed for ‘greenwashing’ while activist groups excluded from crucial talks

Greta Thunberg and other activists from Greenpeace and the Indigenous Environmental Network interrupted a COP26 panel on carbon offsets early this month to protest against what they called “greenwashing” and the dangers of relying on offsets to compensate for emissions.

Before the panel she tweeted that fossil fuel companies and banks were trying to “give polluters a free pass to keep polluting”.

Offsets are a way for buyers to continue polluting while essentially paying someone else to adopt climate-friendly behaviours. But no global oversight or common standards exist and an abundance of low-quality offsets appears to have little impact on global warming. The projects funded by offsets also have the potential to harm local communities if they are not executed properly.

Half an hour into the panel Thunberg walked out shouting “no more greenwashing”. As she left another activist started speaking.

“Carbon offsets mean climate sabotage ... they’re also going to drive devastating land grabs in the Global South” said Teresa Anderson climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International.

Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney who is leading a task force of hundreds of large polluters and sustainability experts to scale up the voluntary carbon offset market also attended the event. He spoke at the end of the panel discussion in defence of his work saying offsets were part of the solution to reaching net zero emissions but that the existing market had to be improved.

Meanwhile activists and members of NGOs said they were excluded from the main venue and told to dial in from hotel rooms.

In a statement COP26 organisers said the event had a high level of attendance and that pandemic restrictions meant entrance might be limited to those who had to be physically present. All who could participate remotely were encouraged to do so.

COP participants did not travel to Scotland to watch proceedings from a hotel while plenary seats remained empty said Ellery Li project adviser of China Youth Climate Action Network.

“Civil society must be treated as an equal partner with equal access to the negotiations” Li said.

Issue: Gfanz’s pledged green trillions under scrutiny

Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney announced at the COP26 panel earlier this month that the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz) would commit US$130 trillion (HK$1012.66 trillion) to financing projects that would help get companies and countries to net zero emissions by 2050.

According to Gfanz’s terms signatories must commit to decarbonise their operations by 2050 use science-based guidelines and provide 2030 interim goals. But questions remain about how well banks will live up to their pledges and how they can be measured and policed.

Since the 2015 Paris Agreement banks have facilitated almost US$4 trillion (HK$31158.80 trillion) of fossil-fuel financing while scoring US$17 billion (HK$132.43 billion) in fees according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with about US$1.5 trillion for green investments over the same period.

In addition the 450 firms that have signed up to the alliance are vastly outnumbered by those that have snubbed it. Banks from China Russia and India are not on the Gfanz list. Also absent are thousands of smaller finance firms that do not have to answer to increasingly green-minded investors or public market regulators.

Larry Fink the chief executive officer of BlackRock which is a member of the Gfanz said hydrocarbon assets were moving from public to private hands. Fink said: “That does not change the net zero world. That’s window dressing that’s greenwashing.”

How climate change has changed our vocabulary

Despite this financing for green projects topped that of fossil fuels for the first time this year according to Bloomberg data.

“We have reached a tipping point in finance this week” said Huw van Steenis the veteran bank analyst and former Bank of England adviser who is leading UBS Group AG’s push into sustainable finance.

“Leaving COP the focus will be on getting the right data and metrics and engaging with companies on financing the transition to clean energy.”

Climate change puts many UN world heritage sites in danger

Question prompts

What must banks prioritise if they commit to joining Gfanz? Explain why this could be difficult using examples from Issue.

Some have suggested that environmental groups should have a say in how Gfanz’s US$130 trillion will be allocated so as to ensure the recipients are held accountable to the commitment to decarbonise. Using News Issue and your knowledge provide ONE argument for and ONE argument against this suggestion.

Glossary

Greenwashing: an attempt to make people believe that a company or government is doing more to protect the environment than it really is

Emissions: refers to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide that are released into the atmosphere where they trap heat. To achieve net zero emissions there must be a balance between emissions produced and taken out of the atmosphere

Paris Agreement: also known as the Paris Accords. It is an international treaty that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement went into effect on November 4 2016. As of 2021 191 countries and the European Union have joined it.

The treaty seeks to limit temperature increases in the 21st century to below 2 degrees Celsius and encourages initiatives that limit the increase further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Carbon offsets: a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Carbon offsets can be bought sold or traded as part of a market.

Clean energy: energy that comes from renewable zero emission sources such as wind solar and hydropower that do not pollute the atmosphere when used

Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz): a coalition of international financial companies that have signed up to tackle climate change. It comprises more than 450 banks insurers and asset managers across 45 countries.

Hydrocarbon: an organic compound containing only carbon and hydrogen. Examples include fuels such as petroleum natural gas and coal.",,,,,,,,,

The Company marked the occasion by donating $18000 to Gulf Shores Elementary School which aims to support ongoing literacy and education programs within the school district. Additionally customers were provided with complimentary gift cards and tote bags filled with vendor products.

“With each new DG store opening we are extending our scale for good to help American households stretch their budgets on essentials create new career paths for employees contribute tax revenue to local municipalities and extend education opportunities through the Dollar General Literacy Foundation” said Todd Vasos Dollar General’s CEO. “From our first store in Kentucky in 1955 to today’s 18000th store our customers and our mission have remained at the heart of all we do and we are proud to extend the positive benefits we bring to better serve Gulf Shores’ residents and tourists alike with our 18000th store.”

“On behalf of my administrative team the teachers and students at Gulf Shores Elementary we could not be more appreciative of the generous donation from Dollar General” said Dr. Alicia Early Gulf Shores Elementary School’s Principal. “The $18000 donation will be utilized to strengthen and expand our academics. We are so fortunate to work in an area where the community believes in supporting and giving back to the schools. We believe our future is in our school buildings and if our schools are progressing and achieving so will the community.”

Dollar General has a longstanding history in Alabama opening its first store in 1965. The Company’s strong presence in the state currently includes the employment of approximately 8100 employees at roughly 850 stores and at distribution centers in Bessemer and Montgomery.

From a Deals Tab and exclusive savings for Express members to a new reduced cost and free delivery option and new Dollar Store Hub destination on the Instacart marketplace the company is rolling out more ways for customers to save when shopping from their favorite retailers.

This new slate of features come at a time when grocery costs are continuing to rise across North America ahead of the holidays and amid increasing global supply chain challenges. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics prices for groceries and other food prepared at home increased by 2.6% over the past year — and that’s on top of a 3.5% increase from 2019. Many consumers will feel these increases on items like corn dinner rolls and cranberry sauce as they prepare for Thanksgiving and even frozen turkey prices are already 25 cents more per pound than they were a year ago according to the USDA’s Turkey Market News Report .

“Giving people more access to food — and more time to enjoy it together — has always been core to our mission. For most families when it comes to grocery shopping we know that every dollar matters. Outside of rent and transportation groceries are one of the largest monthly budget expenditures for most households. Roughly 60% of offline grocery transactions in the U.S. include coupons and across our own marketplace customers have already saved more than $400 million this year” said Asha Sharma Chief Operating Officer of Instacart. “That’s why we’re proud to roll out these new features that help customers get exactly what they need while also saving along the way. Online grocery shouldn’t be a luxury and we’re committed to making Instacart the most affordable way for families across North America to get the food they need from the retailers they love.”

As a result An Old Time Christmas is the four-time reigning champion of USA Today's 10Best Readers' Choice Awards ""Best Theme Park Holiday Event"" says spokeswoman Lisa Rau. With a fifth nomination secured she adds and everything that is new at the Branson theme park in 2021 she feels sure the title will come home again to Silver Dollar City.

""This year will be livelier than ever before"" Rau says with her trademark enthusiasm. ""There are two new Broadway-style productions 'Home For Christmas' -- a $500000 original production featuring 28 songs and over 40 costume changes -- and a newly restaged and rescored 'A Dickens' Christmas Carol.'""

And that's not to mention a new Christmas Princess in the twice-a-day parade and the return of all the ""fan favorite"" foods from prime rib and root beer-glazed ham to cashew chicken and sweet and sour shrimp cones red velvet funnel cake hot apple pie with homemade cinnamon ice cream hot chocolate wassail and much more.

'A Dickens' Christmas Carol'

""A Dickens Christmas Carol has been a huge part of Christmas at Silver Dollar City for [what is now] 18 seasons"" says Dwight Jordan show director and co-composer. ""From the beginning for so many people it wasn't Christmas until they saw this show. With a season off last year we realized it was a perfect time to write the original music that this one-of-a-kind production deserved. It is still the same heartwarming version of Dickens that has been at Silver Dollar City for all of these years but now the music is exclusive to this production. My hope is that everyone will once again feel the warm hug that this show brings and that our audience will fall in love with it all over again.""

New Yorker Robert Cookman is the show's musical director and co-composer.

""I love the challenge of the tradition of 'Dickens' Christmas Carol' at Branson"" he says. ""This project was an interesting challenge for me because not only were melody and chords involved but arranging lyrics a slew of technical stuff like creating click tracks for the live musicians recording all of the other instruments that make up the track; the list goes on and on. Usually I might get to do one of these jobs on a project.""

While Casey Robertson SDC director of entertainment says many guests won't notice the show has changed -- ""we continue to use the same script we used for the last 17 seasons"" -- the three on-site musicians will be backed up by strings horns and woodwinds recorded at the Grammy Award-winning John Kilgore Sound and Recording Studio in New York City. ""The players for the soundtrack are Broadway musicians Juilliard graduates and teachers and Metropolitan Opera Orchestra members"" Robertson marvels.

Longtime friends of Silver Dollar City should also know that ""A Dickens' Christmas Carol"" now pays tribute to its creator Brad Schroeder who passed away in 2019.

""There is a lyric that is in one of the new songs that is dedicated in the memory of Brad: 'There is a light in the night a star sent from heaven to guide us.' His inspiration and guidance will always be felt by everyone associated with Dickens and our gratitude will now be represented in every performance.""

'Home For Christmas'

""'Home for Christmas' is a show all about the experiences you have with your family at Christmas"" says Robertson of this season's new Broadway-style production. ""When I was growing up my family and I would always go to pick out a Christmas tree after Thanksgiving [and] we would also go to church on Christmas Eve and at the end of the service we would always sing carols as a congregation. Those two experiences I had -- and many others did too -- are a part of our new show.

""By far my favorite part is the North Pole section"" Robertson adds. ""I don't want to spoil it but Santa has a little mishap with his sleigh and the elves have to repair it in record time so all the boys and girls can get Christmas presents this year. And we also have an original song in this part of the show named 'No Snow (I Know Snow).' We all know what it's like in southern Missouri during the winter but now we get to see what it's like at the North Pole during Christmas too!""

The Park & The Parade

Between the end of the Harvest Festival and the beginning of An Old Time Christmas Silver Dollar City staff has one week to turn ""15000 pumpkins into 3 miles of garland 6.5 million lights thousands of wreaths and an eight-story Christmas tree"" says Rau. ""There is no comparison to other light shows around the country because there isn't a place in America that does it quite like Silver Dollar City.""

""It takes 200000 ultra-bright LED bulbs and one very famous nose to light up our 10 musical floats"" adds Amanda Carson entertainment supervisor about Rudolph's Holly Jolly Christmas Light Parade. ""Rudolph leads the parade along with everyone's favorite Abominable Snow Monster Bumble! And we have a new Christmas Princess joining some of our old favorites Santa Grandma and her dancing Candy Canes.""

Carson and her team start work on the parade in August and putting the show on the road takes up to 55 people every evening. Parade times are 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. starting in the Grand Expo area.

""There's really not a bad place to see the parade but the square has a beautiful backdrop with our eight-story Christmas tree"" adds Robertson. ""Every year when the costumes arrive and when we see the floats start their testing we know: It's Christmas time!""

Still the hack did not involve the FBI's internal email system.

The FBI's initial statement about the email compromise issued November 13 2021 said:

""The FBI and CISA are aware of the incident this morning involving fake emails from an @ic.fbi.gov email account. This is an ongoing situation and we are not able to provide any additional information at this time. The impacted hardware was taken offline quickly upon discovery of the issue. We continue to encourage the public to be cautious of unknown senders and urge you to report suspicious activity to ic3.gov or cisa.gov.""

Still the attack did not involve the FBI's corporate email service and no data or personal identifiable information was accessed or compromised on the agency’s network the FBI said in a follow-up statement on November 14 2021.

Additional details about the FBI email attack from spam threat intelligence organization Spamhous suggested:

hackers sent ""scary"" emails from infrastructure that is owned by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The fake warning emails were apparently sent to addresses scraped from ARIN database. They caused a lot of disruption because the headers are real Spamhous asserted.

The spam messages were sent by abusing insecure code in an FBI online portal KrebsOnSecurity reported.

With Los Angeles’s Griffith Observatory as her backdrop Adele will spill her secrets and sing her songs (both old and new) to a crowd of A-listers for a one-night-only special on Sunday November 14. As part of the televised event celebrating her latest album the singer is joining Oprah Winfrey for an interview in Winfrey’s famed rose garden—from the comfort of RH’s Capri teak lounge chairs.

That’s right we found the exact chairs Adele and Oprah will chat in on Sunday night. Unlike the furniture featured in Oprah’s sit-down with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry these seats are pricey at $1795 each for nonmembers. The U-shaped back beckons you to sink in while the double-tension rope adds texture without visually weighing down the piece. Plus the whole structure is handcrafted from teakwood the most durable option (if treated well) for outdoor furniture.

The best part? The chic seating pulls double duty. Its curved silhouette pairs just as well with a coffee table inside as it does with a grill out on the patio. And the performance upholstery protects against rain and wine spills alike. “Sometimes it lasts in love” as Adele says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWJsZW5kLmNvbS9zdXBlcmhlcm9lcy9kZWFkcG9vbC1hY3Rvci1oYXMtYS1raWxsZXItaWRlYS10by1icmluZy1wZXRlci1iYWNrLWZvci1yeWFuLXJleW5vbGRzLXNlcXVlbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deadpool Actor Has A Killer Idea To Bring Peter Back For Ryan Reynolds' Sequel,"Long live the X-Force?

Rob Delaney is promoting his latest movie Home Sweet Home Alone which offered up the opportunity for the actor to speak about his fan-favorite character Peter. He offered up his own ideas about how he’d like to see the Deadpool 2 character return saying:

I know at the end of Deadpool 2 he asked if he can get Domino's email address so I think it might be funny to see him pursuing Domino quite earnestly but with no skills at all to try and woo her. So that would be pretty funny and I think given a real challenge by Deadpool if he really had to go take out a bad guy or something because say Deadpool had eaten some bad shrimp earlier. I think too see Peter and some genuine danger and also a little bit of romance I think I'm just saying you know what everybody else wants.

While speaking to Comicbook.com  the actor also known for his role in Catastrophe shared his great idea mapped out for Peter. He reminded folks that at the end of the previous movie Peter asks for Domino’s email address and he thinks it’d be fun to see him actually follow up with her over the internet. Peter is a hilarious character who serves as a great foil to the rest of the superhero things happening around him so I know I will absolutely watch more of his misadventures.

It’s been over three years now since the last Deadpool movie came out. Considering the character was handed over to Disney and Ryan Reynolds has been hard at work on a number of other massive projects such as 6 Underground Free Guy and Red Notice (just to name a few) the gap is understandable. The most recent update on what’s next for Deadpool 3 is a script currently in the works from Bob’s Burgers writers Wendy Molyneaux and Lizzie Molyneaux-Loeglin alongside Ryan Reynolds of course.

Kevin Feige confirmed over the summer that Deadpool 3 could very well begin filming sometime next year and while the movie has not been given a place in the MCU slate the company internally has a production window in mind. It’ll be a different experience for audiences surely because Wade Wilson for the first time will be among the rest of the MCU.

The X-Force was certainly a rag-tag group in Deadpool 2 but the personality that came with that sequence including with Rob Delaney’s Peter only made the movie better. It would be hilarious to see him back in a Deadpool movie as Rob Delaney pitched. Until then Delaney’s Home Alone movie is streaming on Disney+ and Reynolds’ latest action film Red Notice is over on Netflix.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvMjAyMTExMTMvZm91ci1tZW4tc2hvdC1vbmUtZmF0YWxseS13aGlsZS1wbGF5aW5nLWRvbWlub2VzLWVsbGV0c29uLWZsYXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four men shot one fatally while playing dominoes in Elletson Flats,"Four men were last night shot while playing a game of domino in Elletson Flats St Andrew around 8 o'clock.

In most cities you can hardly walk a block before you come across a McDonald’s Domino’s Taco Bell or Chick-fil-A.

Given that many Americans frequent these restaurants it’s no wonder they are increasing in number by the day. From burgers to chicken sandwiches to fried chicken there’s a fast food restaurant to satisfy almost any craving. Below we’re analyzing some data collected to determine the most popular fast food by state. Let’s get started!

Which Is The Most Popular Fast Food Chain In The US?

According to data from Google Trends Domino’s is the most-searched-for fast food chain online. The pizza chain has gained immense popularity since it was established in 1960.

However McDonald’s maintains the record for highest fast food gross sales — not a surprise considering their massive expenditure on advertising. As such it is considered #1 of all the most popular fast food restaurants. In 2020 alone this famous restaurant generated sales of $19.21 billion while Domino’s stood at a distant $4.12 billion.

Subway — offering some of the healthiest fast food options — comes in at number two in popularity with $10.8 billion in gross sales. Behind Subway are Burger King and Taco Bell. Burger King maintains $10.0 billion in gross sales while Taco Bell had $9.8 billion in gross sales.

What Are the Most Searched-For Fast Food Restaurants in America?

It is already evident from these staggering sales numbers that the US has its fair share of popular fast food restaurants not to mention that Americans tend to hold very strong opinions about which fast food is their favorite.

However we used Google Trends to determine which food chain is the most searched for online. This helps establish which is really most popular irrespective of gross sales.

Domino’s

The winner of the popular fast food restaurant contest is Domino’s. This doesn’t come as a surprise because Domino’s is the biggest pizza chain globally in terms of revenue and the second largest in terms of stores opened. It was also among the first to start on pizza delivery and they have since tried to maintain their iconic “30 minutes or less” delivery promise.

McDonald’s

McDonald’s is the second most popular fast food restaurant. For almost 80 years now McDonald’s has been at the center stage of the fast food business. Such a long-standing history gives the company some leverage in terms of sales but Domino’s still surpasses it in terms of search volume.

Taco Bell

Taco Bell then comes in third place. Considering Taco Bell was founded about 20 years after McDonald’s and around two years after Domino’s we can say it’s doing pretty well as the “new kid on the block.”

There are at least 5600 Taco Bell restaurants in the United States. Surprisingly 964 of these Taco Bell establishments operate within California’s borders making California the most Taco Bell populated state countrywide. Texas follows quite closely with a total of 590 Taco Bell restaurants. Taco Bell is also the most-searched-for chain in the Great Lake area.

Interestingly Taco Bell still maintains a higher revenue than Domino’s making Taco Bell the fifth highest-grossing chain in America.

Chick-fil-A

When you move to the southeast part of the country it is evident that Chick-fil-A is the region’s most preferred fast food restaurant. Known largely for its chicken sandwich specialty Chick-fil-A is another chain that is among the most popular in the United States. Chick-fil-A has shown immense growth since it was founded in 1946.

There are at least 2769 Chick-fil-A locations in the United States less than half the number of Taco Bell restaurants.

The state with the most Chick-fil-A locations in the US is Texas. Texas alone accounts for 16% of all Chick-fil-A locations in America which is about 455 chains. Florida then accounts for about 228 Chick-fil-A restaurants. This means that there’s a Chick-fil-A location for every 94201 people as Florida has a population of 21.48 million.

Fast Food Insights

Pretty much all of these four top-ranking restaurant chains — Domino’s McDonalds Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A — have found a home in the country’s most populated states California Texas Florida and New York. They truly have a massive foothold in the food industry in America.

When it comes to Domino’s a majority of searches come from Florida and Texas. This is expected given that the state with the most number of Domino’s Pizza restaurants in the US is Texas. There are 689 stores a total of 10% of all Domino’s Pizza stores in the USA.

McDonald’s on the other hand receives its highest search volume from California and New York. In California there are 1221 McDonald’s stores representing 9% of all McDonald’s stores in America.

Although Taco Bell is far behind second place in terms of search volume Taco Bell chains still manage impressive gross sales numbers.

Which State Eats the Most Fast Food?

Central and southern states have far more fast food restaurants than states on the East or West coasts in the US. This makes sense given that many of these restaurants started in the south.

The state of Alabama is certainly the one with the heaviest consumption of fast food. Alabama has 6.3 fast food restaurants for every 10000 residents. Nebraska and West Virginia then follow with 5.4 and 5.3 restaurants per 10000 people respectively.

Wrapping Up

Fast food restaurants have long been a staple — and an obsession — of American history and their popularity persists today. Domino’s and McDonald’s are among the country’s most-searched-for fast food chains and they also have some of the highest grossing sales in the country. Just behind them are Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A. The infographic above includes a breakdown of the most popular fast food by state including these two fast food titans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9rYXRlLWd1aW5uZXNzLWxvbmRvbi10ZWVuLWJlZHJvb20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Designer Kate Guinness Balances Playful Palettes and Patterns in This Teen Bedroom,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

Every parent knows that cutesy wallpaper and kid-size furnishings have a shelf life. So when the eldest of their two daughters turned 13 a creative couple living in northwest London called on designer Kate Guinness to turn her bedroom into a boredom-banishing teen-friendly retreat. The transformation however wasn’t as simple as switching up the color scheme and freeing up wall space for a few boy-band posters; it required an entire layout reconfiguration.

“There were lots of sloped ceilings” Guinness remembers of the space an attic that spanned nearly 190 square feet. Its considerable size was diminished by the room’s squat height and nonexistent storage. So the designer started thinking outside the box with the help of assistant Jess Denyer coming up with abstract solutions that would fill the closet void. After much trial and error they decided that the wall beneath the “super slope” as Guinness called it was the most logical spot for a bespoke double wardrobe by furniture maker Alfred Newall and makeshift shelving system to house books and school supplies. Cher Horowitz’s rotating clothes rack it’s not but it gets the job done. And by painting the custom shelves in Farrow & Ball’s Inchyra Blue you can’t even tell they’re MDF. It’s the corner where Denyer pictures the young client getting ready in the morning doubling as a vanity and later curling up to read or hang out with friends.

For Guinness landing on a color scheme can be one of the trickiest aspects of designing a teen room. “There’s a tendency to want to go bold everywhere” she explains. The wallpaper their young client had chosen—Ottoline’s Improvisation Number 1—was already quite striking “so we looked at other ways of calming it down” she says. By drawing colors from the motif of repeating dots lines and waves Guinness found balance in the soft hues and contrast piping of the bed’s cushioned headboard. The mix allows the space to feel playful and innocent rather than too grown-up. Elsewhere they added fun shapes with a bright yellow side table (also made by Newall) and a curvy rattan nightstand with one pragmatic touch. “If you try to put a cup of water on top it will wobble” says Deyner “so we had glass cut to the exact shape to sit flat.”

Despite all the attention paid to other parts of the room both Guinness and Deyner agree that their favorite thing is a quiet window-front desk overlooking a green field. “I think it’s so lovely—all the natural light” says Guinness who installed a single shade from Virginia White’s zigzag collection instead of matching the blackout drapes on the opposite window. “I love the mix of the industrial-looking chair (’50s Pamono) and mid-century desk. They’re pieces that she can take with her when she grows up.”

Maxx right now,"New York CNN Business —

Bummer for bargain hunters: It may be harder to snag designer clothes at T.J. Maxx Burlington and Ross.

These discount chains thrive when there is a glut of clothing in the market. They can scoop in and buy premium apparel and shoe brands’ excess inventory for cheap — and then sell it to customers at bargain prices. The problem right now: There’s very little unsold clothing sitting around.

Supply chains are choked off and brands don’t have as much if any extra stuff to dump. And since inventories are lean and customer demand is red hot brands don’t have as great a need to discount merchandise — they can easily sell items at full price.

Under Armour (UA) Ralph Lauren (RL) Carter’s (CRI) and Steve Madden (SHOO) are among the brands that have said in recent weeks they’re retreating from discount chains sometimes called “off-price” stores. Levi’s (LEVI) is also walking away from discount stores.

Even before the pandemic these brands were trying to move away from off-price companies because they are the least profitable outlets for brands. Offering too many products at a discount also dilutes brands’ image and erodes their pricing power over customers. These brands want to sell their stuff through their stores websites premium wholesale partners or their factory stores which are all more profitable.

“Off-price is a last resort” said Susan Anderson a retail analyst at B. Riley Securities. She said discount stores could suffer in the long term if brands keep their inventories tighter.

Clothing and footwear brands have increased their efforts during the pandemic to pull away from discount stores. They’re able to pull it off right now because of the huge imbalance between supply and demand.

“We have reduced the amount that we’re selling to the third-party off-price channel” Under Armour chief financial officer David Bergman said on an earnings call this month. “Those partners would like more product.”

When Under Armour does sell to discount chains they are “going to pay a little bit more to us” because Under Armour has less product to ship Bergman said.

Carter’s is shipping fewer of its baby items to TJ Maxx (TJX) Marshalls Burlington (BURL) and Ross (ROST) this year. Compared with 2019 Carter’s has reduced its sales to off-price stores by nearly 50% CEO Michael Casey said on an earnings call last month.

Instead of delivering to discount chains Carter’s will rely on its own stores and website when it has excess inventory to unload – or it will hold onto products and selling them during a different season a spokesperson said in an email. Carter’s is also cutting back on the number of different products it sells overall leaving less room for off-price stores to pounce.

Ralph Lauren has “significantly reduced” the amount of inventory it’s sending to discount chains including T.J. Maxx a spokesperson said in an email. In particular Ralph Lauren has pulled back on the amount of products it makes specifically for T.J. Maxx.

Steve Madden is also dialing back on unloading inventory to off-price stores because it has to allocate its limited supply of goods.

“Our first priority is always feeding full-price channels” CEO Edward Rosenfeld said on an earnings call this month.

T.J. Maxx says not to worry: Stores will be “frequently updated with new and on-trend items” and customers will be able to find a strong selection of gifts and home decor during the holiday season from its “ever-changing mix of merchandise” a spokesperson for the company said in an email. Burlington declined to comment. Ross Stores did not respond to requests for comment.

Still “quantities of seasonal goods look lower than normal” at off-price chains particularly at Ross and Burlington UBS retail analyst Jay Sole said in a November 8 research note. Top brands’ sportswear was less available than usual he noted.

Off-price chains’ stocks have trailed the S&P 500’s retail index which has increased 18% in 2021. TJ Maxx parent TJX’s stock is flat this year Burlington has inched up 2% and Ross has declined 6%

Goods are scarcer at some companies’ own outlet stores such as outdoor equipment retailer REI.

REI is seeing strong demand for outdoor goods so there’s “very little product leftover” to sell at its outlet stores Ben Johns REI’s general merchandising manager for action sports told CNN Business.

Historically half of REI’s cycling business — bikes helmets apparel parts and maintenance products for cycling car racks — come from full-price sales. This year that’s climbed above 90%.

Johns said: “What we have we just simply sell full price.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9pbnZlc3RpbmcvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXdlYWx0aC10YXhwYXllci1zdXBwb3J0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzExLzE0L2ludmVzdGluZy9lbG9uLW11c2std2VhbHRoLXRheHBheWVyLXN1cHBvcnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's how Elon Musk's fortune has benefited from taxpayer help,"New York CNN Business —

Elon Musk can thank investors for his staggering net worth of nearly $300 billion. But taxpayers played a crucial role as well.

Just how much — or how little — Musk pays in taxes has gotten a lot of attention lately and even prompted his Twitter poll last weekend that preceded his decision to sell $6.9 billion worth of Tesla stock. There have been calls in Congress for a billionaires’ tax that would require at least some minimal payment from wealthy individuals like Musk who often have little in the way of taxable income. Musk has attacked that idea on Twitter.

But just how much of his wealth is due to the government support his companies receive is not an easy question to answer. By some measures little of his wealth is thanks to taxpayers. And in some ways virtually all of it is.

Musk’s wealth is based on the value of his companies including Tesla (TSLA) which is only the sixth US company in history to be worth more than $1 trillion and SpaceX believed to be the nation’s most valuable privately-held enterprise with an estimated value of more than $100 billion.

But those valuations are based mostly on investors’ belief in their future sales and profits not the relatively modest financial results those companies have shown to date. Tesla sales and earnings for example represent a fraction of other long-established automakers.

Tesla saw global sales of 627000 vehicles in the first nine months of this year and net income of $3.2 billion both records for the company. But global sales at Toyota were 10 times greater and its net revenue was 2.3 trillion yen or $20.3 billion more than six times Tesla’s.

Even so Tesla shares more than triple the value of Toyota’s market cap. And Toyota is the world’s second most valuable automaker. Tesla’s market cap is roughly equal to that of the 12 largest automakers in the world combined.

Without taxpayer support however neither Tesla nor SpaceX would have survived this long and investors never would have had the chance to make massive bets on both companies.

Don’t take our word for it. Ask Musk himself.

Billions from regulatory credits

In a tweet last year Musk admitted that Tesla nearly was forced to file for bankruptcy as recently at 2019. The stock price that seems unstoppable today had been floundering among investor’s justified concern that the company was facing a cash crunch as it had difficulty ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan.

“Closest we got [to bankruptcy] was about a month ago” he said in that 2020 tweet. “The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production & logistics hell.”

What Musk didn’t say was that one of the keys that kept the company alive was the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers.

Environmental regulations require companies that are not meeting emission standards to pay fines or buy credits generated by companies that comply with the rules. And no one had more of those credits to sell than all-electric Tesla.

Between 2008 and the first half of 2019 sales of regulatory credits generated more than $2 billion that was crucial to the company’s survival. And the increased car sales ever since have resulted in additional credits that Tesla sold for another $3 billion since June of 2019.

That allowed the company to show profits sooner than it would have without the credits lifting the value of the stock. In fact it wasn’t until the second quarter this year that Tesla reported more in net income than it got from regulatory credit sales.

“It was really US taxpayers that helped get him through his roughest time” said Dan Ives tech analyst with Wedbush Securities who is a bull on Tesla shares — today. In 2019 he was still skeptical as the company struggled.

“If it didn’t have regulatory credits Tesla would not be the brand it is around the globe and Musk wouldn’t be the richest person in the world” Ives said.

Other billions for Tesla

That wasn’t the only government assistance for Tesla. In January 2010 the company received a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy months before its initial public offering when it was still in need of cash. It was able to pay the loan back early but only through proceeds from an additional sale of stock in 2013.

The company also has benefited from the substantial tax credits car buyers receive when they buy a Tesla or other plug-in vehicles. Those tax dollars went to the buyers and not directly to the company but the incentive allowed Tesla to charge more for its cars than it otherwise could. In fact when the $7500 federal tax credit on Tesla purchases was halved to $3750 in early 2019 Tesla responded by cutting the price of its cars by $2000 to remain competitive.

Tesla buyers received total federal tax credits worth an estimated $3.4 billion before the perk disappeared entirely at the end of 2019. Even if that only allowed Tesla to raise prices by half that amount that’s another $1.7 billion in federal help on top of the $5 billion it has received— so far — from regulatory credit sales.

NASA saves SpaceX

And then there’s SpaceX which is a smaller but still significant source of Musk’s wealth. The taxpayer support for this venture is even more clear since it comes in the form of direct government contracts that are worth billions.

According to Sam.gov the government database that tracks federal spending Space X has signed contracts worth nearly $10 billion. None was more crucial than the one the company received just before Christmas in 2008 when Space X and Musk were both virtually out of cash.

That contract to fly 12 supply missions to the International Space Station was worth $1.6 billion. The deal was crucial because it allowed the company to complete work on its Falcon 9 rocket its main workhorse as well as the Dragon capsule that would carry supplies and eventually crew said Casey Dreier senior space policy advisory for the Planetary Society a public interest group advocating space flight.

“They were right on the edge of insolvency” Dreier said. “Elon has pointed out at that moment they were on the edge and that helped to save the company.”

Dreier said the ISS and other contracts have worked out well for NASA too allowing the agency to use SpaceX rather than relying on the Russians to transport US astronauts.

SpaceX has since gotten numerous additional government contracts from NASA the military and other US government agencies. It won a $3 billion contract to develop the next vehicle to carry astronauts to the surface of the moon. And Dreier said SpaceX and other NASA contractors also benefit from the agency’s in-kind support including access to NASA employees and expertise.

Derian and Rajhon were prepping vehicles for Derian’s transport service Elite Transport Service of Florida Inc. and had to go to Walmart for supplies. As they arrived Rajhon saw a man sitting outside of the Walmart by himself. Rajhon immediately reached into his pocket which had a $100 in it from his father for helping gas up vehicles and gave it to the man.

The man shocked jumped up and hugged Rajhon while tears ran down his face. Rajhon came back to the car as if nothing happened.

“Did you just give ...?” Derian who watched the whole thing asked.

“Yup I sure did” Rajhon nonchalantly replied.

Acts of kindness like this was something Rajhon did frequently and is something his parents want to remember him by after his life was taken away this summer.

Neighborhood Block party to bring awareness to the senseless violence and drug abuse

Rajhon was playing basketball with friends on June 28 at the YMCA when he collapsed on the court. A few days later he was dead.

Even more devastating was the cause — Rajhon died of a drug overdose after smoking marijuana laced with fentanyl. The devastated family is determined to celebrate his life by ensuring no other son suffers the same tragic ending.

His parents the Rev. Twanna and Derian House will be hosting a Neighborhood Block party today at their church Alabaster Box Christian Ministries Inc. to bring awareness to the senseless violence and drug abuse happening within the Pensacola community.

From January 2019 to June 2020 drug-related deaths in Florida increased by 13% according to the latest study by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

There were 3034 opioid-caused deaths reported with fentanyl claiming the vast majority of victims: 2622. Overall deaths caused by fentanyl increased by 81% as there were 1171 more deaths occurred in that time frame.

Rajhon was one of these victims.

Rajhon's mom would describe him as a “gentle giant”

Rajhon was a tall fun silly kid who Twanna would describe as a “gentle giant.” He had a fatherly spirit always making sure to guide his younger brother Josiah on what is right and wrong. They would play video games such as ""Madden"" or ""Call of Duty"" and would go outside to play basketball.

“I beat him at least three times” Josiah pridefully claimed.

Rajhon's deep voice calm and laid back demeanor did not prevent him from wanting the love and affection of his father. The pair were close and openly affectionate.

“I was gonna kiss him 30 times a day and I don't care that you're 18” Derian said. “And he would have his moments where he would come and steal all the love. He would hold me down because he would tower over me and kiss on me. But that was our bond. That was our relationship.”

When his father had back surgery and was bedridden Rajhon didn’t go to school so he could take care of his father. He would tuck his father into his bed give him medicine and watch over him for the day.

Twanna who married Rajhon’s father came into his life late. Still Rajhon would act as a protector for both her and his younger brother.

“He and I started getting really close toward the end of his life” Twanna remembers. “So when he passed it was almost like I felt something was robbed from me.”

When Rajhon was about 8 years old he saw his father playing the drums and asked if he could learn how. Derian picked him up sat him on his lap and gave him his first drum lesson. Over the years he would develop his skills from watching Youtube videos as late into the morning as 2 a.m. to asking for the keys to the church and practicing on his own. He was teaching himself how to play the organ and constantly asking questions about chords and keys.

Since his death a new drummer has come to take his place at the church and it is still difficult for Derian to look over at the spot his son once held.

“I just got to the place maybe a couple Sundays ago that I could actually look over there at the guy that plays” Derian said. ""Because for 11 years this boy has been playing for me and the new drummer is skillful but it ain’t my boy.”

Change in Rajhon

About 30 days before his death Rajhon moved out of his parent’s home. They did not see him during that time. Before he moved out his plan was to go to school locally for two years and find his way afterwards. During his absence his parents learned he had switched plans and wanted to go into the military.

Rajhon and his father stayed in contact with each other but he never came back home to visit. On June 28 Derian received a phone call from one of his friends saying Rajhon wasn’t breathing and he didn't have a pulse.

Derian rushed to Baptist Hospital where Rajhon's friends had gathered along with Rose Patton who works customer service at the Bear Levin Studer Family YMCA.

Rajhon and his friends were always playful and joking with Patton when they came in to play basketball. That day however Rajhon was not in a playful mood as he quickly paid for his membership and went to the gym.

As a joke the group of friends would frequently leave some of their belongings on her desk so when she found one of the boy's ID cards she headed to the gym.

When she reached the basketball court she saw people surrounding Rajhon and immediately rushed over. Realizing he wasn’t breathing she started performing CPR.

“It was three of us doing CPR” Patton said. “It was myself one of the lifeguards then one of the guys from Baptist moved me out the way and he got in.”

When the ambulance came to pick up Rajhon Patton followed behind and went to Baptist where she met with his father.

When Derian was able to see his son he was on a ventilator with tubes everywhere. When he tried to talk with him tears ran down Rajhon’s face unable to speak with his father. Derian had to change into the role of a pastor and be strong for not only Rajhon but the family.

When he was told by doctors they needed to know what happened and what he put into his body none of Rajhon’s friends could give him a clear answer.

“Nobody will tell me anything” Derian said. “I have to go back to the hospital with my son who is not responding laying there and all those children are home with their parents. But my son can't respond.”

He stayed with his son for four days until Rajhon passed away on July 1. When the autopsy and toxicology report came back they found fentanyl norfentanyl and dilaudid. Rajhon was smoking marijuana which was laced with these drugs.

Fentanyl leading drug deaths

Fentanyl a powerful synthetic opioid that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent is used to treat patients with severe pain. It is put into other drugs because it takes very little to produce a high and is a cheaper option. When taken in high doses the can cause respiratory problems and death. The actor Michael K. Williams died from an accidental drug overdose of fentanyl in September.

A Florida Department of Law Enforcement study found that in 2019 there were 103 cases of people dying in Pensacola with fentanyl in their system and 89 of those deaths were caused by the drug. In a new study in just the first half of 2020 there were 87 cases of fentanyl in a deceased person and 74 of the deaths were caused by the drug.

As the drug-related deaths steadily rise Derian and Twanna House are determined to raise awareness of the deadly effects of drug abuse and other countless violence plaguing their community. They want to bring people together and find ways to bridge the gap between the community church and anyone who needs help.

Twanna who grew up in Pensacola said that experience she had as a child in which everyone protected each other has vanished.

“The sense of community has been lost because I remember growing up in this area where you couldn't walk down the road too far. If they knew that you got in trouble for something they would call you out in a minute” Twanna said.

Solving issues within the community starts by bringing everyone together setting aside differences and working with one another to prevent types of violence like drug abuse to occur in their community she said.

The family intends to bring together other ministries churches and community organizations to start a movement. They also want to bring the police out for people to interact with the community they serve.

Their journey starts with a Neighborhood Block party hosted by Alabaster Box Christian Ministries today at 1072 Sawyer St. from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Their mission is about reaching out and helping people no matter what stage they are in life — just like how Rajhon would do.

Four months after his son passed Derian was doing trips in his transportation service and dropped his last customer over in Fort Walton Beach. He went out to the water and saw a homeless man and they started talking.

The man was in a grateful mood as he had just reconnected with a friend who was from Fort Walton Beach and they were on the way to pick him up. Derian looked over to the man and asked “Have you eaten today?” and he replied “I haven’t.”

Derian just like Rajhon did reached into his pocket pulled out the $14 he had inside and gave it to the man. The man burst out crying and hugged Derian. It was a reminder of the amazing person he was able to raise and call his friend.

“It's memories like that that warms my heart” Derian said. “That makes me proud that I was able to parent such an awesome young man.”

Tim Kinsella

Guest columnist

A good many years ago when I was a newly-winged aviator I drove up to Monterey from San Diego to visit my parents who were living there at the time. A family friend had invited us out to dinner the following night at Clint Eastwood’s restaurant The Mission Ranch to meet a friend of his and fellow aviation enthusiast. Several years earlier our friend had introduced me to Jimmy Doolittle before the great man passed so my interest was certainly piqued on who it could be.

It was over 20 years ago so while my memories of the night are hazy my memories of our mystery friend are not. The miniature gold wings on the lapel of his navy-blue blazer along with his striped tie in navy blue and gold colors told me immediately that he was a naval aviator. While elderly and bald his barrel chest square jaw and cobalt blue eyes belied his almost 80 years. There was an intelligence and intensity about the man that encouraged you to lean in and listen his words dripping with experience and wise counsel.

And lean in I did hardly touching my meal over the next three hours. He spoke of the difficulty of landing an F4U Corsair on the boat unable to see past the massive engine cowling and craning his head outside the cockpit to get a look at the landing signal officer face buffeted by the wind. He told me of his first dogfight and victory against a Japanese Zero over Guadalcanal but how he was jumped by another Zero and chose to dead-stick his stricken F4F Wildcat onto Henderson Field rather than bailout for fear of being shot out of the sky or eaten by sharks in the water below. He spoke enthusiastically of his time flying the F6F Hellcat with the Blue Angels and of his many conversations with Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz on the subject.

It was a night for the ages and one I remember for being instrumental in the growth of a young naval aviator. It was a tour de force in storytelling and a window into the wonderful culture of naval aviation that I was just beginning to know.

The memory of that dinner at Mission Ranch stayed with me for many years until right before I took command of NAS Pensacola I had to travel to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. Walking through the airport I noticed a display memorializing two aviators. One I knew as Gen. James Doolittle USAF and the other I also knew not only because I recognized the name but more so because I recognized the square jaw and piercing blue-eyed gaze of Capt. Roy “Butch” Voris USN better known as the founder of the Blue Angels.

I stood in front of that display for an age bags in hand befuddled that for so long I didn’t realize that the man who I had dinner with 20 years before was the first and most famous Blue Angel. I already felt like I had won the lottery by being assigned to Pensacola but now knowing that a legend who had in one evening imparted a great sense of history and pride to a young naval aviator also was the founder of the perhaps the best known symbol of naval aviation and that now I was going to be commanding officer of their home field.

To the average fleet naval aviator the Blues are sometimes taken for granted and usually placed somewhere between ""Top Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"" on the “campy yet cool” spectrum. That’s not because of any lack of respect quite the contrary. Anyone who has had their hands on the controls of an airplane knows too well how incredibly challenging it is to do what they do. No it’s more likely because naval aviators are the coolest beings on Earth — and how do I know? Well just ask one because they’ll be sure to tell you. All naval aviators secretly love the Blue Angels but are loath to admit that there’s someone who may top them on the cool spectrum.

Each of the Blues whether part of the ground crew or air crew are all fleet sailors and Marines who will return to the big grey boat when their tour with the Blues is over. Perhaps that is what makes them so special and why they are given only a grudging respect by their peers because even though any tactical tailhook naval aviator is eligible to apply very few actually do and there’s a reason.

Most Blues arrive after just completing an arduous tour of sea duty only to spend more time away from home in a year than they did on deployment in the previous tour. Once their time is up with the Blues they will return to the fleet and deploy again. A tour with the Blues is no joke. It is hard on the service member and even harder on the family. But when you do something you love and you see the joy it brings to so many people any Blue Angel will tell you that it was all worthwhile.

A few months after taking command of NAS Pensacola I was offered a ride with the Blues during a practice airshow. In naval aviation we are taught from early on the importance of the pre-flight brief and post-flight debrief — the “brief execute debrief” formula. It is done without ego and with the purpose of continuous learning and improvement. We take it very seriously and pride ourselves on our ability to integrate constructive criticism into our professional development.

The Blue Angels however brief and debrief with as much emphasis on perfection as they place on their in-flight maneuvers. Watching the Boss lead the team through the pre-flight brief was more akin to a shaman leading a group through a spiritual trance such was their concentration and focus. In flight school we all learned how to “chair fly” an event beforehand but the team’s version of chair flying was on a completely different level.

Each member of the team sits around the large oak briefing table eyes closed one hand on an imaginary throttle and the other on the stick each foot working the imaginary rudder pedals. As the Boss intoned the maneuvers in his soothing chant-like cadence each pilot’s hands and feet moved in unison on their imaginary throttles rudder pedal and control sticks. I remember thinking that I wish I had seen this when I was in flight school as an example of the perfect brief. The de-brief however is an intense self-examination of every turn flip spin and climb. Each team member in turn has their chance to call themselves out on their mistakes. It is the ultimate show of public humility for these paragons of the air. You and I may see perfection from the ground but the Blues see only opportunities to improve.

I flew in the No. 4 jet with Maj. Jeff Mullins in the slot position and I was surprised by three things. Firstly how beautiful it is up there. I will never forget the absolute beauty of being nestled up against the belly of the lead jet the blue and yellow paint scheme contrasting alternately against the white Pensacola sands and clear blue sky as we rolled through a loop. Secondly I was completely surprised at how exhilarating it was. I’ve been a pilot a long time and have seen my share of exciting flights but this was different. My chest felt like bursting with joy at times and more than once I found myself laughing out loud in the cockpit. Finally I was surprised at how exhausting it was! Pulling seven g’s multiple times for 45 seconds is no joke especially for this helicopter pilot! I’m not afraid to admit that I went home and took a nap afterward.

The Blue Angels are a constant — an unchanging personification of the very best qualities in naval aviation. The pilots and maintenance crews come and go but the relentless pursuit of perfection remains the same. The aircraft change with the times but the core maneuvers and instantly recognizable color scheme have remained the same since Butch Voris designed them in 1946. The spectators come and go but 75 years later they still flock to be thrilled by the breathtaking spectacle the Blues are famous for.

The Blues are as much a part of Pensacola as de Luna and Fiesta Palafox and Cervantes. They are in Pensacola’s DNA and even featured on the Escambia County logo and Blue Angel jets can be found sculpted on the I-110 and I-10 interstate overpass pillars or painted on water towers. We name schools after them we call them our own and rarely do we speak of Pensacola without uttering in the same breath “Home of the Blue Angels!”

But the Blues don’t belong to Pensacola. They belong to us all. They belong to the people of America. Among all our differences for 45 minutes at the beach last weekend we all looked to the sky together and felt immense pride in being American. That’s what the Blues give us. They give us hope. They give us inspiration. When you look at your young daughter or son’s face and tell them with sincerity “that could be you one day” it reminds us that anything is possible if you work hard enough for it.

To work with the men and women of the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron these past three years has been an honor for me. They are among the best our nation has to offer. This year we lose a couple of the Blues back to the fleet and they will be replaced by fresh faces in crisp new uniforms. But they will be just as good if not better than the men and women they are replacing. So please join me in welcoming our newest Blue Angels and more importantly in wishing them all a very happy 75th anniversary. Here’s to 75 more!

Capt. Tim ""Lucky"" Kinsella is commanding officer of NAS Pensacola."

With a countdown from 10 more than 350 explosives with a force of about 300 pounds imploded two 500-foot-tall stacks at Duke Energy’s Crystal River coal plant in Citrus County.

The energy company says the two-unit coal plant was built in the 1960s produced 915 megawatts of energy and operated in Florida for 50+ years.

The two powerhouses consisting of boilers steam turbine generators drums motors pumps and pipes were imploded in June. 100% of the steel copper and other metals along with the concrete are set to be recycled.

""We retired the plant in 2018 when the new state-of-the-art Citrus Combined Cycle Station a natural gas plant started serving customers. We are retiring coal plants and replacing them with cleaner and more efficient natural gas plants and renewables as part of the company’s clean energy transformation plan. That plan calls for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The next steps include grading and seeding the land and restoring the site.""- Duke Energy

It took more than 350 explosives with a force of about 300 pounds to take down the 500-foot tall stacks according to Duke Energy.

The plant was retired in 2018 when Duke Energy transitioned to a natural gas plant. The two powerhouses consisting of boilers steam turbine generators drums motors pumps and pipes were imploded in June.

Duke Energy says it plans to begin restoring the land by grading a seeding the site.

Though the power company says it hasn’t decided how it will repurpose the property where the coal plant stood it has no plans to sell it and says it will remain an industrial property.

CRYSTAL RIVER Fla. (WCJB) - The final two remaining towers at the Crystal River Coal Plant were demolished Saturday.

Duke Energy retired use of the plant in 2018 and transitioned to a natural gas plant in Citrus County the same year.

The former coal plant generated more than 900 megawatts of power for over five decades since it started in 1960.

The move to natural gas is one that Duke Energy continues to make as the company made a goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent

Jury selection begins today in the federal criminal case against Elizabeth Holmes the founder of the blood-testing tech start-up Theranos. Indicted in 2018 she faces a dozen counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for making false claims about Theranos’s blood tests and business prospects. She has pleaded not guilty. If convicted Holmes 37 faces up to 20 years in prison.

Opening arguments in the trial which is expected to last three to four months begin next week. At the heart of the proceedings The Times’s Erin Griffith and Erin Woo write is whether Holmes intentionally misled investors about her company’s technology or believed her own lies and was manipulated by others.

Court filings recently unsealed provided a preview of what Holmes’s lawyers may say and whom they could present in her defense.

Holmes may point the finger at others judging from a request her lawyers made last year that was just made public. She will be tried alone but is not the only one accused of fraud. Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani her former boyfriend and the former president and C.O.O. of Theranos also faces charges. (His trial will begin early next year; he also pleaded not guilty.)"

His will to shake off defenders and any number of other feeble hangers-on made him tougher to take down than an international crime syndicate.

Note to Causeway Street shop owners: Batten down the hatches ladies and gents because the wind whipped up pretty good around here when Big Ben was barreling down the field.

Ben Coates a hurricane force of a tight end in his days with the Patriots will blow back into town Dec. 8 for his night as an honoree at the Sports Museum’s prestigious “Tradition” ceremony at the Garden.

“Now that’s all about pride … that’s pride” Coates recalled the other day reached at his home in Concord N.C. “That’s pride when you come from a small school and a lot of people said that you shouldn’t be there but you’re there and you’re just trying to prove that everybody’s wrong.”

Like a large portion of 20th century Patriots history — those decades before Super Bowl rings and duck boat parades became our gridiron de rigueur — time has placed Coates on the back shelf of memories of even some of the most ardent Patriots fans. After arriving here in 1991 from tiny Livingstone College in Salisbury N.C. he worked his way up from special teams to blossom as the NFL’s dominant tight end once Drew Bledsoe became quarterback in 1993.

“Yeah that was my highlight when Bledsoe arrived” noted Coates who quickly rendered two-time Pro Bowl selection Marv Cook a spare part. “It was like ‘Drew you just throw me the ball OK? and I’ll catch it. Just throw … me … the … ball.’ ”

In his six prime pass-catching seasons with the Patriots 1993-98 Coates was the intended receiver 671 times and caught 428 (.638) of those passes 44 for touchdowns. Bledsoe amassed 128 TD passes across that same stretch.

Upon Coates’s retirement in 2001 after winning the Super Bowl in his 2000 farewell season with the Ravens he ranked as the No. 4 receiver at tight end (499 catches 50 TDs 5555 yards) behind Ozzie Newsome Shannon Sharpe and Kellen Winslow all of them now enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Ben Coates (right) gave his all for the Patriots and should be enshrined in Canton. The Boston Globe/Boston Globe

Coates deserves to have his bust in Canton too. The fact that his excellence has been lost to time is really two-fold: 1. New England’s success was rather lean (67-77) during his nine years here including the loss to Green Bay in Super Bowl XXXI; 2. The total eclipse of everything that ever happened here once Tom Brady and crew began to accumulate that six-ring haul in 2001.

“In all honesty that’s fair” said Coates acknowledging how his time and legacy have been framed here. “But you know Rome wasn’t built in a day right? Somebody had to build it. Somebody had to be the foundation for them to be champions six times go to all those Super Bowls. Because when I went there in 1991 we weren’t great … but eventually we were building something.”

The club’s return to respectability over the latter part of the 1990s Coates believes eventually is what helped persuade Bill Belichick to return as Foxborough’s rainmaker in chief.

“The program was pretty much established by then” he said. “If he didn’t think so he would have stayed with the Jets.”

In the 20 years Coates has been retired the game has changed dramatically. He was on the field plenty coach Bill Parcells often leaving him out there for first second and third downs a rarity for tight ends. A 22-year-old Coates entering today’s game probably couldn’t be out there more than he was then but he’d likely be targeted far more frequently in today’s pass-first pass-last pass-always NFL.

More significantly Coates today wouldn’t be required to smack down defensive ends as part of the running game a role he performed with gusto and excellence helping Curtis Martin to crack 1100 yards rushing good for an average 10 TDs each of the three years he ran out of the New England backfield.

“True complete tight ends they’re a thing of the past” offered Coates. who just a few years ago had both hips replaced the price for too much wear and tear from blocks and after-catch yardage. “The game is all about passing and points now teams with 20 30 and 40 points every game. It’s like flag football out there. Some of these tight ends I mean you see ‘em look at their shoulder pads they look like kickers. They’re not blocking anybody.”

Now fully retired at his home outside Charlotte Coates just watched Christopher his youngest of three sons wrap up his high school career. Post-retirement until his hips grew too painful he spent the better part of 15 years in coaching for seven teams pro and college. During a one-year internship with the Cowboys he helped to develop Jason Witten and he also tutored Kellen Winslow II for two years with the Browns.

“The hip pain just got to be too much” Coates said “Time came that I said ‘OK that’s enough. I’m good.’”

Coates said he was “ecstatic” and felt it was “truly an honor” to receive word from Rusty Sullivan executive director of the Sports Museum that he would be included among this year’s Tradition honorees an illustrious group that includes David Ortiz Kevin McHale Angela Ruggiero Taylor Twellman and Mike Milbury. In 2008 the Patriots inducted Coates into their Hall of Fame.

“Just great to be honored like this” said Coates. “Who knows maybe I get this attention here and maybe the [Pro Football Hall of Fame] will get to thinking ‘Hey wait a minute did we forget about Coates?’”

Market in Thunder Bay Ont. is any indication the future is looking bright for the future for the long-empty Eaton's building in the city's north core.

A line around the block full of eager shoppers greeted Maelyn Hurley when she first opened the doors of her new business.

Hurley the local entrepreneur behind the long gestating project said people of ""all walks of life"" came out for the opening of the space at the beginning of November.

""A couple of people were in tears that it was coming you know coming back to life it's been really crazy"" said Hurley.

She said some of the city's older population were in attendance to see the revitalization many of whom remembered the original Eaton's shopping centre.

Leaning into the future

Aesthetically speaking Hurley said it was important to lean into the future while still paying tribute to the past.

""Anything that was iconic to Eaton's or that was really good about the building I wanted to restore. But I also wanted to bring this fresh modern really just simple Nordic vibe as well to the space"" she said.

Listen to Maelyn Hurley's full interview from the ground floor of Goods and Co.

With 35 to 40 permanent vendor spaces a common area and a variety of different products ranging from food to handmade items the 20000 square feet of market space has been put to use in all sorts of interesting ways.

The pinnacle of the market in Hurley's eyes is the ""Woodside Bar"" where thirsty shoppers can grab a signature cocktail or some delicious local fare.

""The Woodside Bar on the corner is definitely the highlight I think for a lot of people in this space. We opened up the display case windows and made it so that people could actually see fully into the market space from the street"" said Hurley.

'A good blend'

Another highlight of the market is the Co. Lab Art Gallery currently showcasing an exhibition organized by The Solidarity Collective.

""We have about 20 BIPOC [Black Indigenous people of colour] artists in this exhibition all working in different mediums"" explained Lara Northway the director of the space.

""So some really large colourful canvases and some screen printing some felt work some actual regalia and beadwork. It's a good blend.""

Northway said they wanted to open the space with a show that reflects the goals and the ""heart"" of the space.

Currently the Goods & Co Market is open Wednesday to Sunday but that's something that could change if there's an appetite for more said Hurley.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9saW1hb2hpby9uYW1lL21pY2hhZWwtcHJpbmUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE1NjUyOTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Prine Obituary (1973 - 2021) - Spencerville OH - The Lima News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/limaohio/name/michael-prine-obituary?id=31565290 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9saW1hb2hpby9uYW1lL21pY2hhZWwtcHJpbmUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE1NjUyOTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3MvZml0LW11bS0yMi1kaWVkLWFmdGVyLTI1NDQ4NTE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Fit' mum 22 died after going into cardiac arrest while giving birth to son,"Paige Bradbury-Price 22 from Nottinghamshire was found unresponsive in the early hours of August 11 after feeling ""hot and stressed"" the night before an inquest heard

'Fit' mum 22 died after going into cardiac arrest while giving birth to son

A ""fit and well"" mum died after going into a sudden cardiac arrest during childbirth as medics delivered her son alive.

Paige Bradbury-Price 22 was found unresponsive in the early hours of August 11 2020 after feeling ""hot and stressed"" the night before.

An inquest held at Nottingham Coroners' Court heard the young mum was 36 weeks pregnant with her second child and was otherwise a ""fit and well young woman"".

Medics from the air ambulance service and East Midlands Ambulance Service crews were called to Ms Bradbury-Price's address in Long Eaton area of Nottinghamshire.

Her partner had called emergency services while another family member carried out CPR NottinghamshireLive reports.

Ms Bradbury-Price had been in cardiac arrest for 12 minutes before paramedics arrived and they treated her in the bedroom of the house before being she was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre where she sadly died later that morning.

The inquest heard resuscitation efforts stopped at 2.58am but a decision was made to deliver her baby at 1.57am by a perimortem Caesarean section - a procedure which is carried out on a expectant mum in late pregnancy who is cardiac arrest.

Paramedics continued efforts to resuscitate Ms Bradbury-Price after her son was born.

She was pronounced dead as 6.20am.

Assistant Coroner Dr Elizabeth Didcock described the delivery as ""the right thing to do"".

The baby boy responded well to resuscitation efforts and was taken home from the QMC shortly after being admitted.

The inquest was told that a a perimortem Caesarean section was a ""very rare"" procedure.

Bosses from the air ambulance service noted that those involved in Ms Bradbury-Price's care were likely ""stressed and traumatised"" as a result of the incident which was described as ""almost unprecedented"".

Dr Didcock concluded: ""There are no issues of care that caused or contributed to Paige's death. My conclusion is therefore that of natural causes.

""Finally I would like to extend my sincere condolences to all the family for the loss of Paige.""

The coroner ruled that Ms Bradbury-Price had died from natural causes and a medical cause of death was given as unascertained.

It was also found that there were some inaccuracies

One member of the family previously told the inquest: ""Thank you for everything you did there. It was such an unusual and rare case. I know how much it affected us but I know it affected everybody there that night.

""We lost Paige but we have also gained a gorgeous little boy.

It was a summer afternoon just over fifty years ago the heat of the day was simmering in Long Eaton families were busily preparing tea and workers were about to clock off.

But as that Monday afternoon wound down terrifying news began to ripple through the town.

A huge fire had taken hold at a factory near the centre of town and was quickly spreading.

The talk on the street was that frightened workers were trapped inside and screaming from the windows while nearby buildings were being evacuated.

The famous blaze happened on June 28th 1971 and the fire would be so catastrophic it would destroy the four storey factory and become the stuff of legend in the area.

Local author and historian Keith Reedman recalls that the day was tinged with a mixture of sadness and excitement

He along with hundreds of others made his way to the scene when the news broke out.

He watched the drama unfold and took many photos documenting a day that would go down in local history.

Historical blaze etched in local memory

""I remember it all very clearly"" says Keith ""It was a very large lace factory building that had been built in 1880.

""It was four storeys high with further attic space and it was the site of Long Eaton's first mechanised lace factory.

""It was erected by Joseph Orchard a lace manufacturer who was expanding at that time.

""But after lace production finished in Europe around the 1920s Long Eaton went into a depression and the factory was rented out to whoever would occupy it.

""At the time of the 1971 fire it was being used by Liptons to make teabags. There were several large expensive machines in there and a number of staff.""

On the day of the fire it is believed that work was being carried out by contractors in the building and that the blaze was started accidentally by them.

""One day some workmen were carrying out something possibly painting"" says Keith ""and they somehow accidentally set fire to the building.

""It went up in a huge conflagration - it was a sight to see Very dramatic.""

Keith a former plumber had been working nearby but headed towards the area.

""You couldn't miss it"" he says ""Everyone knew about it. There was no real fear really it was exciting more than anything.""

The fire broke out at between 4 and 5 pm on the day and is said to have involved something in the region of 22 fire engines taking more than a week for the monstrous blaze to finally dampen down.

Some accounts of the time state that the fire took three weeks to completely go out.

Unbelievably for a fire of its size nobody was seriously hurt in the blaze.

Running out of water

""The fire brigade were all over the place as they tried to control the leaping flames.

""They did have to rescue workers and a huge amount of damage was caused"" recalls Keith.

""Workmen with their ladders were helping to rescue factory workers out of the upper windows before the entire north or north east side of the factory wall came crashing down on top of the surrounding buildings. Those people probably got out in the nick of time.""

Many other buildings were destroyed as the fire wreaked havoc including the buildings of the local newspaper the Long Eaton Advertiser which had been evacuated and the house belonging the the building's owner Mr Orchard.

""Fire engines from all over the region attended as the fire leapt out of control"" says Keith ""There was an out building quite a tall one with an asbestos covered roof. The fire was at such a high temperature that these sheets of asbestos exploded like machine gun fire into the air.

""If that had have happened any time in the last ten years or son the whole of Long Easton would have been evacuated but in those days things were more pragmatic and people just got on.""

As the fire continued it's destruction the fire engines present began to run out of water as Keith explains.

""They had to run hosepipes all the way down to Erewash canal a good quarter of a mile away. ""

Burning teabags floated through the air

Many local people recall the day of the fire including a close friend of Keith's Ann who actually worked in the building but miraculously had left early that day to go to the dentist.

The following is an excerpt of an account of the fire written previously by Ann and supplied by Keith.

""I was back home when my cousin and aunt rushed into my house and said ‘Thank goodness you are OK – your place is on fire!’"" Ann recalls.

""We had no home phone at that time. My husband and I joined them and two children in her car and went to Long Eaton town centre where great crowds were already gathered. Believed to have started sometime between 4.30 and 5 pm. this huge building was by then well ablaze.

""It was believed to have started behind the lift in the entrance lobby on the ground floor close to where my office was situated.

""When the alarm was first raised many employees were washing hands using toilets etc. in preparation for finishing work and ignored the warning thinking it was just another alarm testing exercise.

Medals for bravery

Ann continues: ""Fortunately no lives were lost but many women had to be rescued from the top floor. There were a number of mechanics who returned into the burning building and rescued four women from the top floor and I think their bravery received some sort of recognition.

""Fireman Dave Statham received a Gold Star bravery award for risking his own life as he stood on the top rung of the fireman’s ladder with another fireman holding his legs and managing to reach up and grab a fifth woman to safety from the roof.

""Seconds later the spot where the woman had stood was engulfed in flames. Burning teabags floated through the air some falling on passing railway wagons setting fire to timber.""

Burnt out buildings demolished

Weeks later the burnout buildings stood skeleton like and crumbling.

In time the factory would be demolished and the buildings around it rebuilt.

""There have of course been other fires in Long Eaton that I recall but this was the biggest in my memory"" says Keith ""It's something you don't forget. When the fire was at it's height teabags were flying ablaze into the sky as the up-draft was so fierce.""

After the demolition of the building the site was taken over by a DIY retail unit at the time.

""It signalled a change for the area"" says Keith ""A lot of people lost their jobs and some relocated to various other places.

A lot can change over the course of a century in our towns - buildings can be demolished entire new estates can rise up out of the ground.

Long Eaton has seen many of these changes but for more than 90 years there has been one constant that has remained in place a reminder of how things used to be.

Heaps the stationers has seen off wars fires and recessions as it continues to trade after originally opening in 1930 Nottinghamshire Live reports.

The shop which is based in Main Street in the town has only had a handful of staff during this time.

At the helm of this fascinating treasure trove for the past 41 years having worked there in total for 56 years is Stuart Danvers now 76.

We find Stuart happily tending to his customers on a quiet Wednesday lunch where he spares us some time among the stacked out aisles to tell us a bit about his past half a century there and how he's never moved on because it's ""his life"".

Stuart sits as if in his own living room on a worn and well-loved armchair tucked at the back of the shop.

His backdrop is a wall of greetings cards - ""they're all only £1"" he makes sure to tell us. By his feet are neatly displayed jigsaw puzzles to his sides walls of myriad art supplies which he says are what he's mostly known for.

""Yes the shop has been since circa 1930 - It belong to Mr Heaps until 1955 and then Mr Hooley took it on.

""I arrived at the age of 23 in 1968 to work here and I loved it.

""By 1979 Mr Hooley was ready to retire and he asked me to take on the shop and I was delighted to. It was my life.""

In many ways the town of Long Eaton on the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire border has changed beyond recognition and Stuart has seen much of that.

While there's the very distinct feeling that Stuart is not one to mince his words he does choose them carefully when describing the Long Eaton of today but something in his body language gives away a sadness over some of the changes a feeling that's perhaps only usual for someone who wears their town and their place in it like a second skin.

""Oh so much has changed in all these years yes"" he sighs

""Losing the Co-op across the road had a big impact. I lost a lot of foot fall when that went and it changed this little area a bit.

""The big supermarkets coming in have changed things too it's not about the competition I don't worry about that because I've got no overheads but they change the nature of a place a bit and the way people shop. You can park for free in the big shops so people go there and then don't go anywhere else. They get what they want in there.""

(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)

But while new ways of shopping have come to the masses there's still a core of customers that give Heaps a reason to open its doors every day.

""My customers are very loyal"" says Stuart. ""I have some people who've been coming in here for decades. I'm on to the grandchildren of some of them now I know them that well.

""Mind you I've known some of them that long they've started telling me the same stories I've heard before"" he laughs before quipping ""I'm too old for it now I don't have the patience I just say 'you've already told me!'

Stuart laughs at the anecdote showing his back and forth with his customers happens with fondness rather that frustration.

The shop is almost packed to the rafters with stock and it's hard not to wonder how he shifts it but he says it's ""one of the last independent stores in Long Eaton where you can buy pretty much anything.""

There's a huge selection of jigsaws painting by numbers and children's art sets as well as walls and walls of paints pencils paper clips canvases paint brushes and more.

He also sells items it might be tricky to find elsewhere like candle wicks and plaster of paris and an array of maps that even he admits ""people don't need as much now what with Sat Nav"" yet they're clearly part of store's fabric.

The shop's fittings have barely changed in 100 years the bumpy walls and cracked corners affectionately - and expectedly showing the building's Grade-I listed age.

Over his time there Stuart has simply become part of those fixtures and fittings still donning a tie each morning for a day at work still he says never being sure what each day might bring.

""I've just kept going I've been here so long that any changes happen gradually really you don't notice time just goes by.

""All the nearby nightclubs have gone now which is good. They used to stay open until 4am and the building would shake all night. I'd heard glass shattering but got used to not bothering unless the shop alarm was going off.""

(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)

One of the biggest events Stuart recalls with sorrow was the Long Eaton teabag factory fire of 1971. Flames tore through the building just across the road from the shop and the whole area was in chaos.

""I remember there was an Evening Post seller on the corner outside and he came running in to tell us the factory was going up and I didn't believe him! But of course it was. I saw the whole gable end of the building fall away in flames and women on the top floors screaming. People were shouting 'don't jump'.

He also recalls a time when a gang of youngsters roughed the shop up a little entering en-masse and tearing into stock when Stuart took them to task.

He installed cameras after that but that's the extent of the shop's modernisation.

""Oh the customer's say 'don't change Stuart' and I won't - I'd just be the same as everywhere else then wouldn't I?"" he says.

Astonishingly he still uses a 1930s cash register and behind the counter is a wall lamp which also hails from the 30s. It doesn't work but that doesn't matter.

One of the only things to annoy Stuart about his 50 odd year old job is when customers come in looking for something specific having been to dozens of other stores first.

""They'll say 'do you know Stuart I've been everywhere for one of these and I knew you'd have one' so I think 'well why didn't you come here in the first place then?"" He grins widely and something in that smile says he still thrives on the challenge of meeting their needs.

And this little corner of Long Eaton unchanged for so long isn't likely to change for some time yet either. When asked if he'll ever hang up his hat Stuart thinks for the shortest of seconds before quietly answering: ""Only if I get bored. And I'm not bored yet.""

If you rather have the integrated graphics the Core i5-12400 is also up for sale at $364.77.

With Alder Lake Intel decided to push the K-series processors first saving the more pocket-friendly SKUs for a later date. During the announcement the chipmaker confirmed that it was shipping up to 28 more Alder Lake SKUs to OEMs for prebuilt systems that are slated to debut early 2022. Intel didn't commit to a specific date but many believe that the non-K processors could arrive as early as January.

It would seem that a few of the unreleased Alder Lake chips may have gotten lost in the process. Affari Temporanei an Italian retailer and also the eBay seller has put the Core i5-12400 and Core i5-12400F processors up on eBay. The merchant marked the hybrid parts as OEM chips but didn't confirm whether they're engineering samples (ES) or not.

Affari Temporanei also listed the Core i5-12400 and Core i5-12400F on its online shop with similar pricing to the eBay listings. Apparently there's only one unit each. Interested consumers from the U.S. would probably want to purchase through eBay since that's the only plaform where Affari Temporanei offers worldwide shipping. Obviously it's a big risk since these are alleged OEM chips so they don't come with standard warranties. Since the Core i5-12600K retails for $299.99 you are definitely paying a huge markup just to get the chips before everyone else.

*Specifications are unconfirmed.

The Core i5-12400F and Core i5-12400 made their first appearance at a Canadian retailer a few days ago. If the information is accurate these are hexa-core chips without the small Gracemont cores. That means they sport six Golden Cove cores with Hyper-Threading. The processors could feature a boost clock up to 4.4 GHz. Affari Temporanei stated a 2.5 GHz clock speed which is likely the base frequency.

There are two specifications that we can be certain of. Intel has already revealed the inner workings of Alder Lake so we know the Core i5 models come equipped with 18MB of L3 cache. The model names tell us that the Core i5-12400F and Core i5-12400 have a 65W PBP (Processor Base Power). However the MTP (Maximum Turbo Power) rating is unknown. For comparison the Core i5-12600K sports a 150W MTP so we can state with certainty that the Core i5-12400F and Core i5-12400 will have lower MTP values.

Unreleased Intel CPUs can now easily be bought from eBay.

For weeks what was a domain of Chinese enthusiast forums and black markets has now spread to popular international auction sites. An illegal sale of Intel 12th Gen Core CPUs has reached eBay where practically anyone can now buy a Core i5-12400 processor sample but there is a very good reason not to buy it just yet. That’s despite the fact that Z690 motherboards are already on sale. Most of them will simply not work with these engineering samples.

Alleged Intel Core i5-12400F QXDY sample Source: Ebay

Intel ships thousands of engineering and qualification samples to its partners such as motherboard or memory makers OEMs/ODMs system integrators or even overclockers. The purpose of those samples is to find errors that can later be fixed with the later iterations of the silicon. The early silicon commonly known as ES1 or ES2 (Engineering Sample 1/2) is not supported by retail Z690 motherboards available on the retail market right now as they require a different microcode. Only Qualification Samples (QS) and retail CPUs might work with these boards.

According to our information Alder Lake CPUs were even available in ES3 state which was more or less what the QS samples ended up to be. Apparently some BIOSes will support these specific samples which were distributed by Intel in the last few months. On the other hand the ES1 or ES2 samples which often shipped more than a year ago are simply not going to work.

The eBay seller supposedly offers a Core i5-12400 CPU with an S-Spec code of QXDY. This code does not match the Qualification Sample that was tested by Comptoir Hardware which is QYHX. The QS also has a newer C0 silicon revision while (supposedly) ES2 comes with B0.

In fact there is relatively a big difference between the two such as a different boost frequency: 4.4 GHz vs 4.0 GHz. Furthermore the QXDY sample has a different integrated GPU. Instead of the expected UHD 730 graphics it actually comes with HD 770. In other words it could just as well be an Intel Core i5-12600 sample that supposedly features such graphics. A lengthy and detailed description of each of the engineering samples can be found on Zhuanlan.

A purchase of an early engineering sample will simply mean that without a motherboard with an older microcode/management driver the CPU will simply not work. In fact this is exactly what happened to Linus Tech Tips who bought an ES2 sample of Core i9-12900K the processor was incompatible with the review Z690 motherboards.

In a few months eBay will likely be filled with more engineering samples with Alder Lake silicon but it is important to understand that those come with no warranty possible incompatibility issues and no support from Intel.

However the device is more of a collector's item as Pillonel has cautioned against using it as a daily driver or installing software updates.

4 Reviews

To the dismay of many Apple continues to use its proprietary Lightning port on all iPhones including the latest iPhone 13 models. Recently a robotics engineering student Kenn Pillonel demonstrated that an iPhone can indeed make use of a USB Type-C port for both charging and data by reverse engineering Apple's Lightning connector. This ""world's first USB-C iPhone"" has now sold on eBay for a whopping US$86001.

Pillonel put up his modded iPhone X 64 GB with a USB-C connector on eBay earlier this month as a bid-only item under the account name ""geeken"" complete with free shipping and a 30-minute tech support call-in. The auction started at US$1 but has since been steadily climbing into thousands of dollars. Now Pillonel has sold this modded iPhone X to the highest auction valued at US$86001 which is about 80x its original sale price.

That being said Pillonel has put forth several conditions to the bidder. He writes

You will not restore update or erase this iPhone

You will not use it as your daily phone

You will not open it I guarantee that the phone will work when you receive it but if you don't follow the aforementioned guidelines you are on your own. So basically you can do whatever you want with it but don't expect anything from me if you break something. It is just a prototype.""

This modded iPhone X is more of a collector's item than a daily driver as it is likely that performing any of the above steps will render the iPhone as a pretty expensive paperweight.

That being said Pillonel has opensourced his work on GitHub for other hobbyists and electronics enthusiasts to try out. Pillonel also said that he will continue working on other projects including adding support for USB-C accessories for the iPhone improving the fast charging and more.

Change Checker has released its latest Scarcity Index of rare coins including the most sought-after 10p 50p and £2 pieces - so do you have one of the rarest coins in your collection?

Rarest 10p 50p and £2 coins explained including Kew Gardens design worth up to £200

The rarest 10p 50p and £2 coins have been revealed - including one coin that could be worth up to £200.

We explain which coins you should be checking your pockets for to see if you’re sitting on a mint.

These results are based on the latest Scarcity Index by coin website Change Checker which keeps track of the rarest spare change.

The list is broken down into three sections; the rarest 50 pence pieces A to Z 10p coins and £2s currently in circulation.

The Kew Gardens 50p has once again topped the most wanted 50p coin index.

According to the Change Checker eBay tracker this particular coin fetches an average of £165 on the auction site - but we’ve previously seen them sell for as much as £200.

Meanwhile the rarest 10p is the R for Robin coin which has moved up two places in the Scarcity Index.

When we checked eBay today we spotted one that had sold for £14 although some have gone for a lower price of £3.99.

In terms of £2 coins the most sought-after is the Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games piece.

Change Checker says this could fetch you £45 on eBay if you’re lucky enough to find one in your change.

Here is the latest Scarcity Index broken down.

Rarest 50p coins - worth up to £200

The Kew Gardens 50p has once again topped the rarest 50 pence piece list - so it's worth keeping an eye out for one of these coins.

Created by Christopher Le Brun RA its features the famous Chinese Pagoda from the gardens being intertwined by a leafy climber.

This coin was released in 2009 to mark 250 years since Kew Gardens opened in 1759 and there are only 210000 in circulation.

The next most sought-after coin is the 2011 triathlon 50p which was released as part of the 2012 London Olympics collection.

There are around 1163500 of these in circulation with its design featuring someone running cycling and swimming.

Experts say these can sell for around £11 on eBay - not bad for a coin only worth 50p.

Finally the third rarest coin on the list is now the 2011 wrestling 50p which is also part of the 2012 London Olympics set.

There are slightly less of these in circulation at 1129500 compared to the triathlon 50p with its design showing two people in the wrestling ring.

One in good condition could make you £6.25 online.

Rarest 10p coins - worth up to £14

The 10p list is made of the alphabet A to Z collection released in 2018 and 2019 to celebrate all things British.

There are 26 coins in the set to correspond with the 26 letters in the alphabet.

The rarest one from that collection is now R for Robin launched to celebrate the much-loved red breast bird.

Its design features a robin sitting in the letter R with snowflakes falling around it.

Around 284000 have been released into circulation in total with one recently selling on eBay for £14.

Next on the list is W for World Wide Web which was previously top of the rarest 10 pence pieces on the last Scarcity Index.

This coin has the letter W surrounded by a spiderweb.

Some 283000 were issued for circulation in 2018 and we've spotted one that sold for £9 online in recent weeks.

In third place on the Scarcity Index is Y for Yeoman Warder launched to celebrate the guards of the Tower of London.

The design depicts one Yeoman Warder posing next to the letter Y.

If you have one the highest it'll likely go for on eBay is around £10.

Like the W coin around 283000 were circulated in 2018.

Rarest £2 coins - worth up to £45

The top three coins in terms of the

rarest £2 pieces

are once again all from the Commonwealth Games 2002 collection.

The most sought-after is the Northern Ireland version which comes ahead of two other editions designed for England and Scotland.

The Wales version is number 11 on the list.

All the different editions feature the same base design and you can only identify them by their respective flag.

If you've got the Northern Ireland version of which there are 485500 in circulation they're currently selling for around £45 on eBay.

However we have previously seen examples sell for as much as £80 several months ago.

In terms of the England edition there are 650500 copies in circulation and a mint version could sell for £30 online.

Or if you have the Scotland coin of which there are 771750 in existence it could fetch around £17 to £20."

Recommended Videos

It’s been a rocky (early access) launch for Battlefield 2042 for many players which comes as no surprise. Even when it works and you’re not struggling with online errors kicking you back to the main menu the results are mixed among fans myself included.

But after the way the open beta went down it’s actually smoother than I was expecting.

We decided to turn down EA’s review event for Battlefield 2042 in part because this is a multiplayer game with no campaign whatsoever so I’m coming at you with around five hours of real-world playtime against other players and the AI. Last night’s matches worked like a charm a good chunk of today was spent just dealing with server issues and I’m still very much figuring out how I feel about this game’s design and long-term vision.

I mean it’s a Battlefield launch. Things can only go up from here. (I hope.)

Battlefield 2042 (PC PS4 PS5 [reviewed] Xbox One Xbox Series X/S)

Developer: DICE

Publisher: Electronic Arts

Released: November 12 2021 (early access) / November 19 2021

MSRP: $59.99 / $69.99

I’m liking the full version of Battlefield 2042 way more than the very content-limited and rough-around-the-edges beta — the difference was immediately noticeable.

There are still foundational concerns with DICE’s new approach but compared to the open beta the gunplay feels much more reliable the maps have more personality and the sprawled-out skirmishes are more readable. It wasn’t as hard to find the fun.

There are three main facets of Battlefield 2042: All-Out Warfare (with Conquest and Breakthrough modes) Portal (with player-customized gametypes and official recreations of three classic Battlefield experiences) and Hazard Zone (the squad-based “fight smart and get out alive” PvPvE mode). I’ve spent the least amount of time with the latter.

I won’t beat around the bush here: the best part of Battlefield 2042 is arguably Portal. That might seem like a no-brainer to some of you but I honestly didn’t come in expecting that to be the case. Unlike the gargantuan maps in All-Out Warfare these official and unofficial modes can feel more deliberate manageable and most of all fun. They’re a blast.

I’ve yet to mess around with funky user-made modes (much less attempted to create my own) but I keep coming back to Portal. DICE has leaned into nostalgia with classic Rush and Conquest gameplay on Battlefield 1942‘s Battle of the Bulge and El Alamein Bad Company 2‘s Valparaiso and Arica Harbor and Battlefield 3‘s Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals. If you have a soft spot for any of these games (or especially all three) you should have a riot with Portal. You don’t need to dig into any obscure server list — they’re right there on the main Portal menu and they recreate the weapons gadgets and most importantly classes of those iconic games. This stuff looks and feels great. Now I wouldn’t go dropping $60 or $70 on Battlefield 2042 solely for this slice — again it’s only two maps per legacy game at this point — but Portal is already doing a lot of heavy lifting.

That’s not to say the big new semi-futuristic side of Battlefield 2042 with 128-player battles is a total bust or anything. It’s just not the home run it could and really should be.

The specialist system — in which you pick a named character with a unique trait and specialty who can mix and match weapons and gear rather than a strict all-or-nothing archetype — is still divisive. It doesn’t feel entirely gameplay motivated so much as a way to inject a bit of characterization (and eventual monetization?) into the game even though most of us seem to prefer tried-and-true Battlefield classes and the ensuing teamwork.

The main issue I have with specialists as a general concept is that players have so many options with their equipment loadouts it’s hard to get your team to meaningfully specialize and that has big ramifications. As one example I’ve tended to play as the two current medic-leaning specialists including Angel who’s good with revives and ammo top-ups — but I can totally roll with a sniper rifle or anti-vehicle gadget if I want.

Although some specialists have flashier perks like a wingsuit or grappling hook plenty of them are more muted. Some of them (there are 10 so far with the launch lineup) already blur together. And specialists in general can kind of just feel like one extra layer you have to get through on top of your loadout and weapon customization. The menus add up.

I love the new Plus System in Battlefield 2042 for on-the-fly mid-firefight attachment switching but I hate the way it feels to swap to a different specialist and/or alter their loadout for a given tactical situation after I’ve been taken out and I’m looking for a new spot on the map to drop into. There are enough quirks going on with the UI that you almost need to build up muscle memory before you can learn to quickly move through it.

That might sound like a cranky nitpick but I think it’s having an impact on the moment-to-moment gameplay which is the whole draw of the Battlefield series. I think there’s a snowball effect between the fuzzily defined player roles the huge 128-player matches (on PC PS5 and Xbox Series X/S) and probably also the newness of the maps.

Battlefield is at its best when you feel like you’re making small yet precise strikes to chip away at the opposing forces and the rest of your squad is backing you up by doing the same and every other squad on your side is also working one of many objectives. It’s not about winning exactly — it’s this gut feeling that conscious progress is being made.

On the flip side there are aspects of All-Out Warfare I have yet to fully wrap my head around. I’m tempted to point to one glaring issue or another but I think it’s far more nuanced. I don’t think it’s just a matter of wide-open areas leading to futile firefights and an overall sense of despair over how challenging it is to change the tide of battle with even a coordinated squad but maybe it is that simple. Maybe with time we’ll all learn how to synergize on these sprawling maps with cool weather spectacles as a chaotic backdrop. As is I’m feeling wistful about Battlefield V and Battlefield 1 and while these games usually do take time to reach their full potential there are no guarantees.

There are glitches to clean up gameplay tweaks to make heaps of fan feedback to heed or ignore and new content to create to keep the live-service pipeline flowing. I hope DICE is ready. On a purely technical front the PS5 version has been relatively good to me other than the early-access launch-day connection issues which weren’t much of a surprise.

At this point — and it’s still too early to call — I too rarely experience that warm and fuzzy Battlefield feeling in Conquest on the 2042 maps. When I flipped over to Portal for a smaller-scale round of Rush with the Bad Company 2 preset the contrast was undeniable. Suddenly it just resonated again. Both teams were playing to Battlefield‘s strengths.

I haven’t completely made my mind up about All-Out Warfare in Battlefield 2042 and I also need to invest more time in Hazard Zone (even though it’s not really my scene) so we’ll see how the next week goes. At this point I’d recommend playing the trial if at all possible. There are ways for DICE to turn this game around but at this exact moment I’m not feeling super confident about 2042‘s long-term prospects. The best moments are still a blast — it’s a joy to parachute off a skyscraper while helicopters tanks and even hovercraft sow chaos below — but this game isn’t effortlessly clicking the way it should.

However the thing that arguably has fans more excited than anything else is Battlefield Portal which is a brand-new experience that blends elements of older Battlefield games with content in Battlefield 2042.

Here's an in-depth look at everything we know about Battlefield Portal including what it is what maps and modes are included in it when you can play it and more.

What is Battlefield Portal?

Source: Electronic Arts (Image credit: Source: Electronic Arts)

Battlefield Portal is a tool within Battlefield 2042 and the Battlefield website that allows players to create their own unique Battlefield multiplayer experiences. With Portal fans can build a customized gameplay experience that features factions characters weapons gadgets attachments vehicles and more from Battlefield 1942 Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 2042. With Portal everything from dogfights between jets and World War II fighter planes to firefights between soldiers of Nazi Germany and the modern Russian military is possible. Battlefield Portal has tons of potential and it alongside the rest of the game's content could end up making Battlefield 2042 one of the best Xbox shooters available.

Unlike Battlefield 2042's all-out warfare modes EA and DICE are not running Battlefield Portal servers for players to matchmake into. Instead players will be able to select community servers from a server browser. If players want to create a unique experience to play with they'll be able to do so by using the Battlefield Portal tool on the Battlefield website. They can then choose to host a server with their experience loaded onto it.

To start creating your own Battlefield Portal experience go to the official Battlefield Portal website.

Battlefield Portal: Maps and modes

Players will have 13 different Battlefield 2042 maps to choose from when making the map rotation for their Battlefield Portal experience — seven from the core Battlefield 2042 experience itself and six remastered ones from previous Battlefield games. These include the following:

Hourglass

Discarded

Manifest

Kaleidoscope

Orbital

Breakaway

Renewal

Battle of the Bulge

El Alamein

Arica Harbor

Valparaiso

Caspian Border

Noshahr Canals

In addition to these maps there will also be versions of them that are sized down and will generally be a better fit for small-scale game modes. These smaller variants only feature a few areas of the map instead of the entire thing. They include the following:

In terms of game modes players will be able to select from the following modes when creating their Battlefield Portal experience:

Conquest

Conquest Large

Rush

Free-For-All

Team Deathmatch

You'll also be able to adjust various settings to tweak how these game modes play out on your server. The developers have stated that ""In Rush and Conquest you'll be able to modify Game Time the Reinforcement Multiplier the number of Reinforcements removed per kill the Per-Squad Character limit (up to 4) and the rules for Squad Spawning.""

Team Deathmatch and Free-For-All will also have their own set of mode-specific sliders and toggles that you can adjust though we don't know any specifics right now.

Battlefield Portal: Factions and characters

Source: Electronic Arts (Image credit: Source: Electronic Arts)

Once you've picked out a map rotation and game mode the next step is choosing what factions and characters will be featured in your Battlefield Portal experience. Players can choose from the U.S. U.K. or Germany if selecting a faction from Battlefield 1942 while the Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 2042 variants of the U.S. and Russia will be available otherwise.

Note that the weapons vehicles and gadgets available to each team are dependent on which factions you select. You won't be able to give a Battlefield 3-era U.S. team World War II weapons for example.

Once you select the faction for each team you can then select which classes (or Battlefield 2042 Specialists) players can choose from each time they spawn.

Battlefield Portal: Weapons vehicles and more

Source: Electronic Arts (Image credit: Source: Electronic Arts)

With maps modes factions and characters chosen the only thing left to do is choose which weapons weapon attachments vehicles and gadgets players will have at their disposal.

At launch Battlefield Portal will support over 75 different weapons from Battlefield 1942 Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 2042. All of the weapons from older Battlefield games will be available for all players by default but many of Battlefield 2042's weapons need to be earned through rank-ups first. Because of this you'll need to allow players to spawn with at least one of Battlefield 2042's default weapons if one of the teams in your Battlefield Portal experience is using a faction from the Battlefield 2042 era.

Source: Electronic Arts (Image credit: Source: Electronic Arts)

Battlefield Portal also features a huge range of weapon attachments from both Battlefield 2042 and older Battlefield games that players can freely swap between as they play. When building your Battlefield Portal experience you have the option to place restrictions on which of these attachments are available. For example if you don't want anyone to be able to use a specific scope on their sniper rifles you can omit it from your server.

Note that while the Battlefield 2042 plus system is enabled by default you have the option of disabling it so that players have to swap their attachments on the Deploy Screen before they spawn.

Similar to how you can limit which weapons and weapon attachments are in play you also have the ability to allow or restrict specific types of vehicles in your server. For example you can make it so that only one type of vehicle is able to spawn or you can remove a vehicle type from the battlefield (looking at you mobile anti-aircraft).

Finally you can also choose which gadgets are available in each match. You can force everyone to use rocket launchers restrict the usage of grenade launchers and more.

Battlefield Portal: Gameplay settings

When treated with empagliflozin adults hospitalized for acute heart failure were 36% more likely to have a clinical benefit such as a reduction in all-cause mortality reduction in heart failure events or an improvement in heart failure symptoms.

Empagliflozin was originally primarily prescribed for treating type 2 diabetes and has recently been established as a novel heart failure medication effective for adults with chronic heart failure with and without type 2 diabetes.

Hospitalized adults taking empagliflozin had reduced rates of death or re-hospitalization due to acute heart failure compared to those who were given a placebo.

DALLAS Nov. 14 2021 — Adults treated with empagliflozin during hospitalization for acute heart failure experienced a clinical benefit such as increased survival lower risk of heart failure hospital readmission and an overall improvement in their quality of life according to late-breaking research presented today at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2021. The meeting is fully virtual Saturday November 13-Monday November 15 2021 and is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science for health care worldwide.

Empagliflozin is a medication originally used to treat people with type 2 diabetes and has recently become an established therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. The “Efficacy and Safety of Empagliflozin in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients: Main Results from the EMPULSE Trial” set out to determine whether this medication an SGLT2 inhibitor could help adults hospitalized for acute heart failure once their condition had stabilized. Heart failure is classified as “acute” when patients experience fluid build-up in the lungs and it requires urgent treatment and hospitalization. Once released from the hospital these patients are at a greater risk of death re-hospitalization and a lower quality of life.

“This is the first time we have really seen this type of medication work so effectively and safely in patients who were hospitalized for acute heart failure regardless of heart failure history or diabetes status” says the study’s lead author Adriaan Voors M.D. Ph.D. a cardiology professor at the University Medical Centre Groningen in The Netherlands. “These results may lead to earlier and more frequent treatment with empagliflozin which may improve the lives of more people with heart failure.”

530 adults with an average age of 68 were enrolled in the double-blind randomized controlled study of which 66% of participants were men. Participants had been hospitalized for acute heart failure however their conditions had to be stable before trial enrollment. The participants were divided into two equal groups: one group received a 90-day supply of 10 mg tablets of empagliflozin; the second group received a 90-day supply of placebo pills. They were instructed to take one tablet daily for 90 days.

Researchers defined improvements in the participants’ clinical outcome by the number of deaths; heart failure-related events (hospitalization urgent or unplanned visit due to heart failure); the time to the first heart failure event; or an improved score of at least five points on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire a 23-item self-administered survey used to measure the patient’s perception of their health status. The questionnaire uses a score of zero indicating bothersome daily symptoms to 100 indicating no symptoms within the past two weeks.

The study found:

Adults treated with empagliflozin were 36% more likely to experience a clinical benefit such as reduced all-cause mortality fewer heart failure events and an improvement in heart failure symptoms compared to the study participants who received the placebo.

Benefits included reduction in all-cause mortality (4.2% among adults treated with empagliflozin vs. 8.3% in those who received the placebo) reduced heart failure events (10.6% for participants taking empagliflozin vs. 14.7% for those who received the placebo) and a greater improvement in heart failure symptoms compared to those taking a placebo.

Participants experienced improvements in all-cause mortality heart failure events or an improvement in heart failure symptoms regardless of the type of heart failure or whether they had type 2 diabetes.

Participants taking empagliflozin had fewer serious heart failure events compared to those taking a placebo (32.3% vs. 43.6% respectively).

“Even though there are several medicines available to improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure very few medicines have proven to benefit patients with new acute onset of heart failure needing hospitalization” said Voors. “Our findings indicate that empagliflozin may help to improve outcomes for these patients without an increase in serious adverse events effects.”

Researchers note that a limitation to the study is a relatively small sample size.

Insulin is the basis of diabetes treatment essential for nine million people with type 1 diabetes who cannot make the hormone that controls the blood glucose level and 63 million people living with type 2 diabetes with limited or diminishing insulin.

It reduces the risk of kidney failure blindness and limb amputation – but half the people living with type-2 diabetes cannot afford it.

Around 90% of the market tightly controlled by three multinational companies: Novo Nordisk Eli Lilly and Sanofi according to the WHO report.

With a higher number of people today being diagnosed with diabetes the WHO has said that unaffordable insulin stakes of multi-billion dollar companies in manufacturing and supply and storage of the life-saving medicine are the main barriers of access to insulin.

According to the report released to coincide with World Diabetes Day on 14 November the use of insulin analogues or synthetic insulin has increased in high-and middle-income countries although it is significantly more expensive than human insulin.

Eighty percent of the 420 million people living with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries.Type-2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and access to affordable insulin and treatment is critical to their survival.

The 🆕 WHO report on global access to #insulin shows how a century after its discovery insulin remains inaccessible or unaffordable for many children and adults living with #diabetes around the 🌍🌎🌏. More here 👉https://t.co/kcaqh6tYO1 — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) November 12 2021

There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025. Currently over a million deaths each year are directly attributed to diabetes.

Lower-income countries bear the brunt

Insulin was discovered a century ago and the scientists then had sold its patent for a dollar to encourage its use for saving lives and not to make profits.

“Unfortunately that gesture of solidarity has been overtaken by a multi-billion-dollar business that has created vast access gaps. WHO is working with countries and manufacturers to close these gaps and expand access to this life-saving medicine for everyone who needs it” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

According to an article in the latest edition of The Lancet 25% of the seven million insulin patients in the United States a high-income country struggle with its high cost. Controversial insulin pricing practices including price-fixing has led to repeated market failures and continued unnecessary deaths in the U.S the Lancet article showed.

The pricing landscape is also uneven and reveals a lack of transparency in the way prices are set according to the report. The benefits of cheaper biosimilar insulins are not enjoyed by many countries including lower-income ones.

Although three-quarters of type-2 diabetics live outside North America and Europe yet these two regions accounted for 60% of revenue worth US$16.6 billion in 2020.

The report highlights that there are a “significant number of underserved markets” in lower-income countries and in the WHO African Region WHO South-East Asia Region and WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region.

The market for insulin and diabetic care has shifted from human insulin which can be produced at relatively low cost to more expensive analogues or synthetic insulins which are up to three times the cost. This has financially burdened lower-income countries.

One of the studies cited in the report showed that the lowest-paid unskilled government workers in the 13 low-and middle-income countries studied would need to spend six to eight days of wages to purchase 1000 IU insulin analogue doses in the public sector and 7–16 days’ wages to purchase the same in the private sector. To buy human insulin would need four days’ of wages n the public sector and two-four days in the private sector.

Expensive insulin is not the only problem

The report also highlighted the issue of access to devices and equipment for monitoring glucose levels. These are necessary for the detection of the disease and its complications and are responsible for shaping insulin use and diabetes care.

In low- middle-and upper middle-income countries less than 50 percent of primary health care facilities have the needed supplies for measuring glucose and the apparatus for screening diabetes complications.

Half to one-third of these tested devices were able to meet the standards of International Organization for Standardisation (ISO).

All forms of human insulin are no longer under patent protection. There is a lack of biosimilar human insulin approved by stringent regulatory authorities. Currently intellectual property barriers created by patents on devices and secondary patents have implications on pricing and affordability the report said.

So what is the solution?

WHO recommends the increased local production of insulin and associated devices to cater to the demands of the population without having to pay a premium to large conglomerates.

Locally produced quality-assured insulins and associated devices may also improve to scale up production and operational costs.

Currently case studies in six low-and middle-income countries showed that there was a cumulative mark-up of 8.7% to 565.8% for insulin depending on country and health system context.

The WHO report also highlights the need to improve the collection and publication of data on diagnostic pricing and usage of insulins and associated devices.

Pharma response – high prices and access barriers are due to a wider range of supply chain factors

In a response to the WHO report the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) took issue with the WHO claim that market dominance by the three largest insulin producers is the root cause of high prices in many low-and middle-income countries.

The IFPMA cited a recent report by the IQVIA Institute a pharma research firm which surveyed 32 low- and middle-income countries finding “no correlation between the three largest companies’ market shares” and the average cost of insulin per day adding that “other factors are evidently driving average costs per day for patients.”

The report also notes that six large global biosimilar manufacturers and 12 other manufacturers are operating in the countries surveyed.

“By way of example one innovative biopharma company Novo Nordisk has committed to supplying human insulin in 76 LMICs at a cost of $2-3/vial – which equates to 8 or 12 cents per day for LMIC country purchasers that are governments or UN/humanitarian organizations respectively said the IFPMA statement.

“And yet LMIC patients are still not getting access to insulin (or quality diabetes care) at the point of care. The reasons for this are complex and multi-faceted and do not fit a single narrative…. We recommend that all stakeholders acknowledge this reality ‘roll up our sleeves’ and tackle it in a constructive collaborative way while toning down the rhetoric.

“From an LMIC patient perspective organizations like PATH have highlighted the serious problems caused by massive pricing markups along the supply chain which impact patients at the point of care. We also recommend a greater focus on the essential devices required to measure a patient’s blood glucose and to administer insulin safely and effectively. These elements go hand in hand with supporting patients with quality diabetes care and (according to PATH and other organizations) often represent by far the greatest out-of-pocket cost for PLWDs.

Concluded the IFPMA: “The pricing landscape is also uneven and reveals a lack of transparency in the way prices are set according to the report. For example biosimilar insulins (essentially generic versions) could be more than 25% cheaper than the originator product but many countries including lower-income ones are not benefitting from this potential saving” it stated referring again to Novo Nordisk’s public commitment to sell insulin at $3/vial and $2/vial to UN/humanitarian organizations.

It called for more “innovative approaches and multi-stakeholder partnerships to address the various barriers to access…. which are often overlooked and poorly understood.

“These barriers include availability and pricing issues to ensure there are appropriate affordable products (insulin other medicines devices diagnostics) at the point of care but go far beyond this. They include for example regulatory approval and policy issues; supply chain issues including cold chain; inventory management and aggregation of products; and other holistic issues such as lack of capacity in health systems poor health literacy and empowerment of PLWDs and inadequate financing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhjcGxpdmUuY29tL3ZpZXcvdGljYWdyZWxvci1jYW4tYmUtZGlzY29udGludWVkLTItMy1kYXlzLXByaW9yLXRvLWNhYmctd2l0aG91dC1pbmNyZWFzaW5nLWJsZWVkaW5nLXJpc2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RAPID CABG: Ticagrelor Can Be Discontinued 2-3 Days Prior to CABG without Increasing Bleeding Risk,"Derek So MD

Results of the RAPID CABG study presented at the American Heart Association 2021 Scientific Sessions provide insight into the timing of ticagrelor discontinuation on bleeding risk among patients requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Although guidelines recommend stopping ticagrelor at least 3 or 5 days prior to surgery results from the 6-month follow-up of RAPID CABG indicate patients could discontinue treatment 2-3 days prior to surgery without increasing risk of early post-surgical bleeding and could also reduce the average length of hospital stay.

“We discovered no significant increase in bleeding when people had bypass surgery after 2-3 days of discontinuing ticagrelor” said lead study author Derek So MD a cardiologist at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and a professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada in a statement from the AHA. “These findings may be surprising based on the assumption that the presence of a strong blood thinner should predispose people to severe bleeding.”

So and a team of colleagues conducted the RAPID CABG trial with the aim of providing insight into the ideal window for discontinuing ticagrelor use as a result of guideline recommendations for timing of discontinuation creating a dilemma for clinicians concerned about the risk of recurrent events before surgery. Conducted in 2 centers in Canada the RAPID CABG randomized a population of 143 patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome to early CABG surgery or standard CABG.





For inclusion in the analysis patients needed to be at least 18 years of age and have undergone angiography for unstable angina non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or medically treated STEMI. Patients were excluded if they required stunting for culprit lesions requiring urgent surgery or required valve surgery.

The primary outcome of the trial was the incidence of class 3 or 4 perioperative bleeding. Perioperative bleeding was defined as a compsite of massive transfusion reoperation for bleeding and chest tube drainage exceeding 1000 mL in 12 hours. Secondary outcomes of interest were bleeding outcomes including BARC type 3 TIMI CABG-related bleeding and cardiac tamponade and ischemic outcomes including cardiovascular death stroke myocardial infarction refractory ischemia and unplanned revascularization.

The early surgery and delayed surgery group had similar baseline characteristics. The early group had a mean age of 64 years and 80.6% were men. The delayed surgery group had a mean age of 65.5 years and 83.1% were male.

Upon analysis 6-month results of the trial suggested the rate of severe or massive perioperative bleeding was 4.6% among the early surgery group and 5.2% among the delayed group. When assessing different forms of bleeding there were no statistically significant differences in TIMI CABG BARC type 4 or BARC type 5 bleeding between the study groups. Investigators pointed out 9% of patients in the delayed surgery group required surgery sooner than the planned date due to recurrent angina recurrent heart attack or ventricular arrhythmias. No patients randomized to the early surgery arm required intervention earlier than 2 days after discontinuing ticagrelor.

When assessing secondary outcomes results suggested a MACE outcome occurred within the first 6 months following surgery among 5.6% of those randomized to early CABG compared to 13.0% of those randomized to delayed surgery. Additionally the median length of stay from randomization to discharge was 9 (IQR 7-13) days among the early surgery group compared to 12 (IQR 10-15) days.

“Research such as this with people randomly allocated to early vs. delayed surgery is integral to assure cardiologists and surgeons that early surgery is safe especially since it conflicts with the present guidelines for people who are taking ticagrelor” So said. “Furthermore although our study was not large enough to evaluate whether early surgery protects people from suffering early recurrent heart attacks or angina it opens this hypothesis and may prompt future research in the area.”

Beacon Biosignals is applying artificial intelligence to these tests and the neurotechnology startup has found a ready market in pharmaceutical companies interested in assessing how their experimental brain therapies are working. Now Beacon Biosignals has something else: $27 million in financing.

The Boston company’s recently announced Series A round of funding was led by General Catalyst.

During an electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure electrodes are affixed to the patient’s scalp. Over a period of time typically up to an hour those electrodes capture electrical signals from the brain. By analyzing those signals clinicians can learn what’s happening with the brain. This insight can help diagnose brain and sleep disorders. However analyzing EEGs is labor intensive and interpretation of these tests can vary from one clinician to another. Beacon Biosignals says its technology can overcome the limitations of human analysis of EEGs.

Beacon Biosignals has assembled what it claims is one of the world’s largest clinical EEG databases. By applying its proprietary machine-learning algorithms to the database the company says it has identified neurobiomarkers—biological indicators that are associated with certain groups of patients drug activity and therapeutic efficacy.

In drug research Beacon Biosignals says its technology can analyze existing EEGs to glean insights about how a drug works as well as how the drug moves through the body and the body’s biological response to it. The technology can also be used to guide patient selection for clinical trials. Disclosed partner companies that use the Beacon Biosignals technology include Novartis Praxis Precision Medicines Cyclerion Therapeutics and Idorsia. The startup plans to use the new funding to pursue additional pharma and biotech partnerships.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

“We have already identified novel electrophysiologic signatures functionally linked to primary cognitive endpoints in Alzheimer’s disease” Jacob Donoghue Beacon Biosignals’ co-founder and CEO said in a prepared statement. “We’re further encouraged by the applications of our platform toward heterogenous psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder.”

Beacon Biosignals was founded two years ago by scientists and engineers from Harvard University and MIT. The startup is one of a growing number of companies bringing AI to the analysis of the data collected from diagnostic technologies and procedures. Iterative Scopes has developed technology that brings artificial intelligence to the analysis of endoscopy. In August that Cambridge Massachusetts-based company revealed a $30 million Series A round of funding and a research alliance with Eli Lilly.

Beacon Biosignals said its Series A round brings its funding total to $30 million to date. Other participants in the company’s new financing are Casdin Capital earlier seed investors and new angel investors that include Andy Beck the CEO of PathAI.

Pharmaceutical giant MSD which is part of the US group Merck is planning to develop a large solar farm to help power its plant in Ballydine Co Tipperary in an investment potentially worth over €5m.

MSD Ireland is seeking planning permission from Tipperary County Council to develop the 6.5 megawatts (MW) solar farm contributing 15pc of MSD Ballydine’s electrical energy and offsetting over 3.4 million kg of CO2 per annum.

The proposed project site covers an area of nearly 7.5 hectares near MSD’s Ballydine plant. Should the project be developed it could become one of Ireland’s largest solar farms.

In July pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly opened Ireland’s largest solar farm a 16-acre 5.6MW facility in Kinsale.

The Sunday Independent recently reported that developer Enerpower had applied for planning permission to expand the Kinsale project which Cork County Council approved subject to conditions.

The Eli Lilly project in Kinsale cost €5m to develop. Given this level of investment it is expected MSD could invest over €5m into its new project in Ballydine. The council recently said it required further information on the MSD project. Despite this however and subject to approval the construction of the solar farm is expected to start in early 2022.

According to planning documents the solar farm will connect directly into the existing MSD Ballydine plant.

In response to questions about the project an MSD spokesman said: “At MSD Ireland we are committed to ensuring we make a difference through environmental sustainability and view this as a key pillar of our corporate business objectives.

""Energy management is at the core of our sustainability programmes both at national and global level and we are very proud of the significant efficiencies we have been able to achieve across all our Irish sites in recent years.”

The spokesman added that it has a “vision” to become a carbon neutral operation and would continue to improve its energy performance across all its sites globally including in Ireland."

NEW ORLEANS — The New Orleans Fire Department responded to a two-alarm fire in Algiers Saturday.

At about 1:56 p.m. NOFD responded to a 911 call reporting the fire inside of a vacant building at 1348-50 Southlawn Blvd.

Firefighters said they arrived at the two-story wooden framed double family apartment complex at about 2:01 with fire on the second floor and spreading to the attic.

The second alarm was called at 2:04 after responders thought the second floor was occupied. They began to search for anyone that may have been trapped in the building.

Officials said that the building had been vacant since Hurricane Ida so there was no power to the apartments. Investigations show that the fire started on the second floor in between both apartments.

The blaze was under control by 2:54 with the help of 16 NOFD units and 44 firefighters along with the help of NOPD and Entergy.",,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile Disney became the latest global corporation to announce its metaverse plans including a scheme for a virtual theme park. It is clear that the metaverse is a big business opportunity.

Despite a few recent big deals including a $1bn fundraise by Fortnite-maker Epic earlier this year and a $93m funding round by metaverse world-maker The Sandbox most investors are still deciding which companies are worth backing in this nascent sector.

Many of the metaverse funding rounds so far have been seed and Series A but there is an expectation that big cheques will start to be written in the next 12 months.

We asked metaverse investors and founders for a sneak preview of the European metaverse companies they believe will be worth watching.

Helga Valfells founding partner at Crowberry Capital

Crowberry Capital operating out of Reykjavik and Copenhagen invests in seed and early-stage startups in the Nordics. Crowberry raised a $90m fund in September its second from investors including David Helgason founder of the game engine company Unity Technologies.

Aldin — Iceland

Iceland-based Aldin is building a fantasy franchise in virtual reality based around its best selling game Waltz of the Wizards. Aldin's ambition is to make an entertainment experience that makes fantasy feel like reality. Waltz of the Wizards is known for its unique features that showcase the potential of VR/AR as a medium.

Aldin is more than a gaming studio. The team has built and patented a number of tools to help them create the perfect metaverse. Aldin says that its patented presence analysis and interaction toolkit can help developers understand the complex relationship between user behaviour world design VR hardware setups and in-world movement.

Waltz of the Wizards continues to gain traction on Oculus Quest as well as other VR headsets and Aldin is working on numerous upcoming releases with next-generation features.

Fast Travel Games — Sweden

Fast Travel Games founded by gaming veterans Oskar Burman Kristoffer Bejaminsson and Erik Odeldahl has been releasing exceptionally immersive content of late. The Fast Track team is clearly embracing the engagement potential of the metaverse and it will be interesting to watch FTG travel even faster in the future. FTG recently launched a publishing fund for smaller VR creators which will undoubtedly help develop the VR indy scene

MakeReal — UK

This UK studio creates and publishes immersive educational software and has a platform for simulation training. Makereal's research shows that immersive education is significantly more effective than conventional methods. It has created content for customers including Vodafone Lloyds Banking Group Porsche McDonald’s and EDF Energy.

Varjo — Finland

The Finnish company launched in 2016 makes VR headsets that can follow the gaze of the user so-called “human-eye resolution” which makes it easier to function in virtual reality and see small details. Designers and engineers at car manufacturers like Volvo Audi and Kia use the headsets to design prototype vehicles and Boeing uses the headsets for training pilots.

Varjo raised a $54m Series C funding round in 2020 from investors including Atomico EQT Ventures and Volvo Cars Tech Fund.

Gleechi — Sweden

The Stockholm-based startup launched in 2014 has developed a technology called VirtualGrasp which enables a more natural hand interaction within virtual reality. Users can for example manipulate complex objects such as tools.

Gleechi has partnerships with companies like Siemens Energy Scania and Saab Aeronautics to develop virtual training programmes. It raised a €2.5m funding round from the European Innovation Council in April.

Olivier Martret principal Serena

Serena is a Paris-based firm that invests across multiple industries but with a special affinity for deeptech enterprise software marketplaces and entertainment. It will invest in seed to Series B rounds with cheque sizes ranging from €200K to €15m for a first ticket. Serena invested in Powder earlier this year.

In investing in the metaverse I am looking at three particular things:

1/ The storytelling — by definition a metaverse is the place of all possibilities. I’m always challenging the founders on how they will attract players and put them first. They need to show strong stories/reasons/mechanics that will entice players get them to stay and bring friends.

2/ How they are building the community and how users can create their own content.

3/ The infrastructure side — is the technological backbone strong enough to support the potential growth of the community? Tech debt will be hard to catch up after the launch.

The companies I'm watching fall into two categories the first of which is products with social mechanics at their centre.

Powder — France

French startup Powder wants to be the “camera of the metaverse"". It uses video recording and artificial intelligence to detect and capture a player’s game highlights automatically and share these with other players on the network. It raised a $14m Series A round in February led by Serena.

The second category of startups is those working on the tech layer for games either improving the in-game experience or developing no-code platforms to allow gamers to develop their own games.

Hiber — Sweden

This Gothenburg Sweden-based social gaming platform allows anyone to create immersive worlds experiences and games on their mobile phones with no coding skills required. It is a competitor to platforms like Minecraft and Roblox and its USP is its no-code ease of use. Hiber also recognised early on that users didn’t want to just play games — they might build anything from a virtual library to a memorial for a favourite pet and share it.

The company raised a $15m Series A round in June led by EQT Ventures.

Voxowl — France

A French video games startup developing a game called Particubes where users can build share and play multi-user experiences all made out of cubes (visually quite similar to Roblox and Minecraft). The Particubes games is in alpha testing at the moment.

A Stockholm-based startup developing a mobile-first social communications platform that will allow anyone to create customised virtual spaces either to hang in with friends or to offer as experiences to the public. The company is led by Swedish cofounders Joachim Hedenius (cofounder and former chief technology officer of healthtech Kry/Livi) and Leo Nilsson (former chief product officer of iZettle and entrepreneur-in-residence at Creandum). It raised a €2.9m seed round led by Creandum in July.

Antoine Moyroud Venture Lead at EQT Ventures

EQT Ventures is a Swedish multi-stage sector-agnostic fund which makes equity investments from €1m to €75m in startups and scaleups across Europe and the US. It has invested in a number of metaverse companies including Varjo and Moralis.

Moralis — Sweden

A blockchain development platform powering decentralised apps (dApps) Moralis is building core infrastructure for game developers to embed NFT and blockchain mechanics into their virtual worlds and games. A recent collaboration was with Polymon World.

For a long time now gaming has paved the way for digital ownership (just look at Steam) and visions of the metaverse typically rest on gaming-style virtual environments with decentralised digital ownership.

One of the biggest barriers to widespread dApps adoption is the lack of development tools. Developers waste a lot of time and money implementing basic dApp features which leads to long development cycles. We are so early in the metaverse that many of the core infrastructure tools simply aren't there.

Moralis allows anyone with basic knowledge of Javascript to build and host cross-chain dApps. Many are web-developers who never programmed dApps before discovering Moralis. By enabling more people to build its core infrastructure Moralis helps make the metaverse more of a reality.

The Moralis team will soon release their native C# software development kit which will enable developers to build and support the largest platforms natively — on the web iOS and Android.

Ready Player Me — Estonia

This Estonian company creates full-body characters for the metaverse allowing people to port their avatars across different platforms and games. The team is building a network across multiple virtual worlds where someone’s digital identity is decoupled from their so-called real-life identity. This core principle of decentralisation is close to the traditional gaming ecosystems and the pseudonymity of the blockchain.

Condense Reality — UK

This UK startup offers developers and event organisers the rails to build large-scale live virtual events within virtual worlds through Unity and Unreal. This means that players could soon experience live footage embedded into the likes of Fortnite Roblox or the world's future emerging entertainment winners.

The Sandbox — Argentina but with a French link

This startup founded by Frenchman Sebastien Borget and since acquired by Animoca Brands is spearheading one of the common metaverse principles of socialising and engaging in economies. The Sandbox is building a digital world where players from different games and ecosystems can converge and share a common digital space. It's exciting to think about what bringing different games brands and fan ecosystems under one roof could lead to.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He founded an organization called Tenants Together and helped to lead the successful initiative to preserve rent control in the State of California. He now serves as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors where he was the first democratic socialist elected in 40 years. Lately he has been the subject of a critical article in the San Francisco Chronicle in which he was accused of blocking much-needed affordable housing for the city. He recently joined Current Affairs editor in chief Nathan J. Robinson on the Current Affairs podcast to discuss the housing crisis in his city the practical means of solving it and the reason he’s taking so much flak from a group calling itself the “YIMBYs.”

The interview transcript has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.

Robinson

You are—I believe this has been quantitatively measured—the furthest left member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. There’s a chart showing this?

Preston

There is a chart and I think when it was published they thought it was going to be viewed as an insult. And I was thrilled to see documentation of my position.

Robinson

By a pretty wide margin. People who are not familiar with San Francisco might think “Well you’d have to be really far left to be on the left in San Francisco” but as we’ll discuss that’s not necessarily the case.

I want to begin with the housing situation in San Francisco. My picture as a non-San Franciscan who has not set foot in the city for many years is of a place where the rent is too damn high. It’s a gentrifying city a city where homelessness is out of control. And the class divide of the United States can really be seen in its most brutal form there. Is that a caricatured picture of San Francisco and its housing situation at the moment? How accurate is that?

Preston

That’s pretty accurate. We have extreme inequity in San Francisco. Obviously the tech industry has led a big boom in the local economy. The real estate industry has done everything it can to keep fueling the real estate speculation here. And so prices have gone up up and away. We have some state laws in California that have stopped us from adopting stronger protections for tenants and stronger protections against runaway rents. Those are the laws I’ve been battling against for the last 20 years at the state level. We’ve got housing that is completely unaffordable to low-income people or working-class people in the city of San Francisco. Any new units that come online at the market price are only affordable to wealthy folks or to real estate investors. We just had a report on the committee that I’m the Vice Chair of—the Land Use Committee. We just had a report on Monday from a broad coalition of affordable housing advocates. Almost the entire labor community and UC Berkeley professors worked for two years looking at our housing situation. What they found was that 7% of workers in the city and county of San Francisco can actually afford the median cost of housing here. So it is not a caricature. But we have extreme inequity high homelessness numbers and a lot of people who aren’t reflected in those numbers because they leave. If they’re displaced from their rent control home there’s no way they’re going to afford another place in San Francisco.

Robinson

What are the biggest obstacles to changing this? The New York Times just had this report on the hypocrisy of blue states which I liked because when you look at some of the bluest cities in America the most heavily Democratic they are places where wealth inequality is just out of control. And they pose a very serious question which is: why do places where a large majority of the people describe themselves as liberal-minded people who believe in affordable housing and don’t like having a homelessness crisis–why is it that these places can’t solve these problems? And what would you attribute that to in San Francisco in particular?

Preston

It’s an over reliance on a market that thrives on inequality. What certainly has earned me the ire of the local Chronicle and this so-called YIMBY movement—

Robinson

…which we will discuss…

Preston

…is that they’re market fundamentalists. And they believe that simply creating more housing for rich people will ultimately trickle down to people who aren’t rich—maybe in a decade maybe 50 years. I don’t know when they expect that to happen. For all the talk in this city even a city that’s more progressive on some issues for all the talk when it comes down to who our economy caters to—not just in housing but especially in housing—it caters to the wealthy. It is a struggle to do real progressive taxation. We have growing wealth inequality and we still have even folks who describe themselves as left liberal progressive whatever label you want to put on it who are still primarily voting to give more power to the very market that has created the inequality in the first place. I was more of a believer in these markets earlier in my career. I thought well-regulated capitalism maybe we could get there. I thought we could control the rents a bit and have some protections in place. Maybe this can work if we just make developers do a handful of affordable units when they build and maybe we’ll get there somehow. And decades later you know it just doesn’t work. And until we actually admit that and look at non-market solutions—like social housing and things that can actually reverse these trends—we’re just gonna get more of the same.

Robinson

So when you say non-market solutions what would it actually take to make San Francisco a livable city for the working class? What are the main points of change that you think it needs?

Preston

Well I think the city and government has to be in the business of actually creating housing for people that is not for profit right? We have a long history—now over half a century—of active disinvestment at the federal state and local level in affordable housing and public housing. There’s a renewed movement I think to look at municipal housing and other forms of government-owned housing. But at the end of the day there’s lots of different types of social housing: there’s municipal housing there’s community land trust there’s limited equity co-ops there’s below-market rental units in new construction there’s lots of ways to get there. But all of them are off the speculative market. They are not created owned operated or sold for a profit. And that’s the only kind of housing in an expensive city like San Francisco or a place like New York or Los Angeles—I mean that’s the only kind of housing that’s actually going to house low-income and working-class folks. And it may not be like that everywhere in the country. You may be able to create a market rate unit in a small city that’s not San Francisco and maybe a teacher can afford that market rate unit right? It’s not one-size-fits-all. But I can just tell you—through the lens of the market I know best and where I served the residents of my district—that it is a pipe dream to think that you’re ever going to build market rate housing in San Francisco that a school teacher a janitor or any working-class folks are going to be able to afford.

Robinson

Is that because it would just take such a colossal amount of new housing because a lot of what would be built is just going to be bought up and held as investment property? You know it’s funny. I live in the French Quarter of New Orleans which is similar to parts of San Francisco in that it’s a quaint historic district and I look out my window at night and see no lights in the other windows because so many of the properties are so valuable that they are just held by people as assets. If you built 10% more of them it would just be 10% more that were being held as assets without ever actually being lived in by the people of New Orleans.

Preston

I think that’s certainly a factor here. We commissioned a report—and we’re expecting to announce it fairly soon—from the budget legislative analysts looking at vacancies in San Francisco. And there are a ton of vacancies. A lot of newly constructed places like these luxury condos that sit particularly in the South of Market neighborhood in San Francisco just sit empty and it’s exactly as you’re describing. You can see at night what’s lit up and what isn’t. These half-empty buildings are investments. I’ve long been a champion of doing a vacancy tax like Vancouver did. Again the same critics and industry folks will oppose that even as they claim to be in favor of housing and homes and so forth. But we have to do that. A lot of investors are just buying multiple properties. They sit on them for a while and they resell them and it’s a good investment. And that’s what a lot of the new construction ends up being. It’s two things to answer your question of why doesn’t it work to just build more market rate housing? Why does that not actually result in greater housing equity in a city like San Francisco? It’s two things. It’s that a lot of these sit vacant and are investments that aren’t intended for people to live in anyway. And the more vulnerable low-income communities are the ones being targeted for that kind of development. And what’s being developed is not just more units in a vacuum. It’s units that gentrify the neighborhood drive up the prices in those neighborhoods and drive people out of those communities. And that’s why you see so many people who are organizing with people of color and vulnerable communities in San Francisco all in unison opposing again and again the strategy of just building more and more luxury housing. I don’t know any vulnerable groups in the city that subscribe to that approach.

Robinson

If you have an apartment building with 50 units occupied by working-class tenants and it’s demolished and they build something that has 100 units but it’s 100 people from Palo Alto who come and move in you have the aggregate number of total units increased—you say we’ve got more housing—but you’ve actually managed to displace more working-class people from the city in the process.

Preston

That’s right. And we also have these evictions here called Ellis Act. The Ellis Act lets any property owner go out of the rental business. That’s the idea. So what happens is they evict everyone in the entire building and say they’re going out of the rental business. And then they find a loophole where since they’re going out of the rental business they can’t turn around and rent it. So what they can do is sell off the interest in these high-end co-ops and condos basically. So you have entire buildings in San Francisco that are emptied out of tenants many of whom are low-income long-term rent control tenants to be replaced directly by high-income folks come in who can for one or two million bucks buy a condo or tenancy in common so that displacement has been happening across the city. Our history in San Francisco is completely shameful—from the redevelopment era in which huge numbers of African American tenants were driven out of the city their homes demolished all the way through to waves of evictions during the different booms of the dot coms and all the way through the present. The constant there is we’ve always allowed greed and real estate speculation to dominate the policies.

Robinson

I read a study a while back about rent control in San Francisco and I seem to recall that one of the findings is while the free market types always say that the problem with rent control is that it’s going to restrict supply the finding in San Francisco was that rent control worked and the only reason that it restricted supply was because of those condo conversions. So the only reason that it would be that that rent control caused fewer units to be available to people was because you happen to have a loophole that incentivized the owners of buildings to take units off the market. But if you didn’t have that loophole then rent control wouldn’t have that negative effect.

Preston

Right. It’s always the loopholes around rent control that are used to attack rent control. There’s just such a disconnect between working-class folks and the pundits on rent control right? You go to all these economics departments and you can find lots of professors who are going to tell you how rent controls are bad and distort the market. A few of them will give you some support. But generally you go and talk to people who are living in rent-controlled apartments or live in San Francisco where there would be virtually no working-class left in San Francisco were it not for rent control. San Francisco has a reputation as a progressive city. Yet this would just be a 98% playground for the rich were it not for rent control. Before I was in office I ran a statewide tenant rights organization Tenants Together. We formed at the time when there was a ballot measure to abolish rent control in California. And we crushed it at the polls. The voters of California not just in the big cities voted by a 22-point margin not to abolish rent control. People love rent control because it’s the only thing standing between them and a greedy landlord and displacement from their homes. Even the studies from the economics professors who attack rent control always have to acknowledge in all those studies how effective rent control is in stabilizing housing for seniors disabled folks and the most vulnerable folks even as they attack it on theoretical grounds. They still acknowledge that it works to do what it’s supposed to do which is to stabilize people in their homes.

Robinson

There’s a great piece of testimony by the economist J.W. Mason who talks about how rent control is kind of like the minimum wage in that the previous neoclassical consensus that it was definitely bad has been shaken in recent years in economics. But it’s also the case that a study of supply and demand really leaves out the fact that with non rent-controlled housing what we are talking about is the ability of a landlord to tell someone who has been in a building for 30 or 40 years—even someone whose whole life has been invested in this place but who hasn’t actually developed ownership because we don’t give people ownership rights purely by having paid all of their income for decades to live in a place—to all of a sudden leave everything they know and find somewhere else to live. Think about the unquantifiable psychological effect of that on an elderly or disabled person. Not having rent control is just such an act of wanton cruelty. There’s no study in which you can even capture that.

Preston

It’s true. There’s been this coordinated attack on rent control over the years. But when you actually frame it in terms of its impact as you just did people overwhelmingly support it. When I was running our statewide tenant rights organization Tenants Together we would go into fairly conservative communities to form new tenant unions helping folks to go to their city councils and adopt rent control. And it was so interesting. We would meet with these conservative council members in the Central Valley of California—you know Republican strongholds—and we’d meet with the legislators there and we’d ask them their opinion on rent control. They’d totally oppose it. Absolutely. It’s terrible; it’s bad for the economy. But then you ask them the questions you just asked. “Do you believe that a landlord should be allowed to double the rent on a tenant who’s lived in their home for a decade?” They’d say “No of course not.” People actually think it’s illegal to do these things—to evict someone for no reason or to double their rent. So they actually agree with the entire policy even the most conservative folks and even the folks who claim to be against rent control.

I’ve been doing this for a while—over 20 years—and when I started there was more controversy around rent control. In California people seem to have given up trying to attack and eliminate rent control. People look at cities like San Francisco. And as I said before without rent control there’d be virtually no working-class people living in San Francisco. Everyone would be commuting from hours away. So I think the ship has sailed on that. But attacks on rent control are more subtle because you put that on the ballot in San Francisco and rent control is going to win every time.

Robinson

I want to ask you about the YIMBY movement which you mentioned earlier. For members of our audience who are unfamiliar what is the YIMBY “movement”? I’m gonna use the word “movement” in quotes.

Preston

Yes I will definitely put it in quotes. I certainly have seen my share of movements and been part of them. I think there’s certainly a movement on Twitter that the YIMBYs inspire. I haven’t seen much of it out in the real world. It’s essentially the developers and real estate speculators. Within the last seven or eight years there has been this “yes in my backyard” effort known as YIMBY. They have cleverly defined anyone who does not accept every proposed housing development with no changes and at the moment it is announced as a NIMBY [“not in my backyard”]. I’ve always thought of NIMBYs as people who actually oppose affordable housing—classist folks often racist folks who don’t want homeless people or low-income folks or people of color living in their neighborhoods. That was always my understanding of NIMBY. The so-called YIMBY folks have redefined a “NIMBY” to be anyone that doesn’t just jump when the real estate industry says jump and they’ve become a very toxic force. They have been attacking me for years attacking pretty much anyone who demands things that actually help a community as part of development—either investments in transit or investments in affordable housing. They have evolved over the years into what is now just a complete disinformation campaign. And that’s what you see.

Robinson

One thing worth noting is that it’s quite insidious in the way that it presents itself. I wrote an article trying to expose some of this called “The only thing worse than a NIMBY is a YIMBY.” I denounced both NIMBYs and YIMBYs and one of their supporters said well there’s a whole other category called the “left NIMBY” and that I’m an exemplar of what’s called the “left NIMBY.” They implied that there’s something racist about it. There’s this strange use of rhetoric which is supposedly pro-affordable housing pro-public—constantly emphasizing its progressive bona fides. I mean you’ve said that it’s basically an arm of the developers’ lobby which may be true. But it certainly takes great pains to try to present itself as something that is not in the pocket of developers. If you accuse this so-called movement of being hardcore free-market people they will vigorously protest that characterization. So it’s a little clever in the way it presents itself.

Preston

It is. They dress it up in the language of equity. The truth really comes out when you look at the actual positions. People can tweet all they want about their positions. But when you look at ballot measures—things where you have to take a position—they will 100% side with the money in the real estate industry and they will ruthlessly attack opponents using disinformation campaigns. They will attack anyone who doesn’t further the interests of big real estate capital. It’s gotten to the point that when I ran for election these folks were spreading flyers all around my district saying that I was a serial evictor who had evicted hundreds of low-income tenants. I’ve never evicted anyone in my life. I’ve been an eviction defense lawyer for 20 years. So that’s the level of discourse.

I mean and it’s really sad because I think that there are affordable housing advocates who for years have been advocating for some of the positions that YIMBY folks take. For example they will go into exclusionary rich communities or suburban communities and argue that there should be apartment buildings instead of single-family homes in new construction. That’s a long standing position that groups like the Western Center on Law and Poverty and folks like myself have been championing for a long time and believe in and it’s a shame they don’t just stick with this. YIMBYs could be partners in that fight. Instead what they’ve done is to weaponize that legitimate issue to use those same arguments to attack communities of color and working-class communities in dense expensive cities and to do so at all costs and to try to use that same language of equity when all they’re doing is trying to maximize real estate profits. It’s sad sometimes to see folks who are in it for good reasons. They actually think they’re taking on exclusionary single family zoning or something like that. Most of those folks though—if they’re thoughtful—flee the YIMBY movement once they realize what it’s really about.

Robinson

The precipitating factor behind my wanting to talk to you was that there has been in the last week a new front in the campaign in particular by the SF YIMBY group which has put out this report. I use the word report in quotes. They put out a website called “Dean Preston’s Housing Graveyard” which even features the tombstones of houses that you have personally killed. It was covered in a sympathetic piece in the San Francisco Chronicle. It’s got a heavy presence on Twitter. The argument here is that you have killed a lot of affordable housing. I see: “Preston has denied housing to 12 people a day since he took office. He must resign so that a responsible public servant can take his place.” “Dean Preston is the worst politician in San Francisco. He is single-mindedly focused on making sure the city builds no new housing of any kind.” Can you tell me—trying to be charitable to their argument—what their argument against you is that you are denying housing to people?

Preston

I’m not sure I’m in a charitable mood with these folks right now because this hit piece is so out there and just wrong on the facts. There are things we could actually debate around such as the role of market rate housing in San Francisco. When is it good? When is it not? This thing is just wild. I published my response called “Alice in YIMBY Land” because you know this stuff is just made up. You can go item by item—it’s a complete disinformation campaign.

Now to be charitable—and to set aside the fact that most of it is just complete garbage and made-up—there is this concept that I think drives the YIMBYs and Heather Knight who’s a YIMBY reporter for The Chronicle who amplified their work of fiction as if it was fact. And I think the idea is that anything you do to require anything of a developer is itself a sin. And means that you oppose everything the developers are doing. So I’ll give you an example. One of the things in their housing report or whatever you want to call it I put that in quotes is that I opposed a project that was being built on Geary Boulevard just outside my district. I was the lone dissenting vote. When the developer who had already gotten permission to build years ago came back to the board of supervisors they said we actually don’t want to build the affordable units that we promised to build and that your whole rezoning was based on we don’t want to build those in the project. So my vote there didn’t stop a single unit of housing same number before with or without my vote if I had one makes no difference. But the fact is that I’m saying to a developer: you can’t just do what you want here. And in fact you have to do what you promised which is build affordable units on site. It shows up in their silly report as like however many units that building was that I opposed all those units. This is the level of—I hate to insult elementary school kids—but this is like an elementary school level report at best. We can talk about the tremendous body of work that my office has been doing to tax the rich and generate hundreds of millions of dollars for social housing in San Francisco. None of that shows up in this absurd absurd report. So I think I’m being charitable when I just call it absurd.

Robinson

I do want to stop calling it a report. This is one of the tactics that right-wing fake think tanks use. They put out things that they call “reports” so that then they can say oh a report or a study was done. And it says this or that. And they build a website that claims that a lot of people who would have houses in San Francisco do not have houses because of your actions.

Personally I think one of the key points underlying what you’re saying is that people need to understand-and correct me if this is an incorrect characterization—that in the process of some building being proposed for development you have these levers given your position on the Board of Supervisors and what you are able to do is use the threat of blocking to try and exact concessions from developers. And that is actually quite important. If we use pure free market theory a developer’s interest is in putting no affordable units in any building ever. Why would they ever want to do that unless they had to? So part of what you are doing—and what is being then spun against you as blocking housing—is trying to find ways to use the power that you possess to exact concessions that are actually going to help people from developers.

Preston

That’s exactly right. It’s not only what I’ve done in office. It’s what I’ve done for years. I was among the folks leading the effort to pass a ballot measure that required a minimum percentage of affordable units when developers build private housing. That whole concept is opposed by YIMBYs. Their founder in San Francisco is on record saying that she opposes any inclusionary housing requirement. In other words when developers build luxury housing they should not have to pay a single cent or build a single unit that is not at that market luxury rate. So that’s her position and I’m on the opposite extreme. My view is I’m happy to have the project built and I want to make sure we don’t leave anything off the table. I want to get as much affordable housing as I can. My consistent record is always pushing for that highest level of affordability.

The irony here is that the YIMBYs are even worse than the developers. I work with the developers and deal with them all the time. They’re trying to get projects through. And they know when they come to my office—we approved a big one down at 98 Franklin. That was totally omitted from the report which says that I approved zero units of housing when I approved this major residential tower in my district. The developers knew if they wanted my support they ended up promising—and they’re going to deliver—25% of the units at affordable levels for working-class folks in the city or for low-income folks as well as millions of dollars additionally in funds for affordable housing. Is that perfect? No. I see my role as advocating on the behalf of the community to get as much as possible from developers in the private market. Even then when I can do it it’s not the most satisfying stuff. I’d rather be building 100% affordable housing I’d rather be doing social housing all the things that we won at the ballot you know? But we still have the private market stuff that is part of the ecosystem here and we’ve got to deal with it. And we’ve got to make sure we’re getting as much as possible from the developers as we can.

Robinson

This website implies at various points that you represent a rich district and that you’re trying to do the bidding of landlords essentially rich NIMBYs who don’t want any housing built.

So what your constituents should know is that when you come out against or conditionally against some kind of project what you’re really trying to do is to set terms and conditions that developers are going to have to meet if they want to move forward. In the chess match between you and developers what developers are going to come back and do and what this YIMBY astroturf movement is going to come back and do is say “Aha your Board of Supervisors member is in the pocket of landlords. He doesn’t want to build any housing.” But what’s actually going on is a fight over the conditions under which something will move forward.

Preston

I think that’s accurate. I will just say that it is always amusing when someone says I’m in the pockets of landlords or the wealthy real estate industry because those folks have put millions of dollars into fighting to keep me out of office. I do take some comfort in knowing that the level of disinformation and attacks on me are very much signs of how we have been able to move the needle in terms of taxing the very wealthy and in terms of trying to get the focus on affordable housing and social housing. I have sparred with landlords and the California Association of Realtors. These folks did hit piece after hit piece. They’ve backed my opponent in every election. They’ve backed the opposition to every ballot measure that I’ve worked on. The reality is that they agree 100% with these YIMBYs. There’s no daylight between the developers landlords billionaires and YIMBYs in San Francisco. When you look at my district and people make comments about my district it is one of the most dense districts in the city and nationally it’s a very dense district. It’s a very diverse district with more well-off areas as well as some of the most low-income areas of the city. And folks knew what they were getting with me. They knew they were getting a democratic socialist who was not going to be out there fighting to maximize luxury housing. And so I am doing what I said I would do. Frankly this is off political opponents and certainly it has been fueling the attacks that as I say have been ratcheted up because we keep winning because the people of San Francisco are down with what we’ve done—we doubled the transfer tax. We charge 6%—one of the highest in the nation—when someone sells a $10 million property. These real estate investors are paying huge amounts of money because I wrote a ballot measure and we won it despite the efforts to outspend us twenty to one and we are raising 150 to $200 million a year for affordable social housing the first social housing money generated in San Francisco in generations. It’s like that’s what they and the YIMBYs opposed. They opposed or stayed silent every step of the way. And that’s what they’re trying to stop. So it’s less about me than that movement that is demanding more from the rich and demanding affordable housing.

Robinson

Can I give you a chance to respond to these pieces of legislation they say that you oppose that would have helped make housing affordable? They cite SB 35 the streamlined Affordable Housing Act which they say made it harder for San Francisco to say no to proposed housing that’s at least 50% affordable and led San Francisco to build thousands of affordable homes of the kind Preston says he supports. They say “opposing Home SF the affordable housing density program” which “allows for additional housing to be built if it contains affordable homes.” And they cite SB 50 which allows new dense housing near transit. I assume the story is far more complicated. I don’t understand California very well. So could you tell me what is being massaged here?

Preston

Sure. Yeah. Those bills are complex but the story is very very simple. When I worked at Tenants Together we worked on state legislation. I stood with a coalition of every tenant group in the state local grassroots POC-led groups transit equity groups and others demanding amendments to these state laws some of which were incorporated and some of which were not. We told Senator Wiener who was the champion of these that we love this streamlining. But can we apply it to just affordable housing? Why are we doing this giveaway to the market rate housing? We urged higher requirements of affordable housing stronger protections against displacement and demolitions. So pieces of that advocacy ended up in the bill. And what they’re saying again is the YIMBY test. Did I accept the developer’s written bill the moment it was introduced? Anything short of that is blocking the housing right? So this is just totally make-believe. It’s absolutely absurd that standing shoulder to shoulder with vulnerable communities who are trying to prevent gentrification and displacement and demolition of their homes and fight for more affordable housing that standing with those folks and seeking to improve state legislation is somehow an act of anti-housing or whatever they want to call it. Each bill you can pick apart and go through but that’s the bottom line. All these things are things I sought amendments and improvements to.

Robinson

What’s the thing with the hospital? They say: “Did you know that Preston identifies as socialist but opposed the expansion of a public hospital during a pandemic?”

Preston

Same story. So UCSF is doing a major hospital expansion. I’ve certainly never opposed the expansion. When I came into office I actually urged the city to do an MOU between the hospital which is like a state agency and the city to guarantee affordable housing levels. A deal was worked out that wasn’t good enough. I worked with the hospital workers who couldn’t afford any of the housing that was going to be built with this hospital to argue that there should be more affordable housing as part of this plan. And what we did–this is their whole act this is the absurdity here–this is a multi-year prop or project. UC was going to the state regents which actually controls UCSF. We said—we did a resolution at the board that I authored—that it should wait till their next meeting because we needed stronger affordable housing commitment transit investments in public transit to support this project. And the agreement had no enforceability. Those were the three issues I raised. As a result of my advocacy within a week UCSF actually agreed to improve the affordability and provide more housing for the workers of the hospital. And we also confirmed on the record with UCSF that the short delay in presenting this to the regents would have zero impact on the construction timeline for the hospital or the housing. Zero impact. So literally that’s their example that I blocked all those housing units by seeking to have the regents wait until their next meeting so that we could nail down the enforceability transit investments and affordable housing. It’s the same story. It really is a story.

Robinson

I appreciate your diving into the details because I want our readers and our listeners to understand: in every city there are going to be these kinds of disinformation campaigns. And it’s really important because the arguments they make—if you don’t know the actual facts—can be superficially persuasive. All of this is very well put together. We can say that they are “transparently” absurd but they’re not in fact transparently absurd if you don’t know the truth and if the truth isn’t available—I mean this appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle. I was mentioning to you before the recording that this is now all over your Wikipedia entry because they seem to have very diligent Wikipedia editors the YIMBYs. I do think it’s really important to learn how to dissect this stuff.

Finally are there any lessons from your long fight as a tenant rights advocate that you had advice you’d have for people fighting this same fight in other cities around the country that have some of the same problems?

Preston

You have to be organized with people directly and not assume that what occurs on social media is actually the dominant views of communities. And there’s a ton of people who really aren’t following the back and forth on Twitter the libertarian-YIMBY-Twitter stuff. What we’ve seen in San Francisco is that at the polls when it comes to actual voters and people in our city people get it people don’t buy the idea that luxury multimillion dollar investment home housing is the answer to our problems. In San Francisco the YIMBYs have lost every candidate that they’ve run and back. Everyone loses. Their ballot measures get crushed at the polls. And the only power that they have politically is when they get appointed to things by one of the only politicians that sides with them nowadays which is the mayor of San Francisco which has its own story. So they’ll get an occasional appointment there. So it’s about meeting folks and dealing with their real world issues. Going to meetings in person or Zoom and engaging on these issues. People aren’t fooled so easily. And so some of these cute sleight-of-hand tricks that do work in communities nationally. I mean hell–Fox News and Tucker Carlson make a living off this stuff right? But at least in progressive cities I don’t think people are fooled that easily. And I would just urge folks to keep doing the work and meeting folks in the real world not necessarily on housing Twitter.

Robinson

If you haven’t been the subject of a Fox News profile yet I would give it five minutes I’m sure they’re—

Preston

I’m sure it’s coming. There’s always going to be folks who are organizing to preserve the status quo and preserve profits. I think what’s sad about this whole report this last week was seeing the Chronicle not just publish this report but from a journalistic integrity point of view to not do an ounce of actual fact-checking and investigation and analysis and simply publish this thing as if it’s something—and again while ignoring a report that came out days later from housing advocates the labor community and UC Berkeley researchers which just tells the exact opposite story and talks about the actual housing needs. It’s sad to see a major paper do this and that we’re in the state of our discourse on these things where a major paper would just regurgitate this stuff.

Robinson

Yeah. That really alarmed me. I saw some people I moderately respect parroting these claims as if they were the result of a real economic study and then I opened that web page and it’s just the cheapest kind of political propaganda.

Dean Preston of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors thank you so much for talking to me today.

via: AceShowbiz

Back in September (21) the “Orange Is the New Black” star confirmed she and filmmaker Robert Sweeting married nearly a year ago much to the surprise and delight of fans.

Speaking on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” on Thursday (11Nov21) the actress opened up on the couple’s big day and admitted she wanted to go public with her marriage ahead of the pair’s one-year anniversary was coming up.

“We were just taking the year to ourselves to enjoy the time and have some quiet time together and then we were having our anniversary come up” Uzo said.

She went on to share that she and Robert celebrated their anniversary in Tulum Mexico before revealing how they navigated wedding planning during the height of the COVID crisis

“A lot of Amazon and Etsy gets you through” Uzo laughed. “Just quietly and with a small group of course – our most loved and closest family and friends. It was awesome.”

“When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible” she gushed back then.

“For some of us it can feel like we spend our whole lives waiting for our special someone. My heart my love – I’m so happy my life started last year with you. You’re the best thing that ever happened to me.”

There are a few key themes I follow with most of my designs. Not all but most of these are some of the key giveaways that you’re looking at a curriegoat piece. I work a lot with symmetry I match a lot of my colours to my trainers I use mythical creatures and run them through the same theme. For example one of my most popular rug designs is an animal hide rug but it’s a mythical creature rather than real animal. Even though I’m using a different creature each time when you see a mythical hide rug you know it’s me!

I also don’t blend my colours when I’m painting or making rugs. This graphic style is inspired by a lot of the cartoons that I used to watch as a child and the games I used to play like The Powerpuff Girls and Samurai Jack. The illustrators always used clear lines of separation to show shadow and light which is also used a lot in anime.

A video game example is the legend of Zelda Windwaker. The technique they use is called ‘Cell Shading’. I don’t need to use all of these in every single piece but you’ll find at least two of them and everything I do.

Who (or what) are your main design inspirations?

My main inspiration is the story that I want to tell in the moment. Sometimes I’ll see things on social media or in fashion culture and it will remind me of an old story I want to retell. I started making furniture last year during the pandemic almost as a reaction to the fact that everybody was trapped in the house for a year. The stories I chose to tell were linked to our circumstances.

I made a table inspired by Sphinx and Greek mythology: the sphinx is a guardian and won’t let you leave unless you know the answer to a riddle. In a strange way this felt very similar to Covid. none of us would be free until we found vaccines or some way to control the impact of this disease. I also made work based on guardian lions which I’m sure you can tell by the name protect the inside of buildings which is where most of us were trapped for a very long time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZ2Vla3R5cmFudC5jb20vbmV3cy9ob2xpZGF5LWdpZnQtYWxlcnQtbGVnZW5kLW9mLXplbGRhLWFuZC1hbmltYWwtY3Jvc3NpbmctcGxheWluZy1jYXJkc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holiday Gift Alert LEGEND OF ZELDA and ANIMAL CROSSING Playing Cards — GeekTyrant,"Etsy store Artistic License Goods has created some truly beautiful playing cards inspired by The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing.

That means Celebrity's passengers can expect more sophisticated surroundings and an upscale vibe at relatively affordable prices.

Like the vessels themselves the line's cabins are well-appointed and elegant with modern touches that appeal to a slightly younger-than-average cruise demographic.

Learn what to expect from each room type before you book with our primer for those who are new to Celebrity.

Celebrity Cruises cabin primer

Celebrity Cruises' fleet of ships includes more than a dozen vessels that fall into four main categories: Millennium Class Solstice Class Edge Class and Galapagos Class. Ships in the first three classes share similarities in terms of their cabin offerings. The Galapagos-class vessels are much smaller and include a narrower selection of cabin types and amenities. Because of this the Galapagos Class will have its own section below; the other sections of this article do not apply to the Galapagos Class.

Although all of the ships' staterooms fall into the same general categories – insides oceanviews balconies and suites – the specific types of each vary across classes particularly with regard to the most expensive options.

Even at the most basic level nearly all accommodations include two twin beds that can be connected to form a king (most rooms) or queen; a desk and vanity area with a chair drawers and a phone; nightstands with drawer space and reading lights; a sofa or plush chair; a coffee table; an in-cabin bathroom with shampoo conditioner body wash and towels; a closet with shelves hanging space and bathrobes; a safe; a hair dryer; a television with a selection of movies and live TV as well as shipboard channels and the ability to check the daily schedule and your onboard bill; a mini-fridge; a selection of outlets including USB ports; and individual lighting and climate controls.

All cabins also come with the services of a room attendant who will tidy your digs up to two times daily. All passengers also have access to 24-hour room service which carries a fee of $9.95 per order plus an 18% auto-gratuity.

Solo balcony cabin on Celebrity Edge. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Edge)

Across the fleet all ships offer connecting rooms with some of the largest suites joining to sleep up to 10 people. The line also features special accommodations for solo cruisers on a small number of its vessels (specifics are noted below under applicable cabin categories).

Further all ships offer several accessible accommodations across all main stateroom categories (except Celebrity Solstice and Celebrity Reflection which do not offer accessible standard balcony cabins) for passengers needing extra space for wheelchairs walkers and scooters. Those cabins feature wider (32-inch) doorways a 5-foot turning radius ramped bathroom thresholds bathroom grab bars lowered sinks and vanities higher toilets roll-in showers with fold-down benches hand-held showerheads lowered closet bars and accessible balconies (in select staterooms).

Unless otherwise noted all cabins are designed for double occupancy. In most cases solo travelers staying in accommodations meant for two people will be charged an additional cruise fare known as a single supplement. Further some staterooms are outfitted with trundle beds pull-down bunks or sofa beds that can accommodate up to four people per room.

Inside cabins on Celebrity ships

Inside cabins on Celebrity ships run anywhere from 170 to 202 square feet and they offer everything mentioned above. The one thing they don't have is a view.

As is implied by their name they have no windows and no balconies for natural light or fresh air. These are stellar options for anyone on a budget or travelers who have trouble sleeping with any sort of light.

Celebrity Silhouette has four inside cabins available for solo travelers.

Oceanview cabins on Celebrity ships

Oceanview cabins on Celebrity ships come in at between 170 and 242 square feet depending on the ship and type.

True to their name these rooms offer views of the ocean from windows that don't open so although there are no in-cabin ocean breezes there is natural light.

They include all of the basic amenities listed above.

Balcony cabins on Celebrity ships

Veranda

There are several veranda categories available throughout the Celebrity fleet all of which offer traditional balcony setups. Types include basic balcony cabins (170 to 202 square feet 38- to 53-square-foot balcony) Family Verandas (270 to 575 square feet 106- to 242-square-foot balcony) that sleep a larger number of people and Sunset Verandas (194 to 228 square feet 53- to 89-square-foot balcony) that offer aft views of the ship's wake.

The vessels also offer AquaClass and Concierge Class digs which are essentially basic balcony accommodations with some extras. The former focuses on wellness and comes with free fitness classes unlimited access to the onboard spa's thermal suite dining at exclusive health-focused restaurant Blu a healthier room service menu daily bottled water upgraded toiletries discounts on spa packages and yoga mats for in-cabin use. The latter entitles cruisers to amenities like dedicated concierge services as well as an exclusive luncheon daily in-room canapes and sparkling wine on request.

Basic amenities are included but what really sets these accommodations apart is that they provide cruisers with private access to ocean air – no need to venture to a public deck.

Infinite Veranda

As with standard balcony cabins Infinite Verandas – which are only found on ships in the line's Edge Class – come with the basic amenities listed above but they also grant a bit more interior space (202 square feet) in lieu of the usual walk-out terrace.

They earn their own category here because as those who book the accommodations will find instead of a traditional balcony they have a window that can be raised and lowered with the push of a button. A set of see-through folding doors allows the area near the window to be cordoned off in order to make it feel like a more traditional balcony.

RELATED: 6 reasons to stay in a balcony cabin

Celebrity's three newest vessels each have several Infinite Veranda solo cabins for cruisers traveling by themselves. Celebrity Edge has 16 and Celebrity Apex offers 24 while Celebrity Beyond boasts 32. They offer 131 to 184 square feet of space with 42- to 45-square-foot interior balcony areas.

Suites on Celebrity ships

There are 10 types of suites on Celebrity's ships four of which – Sky Suites Celebrity Suites Royal Suites and Penthouse Suites – appear on every single ship in the fleet. Two more – Edge Villas and Iconic Suites – are found only on Edge-class vessels. Another two Signature Suites and Reflection Suites are exclusive to Celebrity Reflection and the remaining Sunset Suites and AquaClass Suites are new to the fleet with the debut of Celebrity Beyond.

Passengers booked in any of the suites in this category have access to the exclusive suites-only lounge and pool deck known as The Retreat as well as dining in suite-access-only restaurant Luminae.

RELATED: 7 reasons to splurge on a cruise ship suite

Cruisers in these accommodations also receive a slew of perks including higher-level Wi-Fi and drink packages (upgraded from the free ones that come with all fares); onboard credit; prepaid gratuities; free in-room bottles of alcohol; complimentary laundry shoeshine butler and concierge services; and priority embarkation and tendering among other draws.

An explanation of each type of suite can be found below.

Sky Suites

Sky Suite on Celebrity Edge. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Cruises)

These are the smallest suites in the fleet ranging from 251 to 362 square feet with balconies that range from 57 to 163 square feet. They're arranged in a studio configuration similar to what you'd find in non-suite cruise-ship accommodations. They're the least expensive option for those who crave access to suite-level amenities.

Celebrity Suites

For cruisers wanting the step up their square footage or storage space a Celebrity Suite will do the trick. Expect 394 to 498 square feet plus a balcony between 51 and 105 square feet complete with separate living and bedroom spaces a sizeable bathroom (with a bathtub/shower combo) and tons of drawers and cabinets to help chronic overpackers stow their belongings.

Royal Suites

For an even bigger upgrade Royal Suites come in at between 538 and 687 square feet with verandas measuring 72 to 195 square feet. Each has ample storage separate lounging and sleeping quarters and a generously sized bathroom with a shower and separate soaking tub that's perfect for relaxing after a day in port.

Penthouse Suites

Penthouse Suite on Celebrity Edge. (Photo by Tim Aylen/Celebrity Cruises)

Penthouse suites are the largest accommodations found fleetwide ranging from 1291 to 1432 square feet with 197- to 1098-square-foot verandas that are large enough for their own private hot tubs. The two-bed two-bath setup with a separate sitting area and dining table that seats eight makes these cabins great for entertaining or sharing with travel companions.

Edge Villas

These two-deck suites offer an upstairs-and-downstairs setup with one bedroom two bathrooms and a living room in 739 square feet of space. There's also a 211-square-foot balcony. These rooms are exclusive to the line's Edge Class of ships and they boast access to a private plunge pool.

Iconic Suites

Iconic Suite on Celebrity Edge. (Photo by Tim Aylen/Celebrity Cruises)

Iconic Suites -- which are in high demand due to their limited numbers and plethora of extras -- are the largest on Edge-class vessels offering 1892 square feet a nearly 689-square-foot balcony (larger than most staterooms onboard complete with a private hot tub and daybed) a bathroom with dual sinks and a whirlpool tub and an unparalleled forward-facing view from directly above the bridge.

Signature Suites

Signature Suite on Celebrity Reflection. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Cruises)

While Signature Suite accommodations are on the smaller side at 441 square feet the 118-square-foot balcony still manages to include an outdoor tub with a rain shower so you can soak while taking in the views as you sail. They also include high ceilings a shower/tub combo and separate living and sleeping areas.

Reflection Suites

Reflection Suite on Celebrity Reflection. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Cruises)

At nearly four times the size of Signature Suites Reflection Suites come equipped with two bedrooms two bathrooms and a cantilevered glass shower that hangs out over the ocean for simply amazing views. All of this fits neatly into 1636 square feet of space plus a 194-square-foot balcony. Dual sinks a separate soaking tub with a rain shower high ceilings a walk-in closet and a prime corner location round out the opulent offerings. These suites are only slightly smaller than Iconic Suites but their verandas are far tinier.

Sunset Suites

Similar to the wake-view concept behind the line's Sunset Veranda staterooms Sunset Suites provide an elevated experience with the same stunning vistas at each ship's aft. Some of these suites are on the smaller side comprising 296 to 575 square feet plus a 53- to 242-square-foot balcony but they do incorporate separate living and sleeping areas making them feel more like true suites.

AquaClass Sky Suites

AquaClass Sky Suite. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Cruises)

These rooms combine the space and enhanced extras of a Sky Suite (including access to The Retreat and Luminae) with the perks of an AquaClass cabin – fitness classes thermal suite access dining at Blu daily bottled water discounts on spa packages and yoga mats for in-cabin use – to bring passengers a more health-centric suite experience in 319 square feet with a 79-square-foot veranda.

Cabins on Celebrity's Galapagos-class ships

Because Celebrity's expedition vessels are much smaller they warrant their own section. What follows is a breakdown of the cabin types – most of which are suites – offered on each ship.

Note that Celebrity Flora Celebrity Xpedition and Celebrity Xploration have neither The Retreat nor Luminae so suite passengers do not have access to those venues. Amenities also may vary from those offered on the fleet's non-expedition ships.

Celebrity Flora

Penthouse Suite on Celebrity Flora. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Cruises)

The largest of Celebrity's expedition vessels Celebrity Flora houses 50 cabins with a double-occupancy capacity for 100 passengers. All staterooms are classified as suites with a mix of several types of Sky Suites including some with Infinite Verandas (330 to 365 square feet 65- to 86-square-foot balcony); Royal Suites (559 square feet 129-square-foot balcony); and Penthouse Suites (1288 square feet 321-square-foot balcony).

Celebrity Xpedition

Oceanview cabin on Celebrity Xpedition. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Cruises)

Significantly smaller is Celebrity Xpedition which can carry 48 passengers across 24 cabins at capacity. Availability includes 160-square-foot oceanview accommodations; 175-square-foot Junior Suites with 45-square-foot verandas; and a combination of suites – Xpedition Suites Royal Suites and Penthouse Suites – that run the gamut from 205 to 460 square feet with balconies ranging from 50 to 235 square feet. Given that Penthouse Suites on the line's other ships span 1291 to 1432 square feet with 197- to 1098-square-foot verandas it's easy to see that suite sizes decrease as ship sizes decrease.

Celebrity Xploration

Oceanview stateroom on Celebrity Xploration. (Photo courtesy of Celebrity Cruises)

The tiniest and most no-frills option on Celebrity's roster is Celebrity Xploration which carries just 16 people in eight cabins at its maximum. Oddly all staterooms are labeled as Junior Suites but while half of them have balconies (180 square feet with 245-square-foot verandas) the other half (190 square feet) don't. It's also interesting to note that in the ones that do have them the balconies boast significantly more space than the interior living area does.

Bottom line

Celebrity's selection of basic cabins is fairly standard. However when it comes to suites passengers have a decent number of choices and even the smallest and least expensive options offer coveted amenities and access to dedicated spaces.

Although there are suite types that span the entire fleet the line likes to create experiences that are exclusive to some of its newest classes and ships.

Celebrity is one of the best big-ship cruise brands when it comes to everything from service and extras to in-cabin storage space decor and even furniture layout.

These days kitchen larders or pantries can come in all shapes and sizes from discreet free-standing units to whole walk-in rooms with floor-to-ceiling shelves. Depending on the space available to you larders can be an incredibly practical solution to store dry food vegetables and small appliances like coffee machines microwaves and toasters.



One of the joys of a larder is that its storage capacity can free up space in the rest of your kitchen to add more decorative touches like art or wall lights which in turn makes it feel less functional and more homely.

""Larders are much more than a clever storage feature they are a celebration of craftsmanship design and details"" says Al Bruce founder of Olive & Barr. ""Whether you have a farmhouse-style kitchen or an ultra-modern space adding a larder is a great way to create a more homely atmosphere that enhances the vibe you already have. You could use them to create an extra storage option that stands out in the corner of your country home or you could use them to frame your state-of-the-art wine fridge to bring together functionality and modernism.""



Read on for 6 design ideas to make the kitchen larder work for you.

Use statement finishes

Gone are the days of your grandmother's stone-walled storage areas the design and craftsmanship in modern larders and pantries are features in themselves. Spotlight your larder with bold colour ways and eye-catching fixtures like these elegant brass handles on our very own .

""Built-in larders have a show stopping quality in their own right"" says Al. ""Turn yours into a subtle centrepiece simply add an eye-catching splash of colour and some standout details. For instance some chrome or brass handles on the outside and an accent colour inside especially one that celebrates the special items you’ve stored in there.""

Create a place to prep

A walk-in pantry is a dream for keen cooks or for those who want to keep their kitchen totally clutter-free and a well-executed layout is absolutely essential to make the most of your space. Elevate your larder beyond simple storage by including work surfaces to aid basic food or drink preparation.



""Every kitchen should be designed with personality and functionality in mind and a carefully-planned larder offers exactly that"" says Al. ""From creating a dedicated hot drinks station with everything needed to make and serve the perfect brew to extending your kitchen worktops inside so that you have a purpose-built prep station – complete with microwave and coffee-maker – your larder can be turned into a clutter-free area to suit your everyday needs.""

Invest in the right lighting

If you do remember larders of old they were often dark and dingy spaces without much consideration for design or styling. These days there is very much a reason to highlight the carefully organised foodstuffs and accessories inside. If your larder is glass-fronted like this traditional Plain English design illuminate its contents with traditional low-hanging pendant or in more modern spaces consider LED strip lighting nestled underneath your shelving.

Al says: ""Whether you’ve been dreaming of a kitchen larder to keep your clutter from being on display or you want to create a place to display your favourite pieces adding some simple strip lights on the inside frames is a great way to make your larder more practical and special.""

Get creative with storage

The best larders are those that have a good amount of depth to accommodate clever storage features. Roll-out shelving rows of door-mounted storage racks and space for wooden apple crates or wicker baskets can help you keep your larder totally organised.

""Get creative with your storage options and use every inch of the space to maximise the functionality of your space. From different height shelving options to adding storage baskets on rails installing spice racks on the inside of your doors to dedicating a space to your most-used appliances bespoke larders allow you to design your space with your kitchen preferences in mind.""

Work with your kitchen layout

The joy of a larder is that it doesn't have to fit into your immediate kitchen layout. An unused recess can be adapted for a bespoke larder - like this glorious pink Tom Howley example - or use a clever fitted larder in an otherwise forgotten corner like in our very own .

If you have a compact kitchen Al advises to build upwards. ""No matter how small your kitchen is there is always a way to utilise the benefits of a purpose-built pantry — you simply need to think vertically. By creating a narrow floor-to-ceiling larder and then adding generously spaced vertical shelves you can maximise the storage space. Jars bottles bread machines vases cereal boxes — whatever it is you’ll have plenty of space to play with and without taking too much of your kitchen space either.""

Organise organise organise

The larder is the one spot in your kitchen that should have Marie Kondo levels of organisation. ""The key to a successful pantry is all about optimising your storage space to create a luxury feel both when you open the doors and when you want to find something"" says Al. ""It’s about creating a scene that is aesthetically pleasing and simple to navigate which is why we always recommend open shelving and a soft lighting. After this spend some time choosing storage containers and mason jars that tie in with the rest of your kitchen to complete the look.""",,,

Whistleblower Awarded $24 Million By NHTSA For Exposing Hyundai And Kia Engine Flaw

One whistleblower just got a rather hefty payday thanks to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA announced its first-ever payout to a whistleblower after receiving information about a safety defect on Hyundai and Kia’s Theta II engines. According to the whistleblower and ex-Hyundai engineer Kim Gwong-ho the company refused to accept a design flaw that put these engines at the risk of seizing and catching fire. The agency slapped a combined fine of $210 million on Hyundai and Kia of which $81 million was paid by cash. In return the safety regulator paid 30 perent of this collection to Kim Gwong-ho who walked away with no less than $24 million.

Retro-Influenced BR20 Is Ferrari’s Latest One-Off Special

Ferrari has taken the wraps off its latest one-off special. Christened the BR20 it’s based on the GTC4 Lusso but adopts a sleek fastback design inspired by past models such as the 410 Superamerica and 500 Superfast complete with flying buttresses and classically-styled circular rear lamps. Ferrari hasn’t disclosed who commissioned the car or what the “BR” in the name stands for though you might speculate that the letters could be the initials of the “longstanding client” that was apparently fully involved in the design process for their very special car.

(TIGI) has warned that the public’s failure to hold the administration accountable will result in increased slippages in the oil sector.

TIGI says that had Guyanese held firm to the position that the government had since 1999 erred in its decision to award more oil blocks than the laws allowed and lobbied for a change when it was challenged two years ago the forfeiture of the right to audit might not have occurred.

“The latest sensational revelation that the country has lost its right to challenge some $9.5 billion of post-contract expenses through failure to audit on time is only the latest rung in the slippage on an oily slope. For TIGI this began with the breach of the 60-block maximum. We are therefore not surprised though we are surely disappointed” TIGI’s head Fred Collins told Sunday Stabroek.

“You cannot decide to look the other way while serious questions are asked on what appears to be interpretation of laws in favour of special interests or to be silent in the face of questionable compliance without eventually arriving at such a point. For us it will be an event on a natural trajectory started with the signature of the 1999 Stabroek contract with Esso” he added.

Over the past week the Stabroek News has been seeking a response from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) to no avail.

This newspaper has also reached out to ExxonMobil for comment and on Friday local representative and Media and Communications Manager Janelle Persaud said that she was awaiting clearance from the company’s legal team.

Collins said that TIGI had insisted since 2018 that the Minister [of Natural Resources] had no authority to issue the total of 26800 square kilometers as a super-block and should have instead of divided them into the 6 licence blocks in keeping with the law.

“The Caribbean Court of Justice ruling in the elections recount case contained a thorough discussion on why no government official has unfettered discretion and why such an action could never have fallen within the minister’s discretion. In fact the exposition in that ruling should have raised the question as to the competence of the lawyers that drew up the 1999 contract as it clearly meant that the issue was not an esoteric point of law but a well-known principle – the Wednesbury doctrine. We know of no other review of this action which should have been prompted by the CCJ ruling to this day. Again to this day we have seen no discussion as to what the root unauthorized issuance of those blocks means to the validity of the contract” he argued.

“What we said then and what we are saying now is that a society cannot turn a blind eye to the trivialization of its laws and not pay a price. Or to put it differently electoral laws and small-time crooks are not the only ones that matter. We cannot wait until something hits us directly to demand accountability” he added.

Since the revelation by Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo that the post-contract expenses have not been audited since there was no local firm to do the job government has been by critics over its nonchalance about the failure with TIGI’s chiding being the latest.

Jagdeo told a recent press conference that ExxonMobil’s post-2017 expenditure for the Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells would not be audited as government was not able to select a strong local group to undertake it. This statement was made although the government had advertised this year for foreign firms.

“We have been very disappointed that we have not been able to select a group to do the audit of the post-2017 expenditure on Exxon. The reason is we did not have a strong local content. We had two local groups that came in but they were not strong enough. We want to build a capacity in Guyana to do this audit” Jagdeo said.

“We think our people have enormous skills forensic skills auditing skills and we are looking to see if we can’t have an arrangement where we have a consortium of local people partnering with a foreign company so we can build capacity right here in Guyana. We are disappointed that from the individual bids we did we have not been able to do this. When I get back from Scotland (from the COP26 conference) I have asked the minister to see if we can’t get all the groups that expressed interest to see how we can partner they can partner with a foreign company to do this audit. We also have to build this capacity in GRA (Guyana Revenue Authority). GRA has been mandated to build a capacity to do this. But it is a disappointment because it has been quite a while” he added.

However there has been no information on if the MNR as the procuring entity had informed the companies of why they did not qualify or why the Government of Guyana never announced that none of the tenders met the required criteria. No explanation was given on why the contract was not re-advertised or if government had asked ExxonMobil to extend the two-year statutory period given the lack of capacity here and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on works globally.

The Ministry of Natural Resources had been responsible for the evaluating of the financials of companies that had bid for the contract but it apparently abandoned the process without advising the procurement board.

The expiration of the deadline for the examination of the expenses means that the country has not been able to determine if the US$9 billion expenditure by ExxonMobil and partners was warranted. If the expenses were overstated it would have caused a reduction in Guyana’s profit oil take.

Sources told this newspaper that the ministry has not said anything to the National Procurement and Tender Administration Board (NPTAB) on tenders that were submitted for the auditing of the expenses. The tenders were opened in April of this year.

It is unclear how the ministry came to be responsible for evaluating tenders given that the statutory process lies with the NPTAB but one source explained that oil and gas contracts are evaluated by a special body given that it requires expert technical evaluation while the NPTAB has “administrative oversight”.

TIGI also pointed to Chartered Accountant Christopher Ram’s observation of the inconsistency between Jagdeo’s statement concerning the failure to audit agreeing that it is “inconsistent with the Government’s own advertisement inviting bids to audit the contract costs…”

The transparency body said that apart from allowing government’s inconsistences to pass un-objected as fast as an error is picked up government should be made accountable no matter how small the public may think it is. “Had those 26800 sq km been issued under 6 separate licenses there would have been one material difference. The separation would have imposed a natural ring-fencing of sorts to the extent that it would have been impossible to claim that the expenses related to one well located in a licence block could be set off against a productive well issued under another licence. What the failure to ring-fence means is that absent the natural separation into six separate licence blocks the expenses of a well anywhere in that Stabroek block of 26800 sq km are being set off against a productive well anywhere else within it” TIGI stated.

“We find the development quite consistent with the long trajectory which begins with a breach of the law at the very creation of the contract continuing with a contrived history to support certain questionable concessions and including a conspiracy to cheat not one but two countries of taxes…clearly the latest development is only the latest on a path downward which threatens to normalize the preposterous” it added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uZ3kvMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9hdC1lbmQtb2YteWVsbG93dGFpbC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1vaWwtY29tcGFueS1jb3VsZC1sZWF2ZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtdW5kZXJ3YXRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At end of Yellowtail development oil company could leave equipment underwater,"By Vishani Ragobeer

vishani@newsroom.gy

Concerns have been raised about oil equipment that could be left underwater after work is completed on the Yellowtail development which has been identified at ExxonMobil’s fourth oil production project.

ExxonMobil is seeking environmental authorisation for the project which will actually extract oil from both the Yellowtail and Redtail fields in the giant Stabroek block where Exxon has so far made over 20 oil discoveries.

The start-up of the Yellowtail project is expected to begin in late 2025 and is anticipated to produce 220000 barrels of oil per day from a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel that would be able to store up to two million barrels.

“The plan which is preliminary in nature envisions that subsea equipment will be disconnected after it is flushed and prepared and potentially left on the seafloor” Todd Hall an environmental consultant revealed at a public consultation recently.

Hall is attached to the Environmental Resources Management (ERM) the firm which prepared the Environmental Impact Assessment for ExxonMobil Guyana to submit to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The consultation was required after Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) ExxonMobil’s local affiliate submitted its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for Yellowtail to the EPA.

Among the equipment that could be left on Guyana’s seafloor where oil is being produced are Subsea Umbilicals Risers and Flowlines. These kinds of equipment are used to connect the topside vessel- that is the FPSO vessel- to the wellheads and pumps on the seafloor in order to extract the oil.

The Yellowtail project is expected to last for 20 years. It will come onstream and produce oil at the same time as the earlier projects namely Liza phases One and Two and Payara.

It was reported that the exact locations of the Yellowtail development fields have not yet been finalized; however the wells will be drilled from six drill centers. ERM consultants indicate that there could be between 41 and 67 oil wells – the largest number of wells within the four developments.

Stakeholders who were part of the public consultations stated their concerns about this equipment being disconnected at the end of the development and simply discarded underwater since it may adversely affect the marine environment.

Dr Jerry Jailall a member of the Guyana Oil and Gas Governance network asked what international studies the company was using to justify that action.

Another participant pointed out that the government is currently spending millions (the exact amount of $787.6 million) of dollars to remove wreckages from the Demerara River and questioned whether that would become necessary with the oil equipment left underwater.

Hall however emphasised that this decommissioning plan was only preliminary. In the process of producing oil and gas decommissioning (or closure) is the last phase of the process following exploration development and operations.

He said all of the hydrocarbon material (such as oil) would be cleaned off from the equipment at the time of closure.

He also pointed out that in the preliminary decommissioning plan there is scope for alternative strategies to be considered.

“… if we’re talking about something that will happen 20-plus years from now then I think the state of the science (and) the state of international guidance will continue to evolve” Hall explained.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uZ3kvMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9lcGEtaGVhZC13YW50cy10by1iZS1jb21mb3J0YWJsZS13aXRoLWluc3VyYW5jZS1mb3ItZm91cnRoLW9pbC1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EPA Head wants to be 'comfortable' with insurance for fourth oil project,"By Vishani Ragobeer

vishani@newsroom.gy

Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Kemraj Parsram says that the agency wants to be “comfortable” that there is the necessary insurance in place to deal with an unplanned event such as an oil spill before it gives permission for ExxonMobil’s fourth development project called Yellowtail.

ExxonMobil is seeking environmental authorisation for the project which will actually extract oil from both the Yellowtail and Redtail fields in the giant Stabroek block where Exxon has so far made over 20 oil discoveries.

The start-up of the Yellowtail project is expected to begin in late 2025 and is anticipated to produce 220000 barrels of oil per day from a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel that would be able to store up to two million barrels.

With this project between 41 and 67 oil wells are expected to be drilled and it will be on going at the same time as three other projects – Liza Phases One and Two and Payara.

“I am making sure that we are comfortable before we sign this document.

“… There is financial assurance stated in the Environmental Protection Act and that’s what we will follow” Parsram stated at a recent online public consultation on the project.

At a recent public consultation on the environmental impact of the Yellowtail development there were numerous questions about the financial assurances from the company to mitigate potential hazards such as oil spills.

“If that happens we will take responsibility and pay the legitimate costs” Project Manager at ExxonMobil Steve Laws stated.

Laws explained that insurance is more of an “after-the-fact” recovery cost and consideration would be given to any incident not just an oil spill.

The EPA Head on the other hand pointed out that insurance is a consideration before the project Is given approval.

According to Part VI of the Act the EPA may require this “financial assurance” from the body seeking environmental authorisation for a project “for measures appropriate to prevent the adverse effects upon and following the cessation or closing of the works.”

Moreover Section 31(2) states that the amount of financial assurance shall be specified and it may be provided reduced or released in the stages specified in the environmental authorisation.

Parsram also stated that the EPA the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Attorney-General’s Chamber are currently reviewing the draft agreement with EEPGL. As such he explained that negotiations on considerations like insurance are still ongoing.

In the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) document submitted by EEPGL to the EPA for authorisation mention was made of how the company would respond to an unplanned oil spill."

The wealthy landowner was sentenced to eight years in federal prison after admitting in 2001 that he imported girls and women from India for cheap labor and sexual gratification.

He was living in Berkeley until recently; he was pronounced dead of natural causes Monday at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland an Alameda County Sheriff’s Office spokesman said.

Following his prison term Reddy and his family continued to own around 1200 rental units in Berkeley through real estate groups such as Raj Properties and Everest Properties.

A businessman originally from Andhra Pradesh India he founded an engineering college that bears his name in his hometown of Mylavaram Berkeleyside reported.

Residents who lived in Reddy’s properties in Berkeley publicly accused him over the years of being a negligent landlord with one tenant urging the City Council in 2013 to hold Reddy at fault for contributing to a fire that nearly destroyed a Dwight Way apartment complex.

Reddy’s name was most prominent around the sex trafficking scandal that led to several members of his family facing criminal charges. It began after a 17-year-old girl died in 1999 from carbon monoxide poisoning at one of Reddy’s properties.

Reporters at Berkeley High School’s student newspaper brought to light details involving the girl’s death including that she had not been enrolled in school — a revelation that led to the sex trafficking operation’s exposure according to Berkeleyside.

Prosecutors later accused Reddy of bringing girls and women from India to work for his business then repeatedly sexually abusing them and imposing work conditions that were akin to indentured servitude.

In addition to the sex trafficking plea Reddy and other family members were convicted of ducking immigration laws by having men pose as the victims’ fathers in order to bring them to the United States.

Later five of Reddy’s victims would tell a federal judge that their previous testimonies had been exaggerated and misinterpreted by a court translator but two other victims maintained that they had suffered extreme emotional distress from Reddy’s crimes.

It stands to reason then that a merger of regional parcel delivery carriers LaserShip and OnTrac with $1.7 billion in combined annual revenue between them wouldn’t appear on the giants’ radar.

Vienna Virginia-based LaserShip’s mid-October $1.3 billion purchase of Chandler Arizona-based OnTrac will forge the first nationwide provider built from regional networks. The deal has generated much excitement in the last-mile delivery world. It is also welcome news to big parcel shippers that have spent 18 months coping with persistent demand spikes ultratight capacity and demands by FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS (NYSE: UPS) to accept higher rates and surcharges or be volume-restricted if not cut loose altogether.

There are deep pockets behind the tie-up in the form of private equity firm American Securities LLC. Will Manuel an American Securities managing director who is also LaserShip’s chairman has high aspirations for the entity in a delivery world turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Manuel backed it up last month by hiring Mark Holifield who ran Home Depot Inc.’s (NYSE: HD) logistics and supply chain operations for 14 years as the combined entity’s CEO.

However some perspective is needed before the coronation begins. The LaserShip-OnTrac entity equals just 3% of FedEx’s and UPS’ combined volumes and only 1.5% of combined revenue according to consultancy Shipware LLC. Regional carriers including LaserShip and OnTrac are already at or near full capacity and it’s uncertain at best how much of FedEx’s and UPS’ share they could take and still adequately service the accounts Shipware said. “If [LaserShip/OnTrac] doubled in volume capacity — which they can’t for a very long time — they’re still insignificant” compared to the behemoths said Rob Martinez Shipware’s founder and co-CEO.

Not only is he starring in the latest Marvel Studios series Hawkeye but he is the centerpiece of the new Paramount+ series Mayor Of Kingstown. Does he actually play the mayor? No but considering the town’s major industry is for-profit prisons he may as well be. Read on for more.

MAYOR OF KINGSTOWN: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?

Opening Shot: A kid hits a tennis ball in a grassy area. A man in a suit catches the ball give the kid another ball and offers him some money to hit that ball over the prison wall that’s behind him.

The Gist: That tennis ball is ignored by guards and given to a particular inmate who opens it up and takes the drugs that are inside. Mike McLusky (Jeremy Renner) talks in voice over about how Kingstown Michigan has seven prisons in a 10-mile radius and his job is to be the conduit between the prisoners and the outside world a job he never really wanted to do in the first place.

Two days earlier Mike and his brother/business partner Mitch (Kyle Chandler) are talking to a client. Mitch is the driver of this liaison business; he has so many connections in the prisons and in law enforcement most people call him “The Mayor” — even the actual mayor calls him that. One of their connections is their younger brother Kyle (Taylor Handley) who’s a Kingstown PD detective.

Vera Sunter (Elizaveta Neretin) the wife of Milo Sunter an important client of the McLuskys who’s currently in prison comes in; she tells Mitch that Milo wants him to retrieve a bag of money he buried in the woods after “that thing” a robbery that Mitch knows about. She even has a map which she tells him to make a copy of.

Meanwhile Mike is meeting with two COs that he works with; one of them has a nephew who just started on the job and is already in the pocket of a gang member inmate. Mike says he’ll intercept a letter that the nephew says he’ll deliver but a tennis ball of contraband has to go over the wall and he asks the COs to ensure that everyone there knows what’s coming and won’t interfere.

In the women’s prison Miriam McLusky (Dianne Wiest) is teaching a history class to the inmates. After class one asks her if the Mayor can help her out and Miriam disgusted by what her sons do tells her in no uncertain terms to never ask her that again.

Kyle provides police cover for Mitch and Mike and helps Mike dig up the bag with the money. But at the same time someone who was in the brothers’ office when Vera came around encounters her at the strip club where she works. All hell breaks loose after he follows her home strangles her and finds the map she was holding. At the same time the plan to protect the young CO goes sideways when the kid beats the snot out of the inmate sending him to the hospital and angering Bunny (Tobi Bamtefa) the head of the local Crips with whom Mitch and Mike had a deal.

What Shows Will It Remind You Of? Mayor of Kingston feels like The Wire crossed with Mare Of Easttown only more depressing (really).

Our Take: Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Hugh Dillon (who plays Ian a top KPD detective loyal to the McLuskys) created Mayor Of Kingstown and the series starts off as a bit of a confusing mess. Renner whose usual acting prowess is more apparent in the first episode’s later scenes after he finds out what happened to Mitch mumbles his way through the initial scenes which is full of code words and poorly contextualized jargon.

When Mitch and Mike negotiate with the gang leader for instance they talk about a “FedEx.” we know it’s not really a package and after some doing we realized it was the name for the tennis balls filled with drugs that they launch over the prison wall. But everyone is talking so fast and so mumbly that it’s hard to discern what’s what. To be honest we still have no idea what was in the letter the young guard delivered who has it and why it needs to be retrieved.

We get that Sheridan wanted to use unstilted dialogue for these scenes but there’s no context for a viewer to grab onto and is either left highly confused or checked out. It’s also a bit confusing because in his initial voice over Mike says “I’m the Mayor of Kingstown” but it’s clear that Mitch is the Mayor as the episode goes along. You start to forget that the cold open took place two days after most of the action which makes what happens to Mitch all the more surprising.

Despite fine performances from Renner (at least in the second half of the episode) Wiest and Chandler the first episode of Mayor Of Kingstown is relentlessly depressing more interested in breaking Succession’s record for “number of f-bombs per hour” than telling a tight story.

What Mitch and Mike do where they get paid to make the lives of people who are imprisoned and the people who work at the various prisons a little less stressful seems to be good fodder for a thrilling drama full of antiheroes. But after the first episode it feels like we’re basically going to see Renner grimly going about his business fight with his mother about it and maybe even suck in his police detective brother. And we’ll likely hear more mumbling. That’s not our idea of an engrossing show.

Sex and Skin: Vera is topless at her job (of course it’s at a strip club). She grinds the guy that saw her at the brothers’ office during a private dance not knowing who he is.

Parting Shot: After retrieving a stack of money at his office now a crime scene Mike is approached by a woman who has someone in prison that needs the Mayor’s help. Kyle tries to pull Mike away but Mike breathes in heavily and asks the woman what the person’s name is.

Sleeper Star: Because Dianne Wiest has done so much TV lately people forget that she’s won two Oscars. She’s excellent in the scene where she tells Mike that he never should have stayed in Kingstown and worked with Mitch.

Most Pilot-y Line: Bunny yells to a peon “Motherfucker get me some cold frozen shit. I don’t care where from!” after an exchange about the difference between a snow-cone a Slurpee and a Blizzard. It’s funny but seems tonally out of place on this show.

Our Call: SKIP IT. While Mayor Of Kingstown boasts fine performances it’s confusing at times and incredibly depressing at others. If we wanted to watch a show that’s relentlessly grim there are much better choices out there.

Release Date November 14 2021 Airbus tees up early A350 freighter orders with Air Lease Purchase a PDF of this article

Dubai — Airbus is nearing the announcement of its first A350 freighter orders anchored by lessor Air Lease Corp. and one other yet-to-be determined cargo carrier according to people familiar with the company’s planning. The leasing giant is said to be in advanced discussions with the European plane maker to provide the company its first orders for the new freighter.

Air Lease has been at the forefront of Airbus’s two most recent new single-aisle aircraft development programs including its A321XLR in 2019 and its A321LR in 2015.

Both Boeing and Airbus are riding a wave of demand for dedicated and converted freighter aircraft as the pandemic has sidelined the ample bellies of large twin-aisle passengers used for carrying cargo and a long-term boom in global e-commerce.

Airbus is said to also be in talks with UPS FedEx Express and the cargo units of Singapore Airlines Cathay Pacific and Lufthansa the latter three being existing A350 passenger operators. The plane maker formally launched the freighter variant of its latest twin-aisle aircraft earlier this year.

Further Etihad based in nearby Abu Dhabi is currently working with Airbus to renegotiate its order of single-aisle A320neo family aircraft potentially swapping the 26 aircraft for an undetermined number of A350 freighters the person said. Other possible candidates for launch could be the new merged Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. The latter has 21 existing A350-900 and -1000 passenger aircraft on order and those could be converted to freighters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idWNzbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzE0LzIyNzgxOTUzL2J1Y2NhbmVlcnMtbG9zZS1zZWNvbmQtc3RyYWlnaHQtZmFsbC0yOS0xOS10by13YXNoaW5ndG9uLWZvb3RiYWxsLXRlYW0tdG9tLWJyYWR5LW5mbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buccaneers lose second straight fall 29-19 to Washington Football Team,"In this edition of “everything that can go wrong will” the Buccaneer fell to the now 3-6 Washington Football Team 29-19 at FedEx Field. For the Bucs it was not only one of their worst performances in the last two seasons but it comes off of a bye week and against the worst pass defense in the NFL.

Tom Brady threw two first quarter interceptions - having not thrown any first quarter picks in his last 25 games - that started things off on the wrong foot for the Bucs. Of course it was a pretty bad omen when we heard for the last two weeks that the Bucs had to stop beating themselves with penalties then O.J. Howard had a false start on the very first play of the game.

The Buccaneers ended up with six penalties for 43 yards and the two turnovers while only taking the ball away from Washington once - a second half forced fumble by Lavonte David.

Taylor Heinicke outplayed Tom Brady 26-of-32 for 256 yards and a touchdown while Brady was 23-of-34 for 220 yards two touchdowns and the two interceptions.

A 40-yard strike from Brady to Mike Evans got the Buccaneers within four - after Ryan Succop missed the extra point - with 10:55 to play. The Washington Football Team would then orchestrate a 19-play drive culminating in an Antonio Gibson rushing touchdown that took 10:26 off the clock. Washington who had the NFL’s worst third down conversion rate went 11-of-19 on third downs Sunday including 4-of-5 on that final drive. Gibson’s one yard touchdown came on fourth down.

As if the loss wasn’t bad enough Bucs’ defensive tackle Vita Vea was carted off the field following that fourth down run by Gibson. Vea has been one of the best defensive players in the NFL this season and is now looking at missed time with another injury - something the Buccaneers defense can not afford. No word yet as to what the injury is but Vea did not appear to be in good spirits when leaving the field.

The Buccaneers now fall to 6-3 with a prime time game against the New York Giants next week. As we’ve said all year they have a lot of things to figure out between now and then. Time is no longer on the side of the Bucs to get things straightened out on both sides of the ball. One thing is certain; this is not a contending team the way they’ve played through the 2021 season. After the Giants they’ll face the Colts Saints and Bills within a four week stretch. If they don’t have things figured out by then the Saints could sneak past them for the division lead leaving Buccaneers fans dejected and confused."

FSLR,First Solar,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2RuZXdzbmV0d29yay5vcmcvc29sYXItcG93ZXJlZC1jYW1wZXItc3RlbGxhLXZpdGEtaW50cm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Students Build Solar-Powered Pop-Up Van For Touring in a Brilliant Mobile Home That Has Zero Emissions,"22 Dutch university students have completed an 1800 mile road trip powered only by the sun on a quest to show that sustainable vehicles can let you travel the world without harming the environment.

Enrolled in Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands the students say their van—named Stella Vita—is the world’s first solar powered mobile home.

With its solar panel roof and wings that fold out with additional panels when parked the team has doubled the solar surface to 17.5 square meters which generates enough energy to live and drive on.

On a sunny day Stella Vita which is road legal and has a license plate can travel up to 453 miles (730 km) within 24 hours and reach a speed of 75 miles per hour.

With a roof that pops up when stationary you can stand inside while cooking.

Made for two people it has a kitchen with a fridge a seating area bed shower and toilet.

(See the video at the bottom.)

“Stella Vita is a self-sustaining house on wheels” says their website. “Through solar panels on the roof it is independent of charging stations.” But it does have an electric power charger in case of emergency.

The vehicle generates enough solar energy to drive shower watch TV charge your laptop and make coffee says the team.

In one year the students succeeded in designing and building the mobile home and last month completed their demonstration road trip from Eindhoven to the southern tip of Spain.

The drivers and passengers can also track the amount energy used and how much is remaining. News reports say that it has a 60 kilowatt-hour battery that allows it to travel 373 miles at night.

“On a cloudy day the vehicle can still produce 60-70% of the energy” the team coordinator Dr. Carlo van der Weijer told The Guardian. “And even if there is no sun at all you still have an efficient normal electric car that you can charge from a charging port.”

This isn’t the first solar vehicle made by the team of University students and faculty that work under the name Solar Team Eindhoven launched in 2012. In their first year they pioneered the building of a solar powered family car called Stella.

Since then there have been 3 more vehicles before this pop-up van.

Stella and its successors Stella Lux Stella Vie and the 5-seater Stella Era all raced in the World Solar Challenge in Australia and won in its Cruiser Class all four times it was held – in 2013 2015 2017 and in 2019. Being the only competing “family car” with a license plate the road registration of Stella cars contributed to the their winning score in the races.

Solar Team Eindhoven has set up a nonprofit foundation to promote their practical solar vehicle concepts for adoption on a broader scale.

In 2017 some of the students responsible for the vehicles launched their own startup company to make a commercially viable version of the car called Lightyear One which was due to deliver the 4-passenger solar cars costing around $127000 this year.

Some residents say they’re missing out on millions,"WASTHENAW COUNTY MI - When a multinational energy company one the nation’s leaders in renewable power generation approached Karen and Douglas Sherman about leasing their land they did the math.

The Shermans own two parcels in Bridgewater Township a rural slice of Washtenaw County sandwiched between Manchester Clinton and Saline and dotted with farms. “We got a lot of experience on that soil there” Douglas Sherman says. His father bought it in 1960.

The yields are modest though. Getting $150 an acre would be “top dollar” he said. Often the price per bushel of barley hardly covers growing costs his wife once explained in a letter to the township.

The power company Invenergy offered the Shermans a new crop to harvest — the sun.

It would pay $1100 a year for each acre of the Shermans’ land it could blanket with solar panels exploiting the golden combination of open farmland and transmission lines passing through the area. The Shermans and others signed on.

But that was a year and a half ago. Douglas Sherman didn’t realize then Invenergy had a crucial hurdle to clear — the township.

Draft rules permitting commercial solar projects faced a chorus of naysayers. Residents who feared electromagnetic radiation. Officials rankled by Invenergy’s efforts to sign up landowners before consulting local government and skeptical of promises of boosted tax revenue. And others who complained of the panels’ aesthetics infringement on hunting land and a takeover by a massive out-of-town corporation.

“We don’t know that the money’s going to be there and we do know there’s potential for difficulties so let’s not be the guinea pigs” said township Planning Commission Chairman Dave Horney summarizing concerns.

On Nov. 4 with one member abstaining the township’s all-Republican board unanimously said no to the rules the commission had spent months drafting and recommended the board reject.

That’s left some Bridgewater landowners who were ready to ride the solar revolution disillusioned.

“They killed it based on assumptions and I think misinformation without even letting (Invenergy) bring an actual plan forward” said Amy Kopin who uses some of her land for organic farming had been approached by the company and was supportive of the solar proposal.

The solar debate in Bridgewater provides a window into the messy realities of the transition to a decarbonized energy grid.

Even near the green capital of Ann Arbor and in a county that’s set a rapidly-approaching carbon neutrality goal in the face of accelerating climate change rolling out renewable energy projects isn’t always smooth sailing.

And opposition to commercial-scale solar mounted by some of Bridgewater Township’s 1600 residents isn’t anything new.

This year a local businessman blanketed several mid-Michigan counties with 2000 “No Solar Farms” signs and took out TV ads in a campaign to stop similar development. Variations on the theme have played out across the nation.

And the debate will continue sometimes with different results in neighboring townships in Washtenaw and Lenawee counties. That’s because Invenergy is working to lay out solar farms there as well.

But for now Bridgewater residents will watch from the sidelines.

From the get-go officials ask Invenergy to pump the brakes

Invenergy a Chicago-based renewables giant worth billions plans a 170-megawatt array for Bridgewater Township enough energy to power over 30000 homes on an anticipated 1200 acres of land according to an email from Jorie Fox a senior associate for renewable development with the firm.

The solar developer first pitched the township’s Planning Commission in August 2020 minutes show.

Soon after an attorney representing the firm reached out to the township’s planning consultant Rodney Nanney asking to speak about possible changes to local zoning to accommodate commercial-scale solar projects.

That was “premature” Nanney emailed back warning: “If Invenergy puts pressure on this Planning Commission or Board of Trustees to act in haste I would expect the answer to simply be ‘no.’”

“It is very easy for a company like yours to attempt to manipulate the process especially when you are signing up multiple large property owners for leases to allow for an activity that is not currently possible under local regulations” he wrote.

In the year that followed the planning commission delved into drafting zoning changes that would allow for utility-grade solar Horney said. Over the course of many meetings it reviewed information provided by Invenergy comparable ordinances in other places and information provided by Nanney Horney said.

The township mailed out a notice to all of its households and in August roughly 45 people gathered for a public hearing about the draft rules — “a pretty hefty turnout” for normally sleepy township affairs according to Horney.

There residents speaking in opposition to the solar project and the zoning changes that would open the door for it to be formally proposed outnumbered supporters four to one minutes show.

“Few would benefit and the visual scar would harm the majority for years” one resident said while others worried about impact on roads caused by the installation of the panels questioned the effect on migratory birds and farmland and warned of “spoiling the country atmosphere” according to the minutes.

Solar boosters spoke too pointing to the dire need for sustainable sources of energy and the influx of money to cash-strapped farmers. Douglas Sherman using contract rates and estimates of the area covered by the project pegged the income to participating landowners at $28.5 million in the next 25 years.

Karen Sherman rebutted claims the panels would be an eyesore pointing to requirements written into the proposed rules to shroud the installations with trees and shrubbery.

“Does a group of efficient servants as you are have the right to disallow what the farmers need to survive when facts support that it is safe?” she asked in a letter submitted to officials.

‘Blind guys trying to describe an elephant by touch only’

In October the planning commission met a final time to discuss the draft solar rules. By then restrictions included in the proposal had come under fire from some landowners who saw them as an attempt to handicap the proposed solar project before it could even get off the ground.

The proposed local regulations limited where commercial solar could be installed to certain parts of the township cutting out some landowners who had been approached to participate Kopin said.

That paired with limitations on site grading for solar arrays “seems like a backhanded way to just kill the project” she wrote to officials calling the restrictions “arbitrary and capricious.”

Before sending the rules to the full board for consideration the planning commission identified “findings of fact and conclusions” relevant to decisions on the zoning changes — a pro-con list summarizing their year of discussions.

“Renewable energy” and “economic stimulus” made it onto the six pros listed. So did “tax revenue to the township.” But says Horney the commission thought that wasn’t a lock because of proposed changes to Michigan law regarding the taxation of solar energy equipment.

Last year a bill passed by the Michigan Legislature would have allowed solar developers to apply for an exemption from personal property taxes and instead pay a fixed annual amount based on the size of the facility. But local government groups pushed back arguing it would result in 20 cents on the dollar for municipalities and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed the measure.

Invenergy itself estimates the project will bring $5.5 million in total school district revenue over the life of the project alongside $1.4 million in township property taxes wrote Fox the company representative in an email.

Still that promise wasn’t enough to sway the Bridgewater Planning Commission. Its list of 20 cons gave a flavor of which way it was leaning raising concerns over wear on local infrastructure the conversion of farmland to solar and opposition from the public.

“With no comparable installation nearby we are the blind guys trying to describe an elephant by touch only” read one. Another: “This is essentially forever not for a limited period of time. Once done there is no going back.”

The commission ended up voting 3-1 to approve a recommendation that the township’s board reject the ordinance they had spent months drafting. Horney the sole no vote said his opposition to the motion was merely procedural.

He would have preferred not to send it up to the board at all he said.

With project dead in the water landowners dismayed

The board ultimately rejected the solar rules at a meeting on Nov. 4 closing the door at least for now on solar projects in the township.

Trustee Dave Faust one of the four no votes on the proposal said the ordinance needed more work.

In his opinion the rules didn’t identify the best areas of the township for solar he said but the township needs a solid ordinance because Invenergy is already in the process of dealing with residents.

Jealousy may have fueled opposition to the measure Faust added. Some residents “don’t see why just a few farmers are going to make the money.”

But for others the decision is hard to swallow.

Jason Hesselberg who leases his land to farmers in the township said the solar deal would have been 10 times more profitable without the risk of weather disrupting the growing season.

“An individual landowner that’s paying the taxes I should have the right to say yes I want it or no I don’t” he said. Minutes after township leaders rejected the solar rules they complained about lacking money to fix roads he added.

“If you would allow this to go through the extra money can fix all the roads you want and make our schools better” Hesselberg said.

For Kopin who lives near Hesselberg the decision was short-sighted and means the township will miss out at the beginning of necessary investments in renewables on the path toward carbon neutrality.

Solar arrays are preferable to other kinds of development the township could see Kopin said.

“If you build a subdivision you can never get that land back. If they yank these solar panels out in 25 years you still have perfectly good farmland” she said.

“It seems really disappointing the way the country is to see people that couldn’t see the greater wisdom in developing clean energy” added another Bridgewater landowner Kevin Kratz who advocated with his wife for the project.

Things have played out differently in at least one nearby township.

In a split vote in front of a packed outside crowd earlier this year leaders of Lenawee County’s Macon Township OK’d a permit for Invenergy to build the Mustang Mile solar facility slated to power thousands of homes but which has divided local residents.

Doing so it broke with its planning commission which had recommended the board nix the proposal.

In Saline Township planners await proposed site plans for a 150 megawatt solar farm after passing a solar ordinance in 2017. And in Freedom Township an ordinance is on the table now.

Horney said he and other officials had to consider what was best for Bridgewater Township.

“There’s got to be places in Michigan that want these there’s got to be places in Michigan where it would be feasible to build” he said paraphrasing what he had heard from residents.

“We don’t think we’re the place.”

It is very rare that a small family-owned Vermont contracting company founded in 1972 becomes in 50 years a multi-million dollar renewable energy company that's been traded on the NASDAQ since 2019.

(To put it into perspective very few Vermont companies are publicly traded at all.)

The rare company is iSun Inc (formerly Peck Electric Company formerly The Peck Company Holdings Inc).

iSun is a solar engineering procurement and construction company (EPC) based in Williston that is doing projects in about 13 states including all of New England and as far away as Colorado.

The company runs on values. From its website: “We are committed to creating products that promote awareness and respect for the environment. We believe that business plays an essential role in initiating innovative technologies to improve the global quality of life...We are committed to improving our shared planet in a way that leaves it better for our children than we found it.”

To understand iSun one needs to look at its chairman and CEO Jeffrey Peck 51 an outdoorsy man who seems to be uncomfortable answering questions on Zoom but is absolutely intent on answering them fully and honestly.

His father Harvey Peck founded Peck Electric in Williston in 1972. When he had to leave the business for health reasons in 1981 his wife Diane Cone took it over. This in itself is remarkable because not too many women were running construction companies way back then. In 1994 Jeffrey joined the business. In 1999 he bought it.

Over the years the company moved from doing residential electrical work to industrial work for IBM and other large companies. In 2009 it went into solar and it has been a leader in solar energy ever since.

Peck Electric went public in 2019. Late last year it acquired another company a Canadian provider of “solar power electric mobility and smart city solutions for government commercial retail academic and data-center projects” called iSun (hence the company's new name) in a non-cash stock transaction. Its sole employee remains headquartered in Montreal.

And just last month Peck acquired the Waterbury Vermont residential solar panel company SunCommon for $40 million.

It also recently secured a $30 million commitment for development and professional services from Fusion Renewable and a $7 million EPC for a 448 megawatt solar project in Alabama.

Most of the people I talked to about the company attributed its growth primarily to Jeff Peck's foresight and vision. One person I talked to said — and you don't hear this very often — “He has deep respect for the honor of work.”

But if you ask Peck himself why his company has been so successful he has only one answer: “People people people.”

“You can't build a great business without great people and you have great people by taking care of them” Peck said. “We want to bring renewable energy everywhere. And when you take care of your people and you treat them well you value their work you give honor and dignity into what those people do then I think it helps you become an employer of choice. And that helps you build a business for the long term. And that was incredibly important to us.”

Some of Peck's managers have been with him for over 30 years. And iSun has been a signatory to the local Union (IBEW Vermont Local 300) since Peck Electric’s inception in 1972. Being a union shop provides the company with skilled labor that allows them to scale up-quickly from project to project.

The company estimates that it has between 200 and 250 active union members.

Business can be a force for good says Chad Farrell the founder and CEO of Encore Renewable Energy a Vermont B-Corp company which has worked with iSun on multi-million dollar projects for 10 years.

“We focus on not only the economic bottom line but the social and environmental bottom lines” Farrell said. “iSun's position as a union shop offering a good livable prevailing wage or even better than prevailing wage has always spoke to us as a really positive attribute of their philosophy and their approach.”

Being a union shop will be increasingly important as the U.S. begins to attach values to the profit motive Farrell said.

“I can say that's going to be a differentiator in the marketplace moving forward” he said. “As the country starts to put more of an equity lens on our economy as we really start to think more about being more than just a shareholder economy offering those competitive wages and having the union behind them truly is a differentiator.”

Duane Peterson is the co-founder and co-president along with James Moore of SunCommon Vermont's largest solar energy company which was just acquired by iSun.

Peterson has known Peck since SunCommon hired Peck Electric to install its very first residential and commercial solar panels. He said Vermont values lie at the core of Peck's approach.

“I think a lot of people in business talk about the workforce as a cost” Peterson said. “And I think Jeff sees his workers as his primary asset. He treats them as human beings with respect and decency. And that's how you get to innovation — by having a really highly functioning motivated respected workforce.”

Working with Peck has been a pleasure Peterson said.

“I've always appreciated that he's calm and kind and friendly” he said. “And again those are not necessarily qualities associated with successful business executives. But those are the qualities of the people I want to hang out with. I think that served him really really well. And coming back to the acquisition this isn't some random guy in Ohio who we sold to. This is Jeff Peck and we know him and respect him dearly. He's a fellow Vermonter which matters a lot.”

Last year iSun reported a “COVID year” revenue of around $21 million. This year Peck said it will double that.

With the two acquisitions neatly stowed away iSun now employs 350 people.

Energy independence means a great deal to Peck.

“In my lifetime I remember a lot of conversations around becoming energy independent” Peck said. “And recently that was achieved. I think now our focus should transition to how do we become renewable energy dependent? And rather than try to decide how much should be 'dirty energy' I think our focus should be on how do we get to all clean renewable energy? And if we put that out there as our goal and what we should want to do as a country then eventually we'll get there. The long term goal should be renewable energy independence.”

Early Life

The Peck family has deep ties to Vermont.

“I come from a long long line of Vermonters on one side” Peck said.

“And my mother's side of the family was from Canada. Both parents were born and raised in Vermont.”

Peck has an older brother and a younger sister; neither of them joined the company.

Their father Harvey Peck was an electrician by trade.

“As I've heard this story it was a turbulent time in Vermont for construction probably for the country” Peck said. “And he had to make a decision. Was he going to travel to where the work was or stay in Vermont and start his own business? So he chose the latter. I give him a lot of credit.”

Peck's values come from his parents.

“Probably the words of my parents would have been along the lines that it was important to be in a people business” Peck said. “And construction is a people business. You have employees you have customers you're working with you have vendors.”

It is also important to be in the type of a business where you can make your accomplishments tangible.

“Something you could see the completion of” Peck said. “Also working as a team I think was important. And so I think that was the foundation of the family discussions around the business. All of our discussions were always around the people that work here. And the people that we did work for. It's like an extended family.”

Peck started working in the company when he was very young.

“When you grow up in a family business it feels like you're always working in the family business” he said. “You're always doing something. Oftentimes on the weekends I would be at the offices just doing something to be kept busy. I remember being eight or nine somewhere in there going to job sites and trying to help maybe sweeping or something like that. And it became a joke — they didn't like me going to projects anymore. I must have done a terrible job sweeping.”

In the early 1980s Harvey Peck fell ill and his wife took over the business.

“She was at a crossroads” Peck said. “She needed to decide 'Do I let the business end? And with it what we've done what we've built? Or do I step in and try to make this work.' So she brought in some partners and chose the latter.”

His mother had not worked outside the home before.

“She got married really young and had children right away” Peck said. “So by 1981 when my father left the business and she started running the day-to-day operation she was 31 years old with three kids. But the people in the business were like family the customers were like family. So you know she persevered.”

Peck wasn't sure how his mother brought on other investors.

“I know they needed some investments to keep the operation running and growing” he said. “And there's always financing concerns when you're growing a business right? And so she brought in two partners with much more of a construction background. Obviously she wasn't an electrician and needed partners who were electricians. She brought two of them in and raise a little bit of money and moved forward.”

At the time probably between 20 or 25 people worked for the company.

Peck went to Champlain College and took a degree in business. Then he had to decide whether to stay in Vermont or seek his fortunes elsewhere.

“I knew this business was incredibly hard and I wasn't sure that I wanted to just stay in Vermont and work in this business” he said. “But in college I came in and started working a little bit. And I fell in love with the people we work with and the people we work for and you know seeing the progress of what you did every day. It was good work. And so I stayed.”

But he never became an electrician.

“No I don't have any field training” he said. “We have lots of great people here who have those experiences. So I came in and was on the operational and financial side.”

So far he's not missed seeing the world.

“I love Vermont” he said. “I think I'd always felt that was always home for me. At a young age I wasn't sure I could stay here and earn a living. And obviously there's curiosity about what else is out there in the world. I think youth is wasted on the young as they say right?”

Changing Technology

By the time Peck took over the company had left residential electric far behind and was focusing on the industrial sector. It did a lot of work for IBM for example wiring their new manufacturing facilities.

“Our company is an innovative company that has always been working on the latest and greatest technology and trying to bring those technologies to the customer” Peck said. “And so working on IBM's semiconductor labs the technology was always changing. It was always new technology and new challenges. It was good and exciting work.”

iSun continues to work for Global Foundries as well as for other large companies.

Next Peck took on communications.

“We started to do communications work as the telecom industry got really busy and active” he said. “We developed that skill set and differentiated ourselves and helped move that technology forward.”

Going Solar

In 2009 through his executive vice president Kip Myrick Peck got interested in solar energy.

“Kip who has been with the company for over 30 years probably prior to 2009 thought that we should get into solar” Peck said. “He thought it was the next thing and really pushed hard for it. We thought that it was the time to look at something transformational for the business something new. Solar was an exciting new technology with lots of opportunities. We'd built a good business where we could build complicated large projects. And so the transition to solar and constructing those projects was really we felt a pretty natural transition. Solar is the greatest investment we can make right now. We're determined to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy.”

During the Obama administration federal subsidies spurred on the solar industry. But Peck doesn't see subsidies as being particularly important.

“I think there's subsidies on all kinds of energy” Peck said. “I think there have always been some tax credits and things associated with solar prior to when we got into it. But what's really helped the acceleration of the adoption of solar has been the decreasing prices in solar panels. And then the efficiencies built into constructing it.”

Subsidies may have gotten a bad rap early on Peck said.

“For some reason there's been a real focus on subsidies” he said. “Maybe it's because there were some early bad performers. But you know in any new evolving industry there will be bad performers. There will be failures. I'm sure if we went back 100 years and looked at the oil industry I'm sure we had lots of failures. Bad things happen. That doesn't make every other energy company or the industry bad. There were some bad actors or bad players early on in solar. But it's a great market in the energy business. It's completely renewable.”

From the beginning solar energy was a seductive force to Peck.

“With my experience building projects in the semiconductor industry we always hear that the next chip is going to be twice as fast and twice as small and half the price” Peck said. “And we're sort of seeing that same transition in solar technology. We've seen the output by the panels get much larger and at much lower cost. So that's really helped drive and move the industry forward — to make it affordable. Now we can produce solar power that is less expensive than any of the other dirty energies.”

To make his point Peck mentioned the recent California oil spill that ruined some Orange County beaches. But he recognizes that the United States needs an energy mix right now.

“All kinds of energy are important” Peck said. “For now solar will not solve every problem. But it should be where we're putting the majority of our investments as we look for the business solution for the climate crisis. And as we look to provide clean renewable energy for people with no secondary negative side effects.”

The controversial nuclear energy option he believes is off the table.

“I don't think we'll ever build another nuclear plant in this country” he said.

Building Relationships

Peck's solid relationships in the solar energy field are now fueling iSun's growth. Some of those relationships are a decade long and going strong.

For example when SunCommon was founded in 2012 it needed solar installers. That's when it found Peck Electric.

“When James and I started SunCommon we brought our backgrounds in campaigning and marketing but had never worked in solar” Peterson said. “If we had arrogantly assumed we could handle the construction aspects we surely would have messed it up. So we turned to Vermont's largest electrical contractor that had launched a solar division Peck Electric. That partnership flourished as SunCommon grew the sector and Peck built a few thousand residential solar arrays for us as well as a couple dozen larger community solar arrays. So I think of Jeff as an extraordinarily professional and competent construction executive but one who is always driven to innovation.”

In 2018 they parted ways.

“As SunCommon matured and we hired Operations who knew what they were doing we brought construction in-house” Peterson said. “So we parted ways with Peck in deep respect and appreciation for what we'd done together. Peck then focused on the larger commercial solar segment; SunCommon expanded our residential and small commercial segment. Until we just re-connected bringing all that we both offer together under one roof. Now the band is back together.”

Peck Electric offered a dedicated unionized construction work force that it could put in the field. That was one of the attractions to Encore which originates designs develops finances and permits solar installations. As an installer in 2011 it chose Peck.

“At that point we were in fact a very small development shop” CEO Farrell said. “But they had dozens if not hundreds of employees available to actually do the work in the field. We didn't have that right? So it was a very deliberate and effective partnership where they were essentially bringing all the labor that we needed to build the projects. And we were bringing the projects themselves.”

The relationship was symbiotic Farrell said.

“I like to think we’re sort of the origination partner in the relationship” he said. “And they are essentially the construction partner. They have served as the electrical services contractor on greater than 95 percent of the projects that we've delivered and are working on.”

Right now the two companies have 10 active projects going forward.

“All of these are several 100 kilowatts or multiple megawatts” Farrell said. “So they supported the deployment of about $100 million of capital investment to date with more always coming into the pipeline. But those 10 projects that we're actively collaborating on now have a total cost of around $30 million. We serve as the origination partner or the developer and they are coming in and procuring a lot of the equipment the men managing subcontractors and ultimately helping us actually construct these projects in the field.”

Going forward iSun is also developing its own projects.

“Their business model to date has been more as an electrical services contractor” Farrell said. “But obviously as they grow they see opportunities out there as well. We're looking forward to supporting them on some of those early development efforts as they move into that market.”

Going Public

Peck Electric was looking at going public because “we wanted to build a renewable energy platform focused on solar” Peck said.

What does that mean?

“It means we wanted to be able to touch all the sectors within renewable energy where solar would be provided” Peck said. “So there is the residential market there's the commercial market there's an industrial market and then there's the large utility-scale market. We wanted to make sure that we were going to be involved and impactful in each one of those sectors.”

Peck needed capital for that kind of growth so he became an early adaptor in the new SPAC market.

A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is like a shell company: It's a stock you can buy that doesn’t have the support of an underlying business. It is formed by investors who go public and then go searching for a company to buy. Once the SPAC has bought a company it becomes public the investors take their stock shares and disappear and the company carries on saved from going through the complicated IPO process.

In this case the SPAC was a company called Jensyn Acquisition Group from Freehold New Jersey.

H Kenneth Merritt Jr of the Vermont law firm Merritt and Merritt is currently iSun's attorney. He became the company's lawyer in 2020 to help with acquisitions handle SEC reporting and filing and take care of other day-to-day matters. He was not involved with the company when it became a wholly-owned subsidy of Jensyn but he offered me some insight into the SPAC system.

“SPACs are sort of the latest thing” Merritt said. “There's just tons of money flowing into them. This particular one called Jensyn went public in 2014 I believe and raised about $40 million. They had been looking for an acquisition candidate — an operating company — for a long period of time. And Peck Electric was interested in going public. So they did a bit of transaction by merging Peck into Jensyn and changing the name to Peck Company.”

On Tuesday July 2nd 2019 the whole Peck family — including mother Diane Cone — plus Myrick and his family and seven others from the company rang the closing bell at NASDAQ in New York City to mark the occasion.

Acquisitions

Once Peck had capital it turned its attention to acquisitions to expand its reach.

It bought iSun in January of this year.

“The Peck Company purchased iSun which had solar power car ports canopies and EV charging systems” Peck said. “So we bought them and rebranded in January to iSun.”

The growing popularity of electric vehicles was a big stimulus.

“We believe that the transition to electric vehicles is going to cause massive increase in demand” Peck said. “When we acquired iSun it was because they had a solar carport with EV charging. And we thought that that connection to the vehicle would be incredibly important.”

While it is still unknown where the demand for solar will hit in each sector iSun will be there waiting.

“We want to help accelerate the adoption of solar in every sector” Peck said. “So as we see this increase in adoption of electric vehicles and the infrastructure required for the charging we want to be involved.”

Last month the company also acquired its old friend SunCommon for $40 million — $24 million in cash and $16 million in stock. .

“So with SunCommon we are now in a residential space as well” Peck said. “After going public with the goal of having a renewable energy platform that we can service each sector in the industry we thought it was important to be in front of the homeowner who after purchasing their electric vehicle will I think will naturally want to use as much renewable energy as they can. Having solar on their home to offset those costs and helping with the new demands on the grid I think will be incredibly important.”

For SunCommon this was the next step in its evolution.

The company had to shut down for a few months when the pandemic hit but when it reopened it found there was a great consumer demand for clean energy products. So although its revenues were smaller due to the pandemic it still ended the year with $33.1 million in revenues.

“So it's the beginning of this year our board of directors asked us to imagine what's next” Peterson said. “We are committed to doing everything we can to build clean energy. The challenge then was how to expand how to do more. And in discussions with our various friends we spoke to Jeff Peck who we know really well from the partnership we had when SunCommon was formed. We had heard he'd cooked up a clean energy platform. And we both concluded that the iSun platform would benefit from residential and small commercial kind of business units to combine with its utility and industrial scale units and its EV charging network.”

SunCommon with its entire staff including management intact is now a wholly owned subsidiary of iSun.

“Of the $40 million about $2.5 million is going to the SunCommon employees” Peterson said. “So they're each getting $2000 of cash and some iSun stock.”

iSun Strategy

The acquisitions have positioned iSun to be a leader in solar energy.

“I think they're a fantastic company” Merritt said. “I've very much enjoyed working with them. They're obviously focused on the solar industry which is absolutely essential in combating climate change and they now have the capacity to serve sort of the whole range of the solar industry from residential small commercial to utility scale and larger commercial projects. So I think they're extremely well positioned given anticipated infrastructure spending and the country moving away from fossil fuels to alternative energy.”

Although he wouldn't divulge any company secrets Merritt indicated that more acquisitions are in the company's future.

“There will almost certainly be additional future acquisitions” Merritt said. “They have a very well-defined growth strategy. Initially they are focused on the Northeast expanding further geographically with other acquisitions of residential solar companies. So they'll be up and down the East Coast and they also have operations in the West. I think the goal is to continue to grow and expand the footprint.”

Solar can become an organization's brand. It can be a representation of an organization's values.

These are iSun's selling points.

“When people see a business that has solar on their roof and they've embraced renewable energy that's a brand people want to be associated with” Peck said. “That's incredibly important. Not only can a company save money but it'll build brand credibility. And so too with electric vehicles. Having that visual representation of an organization's value with carports and EV charging we thought would be really important.”

As electric vehicle adoption accelerates electric bills are going to go up.

“Most people are going to charge their cars at home or at work” Peck said. “We knew that being connected to that customer early would help with the acceleration of the transition to renewable energy and to the electric vehicle. Because you've seen this with Tesla. The energy market is your home powering your car — it's all connected. The batteries give your home resiliency.”

Transferring to an electric car can be uncomfortable for some people. So iSun wants to connect with those customers early to help them through the process.

“It's new” Peck said. “It's different. And we've been in this business for 13 years now. In the solar business that's a long time. And so we want to take what we've learned and help people transition. We want to make them feel comfortable about it. We really love the way that SunCommon is connected with their customers. So that was important to us.”

Peck said he tends to be “product agnostic” meaning he is not wedded to any particular solar brand or product.

“I want to find the best solution for the customer and meet them where they want to be sold to” he said. “If we were building a specific product you know we feel obligated to try to just sell that one product to them. We want to be able to sell to our customer the right product for their needs. There are a lot of solar products out there.”

Sometimes things go wrong out there.

“Every company that you'll talk to always has a great highlight reel right?” Peck said. “We can all give you a corporate resume and tell you all the great things we've done. I think what really matters when things go wrong when things go bad is how you respond and what you do. We have a 50-year history. We make it right.”

For example while doing a 7 megawatt project someone superimposed a number and the many truckloads of panels that arrived were the wrong ones.

“So we purchased another 7 megawatts of panels” Peck said. “But we were able to repurpose the other panels and use them on other projects. But it was important that we make projects right when things go wrong.”

It's all part of being a people business Peck said returning to his main theme.

“Why I love the business is that I've been around a long time” he said. “I know people. I've committed to relationships. So when a mistake like that is made because we've been around so long we're able to find the right panels and make the project right and and still make the schedule.”

iSun Today

iSun's reach is growing.

“We're in every New England state plus New York” Peck said. “We have projects in Pennsylvania Maryland North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee and Alabama. And then we actually have a large utility scale project that we're working on in Colorado as well.”

The new $30 million contract from Fusion Renewable is to find and build solar projects throughout the United States.

“It is a group of Israeli oil and gas — and as I like to say dirty energy — companies who recognize that they want to diversify and transition to renewable energy” Peck said. “They already own some dirty energy assets in the U.S. And they own some natural gas assets. We started working with them a few months ago after making an acquisition in the utility side of the business. We brought in an employee to focus on that part of the business. These are large projects. We are helping them own operate acquire and build solar assets. They're excited to transition to clean energy.”

The Israelis came to iSun because its work touches on all the different sectors.

“Out of all the companies in the country they came to us for a really one-stop service” Peck said.

The $7 million from Fusion Renewable is the Alabama project.

“What we were able to do with this project was to find land” Peck said. “And to get interconnection agreements to the grid through Alabama Power to build renewable energy. Even as dark red of a state as Alabama is is now recognizing that consumers and businesses are focused on ESG (environmental social and corporate governance). They want to understand where their energy mix is coming from.”

States that were traditionally opposed to solar energy are now embracing it Peck said.

“The costs are lower than the dirty energy” he said. “And businesses that want to expand into their states want to know that the utilities are making a commitment to invest in renewable energy. So the Alabama project was a contract for $7 million for us to first design and develop the solar array. And then once we have permits which should take somewhere between nine months and maybe two years then we build a large solar array in Alabama.”

The project will be built on 2600 acres.

“It was part of a 30000-acre timber forest” Peck said. “The 2600 area had been recently cut. They wanted to record their harvesting timber and recycling every year and that section was ready to be replanted. But the owners of the land said 'We think the state of Alabama needs renewable energy.' They wanted to find a way to put solar on their property.”

For quite a few years the fossil fuel industry has been working to impose higher taxes on solar projects. But Peck is undaunted.

“There will always be bad people at work looking out for their own best interests” he said. “The great thing about working in renewable energy and solar is that you feel like you're doing good while you're doing your job. I don't know what those forces want to do or why they would be opposed to renewable energy.”

The Future

The future looks bright for iSun. Homeowners are transitioning to electric vehicles now. Soon state and local governments as well as businesses will be making the same transition with their fleets.

“Because of our longevity and the depth and breadth of our knowledge in the industry we can really help accelerate that transition” Peck said. “We can provide them with EV charging we can provide them with solar carports we can provide them with solar on the roof of their businesses we can build them out in the field and connect that to their meters. We made an investment in software which can help manage the vehicles so as you run a business with a lot of different vehicles you're managing your fleet. You know how much you're spending to charge. So we take a holistic approach to the industry. We want to help accelerate the adoption for solar energy.”

Peck has two sons and a daughter who might be interested in joining the family company.

“My daughter is 20 and she's at Providence College” he said. “She was thinking law and now she's transitioned to business. Like me growing up around the businesses in a home where they have a business there's a lot of conversations about it. My oldest son works in Boston in real estate finance. And my middle son is still in college at New York University He has worked here several summers. He's installed. He's worked on electrical construction jobs doing the dirty work. He's worked on installing solar panels on the roofs of projects. He worked on the YMCA project in downtown Burlington. He worked around the office this summer. He's seen the business up close. So he's certainly interested. I think they all really like and enjoy the business.”

No matter how large he can scale up his company Peck insisted he is committed to remaining in Vermont and growing jobs here.

“While we've talked a lot about the routes we're going Vermont's my home” he said. “As long as I'm doing this Vermont will be our home. We're always looking for ways to grow the business but I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we're committed to Vermont. It's where we were founded it's our home it's where our values are. We want to take the good stuff that we've gotten from the people in the relationships here in Vermont export them to other places while we're bringing renewable energy. So I think that'll create a lot of opportunities with jobs and growth for the people who live here now.”

Peck has often said that young people should be more exposed to opportunities in the trades that the state needs electricians plumbers contractors and carpenters maybe more than it needs English professors.

“I think that is an issue” Peck said. “I'll see young men and women come out of college and apply in an apprenticeship program and come to work for us. And oftentimes they'll say 'Oh I wish I had known about this before I went to school.' I worry sometimes that there's this whole group of people who would love to work in renewable energy and can come in work and learn the skills and learn the trade. But maybe they've been told that that isn't the right next step for them in their life. There's lots of ways to learn and there's lots of good and meaningful work. I think that we like to bring honor and dignity to that type of work and make sure that people understand that we value it. It's great work. You're building something that'll last decades that will produce renewable energy every day.”

Even as an employer of choice Peck said he is still having trouble finding workers.

“I would love to have a lot of people interested in entering the renewable energy space” he said. “It is a somewhat of a difficult time for hiring. But I don't think we're unique. I think everyone's having a hard time. We're all trying to figure out how to move forward post COVID. How do you integrate people into your workforce? How do you continue to grow? How do you meet the employees in a way that they want to work? I think it's an adjustment for everybody. But again you know we're focused on growing the business and being an employer of choice.”

Peck is building an energy company that will last deep into the future.

“For me it's about the team that's with us and getting to do this great work with them” he said. “It's about working with them every day and seeing we're building something with some longevity. The product we're building will last for 40 years and produce energy. And I get to do it with such a great team of people every day. For me that's the fun stuff.”

As the world slowly moves away from using fossil fuels for electricity a tiny Scottish island has shown it’s possible to rely almost entirely on renewables.

The community living on the Isle of Eigg were the first in the world to set up their own off-grid energy system powered by wind water and the Sun.

Since it was launched in 2008 they have received visitors from several other countries wanting to learn more about the project.

Community Energy Malawi used their experience to set up a solar minigrid in Sitolo village a community that previously relied on fossil fuels and firewood.

According to the recently launched and expanded Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) 2030 the farm will have a total capacity of 10 megawatts-peak (MWp).

“This solar PV [photovoltaic] farm will generate one percent of the total energy demand in [Demerara Berbice Interconnected System] DBIS” LCDS 2030 states.

This farm will be financed by the Guyana-Norway partnership. Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo said that fund stands at currently US$84 million.

Advertisements were already done by the Guyana Power and Light (GPL) Inc. for consulting services for topographic surveys flood risk assessments and geotechnical investigations of the site earmarked for this farm and seven others. These farms will be built under the Guyana Utility Scale Solar Photovoltaic Programme (GUYSOL).

The PPP/C Government’s solar agenda is wide-reaching and comprehensive as part of President Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali’s plan to deliver 500 MW of new power by the end of 2025.

In addition to the farms to be funded through Guyana’s forest preservation funds the Government also intends to power the homes of 30000 hinterland families using solar PV units.

Senior Minister in the Office of the President with responsibility for Finance Dr. Ashni Singh made that announcement on September 29 when he signed a US$7.2 million line of credit from the Indian Technical Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme.

Further solar farms will be built at Bartica and Lethem using some of the proceeds of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) under the Energy Matrix Diversification and Institutional Strengthening of the Department of Energy Project. The executing agency the Guyana Energy Agency (GEA) has already sought bidders to supply and install transmission lines to accommodate them.

The solar farms in addition to the other energy sources which will be implemented will result in a cleaner energy mix that will reduce emissions and provide cheaper energy for businesses and families. (Extracted and modified from the Department of Public Infiormation)"

It was this week in 1989 in a fit of Anglican euphoria Jaguar P.L.C. became a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. after Ford spent $2.38 billion to acquire the fabled British automaker. Ford’s bid is $13.32 a share nearly double the company’s valuation.

Ratan Tata at right then-chairman of Tata Motors buys Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor Co. in 2008.

The deal shouldn’t have been a surprise especially to the executives at General Motors who had been jostling with Ford to obtain the British company for several weeks after Ford announced its intent on buying the company in September.

Ford’s acquisition came as a blow given that GM spent the previous nine months negotiating to buy a stake in Jaguar. It was a move that Jaguar’s then-chairman Sir John Egan preferred. It would maintain Jaguar’s independence and bring a needed cash infusion. Furthermore Egan knew the folks in the executive suite of GM; he had once worked as an executive in GM’s European operations.

But Jaguar’s independence had been undermined by the British government the week before Ford’s takeover when it lifted a restriction limiting another company from owning more than 15% of Jaguar through the end of the 1990.

In response to Ford’s move GM issued a statement saying the company “concluded that the maximum value that could be assigned to all of the Jaguar shares was very significantly below the £8.50 being offered.” The company said Ford’s price “couldn’t be justified.”

Why Ford needed Jaguar

Ford bought Jaguar at a time when other Detroit makers were snapping up European companies such as GM’s investment in Lotus in 1986.

The takeover was merely the latest in a number of acquisitions by American automakers at the time. GM invested $32 million in Group Lotus in 1986. Chrysler bought a 15.5% stake in Maserati in 1986 and purchased Lamborghini for $25 million in 1987.

Not to be outdone Ford initially considered acquiring Alfa Romeo in 1986 for a rumored $2.5 billion for a 19.5% share gradually increasing to 51% within three years. Henry Ford II was allegedly smitten quoted in the Los Angeles Times as having said “Whenever I see an Alfa Romeo go by I take off my hat.” But Ford lost the bid to Fiat which took 100% control paying more than $5 billion to make sure the Italian automaker didn’t end up under American control. Instead Ford acquired a 75% stake in Aston Martin Lagonda in 1987. But while Aston Martins were certainly prestigious they were built in very small numbers.

So Ford considered buying Saab and Jaguar negotiating to buy both companies. But Ford’s chairman Harold “Red” Poling decided Ford couldn’t manage both acquisitions and dropped out of the Saab talks. GM later bought a controlling stake in the company.

American automakers were looking to the old country for European luxury brands that would battle Mercedes-Benz and BMW on the international stage at a time when their sales were booming. Ford’s own luxury brand Lincoln while still popular in America produced vehicles built for American tastes not international ones. They tried and failed to solve the problem with the short-lived Merkur brand.

Ford’s attempts at expanding the Jaguar line-up with models such as the S-Type were less successful than hoped because it shared its platform with the Lincoln LS.

What Ford got

Jaguar had been spun off from British Leyland in 1980 and while the mothership continued its slide toward oblivion Jaguar prospered by comparison. Still by the time of Ford’s acquisition Jaguar was in trouble. Despite some robust sales during the 1980s the company was barely breaking even and selling 51939 cars in 1988. Jaguar’s factories were antiquated its quality abysmal — and Ford knew it.

“It wasn’t that Jaguar’s quality was bad it was horrendous” said Bill Hayden Jaguar’s new chairman in industry publication Automotive News. “It was a terrible organization making terrible cars.” In fact Jaguar’s Browns Lane plant was said to be nearly as bad the Gorky car plant in the former Soviet Union.

Other vehicles such as the XJS’s replacement the XK8 proved more popular.

Despite the challenges Jaguar had a well-placed advocate within Ford Motor Co.: William Clay Ford Sr. father of William Clay Ford Jr. Ford’s chairman. The old man had been driving Jaguars since his college days.

But the company needed protection. Volume dropped from 49000 in 1988 to 20000 in 1992. It’s reported the company was losing $1 million a day. Some within Ford wondered if the company could be saved.

But Ford persevered introducing new models such as a redesigned fifth-generation XJ6 with an all-new 5.0-liter V-8 and the new XK8 which replaced the ancient XJS. Efforts to expand Jaguar’s line-up were less successful than expected. The midsized S-Type and compact X-Type were never viewed as true Jaguars as they shared their platforms with Lincoln LS and Ford Mondeo/Contour.

Ford made huge strides in improving Jaguar’s manufacturing and build quality. But by 2008 having lost $15 billion during the previous two years Ford sold Jaguar and Land Rover (which had bought Land Rover from BMW for $2.8 billion in 2000) for $2.3 billion to Tata Motors of India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UuZm9yZC5jb20vc2VyaWVzL2RyYWctcmFjaW5nL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmhyYS8yMDIxLzExL3Rhc2NhLXdpbnMtZmluYWxzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bob Tasca III Motorcraft/Quick Lane Team Wins Auto Club NHRA Finals,"POMONA Calif. – Bob Tasca III and the Motorcraft/Quick Lane Funny Car Team won the Auto Club NHRA Finals this evening (Nov. 14). As a result Tasca vaulted into third place in the final 2021 NHRA Nitro Funny Car standings setting a personal best. Today’s win was also Tasca’s third race victory of the season yet another career high.

“We didn’t win the war but we won the battle today in this Motorcraft car” said Tasca. “It’s just such a privilege to drive this for the Ford fans and for the sponsors on this car. I’ll tell you this Jim Farley (Ford CEO) is watching. He’s got Ford Motor Company on fire and he’s got this team on fire. When no one believed in me he did. He set us on this path to win and chase a championship. We didn’t get it this year but we’re coming after it next year.”

The Tasca-driven Mustang knocked off a pair of former world champions en route to today’s victory. Tasca toppled 2018 champ J.R. Todd in the first round before edging 16-time champ John Force by 0.0049 seconds (approximately 2 feet) in the semifinals. In the final against Alexis DeJoria Tasca was first off the starting line and led for the duration of the race clocking a 3.955 ET at 321.65 mph. His margin of victory was 0.0448 or nearly 21 feet.

See additional race coverage on NHRA's website.



Tasca’s other two wins this season occurred in back-to-back events Las Vegas (April 18) and Atlanta (May 2). He now owns nine career NHRA Nitro Funny Car wins.

“All of us at Motorcraft are thrilled to see Bob finish off the 2021 season on a high note in Los Angeles” said Jonathan Orth Marketing Manager for Ford Customer Service Division (FCSD). “Ford and Motorcraft are incredibly thankful for the excellent work that Bob and his team have put into representing our organizations this season. We’re already looking forward to 2022.”

Through his role as team owner and driver Tasca works to help Ford attract and retain automotive technicians by talking to students who participate in NHRA’s YES (Youth and Education Services) programs.

When the chip supply tightened some companies paused entire production lines for some vehicles and decided to keep building others while removing some of the less-vital high-tech features that require chips. It kept production lines moving and people working. Not every automaker wanted to replicate the scenes of all of those new Ford and GM trucks that were built earlier this year and then had to be parked as they waited to be run through the factories a second time to get the various chip components installed. So we decided to collect a list of models and technologies that will not (or did not) match the original spec sheet because certain components have been removed to reduce the number of chips needed per vehicle. This is not an exhaustive list but it does show the breadth and depth of how the chip shortage is affecting the auto industry even as new cars are built and sold.

Ford was betting on a lightweight Galaxie but the full-size wasn't fast enough. So FoMoCo went ahead and created a new Super Stock dragster from scratch: the Thunderbolt.Even though the lightweight version of the Galaxie proved competitive on closed circuits it wasn't quite quick enough to win against the mighty Chevrolet Impala Z11 at the drag strip. Ford needed an even lighter car and since the Galaxie was already as stripped down as it could be the company started looking into different platforms.Ford eventually went with the Fairlane which had been redesigned into a midsize for the 1962 model year. At just under 3000 pounds (1361 kg) the fourth-gen Fairlane 500 was more than 600 pounds (272 kg) lighter than the Galaxie. To save even more weight Ford took the lessons it learned while creating the lightweight Galaxie and applied them to the smaller Fairlane.As a result the Thunderbolt rolled off the assembly line devoid of sound-deadening material seam sealer heaters and radios while the fenders hood and decklid were made from fiberglass. Ford also replaced the stock steel bumpers with aluminum units.Weight-saving surgery didn't stop here though. The factory glass was swapped out of plexiglass panels while the factory seats were removed to make way for almost flat buckets. These came from... wait for it... Econoline vans.But prepping the Thunderbolt for drag duty wasn't all fun and games. Race-spec Galaxies used the massive NASCAR-spec 427-cubic-inch (7.0-liter) V8 an engine that was too big for the fourth-gen Fairlane. The latter came with mills no larger than the 289-cubic-inch (4.7-liter) V8.Ford's solution to this problem was to ship Fairlanes with the 289 Hi-Po option and fitted with the rock-solid nine-inch rear axle as standard to the Dearborn Steel Tubing company for the Thunderbolt conversion.To fit the 427 between the front fenders DST engineers had to make quite a few modifications starting with shaping the tubular headers around the front suspension components. Since the 427 V8 also had a high-rise intake the hood had to be fitted with a tear-drop-shaped bulge now one of Thunderbolt's most iconic visual features.Finally Ford replaced the inner high-beam headlamps with massive scoops that fed air into the engine giving the Thunderbolt's front fascia an even more intimidating look.Once finished the Fairlane Thunderbolt had 425 horsepower to brag about. But that was only on paper as racers estimated an output that exceeded 500 horsepower. Weight-wise the drag racer came in at just over 3200 pounds (1451 kg) which was the NHRA minimum for the Super Stock class.Actually the story goes that the Thunderbolt turned out to be too light for the category in the initial configuration so Ford had to put one of the steel bumpers back on the car. That's why most Thunderbolts have steel bumpers in the rear and aluminum bumpers in the front.Ford was able to put together the 50-car minimum to homologate the Thunderbolt for the 1964 season and went on to debut with a win at the Winternationals. The final was a Thunderbolt affair with Gas Ronda defeating Butch Leal for the trophy. With quarter-mile times in the 11-second bracket the Thunderbolt also went on to take the NHRA Top Stock crown that year as well as the NHRA Manucturers' Cup.FoMoCo ultimately built 100 Thunderbolts in 1964 49 fitted with four-speed manuals and 51 equipped with three-speed Cruise-O-Matics.While most of these cars survived years of hard racing and were eventually restored to factory specs coming across a Thunderbolt is a rare occasion nowadays. And needless to say they're far more expensive than the regular Fairlane 500  usually going under the hammer for more than $200000. Quite fitting for one of Ford's most spectacular factory-built drag racers."

George Fox is the only known Unangax̂ soldier killed in action in World War II and any war since. He’s also been buried in an unmarked grave in Unalaska for over 70 years. Now nearly a decade of work will culminate in a Memorial Day 2022 ceremony to recognize and honor him.

Michael Livingston is the cultural heritage specialist for the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association and one of the people who has made Fox’s long-awaited commemoration happen.

“The procession will start in the parking lot of the Russian Orthodox Church and proceed down Bayview Drive to Memorial Park where there will be some speeches” Livingston said. “The gravestone will be placed at Pvt. George Fox’s gravesite next to his mother Emma Fox.”

Fox was born in 1920 on Unga Island the largest of the Shumagin islands about 250 miles northeast of Unalaska. Census data shows that he and his mother moved to Unalaska by 1929 and he joined the military when he was about 21 years old according to Livingston.

Fox was killed fighting in Ardea Italy in 1944. About five years later his body was returned to Unalaska. After a small procession he was buried next to his mother in an unmarked grave Livingston said.

It took a lot of work to confirm that Fox was buried in Unalaska Livingston said. That was just the start of the battle in getting Fox a proper gravestone.

“Request after request was ignored” he said. “I’d fill out all the paperwork and send it in and expect a response. I’d wait weeks and months and nothing would happen.”

Livingston said he provided over a dozen pages of evidence that Fox was an active U.S. Army soldier but his appeals continually met resistance. That’s until he contacted Sen. Dan Sullivan.

“Sen. Sullivan’s office made it very clear that Pvt. George Fox was serving he was killed in action and that the gravestone needed to be ordered” he said.

The gravestone was finally ordered this summer largely in thanks to Sullivan Livingston said.

He said it was a huge relief to finally see the photos of the marker and know that it was awaiting placement at the Russian Orthodox Church in Unalaska.

“It was also a big relief to actually get the date pinned down” Livingston said. “Memorial Day 2022 is an excellent date to honor Pvt. George Fox because that’s a national holiday.”

Livingston is glad to see progress being made for Fox but he sees a big difference in how others — who are not people of color — are sometimes recognized with greater honor and more immediate attention.

“When you compare some of what occurred during World War II or shortly after World War II people who were white were highly honored” Livingston said. “Their gravestones were ordered very quickly after their passing even if their passing was not honorable even if … people weren’t killed in action which is one of the highest honors in the United States military.”

It’s also an honor in Unangax̂ culture to die in battle according to Livingston.

“Back before Europeans arrived in the Aleutians in 1741 people who died in battle were elevated” he said. “Songs were written about them so they wouldn’t be forgotten.”

For Livingston this gravestone represents a fight for racial and social justice.

The marker is solid granite and nearly four feet tall. It includes Fox’s name his date of birth his honors — including a Purple Heart and his recognition as an “Unangax̂ warrior” — and at the bottom is a special engraving of Fox’s own words.

“We found a letter that he wrote from Anzio beach to his father in Unga” Livingston said. “We were able to have engraved three words from that letter and those words are: ‘wish all love’.”

Fox’s ceremony is scheduled for Memorial Day 2022 and is hosted by the Unga Tribal Council Ounalashka Corporation the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association and the Aleut Corporation.

While the list of dignitaries for the event is growing Livingston said it includes Unangax̂ Elder Gertrude Svarny Sen. Dan Sullivan members of the Unga Tribal Council and the Qawalangin Tribe as well as Ounalashka Corporation shareholders.

Livingston said they are hoping to include a military color guard a marching band as well as a 21-gun salute to honor Fox.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apartment community to provide 52 new homes for struggling seniors,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/apartment-community-to-provide-52-new-homes-for-struggling-seniors/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMS8xMS9taWNoaWdhbi10b3duc2hpcC1zYXlzLW5vLXRvLXNvbGFyLWZhcm1zLXNvbWUtcmVzaWRlbnRzLXNheS10aGV5cmUtbWlzc2luZy1vdXQtb24tbWlsbGlvbnMuaHRtbNIBmwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMS8xMS9taWNoaWdhbi10b3duc2hpcC1zYXlzLW5vLXRvLXNvbGFyLWZhcm1zLXNvbWUtcmVzaWRlbnRzLXNheS10aGV5cmUtbWlzc2luZy1vdXQtb24tbWlsbGlvbnMuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan township says no to solar farms. Some residents say they’re missing out on millions,"WASTHENAW COUNTY MI - When a multinational energy company one the nation’s leaders in renewable power generation approached Karen and Douglas Sherman about leasing their land they did the math.

The Shermans own two parcels in Bridgewater Township a rural slice of Washtenaw County sandwiched between Manchester Clinton and Saline and dotted with farms. “We got a lot of experience on that soil there” Douglas Sherman says. His father bought it in 1960.

The yields are modest though. Getting $150 an acre would be “top dollar” he said. Often the price per bushel of barley hardly covers growing costs his wife once explained in a letter to the township.

The power company Invenergy offered the Shermans a new crop to harvest — the sun.

It would pay $1100 a year for each acre of the Shermans’ land it could blanket with solar panels exploiting the golden combination of open farmland and transmission lines passing through the area. The Shermans and others signed on.

But that was a year and a half ago. Douglas Sherman didn’t realize then Invenergy had a crucial hurdle to clear — the township.

Draft rules permitting commercial solar projects faced a chorus of naysayers. Residents who feared electromagnetic radiation. Officials rankled by Invenergy’s efforts to sign up landowners before consulting local government and skeptical of promises of boosted tax revenue. And others who complained of the panels’ aesthetics infringement on hunting land and a takeover by a massive out-of-town corporation.

“We don’t know that the money’s going to be there and we do know there’s potential for difficulties so let’s not be the guinea pigs” said township Planning Commission Chairman Dave Horney summarizing concerns.

On Nov. 4 with one member abstaining the township’s all-Republican board unanimously said no to the rules the commission had spent months drafting and recommended the board reject.

That’s left some Bridgewater landowners who were ready to ride the solar revolution disillusioned.

“They killed it based on assumptions and I think misinformation without even letting (Invenergy) bring an actual plan forward” said Amy Kopin who uses some of her land for organic farming had been approached by the company and was supportive of the solar proposal.

The solar debate in Bridgewater provides a window into the messy realities of the transition to a decarbonized energy grid.

Even near the green capital of Ann Arbor and in a county that’s set a rapidly-approaching carbon neutrality goal in the face of accelerating climate change rolling out renewable energy projects isn’t always smooth sailing.

And opposition to commercial-scale solar mounted by some of Bridgewater Township’s 1600 residents isn’t anything new.

This year a local businessman blanketed several mid-Michigan counties with 2000 “No Solar Farms” signs and took out TV ads in a campaign to stop similar development. Variations on the theme have played out across the nation.

And the debate will continue sometimes with different results in neighboring townships in Washtenaw and Lenawee counties. That’s because Invenergy is working to lay out solar farms there as well.

But for now Bridgewater residents will watch from the sidelines.

From the get-go officials ask Invenergy to pump the brakes

Invenergy a Chicago-based renewables giant worth billions plans a 170-megawatt array for Bridgewater Township enough energy to power over 30000 homes on an anticipated 1200 acres of land according to an email from Jorie Fox a senior associate for renewable development with the firm.

The solar developer first pitched the township’s Planning Commission in August 2020 minutes show.

Soon after an attorney representing the firm reached out to the township’s planning consultant Rodney Nanney asking to speak about possible changes to local zoning to accommodate commercial-scale solar projects.

That was “premature” Nanney emailed back warning: “If Invenergy puts pressure on this Planning Commission or Board of Trustees to act in haste I would expect the answer to simply be ‘no.’”

“It is very easy for a company like yours to attempt to manipulate the process especially when you are signing up multiple large property owners for leases to allow for an activity that is not currently possible under local regulations” he wrote.

In the year that followed the planning commission delved into drafting zoning changes that would allow for utility-grade solar Horney said. Over the course of many meetings it reviewed information provided by Invenergy comparable ordinances in other places and information provided by Nanney Horney said.

The township mailed out a notice to all of its households and in August roughly 45 people gathered for a public hearing about the draft rules — “a pretty hefty turnout” for normally sleepy township affairs according to Horney.

There residents speaking in opposition to the solar project and the zoning changes that would open the door for it to be formally proposed outnumbered supporters four to one minutes show.

“Few would benefit and the visual scar would harm the majority for years” one resident said while others worried about impact on roads caused by the installation of the panels questioned the effect on migratory birds and farmland and warned of “spoiling the country atmosphere” according to the minutes.

Solar boosters spoke too pointing to the dire need for sustainable sources of energy and the influx of money to cash-strapped farmers. Douglas Sherman using contract rates and estimates of the area covered by the project pegged the income to participating landowners at $28.5 million in the next 25 years.

Karen Sherman rebutted claims the panels would be an eyesore pointing to requirements written into the proposed rules to shroud the installations with trees and shrubbery.

“Does a group of efficient servants as you are have the right to disallow what the farmers need to survive when facts support that it is safe?” she asked in a letter submitted to officials.

‘Blind guys trying to describe an elephant by touch only’

In October the planning commission met a final time to discuss the draft solar rules. By then restrictions included in the proposal had come under fire from some landowners who saw them as an attempt to handicap the proposed solar project before it could even get off the ground.

The proposed local regulations limited where commercial solar could be installed to certain parts of the township cutting out some landowners who had been approached to participate Kopin said.

That paired with limitations on site grading for solar arrays “seems like a backhanded way to just kill the project” she wrote to officials calling the restrictions “arbitrary and capricious.”

Before sending the rules to the full board for consideration the planning commission identified “findings of fact and conclusions” relevant to decisions on the zoning changes — a pro-con list summarizing their year of discussions.

“Renewable energy” and “economic stimulus” made it onto the six pros listed. So did “tax revenue to the township.” But says Horney the commission thought that wasn’t a lock because of proposed changes to Michigan law regarding the taxation of solar energy equipment.

Last year a bill passed by the Michigan Legislature would have allowed solar developers to apply for an exemption from personal property taxes and instead pay a fixed annual amount based on the size of the facility. But local government groups pushed back arguing it would result in 20 cents on the dollar for municipalities and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed the measure.

Invenergy itself estimates the project will bring $5.5 million in total school district revenue over the life of the project alongside $1.4 million in township property taxes wrote Fox the company representative in an email.

Still that promise wasn’t enough to sway the Bridgewater Planning Commission. Its list of 20 cons gave a flavor of which way it was leaning raising concerns over wear on local infrastructure the conversion of farmland to solar and opposition from the public.

“With no comparable installation nearby we are the blind guys trying to describe an elephant by touch only” read one. Another: “This is essentially forever not for a limited period of time. Once done there is no going back.”

The commission ended up voting 3-1 to approve a recommendation that the township’s board reject the ordinance they had spent months drafting. Horney the sole no vote said his opposition to the motion was merely procedural.

He would have preferred not to send it up to the board at all he said.

With project dead in the water landowners dismayed

The board ultimately rejected the solar rules at a meeting on Nov. 4 closing the door at least for now on solar projects in the township.

Trustee Dave Faust one of the four no votes on the proposal said the ordinance needed more work.

In his opinion the rules didn’t identify the best areas of the township for solar he said but the township needs a solid ordinance because Invenergy is already in the process of dealing with residents.

Jealousy may have fueled opposition to the measure Faust added. Some residents “don’t see why just a few farmers are going to make the money.”

But for others the decision is hard to swallow.

Jason Hesselberg who leases his land to farmers in the township said the solar deal would have been 10 times more profitable without the risk of weather disrupting the growing season.

“An individual landowner that’s paying the taxes I should have the right to say yes I want it or no I don’t” he said. Minutes after township leaders rejected the solar rules they complained about lacking money to fix roads he added.

“If you would allow this to go through the extra money can fix all the roads you want and make our schools better” Hesselberg said.

For Kopin who lives near Hesselberg the decision was short-sighted and means the township will miss out at the beginning of necessary investments in renewables on the path toward carbon neutrality.

Solar arrays are preferable to other kinds of development the township could see Kopin said.

“If you build a subdivision you can never get that land back. If they yank these solar panels out in 25 years you still have perfectly good farmland” she said.

“It seems really disappointing the way the country is to see people that couldn’t see the greater wisdom in developing clean energy” added another Bridgewater landowner Kevin Kratz who advocated with his wife for the project.

Things have played out differently in at least one nearby township.

In a split vote in front of a packed outside crowd earlier this year leaders of Lenawee County’s Macon Township OK’d a permit for Invenergy to build the Mustang Mile solar facility slated to power thousands of homes but which has divided local residents.

Doing so it broke with its planning commission which had recommended the board nix the proposal.

In Saline Township planners await proposed site plans for a 150 megawatt solar farm after passing a solar ordinance in 2017. And in Freedom Township an ordinance is on the table now.

Horney said he and other officials had to consider what was best for Bridgewater Township.

“There’s got to be places in Michigan that want these there’s got to be places in Michigan where it would be feasible to build” he said paraphrasing what he had heard from residents.

“We don’t think we’re the place.”

When journalist Joe Nocera moved next door to the psychiatrist’s home in the Hamptons he started investigating the story after realizing it was not really the doctor’s home but belonged to another man named Marty Markowitz one of his patients for whom he was managing the property according to Time magazine.

Markowitz started seeing Herschkopf in 1981 after he felt overwhelmed with life trying to grieve the recent loss of his parents while dealing with the dynamics of running the family fabrics company Associated Fabrics Corporation without them.

AS THE US RACES TO VACCINATE KIDS AGAINST COVID-19 SOME COUNTRIES HOLD BACK

The magazine noted Shapiro grew suspicious after discovering her brother was consulting psychiatrist Herschkopf on decisions of the family business rather than making them for himself but as Markowitz spent more time with the psychiatrist he fired her from the family business allegedly because of her work-ethic.

After she stole money from her brother as a way to get his attention Herschkopf convinced him to end the relationship and they didn’t talk for years.

""Ike sucked me into this cult of Ike and I was spending six or seven hours a week with him he kept me constantly busy transcribing his handwritten books throwing these parties and I didn’t appreciate what was going on"" Markowitz said to Time magazine.

""He didn’t let me have a girlfriend. I would go on a date and he’d call her a gold digger. He would say ‘Everyone is out to get you I’m going to protect you.’ And I was stupid enough to buy it.""

WESTERN STATES EXPAND COVID-19 BOOSTER ACCESS

Herschkopf became eventually Markowitz’s only friend but Markowitz started to reevaluate their ‘friendship’ after he had a hernia operation in 2010 and Herschkopf never checked on how he was doing in the days following the surgery.

From then on Markowitz started the process of regaining control over his life ending the relationship with his psychiatrist took back control of his home started talking to his sister and filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health.

In his podcast Nocera asks him the natural question: how could he allow this to happen for almost thirty years?

Herschkopf took advantage of his vulnerable mental state so that the manipulation eventually became ‘irresistible’ so ""I felt I had no choice"" Markowitz told Time magazine.

Over the years Herschkopf infiltrated himself as the president of Markowitz’s company and according to Markowitz the doctor persuaded him to leave his Hampton estate to the doctor’s wife and name him on a joint signatory on a Swiss bank account valued at $2.5 million according to the New York Post.

Markowitz wasn't the psychiatrist's only alleged victim. In April 2021 New York State Department of Health concluded Herschkopf broke ""minimal acceptable standards of care in the psychotherapeutic relationship"" ordering him to surrender his New York medical license as a result of a medical inquiry citing similar complaints from other patients some whom he convinced to rewrite their wills for his or his family’s benefit according to Time.

Herschkopf plans to appeal the ruling according to the New York Times.",,,

George Fox is the only known Unangax̂ soldier killed in action in World War II and any war since. He’s also been buried in an unmarked grave in Unalaska for over 70 years. Now nearly a decade of work will culminate in a Memorial Day 2022 ceremony to recognize and honor him.

Michael Livingston is the cultural heritage specialist for the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association and one of the people who has made Fox’s long-awaited commemoration happen.

“The procession will start in the parking lot of the Russian Orthodox Church and proceed down Bayview Drive to Memorial Park where there will be some speeches” Livingston said. “The gravestone will be placed at Pvt. George Fox’s gravesite next to his mother Emma Fox.”

Fox was born in 1920 on Unga Island the largest of the Shumagin islands about 250 miles northeast of Unalaska. Census data shows that he and his mother moved to Unalaska by 1929 and he joined the military when he was about 21 years old according to Livingston.

Fox was killed fighting in Ardea Italy in 1944. About five years later his body was returned to Unalaska. After a small procession he was buried next to his mother in an unmarked grave Livingston said.

It took a lot of work to confirm that Fox was buried in Unalaska Livingston said. That was just the start of the battle in getting Fox a proper gravestone.

“Request after request was ignored” he said. “I’d fill out all the paperwork and send it in and expect a response. I’d wait weeks and months and nothing would happen.”

Livingston said he provided over a dozen pages of evidence that Fox was an active U.S. Army soldier but his appeals continually met resistance. That’s until he contacted Sen. Dan Sullivan.

“Sen. Sullivan’s office made it very clear that Pvt. George Fox was serving he was killed in action and that the gravestone needed to be ordered” he said.

The gravestone was finally ordered this summer largely in thanks to Sullivan Livingston said.

He said it was a huge relief to finally see the photos of the marker and know that it was awaiting placement at the Russian Orthodox Church in Unalaska.

“It was also a big relief to actually get the date pinned down” Livingston said. “Memorial Day 2022 is an excellent date to honor Pvt. George Fox because that’s a national holiday.”

Livingston is glad to see progress being made for Fox but he sees a big difference in how others — who are not people of color — are sometimes recognized with greater honor and more immediate attention.

“When you compare some of what occurred during World War II or shortly after World War II people who were white were highly honored” Livingston said. “Their gravestones were ordered very quickly after their passing even if their passing was not honorable even if … people weren’t killed in action which is one of the highest honors in the United States military.”

It’s also an honor in Unangax̂ culture to die in battle according to Livingston.

“Back before Europeans arrived in the Aleutians in 1741 people who died in battle were elevated” he said. “Songs were written about them so they wouldn’t be forgotten.”

For Livingston this gravestone represents a fight for racial and social justice.

The marker is solid granite and nearly four feet tall. It includes Fox’s name his date of birth his honors — including a Purple Heart and his recognition as an “Unangax̂ warrior” — and at the bottom is a special engraving of Fox’s own words.

“We found a letter that he wrote from Anzio beach to his father in Unga” Livingston said. “We were able to have engraved three words from that letter and those words are: ‘wish all love’.”

Fox’s ceremony is scheduled for Memorial Day 2022 and is hosted by the Unga Tribal Council Ounalashka Corporation the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association and the Aleut Corporation.

While the list of dignitaries for the event is growing Livingston said it includes Unangax̂ Elder Gertrude Svarny Sen. Dan Sullivan members of the Unga Tribal Council and the Qawalangin Tribe as well as Ounalashka Corporation shareholders.

Livingston said they are hoping to include a military color guard a marching band as well as a 21-gun salute to honor Fox.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apartment community to provide 52 new homes for struggling seniors,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/apartment-community-to-provide-52-new-homes-for-struggling-seniors/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLTUyLW5ldy1ob21lcy1mb3Itc3RydWdnbGluZy1zZW5pb3JzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMS8xMS9taWNoaWdhbi10b3duc2hpcC1zYXlzLW5vLXRvLXNvbGFyLWZhcm1zLXNvbWUtcmVzaWRlbnRzLXNheS10aGV5cmUtbWlzc2luZy1vdXQtb24tbWlsbGlvbnMuaHRtbNIBmwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMS8xMS9taWNoaWdhbi10b3duc2hpcC1zYXlzLW5vLXRvLXNvbGFyLWZhcm1zLXNvbWUtcmVzaWRlbnRzLXNheS10aGV5cmUtbWlzc2luZy1vdXQtb24tbWlsbGlvbnMuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan township says no to solar farms. Some residents say they’re missing out on millions,"WASTHENAW COUNTY MI - When a multinational energy company one the nation’s leaders in renewable power generation approached Karen and Douglas Sherman about leasing their land they did the math.

The Shermans own two parcels in Bridgewater Township a rural slice of Washtenaw County sandwiched between Manchester Clinton and Saline and dotted with farms. “We got a lot of experience on that soil there” Douglas Sherman says. His father bought it in 1960.

The yields are modest though. Getting $150 an acre would be “top dollar” he said. Often the price per bushel of barley hardly covers growing costs his wife once explained in a letter to the township.

The power company Invenergy offered the Shermans a new crop to harvest — the sun.

It would pay $1100 a year for each acre of the Shermans’ land it could blanket with solar panels exploiting the golden combination of open farmland and transmission lines passing through the area. The Shermans and others signed on.

But that was a year and a half ago. Douglas Sherman didn’t realize then Invenergy had a crucial hurdle to clear — the township.

Draft rules permitting commercial solar projects faced a chorus of naysayers. Residents who feared electromagnetic radiation. Officials rankled by Invenergy’s efforts to sign up landowners before consulting local government and skeptical of promises of boosted tax revenue. And others who complained of the panels’ aesthetics infringement on hunting land and a takeover by a massive out-of-town corporation.

“We don’t know that the money’s going to be there and we do know there’s potential for difficulties so let’s not be the guinea pigs” said township Planning Commission Chairman Dave Horney summarizing concerns.

The magazine noted Shapiro grew suspicious after discovering her brother was consulting psychiatrist Herschkopf on decisions of the family business rather than making them for himself but as Markowitz spent more time with the psychiatrist he fired her from the family business allegedly because of her work-ethic.

After she stole money from her brother as a way to get his attention Herschkopf convinced him to end the relationship and they didn’t talk for years.

""Ike sucked me into this cult of Ike and I was spending six or seven hours a week with him he kept me constantly busy transcribing his handwritten books throwing these parties and I didn’t appreciate what was going on"" Markowitz said to Time magazine.

""He didn’t let me have a girlfriend. I would go on a date and he’d call her a gold digger. He would say ‘Everyone is out to get you I’m going to protect you.’ And I was stupid enough to buy it.""

WESTERN STATES EXPAND COVID-19 BOOSTER ACCESS

Herschkopf became eventually Markowitz’s only friend but Markowitz started to reevaluate their ‘friendship’ after he had a hernia operation in 2010 and Herschkopf never checked on how he was doing in the days following the surgery.

From then on Markowitz started the process of regaining control over his life ending the relationship with his psychiatrist took back control of his home started talking to his sister and filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health.

In his podcast Nocera asks him the natural question: how could he allow this to happen for almost thirty years?

Herschkopf took advantage of his vulnerable mental state so that the manipulation eventually became ‘irresistible’ so ""I felt I had no choice"" Markowitz told Time magazine.

Over the years Herschkopf infiltrated himself as the president of Markowitz’s company and according to Markowitz the doctor persuaded him to leave his Hampton estate to the doctor’s wife and name him on a joint signatory on a Swiss bank account valued at $2.5 million according to the New York Post.

Markowitz wasn't the psychiatrist's only alleged victim. In April 2021 New York State Department of Health concluded Herschkopf broke ""minimal acceptable standards of care in the psychotherapeutic relationship"" ordering him to surrender his New York medical license as a result of a medical inquiry citing similar complaints from other patients some whom he convinced to rewrite their wills for his or his family’s benefit according to Time.

Herschkopf plans to appeal the ruling according to the New York Times.",,,

The Florida firm Constellation Group bought the 220-unit complex on Oct. 29 according to a news release. The previous owner was a partnership between Indianapolis development firm SC Bodner Co. Inc. and Carlyle Group a private equity firm headquartered in Washington D.C. which built the complex in 2018.

Constellation did not disclose the purchase price. The Bexar Appraisal District assessed the property at $42 million this year.

With a pool overlooking the San Antonio River 120 Ninth Street is a prominent example of the type of high-end apartment complex that proliferated in north downtown after the completion of the Museum Reach stretch of the River Walk in the late 2000s and with the help of housing incentives delivered through the city’s Center City Housing Incentive Policy or CCHIP. The city ended the policy last year but still awards subsidy packages on a case-by-case basis and with City Council approval.

120 Ninth Street received a nearly $4 million package through CCHIP in 2015 the majority of which is a 100 percent rebate on the city portion of its property tax bill over 15 years worth an estimated $3.1 million.

Constellation cited the growth of the Pearl and the proximity of downtown employers as being “pivotal” in its decision to acquire the complex. The purchase marks the firm’s first acquisition in San Antonio according to the release.

“We could not have asked for a better property to serve as the first San Antonio asset in our expanding multifamily portfolio” said Eduardo Otaola a principal at Constellation in the release. “A newly-built community in a downtown corridor that is experiencing a renaissance of new development 120 Ninth Street is poised for strong leasing activity and rent growth.”

[Leer en español]

What if Mexico collapses? This is much more than a rhetorical question or a question of exclusive interest to Mexicans. It is an increasingly likely scenario with profound implications for U.S. national security. Therefore Washington the states and private American companies should update or begin to develop contingency plans in case their southern neighbor falls into a generalized crisis.

The importance of Mexico

Mexico is not simply an inconvenient neighbor for the United States. On the contrary it is its main trading partner the protagonist (along with Canada) of its most important free trade agreement and the country of origin of a community (Mexican-American) that represents more than 10 % of the total population of the United States which in turn has an expat community of close to one million people in Mexico.

This importance will continue to grow in the coming years as geopolitical differences between the United States and China deepen. In short every American company or product that sets up in China directly finances an enemy expansionist regime determined to destroy American influence in the world’s markets.

It is evident that the United States cannot continue to bet on the Asian giant and Mexico is the natural choice to replace it at least in part. The Mexican republic offers many advantages similar to those of China with the enormous added value that unlike Beijing the Mexican government has no intention of becoming a geopolitical rival of its northern neighbor.

American businessmen and government leaders have understood this reality and for more than 30 years have been betting on Mexico. As a result the production chains of Mexico the United States and Canada have merged. They may have different currencies but they basically share the same economy in addition to the aforementioned social ties involving millions of people on both sides of the border.

Consequently an eventual collapse of Mexico could not be handled as a simple foreign policy matter. Unlike Cuba and Venezuela whose collapse under dictatorial regimes is handled from Washington as a diplomatic crisis the effects of a similar scenario in Mexico would not only be felt in embassies but in all regions all sectors and all industries in the United States.

If Mexico collapses America will lose much more than a beach and tequila. Image: Unsplash

The nuances of collapse

How might this collapse occur? It could take three forms:

That of a radical leftist tyrannical government similar to Caracas or Havana.

An open capture of the state by organized crime.

That of a failed state where insecurity increases to the point of massively affecting the American community living in Mexico and preventing the inputs and products manufactured there from reaching the United States something that would tear apart regional production chains.

In any of the three scenarios the crisis would leap (in a matter of days) from the desk of diplomats to the streets and businesses throughout the United States. Almost immediately millions of jobs would evaporate (already in 2016 at least 5 million American jobs depended directly on trade with Mexico) the border would experience unprecedented migration pressure and the resulting social instability would multiply the damage.

A question of national security

Mexico is certainly not a failed state at this time. Despite constant massacres and profound government incompetence the country is functioning: cities are growing businesses are operating and exports are coming across the border. Should it happen the collapse will not happen today or tomorrow or next month.

However it is equally clear that Mexico continues to slide into the void and in addition to the worrying signs of insecurity economic alarms are becoming more and more evident. For example on November 11 it was announced that so far this year foreign investments have left Mexico for approximately $13 billion dollars ($266 billion pesos) and Luis Gonzalí co-chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton explained that Mexico has already been the country that has lost the most foreign investments internationally for two years.

The risk of collapse would increase drastically if López Obrador succeeds in the approval of his constitutional reform that would destroy the electricity market an initiative that has already triggered the alert of the American industry Ambassador Ken Salazar and dozens of legislators both Republicans and Democrats who are seeking at least to postpone its approval.

The same attention should be paid to many other Mexican domestic policy issues especially in the areas of public security and institutions of government and democracy.

In short if the United States wants to wean itself off its dependence on China it will have to get closer to Mexico and that means being aware of what is happening south of the border. The good news is that all things considered such vigilance will be far less costly than the option of continuing to pump up Beijing.",,,,,,

This feature lets users track everything from morning sickness to baby kicks so moms-to-be can stay informed and approach pregnancy with a plan. It also offers a wellspring of educational information and resources for understanding the happenings of all three trimesters.

What is Garmin Pregnancy Tracking? New moms juggle enough. Garmin lets you keep all your health and wellness stats in one place so the juggling doesn’t have to start early. Instead of looking elsewhere turn to your Garmin for all things pregnancy tracking. By downloading the completely free Pregnancy Tracking app to your compatible device you can log symptoms track baby movement and record your blood glucose levels. You will also receive weekly education on nutrition and fitness and weekly weight recommendations.

Headed to a check-up? You can access a four-week overview of your tracked symptoms to share with the doctor. The Garmin Pregnancy Tracking app is loaded with features to help you maintain wellness throughout your pregnancy and understand your body throughout the process. Plus it has fun features like sizing up your growing baby next to common fruits and veggies. Honestly what’s more adorable than comparing a child to an artichoke?

With notifications and reminders Garmin keeps tracking simple and eliminates the mental work of staying on top of important dates and milestones. Once you’re set up in the Garmin Connect app you can download the Pregnancy Tracking app on your compatible smartwatch from the Connect IQ Store so you can track right from your wrist. You and your partner can also download the Contraction Timer to track the frequency and duration of your contractions. This app is standard for all compatible models with the exceptions of the Garmin Venu 2 and Venu 2S which are compatible with a slightly different version.

While all partners can download the Contraction Timer only female partners will be able to download the Pregnancy Tracking app. Male users are not able to download the Pregnancy Tracking app from the Connect IQ store. See also: The best Garmin watches you can buy

How to use the Garmin Pregnancy Tracking app

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

To start tracking your pregnancy open the Garmin Connect app on your smartphone and follow the directions below. You will need to complete the setup before using the app on your smartwatch.

Setting up in the Garmin Connect app On your smartphone open the Garmin Connect app. Tap the menu in the top left corner and scroll down to Health Stats. Tap Health Stats to open a drop-down menu then tap Menstrual Cycle. If you don’t already use the Menstrual Cycle feature follow the onscreen prompts to set up this feature. First a prompt will ask you to choose your type of cycle. Select Pregnant. If you already use Garmin’s Menstrual Cycle feature tap the three verticle dots in the top right corner then tap Settings. From here you can change your cycle type to Pregnant and follow the onscreen prompts to complete the setup. Once you start tracking your pregnancy it will be listed below Menstrual Cycle in the Health Stats menu.

Pregnancy Tracking on your Garmin smartwatch If your Garmin watch already receives menstrual cycle details from the Garmin Connect app it will automatically begin displaying your pregnancy updates. However you will need to complete a few more steps to track symptoms and other measurables from your device. On your paired smartphone open the Garmin Connect IQ app. Tap the search icon then search for Pregnancy Tracking. Tap the Pregnancy Tracking app then tap install. Once the app is installed you can log symptoms and other data right from your wrist. Read more: The best smartwatches for women

What’s missing? Overall Garmin Pregnancy Tracking is a bit basic but for a free feature it’s a good start. While it allows users to track their progress alongside their other health stats it can’t necessarily compete with standalone apps dedicated entirely to pregnancy. Full-fledged pregnancy tracking apps offer a much wider variety of resources. These apps provide deeper educational resources and even daily updates. Special features include everything from baby name suggestions to food and drug safety tips to product reviews of the items you’ll need once your child arrives. Countdowns checklists and postpartum recovery information are just a few of the details missing from Garmin’s pared-down app but the list goes on.

What’s more most apps can be downloaded by all genders. Garmin’s lockout is a bit disappointing and hopefully something that will be addressed in the future. In the meantime soon-to-be dads can look to more inclusive apps or even opt for an app like Daddy Up that specifically focuses on including men in the pregnancy journey.

Finally while Garmin’s Pregnancy Tracking app allows you to pause your training status on compatible devices it doesn’t suggest personalized alterations to your training based on your pregnancy. That being said the app does offer general recommendations about exercise and diet as your pregnancy progresses. It just won’t tailor a specific training plan for each user. Not a huge deal but hardcore athletes might be hoping for more. Garmin Pregnancy Tracking offers users a helpful tool for managing the basics right alongside the health data they already track. It may not be an all-inclusive resource but it’s a good way for expecting mothers to tune into their bodies and a great addition to Garmin’s women’s health features.

While The Bass Tank boys had been catching them good using jerkbaits and Alabama rigs (check out John Soukup’s 10-pounder) several fish were unwilling to commit. Warren explains the importance of watching your fish finders for trailing bass which often hang below the boat before dispersing. In this situation a Damiki-rigged fluke-style plastic is a top-notch follow-up bait.

TACKLE AND GEAR

The trick to Damiki rigging is doing very little with the bait. Whereas there’s a perception that you need to work a plastic actively the reverse is often key to triggering bass in the winter. One of the keys to the setup is rigging your minnow-imitating plastics to hang horizontally when fished vertically. Warren shares some basic tackle and rigging guidance to achieve this. Get this system right and you’re due to score several additional bites.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMjc3NzExNi9ob2xpZGF5LWdpZnRzLXdpc2hlcy1mYXZvcml0ZS1leHBlbnNpdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Verge's favorite unrealistic gift wishes for 2022,"Let’s face it — somewhere inside us all is a greedy five-year-old who wants that wonderful beautiful fascinating toy that seems completely out of reach. But what that toy is depends very much on who we are. So just out of curiosity we asked the staff of The Verge to tell us something that they would love to get for the holidays — if money (and opportunity) was no object. (And the rule was that idealistic longings like world peace or the end of the pandemic didn’t count — for this once we were not going for idealism.)

So let’s see what hidden longings lie in the hearts of The Verge’s staff...

There’s something magical about getting lost in the woods and having to find your way out with just a map and a compass especially if it’s a relatively safe environment where you’re not too far away from help. However telling your spouse or parent about these wandering exploits can elicit annoyed questions like “What if you broke your arm again?” and “What if you get lost on one of the long wilderness trips you’re planning?” and “You’re not doing any more backpacking until you get a satellite communicator!” (You like me may have noticed that the last one is not a question.)

What I’m saying is that I wish someone would get me a Garmin inReach Mini a $350 GPS / tracker / personal locator beacon. That feels brutally expensive for a gadget that hopefully I won’t ever actually need (especially when I could spend that money on a custom quilt to make nights more comfortable). But until my phone can actually contact people from the wilderness having some sort of satellite communicator is a necessity for my loved ones’ peace of mind. I just don’t think I can bring myself to pay for it despite how useful being able to access maps texts and weather without cell service would be. — Mitchell Clark news writer

Anechoic chamber

Several years ago I learned about anechoic chambers which are soundproof rooms that also absorb internal echoes. (You can find articles about them with titles like “The quietest place on Earth.”) They seem wonderfully weird — like “hear your own internal organs” weird although I think the claim they drive you insane after 45 minutes is an urban legend — and I’ve wanted to visit one for ages.

As far as I can tell public rentals are fairly rare though and New York City’s only chamber doesn’t list the option. My best bet might be a $250 minimum tour at Orfield Laboratories which would require also paying for a trip to Minnesota. So I’m not really *hoping* I’ll get this for the holidays especially not during the pandemic. But it’s fun to dream about. — Adi Robertson senior reporter

I’m a fairly avid cyclist. Let me rephrase that: cycling is the only form of exercise I don’t absolutely detest. I know I should be taking better care of my body but during the winter months I have absolutely no desire to get on a bike let alone go outside. Even if there isn’t snow on the ground biking in cold weather involves more layers than I care to count not to mention occasionally covering my feet in foil like a baked potato so they don’t get frostbite.

I currently get around this utterly ridiculous process by using a $60 bike trainer I purchased off Amazon but if anyone wanted to spoil me this holiday they could chip in for a Tacx NEO bike smart trainer. And while we’re at it go ahead and buy a decked-out iPad Pro so I can catch up on my stories while working out.

This entirely excessive bike trainer provides data readouts for your speed cadence and power via a built-in LED screen can adjust resistance on the fly and even has built-in fans that adjust their speed based on how fast you’re moving which is an absolute godsend when biking indoors. All of these integrated meters and measurements are definitely more important to people who are legitimately training in the off-season but I’m just interested that they can help me level up in Zwift my current favorite app for gamifying my workouts. I currently use a Wahoo speed and cadence sensor that is zip-tied to my bike to get the same albeit less accurate effect.

As for the iPad Pro this is a definite indulgence on my part. As someone that would be using this almost exclusively for media consumption much of the functionality of this overpowered tablet would be lost on me but since the bike trainer comes with a tablet stand I may as well set it up with a tablet that would pay my rent for a month. — Alice Newcome-Beill commerce writer

World travel

I have been wanting to travel the world for years but I haven’t visited as many places as I’d like to yet because 1) there was kind of a pandemic going on and 2) it’s also kind of expensive. However if money was no object I would love somebody to gift me one of those around-the-world travel tickets that go for $10000 so I could wander the streets of Rome Lima Cairo Beijing — gosh I could go on.

And hey if we were really allowed to dream it up here I’d love one of those $15000 cruises to Antarctica as well! I’ve always been curious what life is like in one of the most isolated places in the world and that’s been on my bucket list since I was about 10 years old. Now if you’ll excuse me I’m off to find myself a rich friend. — Sheena Vasani commerce writer

My wife and I are about to move to a new place and while we are already budgeting for responsible big-ticket items like a couch and a desk I cannot wait until we are able to spring for an LG C1 OLED TV so that I can make games on my PS5 and Xbox Series X look even better. The TVs don’t come cheap — a 65-inch model is currently $1800 at Best Buy — but they’re loaded with features including support for 4K resolutions 120Hz refresh rates and Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync. It would be a major upgrade from the 21.5-inch computer monitor I use for gaming now and I’ll be having my eye on one until I can finally spend the money. — Jay Peters news writer

I don’t know what I would do with the $1000 Lego Star Wars Ultimate Millennium Falcon — once I’d built it and marveled at my handiwork of course. It’s not like I’ve got a place to store a Lego set that big. Unlike say a reconfigurable pirate ship / island or a space shuttle the UCS Falcon is so big it’d probably be unwieldy to whisk it around a room playing Lego with my daughters.

Nor do I expect anyone to ever buy it for me particularly now that its original already extravagant $800 price tag has gone up by a full fifth (when you can buy it at all). But it would make for an incredible afternoon week fortnight of building and I’d love to spend time doing that with a friend or two. — Sean Hollister senior reports editor

I’m by no means a professional but I’ve been ice skating consistently since I was nine. This past year with all the rink closures has been the longest time I’ve been off-ice in maybe forever. Unlike others who took up running or indoor cycling during the lockdown I only took some virtual ballet classes at home and swam laps in our building’s pool so I am far from being in skating shape.

Unfortunately there is really no substitution for the lateral movements and agility I get from exercising on a slippery surface: most gym equipment only trains forward motions and movements. As an adult it’s hard to find indoor ice time that fits with a busy work schedule and outdoor rinks are very sensitive to our unpredictable winters in the Northeast. Short of blanketing my entire apartment in synthetic ice tiles and skating inside my home — which would be a dream come true but would also wreck my expensive blades — the next best thing is to get a sliding board like the one from Brrrn to rebuild my skating muscles.

The Brrrn sliding board doesn’t look like much for a $300 piece of exercise equipment. It’s basically a shiny strip of board with adjustable wooden stops on both ends that prevent you from sliding off the slippery surface. You need to wear these booties over your sneakers so you can exercise safely on the board and spray the board with polishing spray to maintain the slick surface. Thanks to its compactness I can easily slide the board from under the couch to in front of my television for a quick sliding session. This way I’ll have no excuse but to get back into skating shape to enjoy my favorite sport again. — Gloria Sin reviewer (mobile)

OK so if we’re really going for a “money no object” gift idea then I’d have to pick Sennheiser’s $1600 HD 800 S headphones. Yes that’s too much to ever consider spending on a pair of headphones and it’s an even more extravagant purchase considering their open-back design would make them inappropriate for listening in all but the quietest of home environments.

But goddamnit it’d just be nice to be able to sit back at my desk at home and know that I’m listening to music in the highest possible quality without having to make any compromises for size or noise isolation. I’ll stick with the wireless noise-canceling headphones for commuting and true wireless headphones for exercising. But if we’re just talking about having a pair of headphones for home listening? It’s gotta be the HD 800 S for me please. — Jon Porter reporter

Tattoos

If my family and friends truly loved me and I mean this in all seriousness someone would gift me $5000 for more tattoos. I’ve got somewhere around a dozen tattoos now but the artists I go to are not cheap — and rightfully so. I’m not even sure if $5000 is a good estimate for the designs I want but it’s a start! If it’s any consolation for my loved ones they’ll be remembered fondly for the rest of my life every time I look at the ink. That and maybe our followers on TikTok would think I look cool. — Kaitlin Hatton social media manager e-commerce

I’m a bit of a wristwatch enthusiast. Not a snob by any stretch but I do have that unexplainable love for timepieces you wear on your wrist. I use an Apple Watch but nothing about it gets me going like an analog watch — whether it’s quartz mechanical solar cheap expensive or whatever. I love and appreciate so many watches that offer anything unique or authentic in their story design engineering and general enjoyment and you’ll never catch me not wearing one.

While I have a sensible and modest collection of watches ranging from a $9 Casio and sub-$200 Seiko to a $600 G-Shock I’ve recently become a bit obsessed with a slightly pricier watch that can’t even be bought anymore. The Unimatic Modello Uno U1-HGMT Limited Edition for Hodinkee is a watch made by a small Italian company that features a GMT complication and a monochromatic sensibility that speaks to me. I have wanted a GMT watch for a while pretending I’m some kind of jet-setting traveler but the most notable ones out there are usually super-expensive options from the likes of Rolex Tudor Breitling etc. Many of them are a bit too posh for me even if I do love a Tudor Black Bay GMT. But the Unimatic struck me in a unique way.

It’s not every day you see a mechanical watch from a small independent brand that’s made in Italy and you don’t always see a design quite like this. Maybe it’s my Italian-American heritage or my obsession with all things black and gray but if this limited edition of 500 watches was not sold out I’d be looking to splurge and spend the $1395 in hopes of it being a forever companion — even if I had to be cliche and “gift” it to myself as a wedding present to go along with my real forever-companion. So I choose this as my favorite gift to get for the holidays money no option. It fits my exact style and I wouldn’t feel like I have to apologize for it like I would something crazy-expensive like an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak (which I also secretly fawn over). I’d even take a used one with a little wear-and-tear since the edition is sold out. A watch should have a story that makes you love it and also be able to share stories of its own. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto commerce writer

2TB Seagate storage expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S

If my Secret Santa wants to be really generous then I have an idea. I can’t justify spending $399 on a 2TB expansion drive for my Xbox Series X especially after I already bought a 1TB card earlier this year.... and an Xbox mini-fridge.

New-gen games are taking up ridiculous amounts of space and waiting for a title to download seems like an entirely unfair punishment for failing to set priorities for the games I keep around. Will adding more storage make me better at the one game I actually play or help me dig through a backlog of games that has only grown longer during the pandemic? I mean maybe? How will I know if I don’t try?

Sure I could delete any of the Game Pass games I’ll never actually play and free up some of the nearly 2TB of storage that’s already inside my monolithic console but you could also mind your business. Unless of course you want to buy me an overpriced peripheral that I absolutely don’t need — then go ahead get involved. (The 2TB drive will be available in December.) — Richard Lawler senior news editor

Life during the pandemic has been surprisingly hectic so much so that I’ve neglected one of my favorite outdoor activities — birdwatching. You’d think that driving to a park and watching the activity of these feathered dinosaur descendants would be just the thing for a brief respite from the cares of the week but for some reason I haven’t been able to push myself out to any of my formerly favorite haunts.

Perhaps part of the reason is that my binoculars are well pretty much shot. They weren’t very high-end to begin with and the last time I looked through them the lenses were so grainy and out of sync that they were less useful than just squinting at the bird I was trying to identify. So I’m in line for a new pair — but even the less expensive binoculars tend to be well not cheap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3dlYXJhYmxlLXRlY2gtd2hpY2gtc21hcnR3YXRjaGVzLWhhdmUtdGhlLWJlc3Qtc3BvMi1ibG9vZC1veHlnZW4tYW5kLWVjZy1oZWFsdGgtbW9uaXRvcnMtY3VycmVudGx5LTc2ODcwMzEuaHRtbNIBpQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3dlYXJhYmxlLXRlY2gtd2hpY2gtc21hcnR3YXRjaGVzLWhhdmUtdGhlLWJlc3Qtc3BvMi1ibG9vZC1veHlnZW4tYW5kLWVjZy1oZWFsdGgtbW9uaXRvcnMtY3VycmVudGx5LTc2ODcwMzEuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which smartwatches have the best SpO2 blood oxygen and ECG monitors currently?,"The ECG sensor on the Apple Watch Series 7 (Rs 41900 onwards) is the most seasoned on any wearable available currently.

Remember this line from the launch of the first Apple Watch in 2014: “Apple Watch gets to know you the way your personal trainer would”? In many ways that has defined the wearable technology category as a personal health and wellness companion. Except now you can add doctor to the personal trainer. It’s the key purchase driver for most consumers who have ditched their luxury watches and heirloom watches for a piece of wearable tech.

The first Apple Watch did just three fitness things – an accelerometer measured total body movement a heart rate sensor measured intensity while the GPS tracked how you moved. Seven years later it’s a whole new ball game as wearable manufacturers have added new wellness elements and sensors in the mix.

Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 can measure your body composition (with clear body fat percentage) straight off your wrist with a cutting-edge BioActive Sensor while Fitbit’s Sense is equipped with a temperature sensor. There are two key wellness features that are driving the sales pitch of most brands – ECG and blood oxygen monitoring or tracking SpO2 levels.

We’ve all heard of SpO2 now thanks to COVID-19: The pandemic has created more awareness for SpO2 or saturation levels of oxygen in the blood than ever before. Remember those clip-on devices (pulse oximeters) that were attached to your finger or earlobe. Before 2020 you might have used them at a clinic now you probably have to be screened by one of these before you step into your local gym. SpO2 is measured by a non-invasive method that emits and then absorbs a light wave passing through blood vessels. SpO2 refers to oxygen saturation - in simple terms an estimation of the amount of oxygen in the blood - 94-100% is the ideal blood oxygenation level.

ECG on your wrist: The ECG sensor on the Apple Watch first debuted in 2018 and showcased the technological prowess of a wearable. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a test that records the timing and strength of the electrical signals that make the heartbeat. The ECG app checks these pulses to get your heart rate and see if the upper and lower chambers of your heart are in rhythm. If they’re out of rhythm that could be AFib or atrial fibrillation a form of irregular heart rhythm.

Apple Watch 7: The seventh gen Apple Watch is still the best wearable for iPhone users. It’s also the most evolved smartwatch with a large ecosystem of Apps. The new expanded screen on the Series 7 brings extra functionality to the wrist with an on-screen keyboard to dash off quick replies. It offers both on-demand measurements that can be taken when the user is still and periodic SpO2 measurements when they are inactive including during sleep. The ECG sensor on the Apple Watch is also the most seasoned on any wearable (Rs 41900 onwards).

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4: It’s a best of both worlds. Samsung’s hardware and design coupled with the Wear OS (from Google). This brings a lot more functionality and apps (think Google Maps) to your wrist. It’s also one of the most loaded smartwatches on the wellness front. You get on-demand SpO2 tracking but our favourite feature is the Body Composition tracker. Samsung’s new BioActive Sensor teamed with a fast chip (a dual core 1.18 GHz processor) tracks fat percentage skeletal muscle and body water. The watch also has ECG and blood pressure measurement capabilities that should be available in India after regulatory clearances (Rs 23999 onwards).

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4

Fitbit Sense: Works equally well with iPhones and Android devices with an evolved companion App and the Fitbit Premium subscription (Rs 999/year with a free six-month trial with the Sense) that offers additional drill-down wellness data. The Sense can track your SpO2 readings in your sleep (it’s not on-demand). The ECG feature is on-demand though and it’s remarkably easy to run. The Sense also boasts of a skin temperature sensor. It’s not the same as the core temperature (inside your body) that is usually measured with a thermometer. The Sense takes three nights to estimate your baseline temperature and then begins to measure variations with the skin temperature sensor (Rs 22999).

Garmin Venu 2: Garmin has remained a cult favourite among serious fitness enthusiasts. One of the newest additions to the Garmin line the Venu 2 comes with an in-built Health Snapshot feature that allows you to log a 2-minute session to record key health stats including heart rate heart rate variability (HRV) Pulse Ox respiration and stress generating a report via the Garmin Connect app to monitor the statistics. Garmin promises an impressive battery life of 11 days in smartwatch mode with up to 8 hours on GPS mode (Rs 41990).

The app had processed 7 million transactions worth AED4 billion in the last two-year period. The amount recorded in the last two years is equal in value to all transactions made on the app in the four years before that period. This reflects the growing confidence users have in the DubaiNow app as an easy-to-use and reliable government service platform in Dubai.The figures also reflect how Dubai’s robust digital infrastructure was prepared not only for ensuring business continuity but also for the accelerated digital adoption the emirate saw following the onset of the pandemic. DubaiNow is an example of the vision of the emirate’s leadership to embrace innovation as the key driver of development and the comprehensive initiatives it has taken to enhance its future readiness.His Excellency Hamad Obaid Al Mansoori Director General of Digital Dubai said: “Since its launch in 2015 the DubaiNow application has embodied the concept of ‘customer centricity’ and teamwork the latter of which saw teams from various government and private sector entities come together to develop the app. This in turn reflects our commitment to integrating and connecting different city entities on a single streamlined digital platform.”HE Al Mansoori thanked all government entities who contributed to DubaiNow’s success. “I am confident that the team who made this success happen is well on its way to bigger accomplishments that will firmly position Dubai as a global capital of innovation” he asserted. “The tremendously positive international feedback we have received regarding the DubaiNow app is a reason for us all to be proud – most notably the highly positive reviews the project generated at the recent Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo 2021 where hundreds of leaders in the global tech industry converged. We are always happy to see Dubai’s success stories inspiring others around the world further advancing the UAE’s global standing.”“We are determined to keep moving forward with our collective efforts and as one team to expedite Dubai’s digital transformation enhance Dubai’s global ranking on performance indicators across various sectors and provide customers with value-added services that enhance their happiness and quality of life in Dubai in line with directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE Ruler of Dubai” HE further said.“Dubai’s experience is a clear example of the need to proactively prepare for the future anticipate challenges and develop solutions for them early on” HE Al Mansoori noted. “The emirate is an example of the great potential that lies in partnering with the private sector to fulfil our objectives establish a digital economy and society and build a smart and sustainable city of the future.”Chief Technology Officers convened at the Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo 2021 to discuss leading strategic and tech developments that are driving the digital transformation process and enhancing its role in shaping the future of IT and business.

First impressions? “Magnificent 777X is out to impress” one frontpage headline declared. “X-pectant” said another.The trip to Dubai was also the plane’s first international flight and its longest. Propelled by a pair of GE9X engines from GE Aviation the largest and most powerful commercial jet engine ever built the 777-8 version of that jet is designed to carry 384 passenger 8730 nautical miles or 16170 kilometers enough to fly nonstop from New York to Auckland  New Zealand. The larger 777-9 version which is on display in Dubai can take 426 passengers 7285 nautical miles or 13500 kilometers.The GE9X engine which GE Aviation started testing in 2017 is one of the plane’s innovations. The engine can supply 134000 pounds of thrust more than the rocket used in America’s first manned space flight.

GE made the engine’s front fan from 16 fourth-generation carbon-fiber composite fan blades. The material allowed engineers to stretch the fan’s diameter to a whopping 11 feet in diameter — as wide as the body of an entire Boeing 737. Every inch is important. By expanding the front fan on commercial engines around the core the designers were able to preserve the aircraft speed passengers expect and make the engine more efficient.The GE9X has a bypass ratio of more than 10:1 which means engine is sending 10 times more air around the core and through the fan than through the core.The engine also has parts made from advanced materials like lightweight and heat-resistant ceramic matrix composites  and components made by advanced manufacturing technologies like 3D printing The design helped the team to improve fuel efficiency of the GE9X and lower its carbon emissions by 10% compared to the GE90 the engine it replaced. This is a big deal given that fuel costs represent a large share of an airline’s operating expenses.But GE Aviation is providing the Boeing 777X with more than just raw horsepower. It also supplies Boeing with the plane’s common core system (CCS). A bit like an airplane’s central nervous system and brain the CCS hosts the airplane’s avionics such as computers data networks sensors and other electronics. One is the enhanced airborne flight recorder (EAFR) which keeps a log of flight crew audio parametric flight data and data link communications. GE’s EAFRs are already on thousands of military aircraft and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jets.GE Aviation has also worked closely with Boeing as the provider of the electrical load management system (ELMS) backup generator and backup converter for the Boeing 777X. The new power generation system produces twice the power generation of the current 777 system while the ELMS controls 30% more power.This article originally appeared on GE Reports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RheG9ub215L3Rlcm0vODk4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,widebody | GE News,It took Boeing years to develop its newest wide-body passenger jet the 777X but just 15 hours to fly it from Seattle to the United Arab Emirates where the plane made its public debut at the Dubai Airshow on Sunday.

Sand can adhere to the turbine blades inside an engine and work its way into the compressor wreaking havoc on fuel efficiency a metric closely linked to carbon emissions. Now after a lot of study and testing GE engineers who designed and built those engines think they’ve hit upon a novel way to reverse the effects of the sands of time. Called GE’s 360 Foam Wash the powerful approach thoroughly cleans a commercial jet engine helping to improve its performance and potentially eliminate tons of climate-damaging CO2.“The world has only done water washing for the last 30 years” says Mike Eriksen senior technology program leader at GE Aviation. “Literally spraying water in the front while the engine’s motoring and rinsing it out. And that wasn’t adequate for this problem. So we reinvented how to clean an engine.”360 Foam Wash is now approved for use on engines including the GE90 GEnx CF34 and CF6 as well as the Engine Alliance’s GP7200 engines which serve on large Airbus A380 double-decker jets. So far seven airlines and one MRO (maintenance repair and overhaul) operator have license agreements. Etihad Airways alone anticipates a reduction of more than 7000 metric tons of CO2 through the end of 2021 for its combined GE90 and GEnx fleets as a result of switching from water to 360 Foam Wash.In fact just in time for COP26 Etihad’s long-haul Boeing 787 flight from London to Abu Dhabi scored a 72% reduction in carbon emissions using existing technologies including 360 Foam Wash. The flight used sustainable aviation fuel employed innovative route planning to avoid creating contrails and even served passengers on eco-friendly dishes. Besides the new cleaning method the plane used GE Aviation’s GEnx engines and utilized GE Digital’s Fuel Insight software to analyze data and make fuel-saving adjustments within minutes. The plane will be on display this week at the 2021 Dubai Air Show which started on Sunday.

The hunt for a cleaning solution started around 2012 when GE started noticing what it called the “hot and harsh” effects of sand on the wide-body jets flown by some of its engine customers Eriksen recalls. Emirates airline — and later Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways — came to GE with the same problem: Very fine particulate dust was getting “baked on” to the cores of the GE90 and GEnx engines causing a loss in fuel efficiency. Traditional water-wash techniques were showing diminishing returns — they couldn’t keep engines clean enough between regularly scheduled maintenance sessions. The relentless desert heat and sand were exacting a toll.After studying the problem at GE’s Middle East Technology Center in Dubai GE Aviation took the data to GE’s Research Center (GRC) in Niskayuna New York where Eriksen says they posed two key questions: “How would you characterize the dust that we’re seeing? And how would you remove it?”A geologist at GRC subjected the samples to a battery of tests and found it to be “a very hard metamorphically phase-reacted layer of dust” Eriksen says. “It’s the kind of thing where you scratch it and it’s like cement.” GE engines are otherwise very efficient at ingesting and separating coarse gravel rocks and sand that occasionally find their way into the inlet. “But the really fine dust we found still went through the entire core” he says. “That’s what was building up.”That’s when the real brainstorming began. Over the next couple of years the technicians at GRC developed what Eriksen describes as a “really novel detergent” that is extremely effective at breaking down the binders in that hardened layer of dust. But once they had the detergent he says the team had another challenge: how to carefully inject it into an engine.This is where the foam came in. As Eriksen says “foam is just a volume-filling method. All we wanted to do was figure out ‘How can you get this detergent throughout the whole engine?’ We can’t just squirt it in there. And it works by a chemical reaction so you have to keep contact fresh with all the surfaces where the dust is.”They built three generations of prototypes for the foaming system and a mock-up of an engine in the lab so that they could figure out how to safely and effectively distribute the detergent throughout its core. Once they had the foaming system fine-tuned they took it to some of GE Aviation’s overhaul shops and tried it on various engines that were being repaired. After using the foam wash they’d run the engine in a test cell to measure its recovery — basically how hot it gets when it’s running. “If the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is within a certain range you know that the engine is running efficiently” Eriksen says. “And so if you have dust buildup if the engine has to work harder to produce the same amount of thrust that’s what makes the EGT go up.”While a normal water wash typically produces a fall in EGT as the engine becomes more efficient the foam washes were resulting in “significant” drops he says. “We started seeing the EGT recovery and the fuel flow recovery go off the charts.”By 2017 they were ready to take it into the field. Etihad began testing 360 Foam Wash on-wing on a GE90 engine powering a Boeing 777 that January; Qatar followed in April testing it on a GEnx-1B engine designed for Boeing 787 jets. Over the next four years working with their partners at Etihad Qatar and Emirates GE Aviation industrialized its foam wash system designing a special self-contained cart with hoses to pump the detergent into an engine and a separate apron to catch the solution as it flows out. The cart allows 360 Foam Wash to be employed in a variety of on- and off-wing scenarios whether inside a maintenance hangar or outdoors on a tarmac.Emirates Etihad Airways Qatar Airways and Royal Jordanian Airlines now hold technical licenses to use 360 Foam Wash for their GEnx and GE90 engines. According to Rohan Douglas Etihad’s senior manager of engine management the airline has begun to track fuel savings on its GEnx-1B- and GE90-powered planes. “We’re seeing the improvements” he says.Yasser Elkilani services leader for on-wing technology at GE Aviation oversees the rollout of foam wash to GE’s customers. He notes that “during technology trials with its GE90 and GEnx engines the 360 Foam Wash solution allowed customers in the Middle East to improve engine performance by reducing buildup of deposits in the engine lowering engine exhaust temperatures and improving engine compressor efficiency. These improvements led to reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions as well as increased engine time on-wing.”GE continues to work in a variety of ways to help its airline customers incorporate more emissions-lowering methods into their businesses. “We believe we can win together” Douglas says. “We tell the guys [at GE] ‘If you have anything that’s new and fresh interesting or groundbreaking we’re ready.’”This article originally appeared on GE Reports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpbm9ubGluZS5jb20vYXZpYXRpb24tbmV3cy9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0LzIwMjEtMTEtMTQvcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtYW5kLWV0aWhhZC1zaWduLXNoYXJlZC1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS12aXNpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rolls-Royce and Etihad Sign for Shared Sustainability Vision | AIN,"Rolls-Royce and Etihad Sign for Shared Sustainability Vision

Most of its history was a chronicle of boisterous expansion then globalisation—followed by painful restructuring away from the now-unloved conglomerate model. On November 9th Lawrence Culp its chief executive announced that GE would split its remaining operations into three public companies.

Each of these entities will be large essential and very modern. One will make jet engines which GE reckons already power two-thirds of all commercial flights. Its power business will provide the systems and turbines generating one-third of the world’s electricity. The health-care division will continue to be the backbone of modern hospitals. Yet it speaks to GE ’s remarkable role that this is a modest reach given its past sprawl. From the late-19th to the late-20th century its products lit dark streets; provided the toasters fans refrigerators and televisions (along with the stations beamed to them) which transformed homes; delivered the locomotives that hauled trains; and then built a huge business financing all that and more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2tldmluZG93ZC8yMDIxLzExLzE0L2RlYXRoLXRvLWNvbmdsb21lcmF0ZXMtZ2UtamotYW5kLXRvc2hpYmEtYWxsLXJldmVhbC1wbGFucy10by1icmVhay10aGVtc2VsdmVzLXVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Death To Conglomerates: GE J&J And Toshiba All Reveal Plans To Break Themselves Up,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevindowd/2021/11/14/death-to-conglomerates-ge-jj-and-toshiba-all-reveal-plans-to-break-themselves-up/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2tldmluZG93ZC8yMDIxLzExLzE0L2RlYXRoLXRvLWNvbmdsb21lcmF0ZXMtZ2UtamotYW5kLXRvc2hpYmEtYWxsLXJldmVhbC1wbGFucy10by1icmVhay10aGVtc2VsdmVzLXVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

GPU giant Nvidia has pledged to build an energy-efficient supercomputer to simulate the world.

The company announced the Earth-2 supercomputer at its GTC21 virtual conference. “We will build a digital twin to simulate and predict climate change” Huang said during his keynote.

It will run AI physics defined by the new Nvidia Modulus AI framework and simulated on the Nvidia Omniverse platform he said.

“All the technologies we have invented up to this moment are needed to make Earth-2 possible” he added. “I cannot imagine a greater and more important use.”

Omniverse is the company's branding for 3D simulation design collaboration and digital twins. Given Facebook's recent rebrand as Meta and the rise of the metaverse as an investor-friendly buzzword Omniverse is now being billed as a ""metaverse for engineers.""

The new supercomputer will be ""designed for Omniverse because if you imagine Earth as a physical thing this will be the engine of alternate worlds” Huang told reporters.

He added that the system will be ""the most energy-efficient supercomputer ever created."" Depending on the benchmark used that current title either belongs to the MN-3 - a 1.8 petaflops Japanese supercomputer that tops the Green500 list or the NREL ESIF HPC data center which has a PUE of 1.01.

An Nvidia DGX A100 system is second on the Top500 list while its own in-house DGX SuperPOD is number five.

The company operates the Selene supercomputer in California and recently opened the Cambridge-1 facility at Kao Data's site in Harlow.

The UK supercomputer is available to select DGX customers in the healthcare space a first for a company that has traditionally only used supercomputers for internal use.

Earth-2 will also be made available to unspecified researchers and partners.

It is not clear what resolution the Earth will be simulated at and which parts of the global weather system will be given priority.

Last year we profiled an ambitious European Union effort to build a digital twin of the Earth but found that 'Destination Earth' faced an uphill challenge to simulate something at such a vast and complex scale.

“To have this cohesive digital twin of the Earth I don't see that happening"" Professor Michael Grieves inventor of the first digital twin told DCD. ""I think that is so far out I just can't conceive. I'm not seeing that anytime this millennium.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L2RvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLXNhbGVzLW5vdi0xNC0yMC1idXR0ZXItc3RpY2tzLWh1bnRzLXBhc3RhLXNhdWNlLWFqYXgtZGlzaC1saXF1aWQtMy1kYXktc2FsZS8xOTk4MTc5NC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar General sales Nov. 14-20: Butter sticks Hunt's Pasta Sauce Ajax dish liquid 3-day sale,"* Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links and we may earn a small commission if you use them.

Should we Keep Talking About Generations?,"What happened to Generation Y? Should we Keep Talking About Generations?

Por r.c.d. kreimerman

If you were born between 1965 and 1980 you are considered a Gen X. As you might have guessed there isn’t an international commission or crowdsourcing effort to name generations. (Crowdsourcing being a concept born during the Gen X era) It is usually researchers or the media that come up with names to talk about a cohort (according to thoughtco.com a cohort is a group of people who share an experience or characteristic over time). For economy you would rather name a cohort in a memorable way such as Gen X rather than referring to it as the 65-80 generation.

Coming after the Baby Boomers Gen Xers were originally referred to as the Baby Busters. Thankfully for all of us the name did not stick. The term Generation X was first used by photographer Robert Capa describing the generation of the 50’s (Generation X: America’s neglected ‘middle child’ Pew Research. Paul Taylor George Gao. June 2014) Douglas Coupland recycled the term for his 1991 novel ‘Generation X’. Slowly but surely the novel became a bestseller and the name stuck.

What comes after X? Gen Y was the obvious choice for the generation that followed. But once again the name Gen Y did not stick. The term Millennials is attributed to William Strauss and Neil Howe (First appearing in their 2000 book: “Millennials Rising”). Today we identify millennial’s as the first digital generation. The generation of those born between 1980 and 1996.

In the seminal essay Theory of Generations German Sociologist Karl Mannheim described generations as a group of individuals of similar ages whose members have experienced a noteworthy historical event within a set period of time. He notes that this historical event has to be experienced at a young age. This is important because future events will be interpreted based on those earlier experiences. A generation typically groups people born over a 15 to 20 year span. It is assumed that people born in that period would share similar idiosyncrasies that would differ from other generations; but this is arbitrary and could be totally wrong.

According to consumer trends expert Peter Francese the Baby Boomers (1946-64) were the first generation to exist. Meaning the first generation to be named and targeted for marketing purposes. The Lost Generation (1883-1901) The Greatest Generation (1902-27) and The Silent Generation (1928-45) were named retroactively. It all started with the period identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as the post war baby boom. A period between 1946 and 1964 where 78.3 million Americans were born. The Lost Generation (1883-1901) is the generation of World War I. It is the sentiment of massive loss of life and migration. The Greatest Generation (1902-27) came after the great depression and they were thought to have a moralistic attitude towards the conflict. The Silent Generation (1928-45) came of age during the postwar period and were very accepting towards the government.

Jean Twenge named the cohort of those born between 1997 to 2012 as the iGen. I think this is a good name but Gen Z appears to be the winner (Which is weird because Gen Y is not widely popular). The latest generation to be named is the Alpha Generation. This is a clear effort to have a new alphabet to work with for future names.

Now if you were born or live outside of the United States you already know that these labels mean very little to you or your parents.

At the beginning of the previous century Mexico was not worried about the First World War Mexico was in the middle of the civil war known as the Mexican Revolution which ended in 1917. In the 1940s the greatest historical event was the nationalization of oil and in the 60’s the student movement. In Argentina the 20th century was plagued by government instability. In this century the institutions suffered six coups two of which became dictatorships. Colombia has had a historical political instability (even to this day) that has been linked to income inequality and drug trafficking. These are just a few examples of events in Latin American countries but it is not necessary to go very deep to realize that each country lives its own history and this history is interpreted differently depending on the level of education and income. It is undeniable that technology is an important force that shapes society and that our parents’ relationship with technology is different from ours. In that sense the cohorts will have things in common corresponding to age. However there are other types of attitudes and world-views that correspond to the place where you grew up and were educated. In that sense you are more likely to have more in common with your parents than someone your own age who lives on another continent.

To better understand the dynamics of any country it would be advisable to create new segments that recognize their historical events. Also use these definitions broadly in an effort to enrich the conversation thus trying to avoid stereotypes. Generations are fluid and there is a lot of overlap between them.

The Exception

For the first time in recent history there has been an event that affected everyone in the world. I wonder if in the next few years Gen Z’s and/or Alpha’s will be known as the COVID generation.

An interesting thread has recently appeared on Reddit. It covers the concept of the Digital Linear Voltage Regulator (DLVR) which might be used with the upcoming Intel Raptor Lake CPU series.

Intel Raptor Lake Digital Linear Voltage Regulator Source: VideoCardz

The thread actually redirects to patent hunter Underfox who discovered that Intel had plans for DLVR since January 2020 at least but the patent was not published till July 8th this year. This is not the first time we are hearing about DLVR though as the acronym had already appeared in a leaked slide that we posted exclusively back in March 2021 except at the time we had no idea exactly what it meant.

Power supply architecture with digital linear VR clamp Source: Intel

So as it turns out DLVR stands for Digital Linear Voltage Regulator and it is explained by Intel in a patent called “Digital Linear Regulator Clamping Method and Apparatus”. The document claims that by placing an additional voltage regulator in parrel to the primary regulator for instance on a motherboard the power consumption of the processor core can be lowered. This power delivery modification is relatively cheap to implement and has low complexity of tuning the document explains.

Intel researchers claim that it is important to determine input voltage for the regulator in order to account for sudden loading requirements for the SoC CPU or GPU. It is said that higher than the necessary voltage for the regulator will generate more heat and power consumption. There are several factors that cause this increased voltage mainly motherboard load-line (LL) and maximum processor current requirement but also inaccuracy in motherboards voltage regulator. By implementing digital-LVR in parrel to the primary voltage regulator the CPU core input voltage is lower and as a result power consumption is reduced.

Core voltage drop and power benefit of DLVR Source: Intel

Intel researchers have concluded that DLVR can reduce CPU voltage by 160mV which translates to about a 20% to 25% drop in CPU power consumption. A 21% of voltage drop on the CPU translates to approximately 7% performance gain.

With all this in mind it appears that Intel 13th Gen Core series codenamed Raptor Lake (launching for both desktop and mobile devices) will not only increase the core count (16 Atom cores) but also provide improvements to CPU cache LPDDR5X memory support and performance and power efficiency gains due to new Digital Linear Voltage Regulator. Some of the features may require an upgrade to Intel 700 series motherboards though.

By Arjun KoladyFor a while now brands have been looking for more impactful ways to connect with the often-distracted-by-excess-information generation of Zs. The onset of the pandemic accelerated the shift in marketing campaigns as brands sought fresher ways to reach this audience through digital mediums and build cultural relevance. And in all this audio emerged stronger than ever before.The Z’s affinity to stream audio across devices and increased interest in music and podcasts owing to screen fatigue and doom scrolling has put audio front and center. With millions of Z’s streaming music to accompany their moments here’s all you need to know on what makes audio an indispensable part of their ‘everyday’ and why marketers cannot ignore the role of audio in their brand communication.Music is an integral part of how this generation balances their digitally saturated and socially distanced lives. Songs that help them relax and unwind or soundtrack their daily activities play an important role in expressing and feeling their emotions. In fact findings from our recent Culture Next report show that in India 80 per cent of Gen Zs feel more centered and generally happier when listening to their favourite music daily.This opens up opportunities for advertisers to engage with listeners during moments when they feel connected to themselves. The willingness of consumers to listen to an advertisement allows brands to strategically place uncluttered region specific and perfectly timed audio ads that resonate with the Zs. Gen Z has grown up on the internet often reposting remixing and rehashing culture through social connections that they build online. They discover new songs artists and trends through social sharing whether friends or like-minded communities This is a huge opportunity for advertisers to speak the generation’s lingo and become a part of social conversations through personalized playlists music that speaks to a cause or even artist advocacy programs.Customized playlists are also a great tool for brands to connect with Zs through contextual immersive relevant and original ads. For instance an e-commerce clothing brand can associate with a shopping themed playlist during big Indian festivals like Diwali or a fitness brand can collaborate with a health-conscious artist to curate an upbeat workout playlist.In the Culture Next Report this year nearly 50% of the Gen Zs ranked their trust in podcasts higher than their average trust in traditional media sources including national TV news newspapers and radio. Not only that. The average podcast listenership increased over 300% among Zs year-on-year and for nearly 70% of them the podcast hosts “sometimes feel like a friend”.The wide array of podcasts diversity of creators and open discussions create an intimate connection between creators and listeners while also building a sense of trust. Advertisers can build on this momentum through the creation of custom podcast ads and content integrations that result in an increase in the listener's awareness about the brand in a trusted wholesome and lean-in environment.While listener connection with audio has always been strong the easy access to every genre of music and every type of podcast on streaming platforms has made this connection even deeper. Audio is the most immersive form of media and now is the time for brands to create communities and campaigns based on common interests and passion of consumers who matter to them.The author is the head of sales at Spotify India.

The Tomcat has its early roots in the Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX) program. Seeking to cut development costs and to streamline production chains then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara laid plans to procure a joint fighter for the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Against the wishes of the Navy the TFX program produced the ill-fated General Dynamics F-111B attack aircraft a long-range interceptor plagued by excessive weight and landing mechanism problems. The F-111B project was cut short by 1968 and the Navy was given the green light to develop a two-seat twin-engine air superiority fighter better suited to its mission parameters.

The first of the prolific “teen series” fighters that also included the F-15 Eagle F-16 Fighting Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets the F-14 Tomcat was designed to incorporate the air combat lessons learned from the poor service record of the F-4 Phantom II during the Vietnam War years particularly against the fighters in the formidable Soviet MiG catalog (and to more effectively engage Soviet bombers like the Tu-22). As noted in a deeply insightful 2014 lecture by Northrop Grumman VP Mike Ciminera the uphill struggles of the TFX program were not completely for naught—the F-111's many design deficiencies provided crucial engineering experience that helped mold the Tomcat into the well-rounded naval aviation fighter that it proved itself to be over its three decades of service.

The F-14 Tomcat was first deployed in 1974 aboard the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier as part of the U.S. withdrawal from Saigon. The fighter featured a host of improvements over its F-4 predecessor including an integrated M61 Vulcan cannon for additional flexibility in dogfights. At top speeds approaching Mach 2.4 the Tomcat could capably fulfill the Navy’s requirement for a fast-flying interceptor; it was also markedly more agile than the F-4 which despite its massively powerful J79 twin engines was not known for its stellar aerodynamic performance.

The F-14's versatile armament suite spread across ten hardpoints allowed it to perform both long-range interception and air superiority missions. The fighter's potent AN/AWG-9 radar complements its long-range Phoenix AIM-54A missiles giving it the ability to threaten high-value aerial targets at a range over 100 miles. Meanwhile its AIM-7 and AIM-9 medium and short-range missile loadout made it well-suited for an attack escort role.

The Tomcat drew its first blood during the Gulf of Sidra incident in which two F-14's destroyed two Sukhoi Su-22s belonging to the Libyan Air Force. The F-14 continued to see regular use throughout the 1990s and 2000s as a strike escort and reconnaissance and surveillance platform taking part in Operation Desert Storm the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and the Iraq War. But the title of all-time most successful F-14 pilot goes to Iranian ace of aces Jalil Zandi who is credited with downing as many as 11 Iraqi aircraft during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War.

The F-14B revision introduced in 1987 brought an updated engine and partially enhanced avionics. The final F-14 variant the F-14D incorporated a glass cockpit as well as a slew of new and updated electronic warfare and targeting systems.

Upwards of seven hundred F-14 models were produced through the early 1990s. The Tomcat was formally retired in 2006 following a final strike mission over Iraq capping off the career of one of the most iconic fighters in U.S. naval aviation history.

The ceremony naming New Jersey — the fifth Block IV Virginia nuclear attack boat — comes as the two yards responsible for building U.S. nuclear submarines continue to recover from pandemic delays and prepare for the construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN-826) nuclear ballistic missile submarine.

“During COVID last year we did have to make some prioritization decisions based on a significant reduction of our workforce here and we prioritized through collaboration with the Navy really the vessels that were closest to delivery” Jason Ward Huntington Ingalls Industries’ vice president of Virginia-class submarine construction told USNI News on Friday at the shipyard.

Builders Newport News and General Dynamics Electric Boat each build components of the Virginia-class submarines and barge the sections to each other’s yard for final assembly.

According to a June report from the Government Accountability Office eight of the ten Block IV Virginias have been delayed about four months on average and put follow-on Block Vs at risk.

The yards “stated that the overall increase in submarine workload and resulting increase of inexperienced new hires at both the suppliers and the shipbuilders along with long-term challenges meeting staffing levels are driving these unfavorable cost trends for both blocks” reads the GAO report.

Both yards are balancing the boats under ongoing construction with the demands of Columbia-class submarine production.

“The important part of the Virginia program is really about cadence” Ward said. “Two [boats] per year is really what enables a six-month build cadence that supports efficiency learning curve [and] cost advantages [for] a stable production.”

To that end EB HII and the Navy are taking an integrated approach to building Navy’s nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers Ward said.

“Coupled with that strategic initiative is the support from Congress with supplier development funds to invest in industrial capacity and capability to support the increased demand for these weapons systems” Ward said.

The two yards have studied the capital investment needed to produce three Virginia-class submarines a year. Ward said expanding the yard to reach that goal would take four to five years.

In the short term Newport News is building 200-foot extensions on its construction bays to accommodate the Block V Virginia Payload Module’s planned 84-foot extension.

Attack submarines are a key advantage the U.S. has over geopolitical strategic competitors China and Russia.

“New Jersey and her sister ships will fill an ever-increasing need to counter Russia in the Atlantic and China’s growing anti-access threats in the western Pacific” Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe the head of the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs said in a speech during the ceremony.

“Why is each submarine we build more capable than the one before it? The answer is it’s because our adversaries are working tirelessly to do the same” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTMvbmF2eXMtbmV3ZXN0LWF0dGFjay1zdWJtYXJpbmUtdGhlLW5ldy1qZXJzZXktaXMtY2hyaXN0ZW5lZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Navy's newest attack submarine the New Jersey is christened,"Sponsor Susan DiMarco needed two swings of a bottle of sparkling wine to christen the Navy’s next attack submarine the New Jersey.

The first in-person christening of a warship at Newport News Shipbuilding during the pandemic provided a chance to reflect on challenging times — and move through them.

Christening the vessel now officially the Virginia-class submarine New Jersey means it is ready to take to the water — on schedule to be delivered to the Navy next year.

“Let’s remember our shared strength” DiMarco told the crowd of 1800 sailors shipbuilders and folks from New Jersey who gathered on a windy Saturday morning behind Bay 4 of the Module Outfitting Facility to celebrate.

Then shipyard president Jennifer Boykin called out: “Let’s christen this Jersey girl!”

Christening starts the final sprint for the shipyard and submarine crew with slightly less than 20% of work still to be completed along with the extensive testing required before any warship can be commissioned as a “United States ship.”

“The future USS New Jersey will be a critical some might say the most critical arrow in our quiver” Adm. Mike Mullen former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the crowd.

“We face an adversary we have not seen before” he said while “recent events moved us closer to a breaking point” for American democracy than he had ever thought possible.

New Jersey is the 23rd Virginia-class fast-attack submarine and the 11th boat to be delivered by Newport News Shipbuilding under a unique partnership with General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard in Connecticut. Newport News builds the bow stern sail and nuclear propulsion sections of the boats while the two yards alternate final assembly.

“I’m glad to see the teaming agreement work so well” Mullen said adding that the first days of the pact now spanning two decades were difficult.

“Challenging times often feel like time is standing still … but milestones like today remind us that we are moving forward” said Boykin.

Despite the pandemic shipbuilders and suppliers “remained laser focused on meeting our commitment to the U.S. Navy — that’s moving forward” she added. “The first Virginia-class submarine designed for male and female sailors that’s moving forward” she said. “New Jersey defines what made in America means.”

New Jersey will move into a floating dry dock to begin its final fitting out in the next few weeks — it’ll take three days for some 56 heavy duty sets of railcar wheels to move the 7800 ton submarine the 960 feet to the dry dock.

On Friday Cmdr. Carlos Otero and Master Chief Hamilton Felt did their walk-through of their submarine.

“Last week there was still scaffolding up there were tubes and pipes dangling everywhere like a patient on life support” said Felt. “Now she looks like she’s ready to come to life.”

For Felt seeing New Jersey free itself from its scaffolding and tubes and pipes is a big deal. He’s been at the yard since 2019 watching as 4000 shipbuilders turned steel into a submarine.

“I’ve seen them put the pieces together to make the bow and stern” he said. Those are the parts of all Virginia-class submarines that along with the sail and the nuclear propulsion compartments Newport News builds as part of its partnership with General Dynamics Electric Boat yard in Connecticut.

“Then I saw them assemble everything here” he added. Newport News and Electric Boat alternate assembly of Virginia-class submarines as part of their unique teaming relationship. The New Jersey is the 11th Virginia-class submarine Newport News assembled.

The Navy and Congress would like to step up the pace of Virginia-class sub output a five-year production process that delivers two boats a year and shipyard officials already are eyeing Bay 4 for work on yet another sub.

The bay next to New Jersey is filled by the submarine Massachusetts — in fact that’s where many of foreman Patrick Veloso’s second-shift crew are already at work.

“It’s a little like an assembly line” said Veloso a native of Newark New Jersey. But it can be years between the time he and his teammates do one particular job on one sub before they have to do it again on the next in line so it really doesn’t feel that way.

“Every one is different” the 12-year veteran of submarine construction said. “And I think we get better and better with each one.”

Nuclear testing engineer Nicholas Panagotopulos who joined the yard just a year ago working on some of the final complete-systems testing of the nuclear propulsion system is also concentrating on the Massachusetts these days.

But it was a big deal for the New Jersey native to work on a submarine named for his home state.

“When I was a kid we used to go to the battleship New Jersey” he said. “It was such a monumental piece of work. And now I got to work on another monumental one.”

Huntington Ingalls Industries press release

“The christening is a Navy and shipbuilder tradition that celebrates the hard work and dedication of the women and men who are building this magnificent submarine readying her for the next phase of construction which includes launch testing sea trials and delivery to the Navy” said Jennifer Boykin president of Newport News Shipbuilding. “We commemorate these American builders during a challenging time in our nation’s history.”

“When New Jersey joins the Navy’s fleet she will deliver firepower for freedom taking with her the skill of her shipbuilders the spirit of her sponsor the courage of her commander and crew and the pride of her fellow New Jerseyans” Boykin added. “These characteristics united forge a strong national defense that defines America.”

Susan DiMarco who is a New Jersey resident retired dentist and wife of former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson serves as the ship’s sponsor and performed the traditional honor of breaking a bottle of American sparkling wine across the submarine’s bow during the ceremony.

“As citizens today we are more divided and disconnected from one another than at any time in our last 50 years but the efforts that went into building New Jersey say otherwise” DiMarco said. “In order to complete this great ship there must have been vital partnership and purpose. As a country we are cooperative generous and tenacious and we can work together on exceptional ideas.”

The ceremony took place outside of Newport News Shipbuilding’s Module Outfitting Facility and was attended by more than 1800 guests including Newport News Shipbuilding employees who are building New Jersey members of the submarine’s crew Navy personnel and other government officials including Jeh Johnson.

U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia and U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross of New Jersey both delivered remarks. Other speakers included New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy; Jay Stefany acting assistant secretary of the Navy for research development and acquisition; Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe Jr. director of the Navy’s strategic systems programs; and Kevin Graney president of General Dynamics Electric Boat.

Ceremony participants included U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia; Capt. Andrew P. Johnson commanding officer of Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion and Repair Newport News; and Cmdr. Carlos Otero the ship’s prospective commanding officer.

Retired U.S. Navy Adm. Michael Mullen former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former chief of naval operations provided the keynote address.

“Today is a day of gratitude especially to the 4000 men and women whose hard work put New Jersey together” said Mullen adding that the nation must prevail in an ideological battle against an adversary it has not seen before.

“The future USS New Jersey will be a critical — some say the most critical — arrow in our quiver” he said.

The company reached the pressure hull complete milestone in February meaning that all of the ship’s hull sections were joined to form a single watertight unit. This was one of the last major milestones before the christening and is floated off to a pierside berth for additional outfitting and testing at a future date.

New Jersey is the 23rd Virginia-class submarine and the 11th to be delivered by Newport News Shipbuilding. It is first submarine designed with a modification for gender integration. Construction began in March 2016 and is 82% complete. The submarine is scheduled to be delivered to the U.S. Navy in late 2022."
GIS,General Mills,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vdGNibWFnLmNvbS9pbm5vdmF0aW5nLW9uLXRoZS1pbnNpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovating on the Inside,"Not every company names its growth strategy. But General Mills Inc. is a global marketing machine so the Golden Valley-based behemoth dubbed its spring 2021 blueprint “Accelerate.” The company is restructuring to “increase agility” which will result in the elimination of 700 to 800 North American jobs and another 600 to 700 worldwide—news that grabbed most of the headlines. But cost savings weren’t the only driver. The reorganization also created several new leadership roles focused on transformation growth and disruption. Like many Fortune 500s that are feeling pressure to move at the speed of startups the company that created Cheerios wants to bulk up its innovation muscle.

“This is an acknowledgement that we can’t just do things the way we used to do it” says Doug Martin General Mills’ newly appointed disruptive growth officer. Previously the president of the company’s dairy operating division Martin was promoted in June to oversee a new team focused on growth opportunities. That includes G-Works a new internal innovation engine and the 301 Inc. venture capital arm which invests in and mentors emerging brands.

“There are things we do really well: delivering big brands everywhere in America safely and effectively. And we’re good at marketing those big brands” Martin says. “But there’s a big difference between the skill set of someone running a billion-dollar brand and the skill set of someone who is going to create something new from scratch.”

Enter Amol Dixit. Make that “re-enter.”

Dixit started his career at General Mills and spent 15 years climbing the ranks to a senior marketing manager position. In 2011 he became manager of a team that identified and executed investments in emerging food brands. “I wanted to be an innovation guy at General Mills” he recalls. A year later he left to do it his own way. He launched Hot Indian a fast-casual restaurant concept with ambition to popularize Indian cuisine. Today Hot Indian has two locations at Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis and Mall of America (a third in the downtown Minneapolis skyways remains in pandemic limbo). Dixit has become a familiar face in the local food and startup scenes thanks to his pioneering concept cheeky branding and support of corporate titans like former General Mills chief marketing officer Mark Addicks now a Hot Indian investor.

But as is often the case with startups revenue doesn’t necessarily match the buzz. So with a trusted head chef running Hot Indian’s day-to-day operation Dixit went looking for his next opportunity. He found it in the last place he expected: back where he started at General Mills running the G-Works incubator.

“This isn’t me coming back to get on the marketing career path” Dixit says. “This is me seeing an opportunity to be an innovation leader. For me it feels like the company is in a different place. Innovation is front and center. To be part of a group that is going to play a big role in achieving that ambition it’s exciting.”

A Startup Mentality

General Mills isn’t Minnesota’s only large company stepping up internal innovation. Cargill launched the Entrepreneurial Digital Growth Engine (EDGE) last year to pursue new ideas unencumbered by the typical corporate process.

“Often in big corporations the team comes up with a new idea and then applies traditional business decision-making like ‘What’s the [return on investment]?’ The biggest tech giants wouldn’t be what they are today with that thinking” says Lawrence Wang Cargill’s director of digital strategy development. “We’ve always had it in our DNA to be innovative—but we need to learn how to take more risks and how to invest in the big market potential of new ideas.”

That means making investments without guarantees. Fail fast. Test cheaply. The pace of innovation today requires looking beyond the corporate walls Wang says.

For many big companies the most efficient way to evolve is through acquisitions. Wang says Cargill has learned a lot about the startup mentality by working with independent founders through its Techstars Farm to Fork Accelerator but the company also wants to capitalize on the institutional knowledge of its 155000 employees.

That’s what EDGE is meant to do. The program is staffed by a small team of people who have corporate innovation or entrepreneurial experience. Anyone in Cargill’s global workforce can put forth an idea and the EDGE team will decide whether there’s a viable path to scale. If greenlighted the employee with the idea might become a “founder” and work on the project part time—or more; EDGE will provide the resources support and necessary capital to pursue new ideas. Both Cargill and General Mills declined to say how much funding is available to their new startup programs.

“The goal is to develop a portfolio of investments” Wang says. “You need a high volume of ideas to do that.”

As for General Mills “We’re very good at flowing capital into things that are working” Martin says.

G-Works’ mission is much the same as Cargill’s EDGE but General Mills took a different approach to setting it up. The department consists of 20 “builders” divided into threeperson teams. (Most came from other departments in the company; a few like Dixit were external hires.) Each trio includes a commercial lead a technical lead and a trend specialist. The G-Works teams identify “opportunity areas” and find a consumer problem they want to solve. “We’re very open in how we define opportunity areas” Martin says. The key he says is finding space between existing products. For example “We shouldn’t have a G-Works team coming up with a new cereal flavor.”

G-Works’ first product is already on shelves at local Hy-Vee stores and Amazon. Good Measure is a snack brand targeted to people with diabetes. It resulted from a team digging into the unique pain points faced by people who have to think about how what they eat interacts with their blood sugar. Nearly one in six adults in the U.S. has been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It’s the sort of niche product line that might have come from a solo founder with diabetes who experiences dietary struggles every day. G-Works is an attempt to improve on the ideation and support for smaller ideas Martin says rather than what has become the sweet spot of many large companies like General Mills: making big brands bigger.

“The competition from smaller brands has clearly been exposed in the food space” Martin says. “We’d like to rebuild some of that muscle of creating and nurturing brands in their infancy so that one day they can be big enough to live comfortably within the bigger machine that is General Mills.”

15% Culture

But can big companies really get out of their own way?

At 3M a freewheeling spirit of entrepreneurship was in effect long before Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson built rocket ships to launch themselves into space. Company leaders today often recite the edict of William L. McKnight who became 3M’s president in 1929: “Delegate responsibility and encourage men and women to exercise their initiative.”

That philosophy held by several early company leaders led to 3M’s longstanding “15% culture” which allows employees to pursue passion projects on company time that may or may not be related to their day jobs. Post-it Notes are the classic example: A 3M scientist charged with making strong adhesives came across one that stuck lightly to surfaces and didn’t bond. After several years of noodling with potential applications a colleague griping about how his scrap notes fell out of his hymnal inspired the eureka moment.

“I’d argue almost all of our products come out of 15% time” says John Banovetz 3M chief technology officer.

The company doesn’t track 15% time. Some employees mark it on their calendars; for others it’s more of a general understanding that daydreaming is good for business.

“As a leader I don’t want to know what you’re working on” Banovetz says. “As soon as I know it creates that compulsion of  ‘This has to work.’ ’’ For large companies to successfully create a culture of innovation it’s essential to support ideation Banovetz says. “Knowing that only three in 10 ideas may succeed it’s more important to promote that personal initiative. The payoff is long term.”

In today’s business environment where successful entrepreneurs become celebrities and VC firms throw mega-millions at potential unicorns that have yet to turn a profit you have to wonder: Would that 3M scientist have left the company and tried to launch Post-its alone?

The lure of entrepreneurship has become more powerful and seemingly more tangible says Myles Shaver professor of strategic management and entrepreneurship at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. “There’s a bigger focus today on entrepreneurial education. Students want to take these classes.”

That path was less obvious when Dixit earned his MBA in 2002. “If I had to label myself I don’t know if ‘entrepreneur’ was the thing I would have said back then” Dixit says. “I think I’m an innovator and you can apply that anywhere.”

The “working in a garage subsisting on ramen” stories of starting a company tend to get glamorized but the realities of being a startup founder can take their toll. “There’s the emotional side: I have the feeling that the best possible version of Hot Indian hasn’t yet seen the light of day and that’s on me. I’ve made some bad decisions over the past eight years but I still have such belief in the brand and what we’re trying to do” Dixit says. “Then there’s the practical side of it: I have leases bank debt investors employees. There are always obligations and you’ve got to do everything in your power to meet those obligations.”

Corporate innovation support eliminates some of the more nerve-racking aspects of starting up. “It allows me to focus on the task at hand” Dixit says.

But the reward of writing payroll checks is the determination it creates to succeed.

“We’re still figuring out how to do this in a corporate setting as effectively and efficiently as possible” Dixit says. “In traditional corporate jobs there’s a playbook for how to build how to manage how to grow. Here we’re building that playbook. All of these accelerators and venture funds we have to think about the equivalent for corporate entrepreneurship. How prescribed should the playbook be? How do we plug into the food startup world? How do you gain big company resources while gaining empathy for what it means to be an entrepreneur?”

At G-Works Dixit has the space to explore all of those questions and experiment with the answers.

“We don’t know what perfect looks like here” Martin says.

For now G-Works members receive the same sort of compensation package as any other General Mills employee. But everything is up for discussion and disruption Martin says. “We need to think about incenting the right behavior. We’re not going to do that on Cheerios. But here the whole model assumes a level of failure that’s pretty high—and now and then you’re going to hit it out of the park.”

At 3M accolades come to those who shine but there’s no monetary award for a successful 15% project Banovetz says. “My advice to other companies: Be conscious of the pivots that happen and support the people who choose to pursue new ideas. Innovation is very much a team sport.”

Supporting Startups

Four Twin Cities-based corporate accelerators with proven results.

Not all of the big ideas come from big companies. More than 75 businesses in the Fortune 100 are now active in corporate venturing according to Inc. magazine. In the Twin Cities home to the most Fortune 500 companies per capita of any metro area several corporations run their own external startup accelerator programs.

Beyond funding most provide resources and expertise to help small businesses grow. The goal might be acquisition or partnership but sometimes it’s simply about learning and mentorship. “When you think about a startup what they need most is access to the market and expertise. Meanwhile big corporations need access to innovators and solutions that could potentially be disruptive” says Lawrence Wang Cargill’s director of digital strategy development. “Our overall belief is we need to transform ourselves and be better at how we innovate internally but we also know that there are a lot of big problems to be solved in food and ag and our environment such as food safety security sustainability and transparency. We can’t do it alone. We need a broader ecosystem of innovators to bring these things to life and market.”

Here’s a sampling of corporate accelerators active in the Twin Cities.

If truly awake the Christian Church will roar about the nightmare of injustices Palestinians live with every day. Ainsworth United Church of Christ of Portland Oregon is one awakened church. Our church just pledged to be a Pillsbury-Free-Church in support of Palestinian human rights. We hope our action will be a spark to awaken more sleeping local churches across the nation and our government. Join us! Boycott Pillsbury!

Love the Bread of Life and reject the Bread of Oppression

Why boycott Pillsbury? It seems that cute little Dough Boy got himself nestled into an illegal Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem. The United Nations lists General Mills owner of the Pillsbury brand as one of the top seven abusers of international law by producing Pillsbury products in Atarot an illegal settlement. This Palestinian land was confiscated then annexed by Israel. Pillsbury profits from the theft of this land use of water and other resources. Pillsbury is perpetrating and profiting from an inhumane system of segregation by making products in this settlement. If we say we love and follow Jesus the Bread of Life then we must reject this Bread of Oppression and Boycott Pillsbury!

There are many reasons to be awake!

I once read a list of abuses to the Ainsworth congregation. Here is a short version: In the West Bank Palestinian children as young as six are pulled from their beds in the middle of the night by the Israeli Defense Forces and arrested. No parent or lawyer is allowed to go with them. They are often tortured and then forced to sign confessions in Hebrew a language they do not understand. Over 400 “flying” Israeli checkpoints block movement. Eyewitnesses report that Palestinians have died stopped at checkpoints while on the way to the hospital. Palestinians are blocked from their own fields jobs and children from school. Palestinian homes are systematically bulldozed by the Israeli government and the owner is sometimes forced to pay for that demolition while homeless.

Settlements have water provided 24/7 for homes gardens bushes and pools while water in some Palestinian areas is distributed only once per week to small tanks on their roofs. They ration their water. Settlers have burned Palestinian owned orchards. Palestinian Bedouin’s goats and sheep have been slaughtered by settlers who are not arrested by police and soldiers who protect the settlers. Settlers travel on settler-only roads that lead to Jerusalem and their jobs. Settlers have specifically colored license plates. Palestinians have different colored license plates limiting access to settler-only roads so they struggle on torn-up old roads.

Work permits get Palestinian workers through West Bank checkpoints to go to the Pillsbury factory but they are not allowed to work anywhere else in Israel. Permits to work can be denied at any point. Waiting at the checkpoints to get to the factory can take hours. If workers are late they can lose their jobs. General Mills says Palestinians are paid equally to their Israeli counterparts at the factory but over 170 Palestinian unions and organizations have called on the people of the world to boycott any international company producing products in illegal settlements. General Mills is immoral to argue “equal pay” when one of the parties you’re paying stole the land your factory sits on from the other party. You don’t get a trophy for fulfilling one legal obligation while committing a crime against humanity.

The Palestinians in Gaza live in the largest open-air prison in the world. Israel gets USA funding for an Iron Dome which stops homemade missiles from Gaza. Nothing stops the bombs dropped by Israel on Gaza using American made planes. Homes hospitals and schools have been bombed. Teenagers’ legs are shot by the IDF and then amputated crippling the next generation of boys from Gaza.

I had gone on for eight minutes reading this list to the congregation. Feeling the horror in the room I asked if they wanted me to stop. They all said “Yes!” Then I said “You lived that for 8 minutes. Can you imagine being Palestinian and living that horror for your entire lifetime?

Jaw-dropping right? I traveled there four times and it only gets worse. Even some of the Pillsbury family whose family relative started the company are calling on us to boycott Pillsbury. They say “Not in our name!” Charlie Pillsbury produced a film you can view here:

Christians in Palestine wrote “Cry for Hope: A Decisive Call for Action” calling on the international community to confront Israel’s theft of land and abuses. The National setting of the United Church of Christ since 2005 is on record supporting the use of economic measures including boycott sanctions and divestment which pre-dates the “Cry for Hope.” The national UCC has joined the Pillsbury Boycott. The national settings of the Methodists and Presbyterians have also taken an anti-occupation stance and pro-Palestinian human rights.

Now it is our time for Christians in local churches to rub the sleep from our eyes and become Pillsbury-Free-Churches. What a roar that will be!

Boycotting Pillsbury is easy peasy! Do we really need those specific Pillsbury biscuits or sweet treats or can we pick some other brand that does not have ties to that horror show? You can use the Pillsbury Boycott as a vehicle in your church to teach your congregation what is going on in Palestine/Israel. Since we give more American tax dollars to Israel than any other country in the world more than all the countries of Africa combined it is important to wake up!

Boycott Pillsbury!

Become a Pillsbury-Free-Church

Wake up and Roar!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3Jpc2luZy1jb3N0cy1oaXQtc2hvcHBlcnMtZm9vZC1tYWtlcnMtZ295YS1jZW8tdW5hbnVl0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvcmlzaW5nLWNvc3RzLWhpdC1zaG9wcGVycy1mb29kLW1ha2Vycy1nb3lhLWNlby11bmFudWUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rising food costs pounding shoppers’ wallets; ‘No choice’ but to increase prices: Goya CEO,"Goya CEO Bob Unanue told FOX Business he had ""no choice"" but to increase prices for goods as manufacturers and shoppers have been feeling the pinch of the rising cost of food due to supply chain disruptions labor shortages and inflation.

Unanue stressed that inflation ""touches everybody.""

""Costs are going up. Inflation is here to stay at least for a good while and everybody has these costs"" he added.

Unanue noted that prices for some Goya products shot up about 10% so far to account for higher input costs and warned that prices could continue to rise unless the problems ease.

At supermarkets across the country some shoppers are feeling sticker shock as food prices continue to soar. Renita Gary of New Jersey said she’s been noticing higher prices on grocery store shelves and has changed her shopping habits.

""I cut a lot of things out"" she said. ""I don’t even buy clothes like I used to.""

On Wednesday it was revealed that the consumer price index climbed 6.2% year over year in October according to the Labor Department. The increase marked the largest annual gain since November 1990.

Food price jumped .9% last month which was the same increase as September according to the Labor Department. The index for meats poultry fish and eggs continued to soar increasing 1.7% in October following a 2.2% increase the month before.

Several food companies including Pepsi Coca-Cola and General Mills which produces cereal including Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Cheerios have been raising prices as they deal with higher costs as well as labor and transportation problems that are holding back key items from making it to grocery stores.

Unanue told FOX Business that his company has been hit with higher costs for everything including labor and materials.

""We’re vertically integrated"" he said noting that his company makes their own cans and bottles.

""The cost of all those packaging materials have gone way up"" Unanue continued.

CONSUMERS SEEING SOME FOOD PRICES GO ‘THROUGH THE ROOF' GROCERY STORE CEO SAYS

He noted that the increased cost for raw and packaging materials is a contributing reason as to why prices for some products increased this year.

""You've got to make a profit after your costs. If you don’t then why are you in business?"" he told FOX Business.

""You can’t pay an employee you can’t feed your kids"" Unanue continued. ""We’re consumers like everyone else and we can’t take it on the chin.""

Unanue said one of the biggest challenges has been the transportation of goods.

""We bring products like coconut water from Thailand [and] from Vietnam and a container with about 1300 cases of coconut water in it used to cost about $1800 $1.40 a case; it’s gone up to $20000 to get on a container ship if you can"" he noted.

In addition to transportation issues like many other companies Goya has been struggling to secure trucks and staff warehouses as well as production facilities.

""We are running with less people"" Unanue said. ""We are doing more with less.""

He noted that wages for warehouse and production workers have increased by about 70% since the onset of the pandemic.

""We have to keep people engaged"" Unanue said.

He went on to say that he expects supply chain issues and therefore higher prices will stick around through 2022."

The largest U.S. automaker said its ""Factory Zero"" will mark its grand opening during Biden's visit Wednesday. The plant spanning parts of Detroit and Hamtramck actually opened in 1985 but GM said in 2020 it would repurpose it to build electric trucks and SUVs.

Biden will discuss $7.5 billion in funding for EV charging stations in a recently approved infrastructure bill as well as how EVs will reduce emissions improve air quality and create ""good-paying union jobs across the country"" the White House said.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra will attend Wednesday's event.

In August Biden signed an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric. The 50% target which is not legally binding and includes plug-in hybrid models with gasoline engines won backing of U.S. and foreign automakers which said achieving it would require billions of dollars in government funding.

A proposed $1.75 trillion social spending and climate bill includes an EV tax credit of up to $12500 including a $4500 incentive for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Cost of the tax credit is estimated at $9.6 billion over 10 years.

It also includes new EV used car tax credits $3.5 billion in grants for automakers to convert existing plants to electric vehicles and components and $9 billion for the U.S. government and Postal Service to buy EVs and charging infrastructure.

On Thursday key Democratic Senator Joe Manchin expressed opposition to the union EV provision.

Biden has repeatedly refused to back any specific date to phase out new gasoline-powered vehicles. The United States did not join some other countries in Glasgow in backing a phase-out by 2040.

The EV tax credits would disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - GM Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.

Foreign automakers have harshly criticized the decision to give union-made vehicles a leg up.

The Democratic proposal eliminates phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200000 electric vehicles sold which would again make GM eligible along with Tesla.

Tesla and foreign automakers do not have unions representing U.S. factory workers and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.

GM in 2020 said it was renaming its Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant ""Factory Zero"" as it announced a $2.2 billion investment to shift the factory to EVs. The GM plant has built more than 4 million vehicles including the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid.

In September Detroit won a $4 million U.S. Commerce Department grant to reconstruct deteriorating roads in support of Factory Zero.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJzLzIwMjEvMTEvMTMvamltLXRheWxvci1odW1tZXItZWxtcy1lbGVjdHJpYy12YW4tdXJiYW4tZGVsaXZlcnkvNjM4NzEwNzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Hummer CEO Jim Taylor makes ELMS electric vans in old GM plant,"Your subscription supports:

GM plans to build prototypes of the militarized Hummer EV dubbed ""electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle"" (eLRV) in 2022 for evaluation by the U.S. Army GM Defense President Steve DuMont said in an interview at the automaker's Warren Michigan Tech Center.

In turning the Hummer EV into a military vehicle GM could take a similar approach to its Chevrolet Colorado ZR2-based Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) according to the report. The ISV uses the basic platform and powertrain from the ZR2 but with stripped-down bodywork. So while it will likely use the Hummer EV's frame motors and Ultium battery system the eLRV prototype probably won't look like the civilian model according to the report.

2022 GMC Hummer EV

The Hummer EV-based eLRV isn't a sure thing. GM is just one of 10 companies that responded to an Army request for information on an electric vehicle the report said. The Army will next release detailed specifications and call for the construction of prototypes. Two companies will be chosen to manufacture production vehicles with a decision expected by mid-decade according to the report.

The civilian Hummer EV is expected to start deliveries before the end of the year. It will launch in commemorative Edition 1 form with about 1000 hp. That will get this roughly 9000-pound vehicle from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.0 seconds GMC claims. The Hummer EV will also boast impressive off-road capability with an Extract Mode which raises the suspension to allow for 15.9 inches of ground clearance and Crab Walk which uses a four-wheel steering system to move the vehicle diagonally.

The Hummer EV Edition 1 has a $112595 base price including destination. About a year after launch GMC will follow that up with an EV3X version with the same powertrain and a $99995 base price. Less potent EV2X and EV2 models will arrive in 2023 and 2024 respectively. The EV2X will start at $89995 and the EV2 will start at $79995. A Hummer EV SUV will also arrive in 2023 as a 2024 model."

(600518.SH) to pay almost 2.5 billion yuan ($385 million) to more than 50000 investors as compensation for their losses on the company’s stock. The court ruled Friday in China’s first class-action lawsuit against the company.

The Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court found the drugmaker its executives and auditors responsible for financial fraud that caused 2.46 billion yuan of losses to 52037 investors the court said.

The defendants include former Kangmei Chairman Ma Xingtian and his wife former deputy general manager Qiu Xiwei and financial chief Zhuang Yiqing. The court found that they deliberately organized plotted and implemented the financial fraud and should be 100% liable for losses to investors. An additional 13 executives were ruled partially responsible for the losses.

Guangdong Zhengzhong Pearl River Accounting Firm which acted as Kangmei’s auditor for 18 years since 2001 and its partner Yang Wenwei were also ruled 100% liable for the losses. It’s not known whether the defendants will appeal the verdict.

Kangmei one of the country’s biggest publicly traded drugmakers was accused of financial reporting fraud involving 88.6 billion yuan of overstatements between 2016 and 2018. It was fined 600000 yuan in May 2020 by top securities regulators for inflating revenues and fabricating bank deposits.

Regulators found that the company used fake bank deposit slips to inflate cash reserves forged documents for nonexistent business activities and transferred company funds to related parties to trade in its own stock.

Kangmei’s 2020 losses reached 27.7 billion yuan up nearly five-fold from 4.7 billion yuan a year earlier. In April a Kangmei creditor filed suit seeking a bankruptcy restructuring of the company accusing Kangmei of failing to repay 49 million yuan.

On Oct. 27 Ma was charged by prosecutors with illegal disclosure failure to disclose important information misappropriation of funds and manipulation of the securities market. Ma and Kangmei were also charged with paying bribes to government officials and regulators totaling more than 10 million yuan according to indictments disclosed by the company.

Earlier this month state-owned Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Ltd. proposed to invest as much as 6.5 billion yuan in a government-led rescue of Kangmei. A special-purpose vehicle set up by local state-owned enterprises and a unit of Guangzhou Pharmaceutical already took temporary control of Kangmei’s business.

Kangmei’s creditors will vote on a restructuring plan Monday. Under the plan Kangmei set aside 2.46 billion yuan of cash stock and beneficial share of trust for expected compensation in the class-action lawsuit according to people familiar with the plan.

Investors with losses of less than 500000 yuan will get cash payments while those with losses of more than 500000 yuan will receive cash stock and beneficial share of trust according to the restructuring plan.

It’s not clear how much cash the company has put aside for the lawsuit. If the company can’t pay due to reasons such as bankruptcy the plaintiffs can request compensation from Ma and other defendants said Liu Siyuan a partner at law firm Jingtian & Gongcheng.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Sussman’s history investment philosophy and hedge fund performance go directly to the Top 5 Stock Picks of Donald Sussman’s Paloma Partners.

Selwyn Donald Sussman is a philanthropist and asset manager in the United States. He was the vice president and chief financial officer of Titan Industrial Corporation a privately held trade corporation. Subsequently he managed money for the partners of Gelberg & Abrams a New York law firm. In 1981 Sussman founded Paloma Partners a hedge fund in Greenwich Connecticut primarily for institutional investors. In addition to the Paloma funds Sussman founded Trust Asset Management and New China Capital Management LLC.

Paloma Partners is a multi-strategy investment entity that has operated through several market cycles and decades. It aims to produce good long-term risk-adjusted returns with little market correlation.

Paloma had a 1.5% return in October thanks to substantial gains in its fixed-income relative value bets. This year the $4.2 billion multi-strategy fund has gained over 10%.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) among others are some of the most important holdings of Donald Sussman’s fund as of the second quarter of 2021.

Paloma Partners owns 24077 shares in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) after reducing its stake in the company by 71% in the second quarter of 2021. On November 1 Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick initiated coverage of Microsoft rating the stock as “Buy” and gave a price target of $390.

Based on the latest 13F holdings for the second quarter of 2021 Paloma Partners owns 135198 shares in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) after cutting its holding in the company by 1% from the first quarter of 2021. On November 9 Arete analyst Richard Kramer raised his price target on Apple to $180 from $168 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares.

Donald Sussman’s Paloma Partners is also bullish on Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) according to the hedge fund’s disclosed holdings data as of the end of the second quarter of 2021. The fund increased its holding in Amazon by 21% in the second quarter ending the period with 6942 shares. On November 11 Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth raised his price target on Amazon.com to $4460 from $4370 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. According to the analyst the firm is well-placed to withstand near-term supply chain difficulties and produce solid sales growth in 2022.

Average investors have to tread the financial markets with extreme caution. Even experts are having a hard time making sense of the rapidly changing world. The hedge fund industry’s reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 86 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and July 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 186.1% vs. 100.1% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 86 percentage points (see the details here). That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Investors have been disappointed at the pace of the revenue acceleration given the uneven nature of the reopening globally. The U.S. is doing well with issues but Europe and Asia remain in various stages of reopening and lockdowns and thus spending has been curtailed.

He said it: “My favorite play was our second touchdown on the skinny post to Mike Murphy. It felt like money and I knew it when I walked to the line and saw how the defense was set up. I think I ran the ball better than I passed. People know me for passing but I like what I did running on Thursday … I stayed in the film room and studied with my coaches in the offseason a lot. I wanted to know the playbook inside and out.”

Coach said it: “I was most impressed with how he ran the ball against Harker Heights. The way he was smart with the ball I couldn’t be more proud. He has really evolved this year in how he manages a game. The way he will check down to his first second or third options on passes or not passing at all when it’s not there is very smart” DeSoto coach Claude Mathis said.

Weighing parenthood amid the climate crisis,"One evening last summer I was running through a damp field on my farm in Vermont with my 10-year-old and a passel of dogs. We were barefoot and laughing. Suddenly my daughter turned to me with a serious look in her eyes.

“I didn’t realize things were going to get so bad so soon” she said.

“What things?” I asked. Was she thinking about the heatwave in Vermont forest fires in California or the pandemic?

“Climate change” she said staring hard at me. “It’s bad isn’t it?”

Lately when my daughters begin the sentence “when I have children … ” my chest aches. I know they can live fulfilling lives without traditional parenthood but I wish them a future where they have options – one that I suspect is moving quickly out of reach. Some models predict significant global ecological and environmental collapse by 2040 – within my lifetime as well as my children’s.

It’s not only my children seeking honest answers and advice. Just before the pandemic two students entered my office and professed they no longer felt it wise to have children. Recent polling reveals that four in 10 young people are “hesitant to have children as a result of the climate crisis” and “fear that governments are doing too little to prevent climate catastrophe”.

Each of my students asked: What would you do?

Are we prepared to answer these questions honestly for the ones we love and advise? Moreover should we? As a mother of two my decision – fraught even 13 years ago – has already been made. My challenge now is to help my children process reality in an age-appropriate way and prepare for it.

Last week my eldest daughter was flipping blueberry pancakes. “Mom” she said. “I just read an article that says anyone under 40 will have a hard life because of climate change. Is that true?”

“I think it will be hard” I said choosing my words carefully. “But we’ll continue to find beauty in the world and help others.” My daughter returned to her pancakes.

I felt sick. This is the first year I’ve had to witness my daughters’ fear of the future. I respect them too much to obfuscate the truth: the world is becoming increasingly warm volatile and inequitable. Research indicates we have a mere decade left to address climate change in “an unprecedented transformational way” in order to avoid global catastrophe.

Young people are already calculating how much suffering they will witness or bear themselves and what this means for their futures particularly with regards to child-bearing.

“I do feel like this is something that’s been discussed a fair amount in circles I run in” my former student Mollie 22 shared with me via email. “Especially when conversations turn more pessimistic. Someone usually says ‘I don’t even want to have kids’ or ‘the next generation is totally fucked; we can’t have kids.’ This conversation often leaves me angry and unsettled because it forces me to wrap my mind around something completely unfathomable at the moment: what is our earth going to look like in 2050 when I might have kids trying to start lives of their own? Would it be unethical to bring someone into that world however it may look?”

My former research assistant Ellie 23 agrees. “I hope it doesn’t sound melodramatic to say that I’m deeply afraid of the things I’ll see in my lifetime. Even if humanity gets its act together I can’t imagine what my kids would see in theirs.”

Whether or not to procreate is an extremely controversial question and another example of how climate scrutiny often falls upon individual actions when it’s the governmental and capitalist systems that have made life on the planet untenable. It’s abhorrent that the burden of environmental collapse falls first on the shoulders of young people and the global south when oil corporations and countries like the United States carry an outsized responsibility for the crisis.

And yet our planet’s resources are straining under the global population which is approaching eight billion.

Many climate activists avoid mentioning childbirth because of its association with population control and eugenics. “The conversation is often reductive and racist” farmer and environmental sociologist Dr Isaac Leslie told me on a call. “White people too often blame Black and Brown women for having children when the issue isn’t population – it is consumption. Consumption is what’s linked to environmental destruction. The conversation should be about capitalism and climate change not about controlling the bodies of people who give birth.”

The Center for Biological Diversity notes on their population growth page: “Under current conditions a child born in the US will be responsible for almost seven times the carbon emissions of a child born in China and 168 times the impact of a child born in Bangladesh.” Children born into poverty are not driving the climate crisis but they will suffer its impact in an outsized way.

Dr Jaya Tiwari the vice-president of Boma Project an NGO focused on graduating women from extreme poverty in the face of climate change has witnessed the inequities of child-rearing first-hand. She made personal decisions accordingly.

“As someone growing up in India” she told me “the second most populous country in the world – and as someone who has devoted a majority of her professional life to working on development issues in the dry lands of Africa and in regions that sit at the intersection of poverty gender inequality and climate change – I agonized about the question of motherhood and what my choice to have a child meant for myself my family and my planet. The fact that we ended up with an only child is an indication of where I ultimately landed.”

Given the increasing impact and risk of childbirth it’s imperative that people who give birth have absolute control over their bodies and unfettered access to reproductive healthcare. “The vortex of poverty the lack of access to education and reproductive rights the struggle for resources and continued climate pressure creates a cycle that feeds upon itself” Tiwari tells me. “We have indisputable global evidence that education for girls correlates to having fewer children and living healthier lives.” According to Project Drawdown a non-profit focused on data-driven climate solutions increased family planning and education of women “could prevent 120 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2050 – more than on- and offshore wind combined.”

When relatively privileged individuals consider childbirth they imagine avoiding the nightmarish scenarios many parents are already living. More than 100000 children have been born in refugee camps in Myanmar and in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar the largest refugee settlement in the world which is vulnerable to extreme flooding and landslides.

“We often talk tongue-in-cheek about the apocalypse” Leslie told me. “Society and humanity will continue but the question is what gross inequalities will continue with it.”

To be clear I fundamentally believe it’s unethical to interfere with reproductive choices at the individual level. Plus families largely make emotional decisions not data-driven ones.

My students while fearful also express hope that we might leverage technology and legislation to turn things around. George 23 told me via email that “as someone who just spent his entire summer outside with kids I still definitely want children. I think I will have to see how climate legislation evolves in the next five years to make the call whether or not they are biologically mine – because I’m certainly anxious about bringing a child into calamity.”

I would offer these points of deliberation for someone considering having a child:

Connect deeply with your reasoning for bringing a child into the world

Look at the predictive modeling for climate change scenarios in your area and visualize yourself raising a child within them noting your ability to withstand risk

Be willing to have a difficult and honest conversation with your partner about family planning and domestic labor

Imagine helping your future children build the psychological physical and financial resilience they might need to endure the challenges ahead

Consider additional ways to nurture lives and build climate resilient communities

Younger generations are often more progressive about the notion of building families.

My student Ellie wrote “While I don’t believe the changes we’re seeing have to signify end-of-days I do believe there are incredibly thoughtful solutions at hand which – if we can pull them off – would bring about a world I’d very much want to have children in. But I also think my generation may have found itself at a unique moment in which more people isn’t the answer and alternatives like adoption represent more eco- and ultimately human-conscious choices.”

Queer communities present thoughtful models potential parents can learn from. Leslie tells me they spent years letting go of the idea of having biological children and grieving it. “Queerness and climate intersect in the talk about children” Leslie said noting possible plans to create a family through fostering and building space for queer community on a farm with their partner Wichie.

“It’s hard to separate what we really want from what we’ve been socialized to think we need to be happy” Leslie says. “Now that I’ve seen what chosen family can be I’m no longer attached to the concept of biological family.”

“Climate resilience is community resilience” Leslie’s partner Wichie tells me. “We understand that we’re preparing for the future. We’ll teach our children how to grow food and think about the betterment of their communities.”

As mentors friends and parents of younger generations many of us must be willing to listen and engage in meaningful conversations about climate pressure and child rearing. I suggest the following tips:

Do not direct the conversation solely at women; talk about child-rearing in a way that honors and invites contributions from men queer and nonbinary parents and other caregivers

Do not reduce the procreation conversation to platitudes. We will not help someone we love by practicing oppressive optimism about the future bludgeoning them with doomsday scenarios or pushing old agendas

Allow for grief and anger. Older generations have helped create an unfair and terrifying future

Do not center the argument on labor shortages nationalist concepts or putting more of a particular political party into the world; child rearing is a powerful individual decision

If you have accumulated wealth consider what support you’d be willing to offer families in your community or in regions of the world suffering because of climate pressure and displacement

Conversations about procreation are sometimes less about parenting logistics and ultimately more about the health and promise of the future – and how we will care for one another as things get harder.

“Despairing is easy” Leslie said to me “and it’s offensive. You have to believe that there is some sort of joyful future ahead. In queer culture we have always celebrated sex and life amidst death. We can hold these things together. People are creative; as a Jew in the diaspora I think about this all the time. Marginalized communities still carry the spirit and strategies of their chosen families and ancestors. Social connection and joy are part of building resilient communities.”

When my daughters ask me again if they should have children I will be inclined to say no. Instead I will say: I leave that decision up to you but you will want to be intentional and consider how you are participating in a resilient community.

Ultimately I will do my best to listen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzE0L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9jb3Ntb3MtYmVja29uLXNub29weS1vbnNjcmVlbi1yZWFsLWxpZmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The cosmos beckon for Snoopy onscreen and in real life,"NASA uses stuffed animals on flights because when the little guys start to float it indicates that the spacecraft has entered space’s zero gravity. Since the toys are soft and light they won’t break anything or accidentally strike a button.

A 5-ounce plush toy version of the daydreaming beagle — wearing a space suit designed according to NASA’s strict specifications — has an important job for the Artemis I unmanned mission.

A new rocket designed to launch humans to the moon Mars and beyond will launch next year from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. On board will be a familiar fuzzy figure — Snoopy.

The Artemis I mission is scheduled to circle the moon and then return to Earth in February as a dry run without astronauts making sure all systems are working for future crewed missions. Also aboard will be two Lego figurines part of an educational series.

The upcoming mission announcement coincides with the release of the second season of “Snoopy in Space” the Emmy-nominated animated series on Apple TV+. Season one saw Snoopy become an astronaut and land on the moon. Season two sees him go further in what showrunner Mark Evestaff calls an “epic road trip.”

“We have taken a bit of a step further so that Snoopy is able to go to some of these places that we haven’t been like Mars or the moons of Jupiter or visiting an exoplanet” he says. “And he does it through his imagination but it’s also based on actual science from NASA.”

Stephanie Betts chief content officer at media company WildBrain said season one was the perfect foundation. “Snoopy became an astronaut and was able to go to space. Well now what do you do with that? Well let’s go explore. Let’s have that search for life.”

Back closer to home the plush Snoopy's gravity-monitoring task — it's officially called the zero gravity indicator — will be far from the first stuffed toy used by astronauts. Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin the first human in space had a small doll when he launched on Vostok 1.

Since then an owl doll and an Angry Birds toy have been on the International Space Station a plush R2-D2 was used as the talisman on a Soyuz mission in 2015 and a stuffed snowman Olaf from the movie “Frozen” has gone up. A plush Snoopy has also been on the space station.

Snoopy has a long history with NASA starting when the Apollo X astronauts Thomas Stafford John Young and Gene Cernan chose “Peanuts” characters as nicknames — the command module was called Charlie Brown and the lunar module was Snoopy.

“Someone had the idea of trying to bring more interest into the space program. By the time they got to Apollo 10 they felt that the program was going to become a little stale” said Craig Schulz son of “Peanuts” creator Charles Schulz. “For my dad it was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest honor that could ever be bestowed upon his comic strip.”

Charles Schulz for his part drew strips with Snoopy walking on the lunar surface. “I did it! I'm first beagle on the moon! I beat the Russians... I beat everybody... I even beat that stupid cat who lives next door!” says Snoopy in one.

NASA and “Peanuts” have frequently been interwoven. The space agency honors its best employees with the Silver Snoopy Award and a Snoopy doll was aboard Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft in 2019.

The plush 10-inch-by-7 inch Snoopy that is being readied for the Artemis I mission was not the kind you'd find on a Target shelf. It's a one-of-a-kind work and painstakingly designed using only NASA-approved materials. Stress-testing it is due in December.

“The spacesuit had to meet all the requirements and be of the same quality that the astronauts would be wearing both in the materials and what got approved. So it was a months-long process of going back and forth and back and forth as they considered all the materials used on the spacesuit” said Craig Schulz.

In many ways the reuniting of Snoopy and NASA in 2021 mirrors the way the two initially worked together to generate interest in space exploration.

Posted on 11/13/2021

Warwickshire-based The Belfry Hotel & Resort was sold to Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Cedar Capital Partners. The seller is KSL Partners. The estimated price was reported at £140 million. The facilities include three golf 18-hole courses a 324-bedroom hotel spa and conference facilities. It is situated within a 550-acre estate.

The Belfry Hotel & Resort hosted the Ryder Cup 4 times.

JPMorgan's iconic new team in Paris,"November is a strange time to be talking about people leaving jobs in the banking industry simply because of the operation of the compensation calendar. The banking labour market still operates in the closing months of the year but generally people are reluctant to leave behind the bonus they’ve been earning all year and hiring companies are equally reluctant to buy them out and effectively pay for work they didn’t benefit from. So the fact that the “Great Resignation” phenomenon seems to be hitting Wall Street right now is certainly unusual.

It’s been particularly noticeable because even major franchises at top-three banks have been having problems holding on to staff; JP Morgan’s equity derivatives team in New York has been seeing the sort of turnover you usually associate with a European bank going through a restructuring. It seems like there’s a perfect storm of different factors all hitting the hiring market at the same time. At the time of writing two of the top three posts on Wall Street Confessions are about people resigning.

The first factor is that the normal reluctance to pay big guaranteed bonuses late in the year doesn’t seem to be as strong at the moment. According to Bloomberg one recruiter has said that he’s “never seen so many eight-figure hiring packages”. Mike Karp of Options Group has also seen “unfilled jobs where the bids just kept going higher and higher”.

This is an interesting insight into the psychology of top management at the moment – comments about the outlook made in press releases and at investor days have generally been guarded but nobody starts outbidding a ten million dollar offer unless they’re confident about the future. It also seems that the buy side is driving the poaching cycle at least as much as the sell side.

There also appears to be a genuine net loss of top talent to the industry. One consequence of the pandemic bull market seems to be that a lot of bankers might have reached their “FIRE Number” (financially independent retire early) a lot sooner than they might have expected. A period of working from home might have given fifty-five year old MDs a sudden sense of perspective and the first few commutes after Labor Day might have set them thinking about whether they really needed to carry on. Even some younger bankers have left the industry after having invested in the right cryptocoins.

The trouble for the banks is that the cycle of resignation recruitment and remuneration tends to feed on itself when the industry is short-staffed in aggregate. It’s sometimes possible to fill gaps with internal promotions particularly at the big houses – that’s what JPM seems to have done on its equity derivatives desk. But when people are getting such big rewards for moving banks it creates a sort of FOMO effect among employees who might otherwise have stayed loyal. Everyone starts taking recruiters’ calls if only to get an idea of their own market value. After the best part of a decade of peace it seems like the “War For Talent” has broken out again.

Elsewhere JP Morgan has been doing its own poaching recruiting Neven Graillat from BNP Paribas to be the MD in charge of a new Global Markets Sustainability Centre in its Paris office. Although this sounds like a slightly grandly-titled think tank it’s actually a structured products team; Neven will be reporting to Rui Fernandes and Masi Yamada the global heads of investor structuring.

The idea is that investors increasingly want financial products with an ESG angle to them and that this is turning into a big enough market to support specialists who are able to work across asset classes to slice and dice exactly the combination of risks and rewards they need. Apparently Graillat’s job is going to be to “channel and manage the overwhelming global interest in this area”. European banks had been looking like they were aiming to take the lead in sustainable finance but it seems that the bulge bracket are able to pay up to catch up.

Meanwhile …

What Americans should know about inflation as it hits a 30-year high

Americans across the country are seeing higher prices at the mall grocery store and gas pump causing new pain for their pocketbooks right as the holiday shopping season is set to commence.

Inflation has risen at its highest rate in three decades data released by the Labor Department earlier this week indicates as consumer prices soared by 6.2% compared to the same period last year. This is the biggest one-year jump seen in the government's consumer price index since 1990.

As inflation tightens its grip on the economy the Federal Reserve has begun walking back previous assurances that it will be a temporary post-pandemic blip. Economists at Goldman Sachs warned in a research note last week that inflation is ""likely to get worse before it gets better"" and could persist well into next year.

Many Americans now are too young to remember the pain and uncertainty inflation wreaked on the country in the 1970s a period economists dub as ""The Great Inflation"" when wages and prices snowballed and the purchasing power of savings dwindled before a painful correction that led to a recession and double-digit unemployment rates in the early 1980s.

A generation later and under very different circumstances prices are again surging at a rapid clip. While economists say policymakers now are much better-equipped to respond to inflation than the last time it struck the U.S. consumers are already feeling the pressure -- particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials.

Here is what Americans should know about inflation why it is so high right now and when they can expect relief.

What is inflation?

""Basically inflation measures the rate of increase in consumer prices"" Itay Goldstein a professor of finance and economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business told ABC News. ""At the end of the day it measures the extent to which the cost of living is higher.""

The Federal Reserve America's central banking system defines inflation as the ""increase in the prices of goods and services over time.""

""Inflation cannot be measured by an increase in the cost of one product or service or even several products or services"" the Fed states. ""Rather inflation is a general increase in the overall price level of the goods and services in the economy.""

Policymakers evaluate changes in inflation by monitoring several different price indexes. One of the most commonly used barometers of inflation is the Consumer Price Index which is released by the Labor Department each month and measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a market basket of goods and services.

The CPI has surged by 6.2% since last October according to DOL data. The so-called ""core index"" or measure for all items except the more volatile food and energy indices rose 4.6% over the last 12 months the DOL's data indicates. This represents the largest one-year increase since August 1991.

""Inflation means that your dollar won't stretch as far"" Laura Veldkamp a professor of finance at Columbia Business School told ABC News. She used Christmas presents as an example saying that if you wanted to buy a sweater as a gift last year for $100 this year that price might be closer to $105.

If the prices of some goods and services increases and the prices of others fall but the overall prices that consumers pay for the bundle of goods and services does not increase then this is not referred to as inflation.

What causes inflation and why is it so high right now?

Inflation is determined by the interaction of total demand (aggregate demand) and total supply (aggregate supply) in the economy. If total spending in the economy exceeds the total amount that the economy can produce then production cannot increase but instead prices will rise.

""When you have a higher demand the price tends to go up. When you have lower supply the price also tends to go up"" Goldstein told ABC News. ""At the end of the day the price is a combination of these forces.""

But monetary policies also affect inflation he said. Keeping interest rates low and injecting a lot of money into financial markets -- actions the Fed took to help buoy the economy during the health crisis -- can also be linked to the high inflation we are now seeing according to Goldstein.

Stimulus checks boosted total demand and at the same time the ability to supply goods and services have been restricted by the pandemic. While the impact of stimulus money on inflation is now waning many of the other factors that created these imbalances between supply and demand are persisting Goldstein said.

""People feel that they have money to spend they want to spend it on things that they haven't done in the last year"" Goldstein said. ""You basically have limits on supply at the same time that you have an increase in demand and that certainly pushes prices up.""

Veldkamp also stressed the impact that the supply chain issues have on driving up prices. Using the Christmas sweaters metaphor again Veldkamp added ""Let's say those Christmas sweaters are stuck on a boat somewhere then the few sweaters that are here lots of people want them.""

""So stores can charge more for them because they're scarce"" she explained.

Costs of doing business have also risen during the pandemic Veldkamp noted as companies had to spend more to make it safe to do business while COVID-19 spread.

""Lastly workers are asking for higher wages"" Veldkamp said. ""Which may be perfectly justified but it does make the cost of doing business higher. Say if a restaurant waitstaff wants a 5% 10% raise those restaurants are going to have to pass some of that additional cost to their customers otherwise they won't turn a profit.""

The economic phenomenon known as the ""wage-price spiral"" can develop when prices increase and then workers ask for higher wages -- which can then lead to further increases in the prices of goods and services and these can lead to a further increase in wages and so on. In this manner inflation can become a self-fulfilling prophesy of sorts. This ever-intensifying wage-price spiral characterized the U.S. economy in the '70s ultimately resulting in double-digit inflation.

How does the rise in inflation affect consumers?

If consumers' wages increase with the rise in prices they should be able to continue purchasing the same amounts of goods and services as usual. This will not be true for all consumers however meaning some may struggle to purchase what they used to.

""Your dollar doesn't go as far so it's going to be a little bit harder to buy all the things on your list with the same amount of money"" Veldkamp said. ""And that sounds pretty bad but at the same time wages are rising and returns rise with inflation too.""

Goldstein reiterated that the effect of inflation on consumers is that ""when prices go up people will have to pay more for whatever they want and as a result they can afford less.""

He also mentioned the wage-price spiral to show how inflation ""might get out of control.""

""What could happen is everyone has to pay more so they go back and start demanding increases in wages"" he said. ""And if wages start to go up then the whole process can get additional amplification and kind of like a snowball eventually gets very tough to control -- and then it becomes very difficult to bring things back.""

How does inflation impact the stock market?

Stocks are a claim on the future earnings of firms so in principle firms should be able to raise their prices in line with inflation so their earnings should not decrease.

Historically however inflation has been linked to negative impacts in the stock market. One reason for this is that inflation restricts the ability of the Federal Reserve to take action. After stricter policies defeated the spiraling inflation in the U.S. in the early 1980s the Fed has been able to ease monetary policy following stock market crashes and adverse events such as the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic. When inflation is increasing however then the Fed no longer has as much freedom to implement expansionary monetary policy and when the Fed contracts its expansionary policies this can decrease stock prices.

Inflation is also often accompanied by uncertainty which can be bad for the stock market. Investors do not know how long it will last and do not know what to expect from monetary policy meaning they might be less likely to invest in it.

In the near-term investors will likely see higher returns on stocks in times of inflation Veldkamp said driven by prices increasing.

Goldstein warns however that once inflation starts rising the Fed will have ""no choice but to increase rates abruptly.""

""And when this happens this will tend to have a negative effect on the stock market"" he said.

What can the government do to reduce inflation?

The Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates and ease the pandemic-era expansionary monetary policies that injected liquidity into financial markets according to Goldstein though he added that this is a ""tough balance"" as the economy still teeters toward a recovery.

""On the one hand you want to provide stimulus to the economy and to markets to get over the crisis"" he said of the Fed. ""But on the other hand you don't want to overdo it so that things don't overheat and cause inflation.""

Echoing Goldstein's sentiments Veldkamp told ABC News ""We're probably going to see some interest rate rises.""

""So if somebody hasn't already refinanced their mortgage now would be the time to do that"" she added. ""We will probably see the Federal Reserve boost interest rates because that's their primary tool to constrain inflation and what that does is it encourages people to save their money.""

But Goldstein warns that ""the government cannot do a whole lot"" when it comes to inflation.

Policies that have been tried in the past around the world such as instituting price caps can quickly backfire Goldstein said because they can bring about a whole new set of issues when the government intervenes like that in the economy.

In the short-term anything the Biden administration -- which operates independently of the Fed -- can do to help ease the supply-chain bottlenecks will also help with keeping prices of goods down.

Veldkamp said that less government spending is the ""traditional remedy to bring down inflation"" though adds that is not what we're seeing happening at the moment with Biden's proposed $1 trillion infrastructure bill.

This bill can help reduce inflationary pressures however ""if that infrastructure helps to reduce the cost of doing business"" Veldkamp added.

""If fixing the potholes means that fewer delivery trucks are blowing out tires and things get to where they need to go on time -- things run more smoothly"" she added. ""If they can reduce the cost of doing business they can bring down inflation.""

How can people protect themselves from the impacts of inflation?

""When you are dealing with inflation you have to think about how you protect your investments"" Goldstein said. Just keeping money in your bank account could hurt he said ""because you're not getting compensated for the inflation.""

Some people choose to invest in the stock market but as Goldstein mentioned the stock market can be a bit of a mixed bag ""because there could be overall macroeconomic implications that will push the stock market as a whole down.""

Veldkamp said her advice for Americans is: ""Don't leave your money in cash.""

""The value of cash is going to get eroded"" she said. ""You want to look for at the very least a savings account that offers some interest. You might want to ask about money market mutual funds those are financial products that are usually really safe but give you a little bit more interest.""

""Things are getting more expensive but if you protect the money that you have by putting it in interest-bearing accounts you should do just fine because your money will grow even faster than the price level is growing"" Veldkamp added.

""On the flip side anybody who's got a mortgage should be loving inflation"" Veldkamp said ""If you owe somebody something then inflation is eating away at the value of that debt it should get easier and easier to pay back that loan.""

Will the inflation we're seeing now be temporary?

In short only time will tell.

In past months policymakers including Fed Chair Jerome Powell have stressed that the inflationary pressures are expected to be ""transitory"" in the wake of the pandemic.

In a press conference earlier this month however Powell said that ""supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.""

Powell said that ""the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic specifically the effects on supply and demand from the shutdown the uneven reopening and the ongoing effects of the virus itself"" and stressed that the Fed's tools ""cannot ease supply constraints.""

Still Powell said that he believes ""our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances and that as it does inflation will decline.""

""Of course it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation"" Powell said. ""Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function but the timing of that is highly uncertain.""

Goldman Sachs economists in their research note warning inflation will get worse before it gets better said their core view remains that the underlying supply-demand imbalances will work themselves out as Powell has said.

""But it is now clear that this process will take longer than initially expected and the inflation overshoot will likely get worse before it gets better"" the researchers warned.

The Goldman Sachs team said they expect the process of supply chain disruptions easing inventories being rebuilt and the lingering impacts of pandemic-era fiscal boosts fading to ""start by the second half of next year and to extend into 2023.""

Veldkamp told ABC News that she is only ""modestly"" concerned about inflation spiraling out of control like what was seen in the 70s.

""I do think it's a possibility I'm watching out for it"" she said. ""At the same time I think our central bankers know a lot more about how to contain inflation than they did in the 1970s. Economics has evolved a lot since then and so I have confidence in the professionals running our monetary system that they're going to work hard to promote that.""

Goldstein echoed Veldkamp's sentiments saying that he doesn't think the ""nightmare scenario"" of what happened in the '70s is a likely outcome at this point.

""A lot has been learned from the past and how to deal with those situations"" he said. ""And I think the Fed is ready to act and if they see it is getting to that point they can very quickly raise rates and I think that will likely help."""

The New Hartford junior sent a free kick from about 25 yards out less than two minutes into a NYSPHSAA Class A semifinal against Section I's Clarkstown North. The ball she thought was sailing a little high.

Fortunately for an undefeated New Hartford team and its dynamic offense that has largely rolled through the season into their first state final four in program history the ball dropped down over the goalkeeper’s hands at the last moment.

The early goal combined with another just minutes later helped give the top-ranked Spartans all the momentum the team needed in a 4-0 victory at Tompkins Cortland Community College and advance to the state final.

New Hartford advanced to its first state final against South Side (Rockville Centre) on Sunday.

“I was just excited. I was overjoyed. I wasn’t expecting it to go in. I thought I hit it a little too far over"" Vitullo said of her sixth goal of the season. ""But when I saw it sunk in it was just amazing.""

The goal also took the nerves away for the speedy Spartans according to Vitullo and junior defender Biddie Clive.

“We were ready to go after that. We had a little bit of nerves coming into the game because we didn’t know what to expect from this team” said Vitullo who also had two assists. “I think once that first goal went in we got ready and riled up.”

New Hartford (22-0) which previously won its first Section III title in about 30 years in late October has won 36 consecutive games. New Hartford has outscored opponents 144-5 this season.

“We know every single game in this postseason we needed to be on our best” Clive said. “We know that our team can work toward a goal together. We have such good chemistry that we can make that happen.”

“We’re so excited” coach Frank DuRoss Jr. said. “They’ve worked so hard. They put in 100 percent all the time. I’m really happy for them to do this for the school and the team. Especially for our seniors to go out in a season like this is unbelievable.”

New Hartford ended a magical run for Clarkstown North which had won three consecutive games outside of regulation in the postseason.

Clarkstown North had moments in trying to find an answer back but the team had trouble generating much against a New Hartford defense that is solid.

“We knew we had to be super tight going into this game” Clive said also noting teammates Carina Wu and Mia Roberts. “We didn’t necessarily play our best defensive game. There were some moments but I think we were solid.”

New Hartford added two more goals in the second half – one on a header by Willa Pratt following a corner from Vitullo with 31 minutes left and another on Caroline Sekula’s 26th of the season on a breakaway -- to put the match out of reach.

Turning point

A start doesn't get any better for a soccer team than scoring on a free kick less than two minutes into the game which New Hartford did on Vitullo's shot.

Adding another goal less five minutes later from in close by Allison Falvo? Well that certainly gave the Spartans all the momentum they needed.

Player of the game

Talia Vitullo New Hartford: She scored on an impressive strike from about 25 yards out minutes into the game and also assisted on another goal late. She was key in helping generate offense for New Hartford throughout the game.

By the numbers

New Hartford: Caroline Sekula had one goal and one assist. Allison Falvo and Willa Pratt each scored a goal. Savannah Cole had two saves. Alex Volo earned the sportsmanship award.

Clarkstown North (14-5-3): Sydney Ferst had nine saves.

Quotable

""We thought last year was the year we could do it. It wasn't in the cards because of COVID"" DuRoss said of the possibility of winning a state title. ""We knew this was coming. We've been working hard for it.""

Rex Melius who runs a community service group called Cemeterians said he drove past the cemetery around 11:30 a.m. and noticed the damage right away.

“Right now we know nine headstones have been tipped over on the south side of the cemetery” said Melius. “One of the headstones is pretty new; it has only been up about two years.

“US flags have also been snapped off from veterans stones and historic stones even two children’s headstones have been damaged.”

Melius said the size of some of the stones is considerable. “This is going to be big bucks to fix” he said.

Police have really good surveillance photos and they will be posting those shortly.

Early word is the vandalism occurred around 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. Police are also following up on reports about attempts to enter several vehicles in the area.

“This is debilitating because of the restoration work we’ve done in the cemetery the last four years” said Melius. “Then you have someone come along and take all that away.

“This is the second oldest cemetery in Hartford WI and there are 99 Civil War veterans buried here. There are also people buried here from the War of 1812 and the Spanish American War.

“Not only is the person responsible destroying headstones but they are also destroying history” Melius said.

UPDATE: Click HERE for a video of a person of interest police are looking to speak with. If you have any information please contact Hartford Police at 262-673-2600.

This is a working story and more information will be posted when details become available.

5 Minute Read

HeroQuest is shipping from Hasbro and the best thing about it is clearly the Broadsword!

When Hasbro announced that they were bringing back HeroQuest I was excited. So excited I actually DID back this one myself. Which means I had to sign-up for a Hasbro Pulse account and have been getting random emails from them ever since. Fun. But no matter! Because it’s finally paid off (or I guess I should say that they finally delivered the goods that I paid for). The HeroQuest Mythic Tier has arrived and I’m about to go adventuring.

﻿

BROADSWORD!

Look I’m legit excited about this one. Some of my earliest boardgaming memories are from HeroQuest. I was indeed a wee lad when this game originally launched and I spent quite a few nights playing this game with my Dad and Brother. So I’ve got a bit of the old nostalgia factor shading my view on it. So if this review is a bit slanted towards the positive that’s a big factor for me.

Having said that at this point I’ve also unboxed hundreds of various miniatures products. Seriously…it’s a lot. So I know when I see a good one in terms of quality vs not-so-much. Board game components have come a long way in the years since this was initially released as well. So I’m going to try to be objective about that aspect too. Plus since I literally spent my own money on this one I feel like I can be completely honest here! Not that I’m not honest when folks send us stuff to review — if it’s not in my wheelhouse we just don’t review it. Plus I stand my all my reviews that I’ve done over the years. At the time I wrote them I meant it. So now that THAT’S out of the way let’s talk about that Broadsword!

Mythic Tier Please

First up as mentioned I ordered the Mythic tier. Why? Well I figured if I was going to do this I wanted to be all in. I didn’t want to worry about picking stuff up after-the-fact or worry about a retail release or missing out on any extras. So…here we are. And I’m glad I did!

Included in the order were the “base” game the two expansions and all the extras from the Hasbro campaign. So that means I have a crap-load of miniatures for this game now (and I’m not complaining). From a total of 12 heroes — Both sets of genders for the old heroes plus a new Warlock Druid and Bard hero AND another Wizard that looks suspiciously like the one on the GM screen — and GOBS of baddies I’m in HeroQuest mini-heaven right now.

And since we’re talking about the miniatures let’s talk about the quality. They’re fine. After my initial excitement wore off I still think they are really cool — but the quality is just…fine. Compared to GW minis they aren’t quite as crisp or sharp in the detail department. That said it’s probably because they aren’t hard plastic minis. They are a little bendy and softer. And again that’s okay! It’s not the greatest quality (we’re not looking at Gunpla or GW minis here) but since I’m being honest I think they minis in sets like Steamforge Games’ Epic Encounters are above them in quality. Then again I also really like Epic Encounters so maybe that’s a bad example.

I guess what I’m getting at is that these are perfect miniatures for a board game. If you looking for extra minis for RPGs (like D&D) or just want a bunch of extra baddies for whatever in your board games/RPG nights then these are that. They aren’t quite as good (in terms of quality) as say miniatures for Wargaming. But I wasn’t really expecting them to be that quality. They are perfectly adequate for the job.

Oh did I mention they are also all single pieces of plastic that come ready to go out of the box? There’s also that aspect to consider and I think when you put that in context with the fact that these are for a board game you’ll agree that these are indeed just fine minis. You can paint them if you want — they will take primer easily enough. You might want to rinse and scrub them first if you do as they seem to have some mould release on them.

The Rest Of The Components

Okay moving on from the minis because otherwise I’ll just keep going the rest components are fan-freaking-tastic. The cards the dice the board the quest packs and everything else has that same sense of nostalgic goodness with a veneer of “updatedness” that comes along with a product refresh. That is to say component wise everything feels like a modern take the “stuff in the box” while at the same time the artwork and style is essentially the exact same. While I haven’t gotten to compare the rules to the classic set I’m pretty sure it’s the exact same set of rules. Same with the classic Quest Pack. And that has me super excited!

The New Stuff

I haven’t gotten into the new stuff yet – NO SPOILERS PLEASE. But between both expansions AND the extra three adventures included in the Mythic Tier I’m going to be busy for a while. I really want to play the Joe Manganiello quest line in particular. I keep butchering his last name (I’m sorry – please don’t beat me up) but I’ve seen how big of a nerd he is and I know he’s got “the goods” when it comes to fantasy RPGs. #JocksMachina

I also am excited to give the new heroes a shake. Probably AFTER I play with the 4 OG heroes first. They look neat and might bring some new toys to the tabletop. It’s kind of strange to be excited about an old game’s OLD stuff and yet still want to play with the NEW toys too. I know that I’m going to be busy for many an evening with this new HeroQuest and I can’t wait!

Ghostbusters Ecto-Plasm Ghost Gushers feature four different characters from the Ghostbusters film series: Slimer The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man a Terror Dog and Muncher. Inside each one of those ghosts you’ll find not only Ecto-Plasm but a smaller companion-sized apparition.





Check out our full review and unboxing below.

As evident in the video we’re huge fans of this line and would love to see Hasbro continue with additional offerings! I mean imagine Ghost Gusher renditions of the Scoleri Brothers Vigo the Carpathian and Gozer the Gozerian!

During the video I also showcased an info sheet (found here) that tells you which mystery companion-sized can be found inside each thanks to an identification number stamped on the packaging. Big shout out to @Venkmaniac over on Instagram for that.

Speaking of other recent messy offerings from Hasbro check out our unboxing of the Mini-Puft Surprise mystery line below.

The 44-year-old actor is a huge fan of 'Dungeons & Dragons' and he believes he was hired for new movie 'The Spine of Night' because of his work in the fantasy genre for games company Hasbro.

He explained to Variety: ""I think they knew about my work in the fantasy genre namely 'Dungeons & Dragons' and even Hasbro — I’ve been a game designer for them. I helped redesign this board game called 'HeroQuest'; it’s basically 'Dungeons & Dragons' in a box.

""I was hired by 'Dungeons & Dragons' initially as a consultant. That started a friendship with the company in which I then got to write storylines for adventure modules and create characters that led to action figures and toys that are sold in toy stores. I got to redesign a lot of the 'Dungeon & Dragons' characters and things because I started a streetwear line — like I wasn’t busy enough I guess. I also ran this A-list celebrity 'Dungeons & Dragons' game in my house every Friday night and turned my wine cellar into a dungeon. I think it just became a part of my identity.""

Joe also revealed that he continued his celebrity 'Dungeons & Dragons' game online once the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

He said: ""When the pandemic hit and we all went into quarantine we’d been playing live. That weekend we postponed and actually punted while I went and figured out how to work this computer system where you can create your own dungeon maps and enter your players into it. Once we figured out the tech of it we started playing online. They talked me into running two games a week. And then we saw [COVID] isn’t going away anytime soon. I had to pull it back to one night a week. It takes a lot to prep. It’s like preparing as a director to run a TV show every Friday night — live with your friends starring in it. For me I started getting busy."""

EAGLE - Gino Mariani admits Ian Hershey is cocky.

It’s something the longtime Highland High School football coach of 21 years has personally relayed to his multiple-time all-state and record-breaking kicker.

But Hershey continues to back it up.

A week after setting a state record and hitting a game-winning field goal - Hershey did it again with his 41-yarder as time expired to send the fifth-ranked Rams to their fifth Class 5A title game over the past nine years in a 29-27 win against No. 4 Eagle in a semifinal game at Thunder Stadium.

Highland (10-2) will play Rigby (10-1) for the 5A state championship next week at Holt Arena in Pocatello.

It's been a mind-blowing two weeks of action for Hershey who booted a 58-yard field goal - the longest in state history - in a quarterfinal win over Rocky Mountain. And now two game-winning kicks.

""He’s not afraid"" Mariani said. ""He loves the pressure.""

Even when the entire Eagle section was mocking and laughing at him.

After the Mustangs (9-3) tried to ice him with a timeout with four seconds remaining Hershey wanted to stay warm. So after walking around and swinging his arms back and forth Hershey attempted a practice kick. He slipped on the wet turf and landed right on his backside prompting Eagle fans to erupt in laughter.

But Hershey immediately got up turned toward them and raised his hands to bring it on.

He got the last laugh too: The kick sailed through the uprights with plenty of room to spare. The stadium fell silent as Hershey ran up and down his own section in jubilation.

""I feel like that only happens once a season"" Hershey said. ""Two times in a row in a quarterfinal and a semifinal means a lot to me. I really hope people see that and I hope it’s a good way to keep getting my name out there for sure.""

Hershey has offers from Idaho State and Sacramento State. He received the latter after last week’s showing. Hershey who has visited FBS schools such as Boise State booted in three field goals for the second week in a row. They all came in the second half when the Rams needed them most after being held out of the end zone.

Highland went up 20-7 after senior wideout Raimon Barela hauled in a 15-yard pass from senior quarterback Jack Whitmer with 2:55 to go in the first half. Barela had just corralled in a 40-yard touchdown reception less than nine minutes earlier. The Rams also scored on their first drive of the game on Whitmer's 11-yard strike to Fischer Anderson.

Eagle seemingly snatched the momentum though. Halfback Roy Hull barreled his way in from a yard out with 57 seconds until the break before speedster Ian Duarte who has an offer from Arizona torched Highland’s defense for the second time. He turned a simple slant route into a 90-yard touchdown catch to give the Mustangs their first lead of the game 21-20 midway through the third quarter.

Duarte also had a 73-yard grab late in the first quarter. He finished the game with 252 yards of total offense on just six touches.

However the Rams weathered the storm and leaned on Hershey. He connected on kicks of 21 and 52 yards the latter extending the Rams' lead to 26-21 with 6:32 to go.

But quarterback Jack Benson gave Eagle the lead right back on a 42-yard scramble with 3:18 remaining. Worst yet the Rams got backed up to their own 7-yard line after a holding call on the ensuing kickoff.

But they did not panic especially knowing all they really had to do was cross midfield to get into Hershey's kicking range.

And Highland did what it had done effectively all night - run the football (305 yards). It gashed the Mustangs one last time with 77 yards on nine consecutive run plays.

""We don’t give up"" Barela said. ""No lead is safe with us right now. We’ve been playing the best we’ve ever played and I’d say we’re sitting pretty good going to the state championship.""

And Hershey who is now 18-for-21 on field goals this season took care of the rest.

Highland which finished the game with 457 yards of total offense will now play for the state title for the 20th time since 1984. This will be Mariani’s 11th appearance himself.

""When they play for Highland there’s expectations"" Mariani said. ""I’ve always told them 'Listen the road to the state championship will always go through Highland.'""

A night that began with smoke — from fireworks during “The Star-Spangled Banner” as LED lights flashed through the stands — ended with Michael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror” played on the public address system.

U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said Thursday that Ochoa’s remarks showed ”that we have a long way to go to get the respect of Mexico.”

Fans in the crowd of 26000 at new TLQ Stadium booed Ochoa with every touch.

“I think you guys know the message. I don’t need to like speak on it too much” Pulisic said. “It’s just an idea that came in the head.”

Tim Weah said he and defender DeAndre Yedlin inspired Pulisic’s shirt.

“Just to send a message” Weah said. “Before the game Mexico was talking a lot of smack. To shut them up we have to continue to win games continue to beat them. That’s the only way we’re going to earn their respect and get the world’s respect.”

The win was the third this year for the 13th-ranked Americans over No. 9 Mexico following a 3-2 victory in the Nations League final in June and a 1-0 victory in the CONCACAF Gold final in August.

“To win three in a row is obviously amazing” Pulisic said “but that doesn’t mean that it’s time to be complacent or time to think oh we’re the best around.”

Heated matches between Mexico and the U.S. are the norm and this one ended with the U.S. a man short after Miles Robinson — who scored the Gold Cup goal — got a pair of yellow cards.

“We fiercely dislike Mexico’s soccer team right and we’re fierce competitors and we want to win every time on the field” Berhalter said making a point to distinguish Mexico’s team from its people. “Afterwards you shake hands and you move on. We have a lot of respect for them.”

The U.S. and Mexico have 14 points each followed by Canada with 13 Panama 11 Costa Rica Jamaica and El Salvador six each and Honduras three.

Three nations from North and Central America and the Caribbean qualify for next year’s tournament in Qatar and the fourth-place nation advances to a playoff.

The U.S. won four straight home qualifiers against Mexico by 2-0 all at Columbus Ohio before falling 2-1 in November 2016 at Crew Stadium. That led to the Americans missing the 2018 World Cup.

Fucale was called up late last week by the Capitals on an emergency loan after Vitek Vanecek suffered an upper-body injury.

Fucale traveled with the Capitals on their recent two-game road trip which saw him earn his first career NHL start and shut out the Detroit Red Wings. He is the first Capitals goaltender in franchise history to pitch a shutout in their NHL debut.

Fucale was also the backup goaltender Friday night when Ilya Samsonov beat the Columbus Blue Jackets. The transaction indicates that Vanecek is ready to get back into the net after he did not dress or play either half of the recent back-to-back.

It also answers the short-term question of what the Capitals want to do with their goaltending situation as a whole.

More from the Capitals:

Capitals Assign Goaltender Zach Fucale to Hershey ARLINGTON Va. – The Washington Capitals assigned goaltender Zach Fucale to the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) senior vice president and general manager Brian MacLellan announced today. Fucale 26 became the first goaltender in franchise history to record a shutout in his debut stopping all 21 shots he faced against the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday. Fucale is 3-0-2 with Hershey this season with a 1.73 goals-against average and a .933 save percentage. The 6’2″ 189-pound goaltender is tied for second in the AHL in goals-against average among goaltenders with at least five games played. During the 2020-21 season the Laval Quebec native led the AHL in goals-against average (1.80) and ranked second in save percentage (.932) establishing career highs in both categories. Fucale played 11 games with Hershey the most games he has played at the AHL level since the 2017-18 season posting a 9-2-0-1 record. Fucale’s nine wins were tied for eighth in the AHL while his two losses were the fewest among goaltenders with at least 660 minutes played. Fucale and Pheonix Copley received the AHL’s Harry “Hap” Holmes Memorial Award presented to the goaltenders on the team which allows the fewest goals per game in the regular season.

CGI Merchant Group a Miami-based investment firm is in contract to acquire the hotel lease for the Trump International Hotel which is located a short walk down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. CGI intends to remove the Trump name and it has reached a deal with Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. to have the property branded and managed by Hilton’s Waldorf Astoria group these people said.

The hotel is owned by the federal government but with extensions the lease runs close to 100 years. It is housed in the former Old Post Office and it features some of the largest guest rooms in the capital.

TRUMP'S 'TRUTH SOCIAL' PLATFORM DEAL DRAWS STRONG INTEREST FROM INVESTORS

The sale which people briefed on the matter said is expected to close in the first quarter comes as Democratic-controlled House committees have been investigating and holding hearings on potential conflicts of interest and emoluments issues surrounding former President Trump.

The Trump Organization has said it didn’t market the hotel to foreign dignitaries and that it writes a check to the U.S. Treasury Department for money made from foreign government guests.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has been examining the lease terms between the Trump Organization and the federal government’s General Services Administration for use of the Old Post Office. The deal predates Mr. Trump’s entry into national politics but the committee is probing how well Mr. Trump managed conflicts of interest while president.

It couldn’t be determined if the proposed sale would have an impact on the hearings and representatives for the House committee didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.

The House committee said the hotel lost more than $70 million between its opening in 2016 and last year leading the Trumps’ company to inject at least $24 million in aid. The Trumps have disputed those findings.

JUDGE: TRUMP COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY COHEN’S LEGAL BILLS

The hotel generated about $150 million in revenue over four years according to Mr. Trump’s financial disclosures while president. His most recent disclosure which covered all of 2020 and the first few weeks of 2021 showed the hotel’s revenue fell to $15 million compared with $40 million in 2019 though most hotels in major urban markets suffered significant setbacks during the pandemic.

While the sale will bring a cash infusion to the Trump hotel company it comes at a price to the company’s ambitions hotel analysts said. The Washington hotel has been a jewel in the Trump family portfolio. In 2012 the Trumps beat out some of the most-experienced and deepest-pocketed names in the lodging business including Marriott International Inc. and Hilton for the rights to the lease.

The family’s pledge to spend about $200 million renovating and converting the 19th-century post office into a modern luxury hotel was the highest offer say people familiar with the matter.

During Mr. Trump’s years in the White House the hotel became a favorite Republican meeting spot attracting fans lobbyists lawmakers and others with business before the Trump administration.

The Trump affiliation discouraged other business hotel analysts say including from various trade organizations and other groups that didn’t want the association with the president.

In converting the property to a Waldorf Astoria the new owners would be aiming to sever the property from its politicized past. ""If it becomes affiliated with a luxury brand that brand can create a new identity for the property"" Sean Hennessey chief executive of Lodging Advisors a New York hospitality consulting firm told The Wall Street Journal in October.

A Miami-based investment firm CGI Merchant Group is in contract to acquire the hotel lease for the Trump International Hotel situated less than a mile away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue said the people who declined to be identified because the matter is private. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter they said.

The buyer plans to remove the Trump name and reached a deal with Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. to convert the property to a Waldorf Astoria managed by Hilton. The Wall Street Journal reported the agreement earlier Sunday.

Trump won the rights to develop the hotel located in Washington’s Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in 2012 leasing the building from the federal government. The hotel has been a prized asset for the Trump Organization and Trump rejected calls to sell the hotel when he was elected president.

Trump’s company has been engaged in off-and-on efforts to sell the hotel since 2019 when it floated an asking price of more than $500 million Bloomberg News previously reported.

The hotel had been a source of consistent controversy with critics arguing foreign governments and other interest groups could gain favor by booking rooms at a property owned by the former president’s company.

According to documents released by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform the hotel received about $3.75 million in payments from foreign governments but still lost more than $70 million during Trump’s time in the White House. The Trump Organization disputed the report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8xMS8xMy9oaWx0b25zLWN1cmlvLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tb3BlbnMtc2l4dGgtbG9uZG9uLXByb3BlcnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton's Curio Collection opens sixth London property – Business Traveller,"The Gantry London is located at 40 Celebration Avenue a few minutes’ walk from Westfield Stratford City shopping centre.

The landmarked but empty and construction-marred Martinique Hotel will soon rise from the ashes thanks to a just-closed hard-won leasehold purchase of the long-troubled property at Greeley Square.



The previously bankrupt hotel will reopen in stages starting as early as December although 12 to 18 months of mostly exterior work lie ahead. It will again be branded as Curio Collection by Hilton the flag it last carried before the pandemic shut it down.

The rebirth reflects the rising fortunes of the Broadway Nomad-area corridor south of 34th Street where new Ritz-Carlton and Virgin hotels and hip restaurants such as The Smith have replaced wholesalers and an ugly sidewalk bazaar.



“Turning the lights back on at the Martinique will be a booster shot for Greeley Square and Herald Square” said a plugged-in Midtown South observer.

4 Investors from the Midwest are pouring tens of millions into renovating the Martinique Hotel. Nelson Lee

The Martinique’s rescue didn’t come easily. The buyer is surprisingly not an overseas investor but a little-known company in the Midwest — Oklahoma City-based developer Burnett Equity. Burnett closed on the $55 million leasehold purchase last week sources revealed. Burnett is mostly active in Oklahoma with commercial and residential projects. It’s expected to pump up to $60 million more into the Martinique’s stalled restoration project.

The 1897-vintage Martinique at 1260 Broadway at West 32nd Street was believed to be the city’s longest continuously-operating hotel until it closed for the pandemic. At different periods in its history it was a luxury hotel an SRO and most recently a sound destination for middle-market travelers.

We first reported the leasehold offering back in March. Marcus & Millichap brokers Eric Anton and Nelson Lee were tapped by the landowner a private investor from Florida in December 2020 to market the bankrupt leasehold which had 68 years left on it.

The mortgage fell into foreclosure after the leaseholder died in late 2020. Adding to the challenge the 530-room property also had 34000 square feet of retail space that was vacant except for a small Chase bank branch. The property’s landmark status meant that the renovation work had to be handled with kid gloves and construction was years behind schedule.

But the toughest obstacle facing a new owner was that the ground lease had “very onerous terms” a source told us.

“Appraisers told the brokers not to waste their time — the whole ball of wax was worthless” we’re told.

But Anton and Lee pressed the search for a buyer. “They expected to receive offers from overseas investors who regard New York as cheap. They did but they were surprised to also hear from Oklahoma City” an insider related.

Analysts speculated last winter that the leasehold could fetch $70 million to $75 million. But two circumstances resulted in a price cut. The unfinished facade restoration faced more costs to complete than were expected. Plus the ground lease needed adjusting to make it more finance-able. The parties were able to agree on altered terms after several months of negotiating.

Mission Capital a division of Marcus & Millichap stepped in to secure acquisition financing for Burnett Equity.

Meanwhile retail brokers Danny Volk and Andy Kim were tapped to fill the empty storefronts. Even before the leasehold deal was done they managed to score leases for yet-to-be-named Korean-themed cafes on the 32nd Street side and an upscale American bistro on Broadway.

The stores and eateries will open over the next year.

An exuberant Anton said “After a year of working on this complicated deal during the dark days of Covid I can’t wait to embarrass myself singing karaoke at the new Martinique. It will be the most fun hotel in the city with five restaurants at the crossroads of Koreatown and Nomad.”

Expanding workplace provider Industrious signed a 10-year 43874-square-foot partnership agreement with Sapir Organization’s 261 Madison Ave. a midcentury tower two blocks from Grand Central Terminal. It will take over the entire ninth and tenth floors which were previously part of WeWork.

Landlord CEO Alex Sapir said “As more companies return to work and look for cutting-edge space near transit hubs 261 and 260 Madison are poised to play a leading role in Midtown’s office recovery.”



Industrious real estate director Doug Feinberg said that small and mid-sized companies are “looking for solutions to their return-to-work plans” and flex space is the answer for many.



Industrious has provided workplaces for companies including RR Donnelley Cisco Lyft Spotify Heineken Chipotle Pinterest and Salesforce.



CBRE repped both sides on the deal — Sacha Zarba and Alice Fair for Industrious and a team led by Peter Turchin and Gregg Rothkin for Sapir.





Lefrak’s 40 W. 57th St. is one of those successful midtown towers that rarely has much available space. The 800000-square-footer is 97 percent leased after five new and renewal leases totaling 100000 square feet were just signed.



The largest deal was a 50000-square-foot renewal for Givaudan a Swiss manufacturer of flavors fragrances and “active cosmetic ingredients.”



New leases were signed for A&E Real Estate and Lightyear Capital while Drasana Capital and Elmwood Asset Management Capital both expanded within the building.

A CBRE team led by Howard Fiddle and Gregg Rothkin repped Lefrak along with a Lefrak in-house team led by Marylou Berk."

I haven't gone to Home Depot since the carts disappeared. The promise of a dog chips and soda was the only way I could get my kids to humor me and tag along to the hardware store.



As an avid Home Depot shopper this deeply saddens me. The ability for me to grab a meal while I'm grabbing supplies is a job-saver. I don't need more shitty grills or fence displays outside.

What a shame. The ability to grab lunch and some supplies for work in one stop was such a time-saver.



The guy at the Glendale Home Depot used to play his bass along with the songs on the radio. it was awesome.



Why is Home Depot trying to shut down people's businesses and livelihoods?

They should be using all that parking-lot space to bring in food trucks — and that my friends would attract more customers. This is a disgusting moment for them to shut down the little guy vs a big greedy corporation.

Many amenities have been lost to the pandemic — including the hot dog stands outside of metro area Home Depot and Lowe’s stores . Back in January vendors at these locations were told they had thirty days to remove their equipment and they haven't been invited back. ""We’re continuously evaluating the needs of our business and we found that in some areas we need to repurpose the space to better serve our customers’ home improvement needs"" a Home Depot spokesperson toldthis fall. ""The fact is that all food vendors at our stores have remained closed since March 2020 and many voluntarily chose to move their business somewhere else during that time.""But another fact is that many of these vendors did not want to leave and would happily reopen at their old locations today. “At my Lowe’s they replaced my hot dog stand with a water cooler” says one vendor. And customers would be eager to welcome them back judging from their comments on the Westword Facebook followup on the missing vendors . Says Tate:Reports Dave:Adds Dom:Offers Zak:Recalls Aaron:Wonders Enrique:Suggests Denise:For the record there is one Home Depot in metro Denver that still has a vendor: the Brat Bar in Arvada.

It didn’t take long for someone to notice the hip-high white pony and ask the owners nearby if George could attend a child’s birthday party.

Much like George unintentionally becoming a unicorn Kate Nichols didn’t mean to buy a horse farm; she simply wanted a property with a guest house.

She didn’t plan on rescuing more than 40 horses but she had a barn with empty stalls and a partner who made things appear – like unicorn horns pens shelters and food trucks – days after she wondered aloud what it would take to make it happen.

A landscaping company dumped mulch on the property and it became a playground. Fencing for parties at the playground became paddocks.

And all these fated happy accidents are more or less how Nichols and Rick DeBerry suddenly came to be the owners of a unicorn farm.

‘Twas the season

In the four years since Nichols purchased the property on Little Virginia Road in Fountain Inn she has saved more than 40 horses. She started with miniature ponies and has worked her way up to Jupiter a former carriage horse who has put on 150 pounds since coming to Hidden Pasture.

“When I was in my 20s I very much wanted to have a visiting farm with mini horses and I baked pies” Nichol recalled. “It was just a random thing but I never thought would ever materialize and it wasn’t in my life plan. It just kind of popped back up like a vision board over the years.”

Jupiter still has another 200 pounds to go before he’s a healthy weight Nichols said a task he tends to himself by stretching his long neck into the next stall and stealing hay from Willy when he isn’t looking.

The neighbors part of what Nichols called a huge overpopulation problem were both headed to meat trucks before their paths redirected to Hidden Pasture Unicorn Farm.

While selling horses for meat is illegal in America it’s not illegal to ship them out of the country for the same purpose. Over 100000 horses are sent to slaughter each year according to the Humane Society of the United States and most could be rehomed.

“(Buyers) have these contracts with these international companies where they have to bring so many heads of horses per year” Nichols said. “Then they go to these auctions and they buy all the leftover horses for nothing and then they slam them in the livestock semi.”

Hidden Pasture would pay for a trailer of ponies in unknown condition – including whether or not they’d arrive alive to their new homes – and the pair did their best to rehab them.

Miniature horses easily become “lawn ornaments” Nichols said and are easily tossed aside when owners don’t bother to train them or work with the animals in any way. Four horses turned into six and before they knew it Hidden Pasture’s pens held 25 horses.

“I finally got to a point where I thought ‘You know we have to do something with these animals. We have to make their lives better not just by caring for them but allowing them to be rehomed’” Nichols told The News.

In an effort to rehome their rescues Nichols and DeBerry went through the Clemson Master Equine Program joined the American Miniature Therapy Horse Association and started training horses for a higher purpose.

It was while training George decked out in the handmade unicorn horn DeBerry made as Nichols’ Christmas present that the cogs started turning.

Before it closed Nichols spent 13 years on the board of the Roper Mountain Holiday Lights. Her connections decorating skills and love of crafting immersive experiences took over the six-acre farm for the first Yuletide Unicorn Festival in 2019.

""We weren’t open for visitors we just wanted to see how it would go"" Nichols said. ""We only did like four weekends and everything has evolved into what it is today.""

The unicorn farm marked its second anniversary last week but the third year of the Yuletide Unicorn Festival just kicked off and runs each weekend through Dec. 19 complete with Santa visits unicorns and a bounce house.

Fairytale farm in real life

Though she hasn't found time on top of running the farm and maintaining her job to bake the pies from the vision board she's been holding close to her heart for decades Nichols has created a family-friendly experience one day and one dollar at a time.

There are 17 equines — including Whisper the hinny — at Hidden Pasture along with miniature cows peacocks dairy goats bunnies chickens and pheasants. Nichols and DeBerry decorate for all the holidays to bring a festive feel for visitors though a few skulls still hung around the coops as evergreen garland graced the fences in preparation for Yuletide.

The ""big barn"" is but a series of vertical poles that will eventually house six large horses as cash flow and time allow construction. Then she can add more rescue minis to the current barn train and rehome them.

There's never a lot of money sitting around when you're in farming Nichols laments. They're cash-based and won't take out loans to expand so the rescue grows as unicorn farm income allows.

“It costs us about $2500 a month in food alone. (Vet care) is very expensive. Preventative care is not but the emergency care is where you rack up $6000 in an afternoon"" Nichols said. ""Last time that happened we had to sell the truck.""

Baby Echo's lifesaving plasma transfusion was worth it. She'll do it again if she has to though the summer camps weekend festivals and other farming operations help maintain the bottom line.

The pair have perfected doughnut and pizza recipes for an on-site food truck transformed a hay shed into a gift shop and turned Nichols' office into a guest rental. They breed and sell dairy goats one of whom serves as an unofficial greeter while considering whether to munch on an artificial Christmas tree.

DeBerry spends his days managing the pastures maintaining fences building structures tending to animals and whatever else needs tending. Nichols' spare moments from work are largely the same though DeBerry's skill set is best used in the hands-on day-to-day of farm labor.

If she wants to have a conversation while they're working she jokes she has to walk and work with him. DeBerry is rarely still and there are always more horns to be made; the horses are harder on them than they expected.

Her marketing skills have helped tell the story of Hidden Pasture her story and that of the evolving lineup of unicorns unidonks and moonicorns — no four-legged creature is exempt from the magic.

“I always thought I was going to be a book writer so I’ve been writing stories about unicorns my whole life"" she said. ""We’re just bringing them to life with this.”

Nagel Charles Wagner Passed away quietly at home on 10/28/2021 at the age of 85. He was born in Bemidji Minnesota to Roy and Ruth Nagel (Snyder) in 1936. Due to Roy's military service and years working as a scientist for the US Forrest Service Charles divided his childhood between Minnesota Maryland Colorado and Idaho. After graduating high school in Fort Colins CO Charles attended the University of Colorado on an academic scholarship. He met Marjorie Burge while in school and they were married in 1958. Charles graduated in 1959 with degrees in electrical engineering and business then moved to Minnesota to take a job with Honeywell where he would work his entire career. Although Charles found success academically and in his career his primary roles were as father and husband. He was the steadfast leader of the Nagel clan until the end. His four children remember him as counsellor coach Cub Scout leader and community volunteer. His Wife will remember him as a devoted and loving husband. He was serious in his faith and was an active member of Wooddale church Eden Prairie. Most impressive was his breadth of knowledge and ability to build and repair nearly all things. He preferred camping trips in Colorado or the Boundary Waters though for the sake of work and family he spent time in China Mexico Europe Alaska and Hawaii as well as many family car trips so he could stop and teach at each historical marker on the way. He leaves behind wife Marjorie children David Steven Scott and Karen in addition to grand children Isaac Anna Elliot Sonya Arlee June Ellie Edward Ruby & August. There will be a family service on November 18th and a graveside gathering at Groveland Cemetery in Minnetonka at 1:00 pm on November 19th open to all friends and family. Memorials can be sent to Tree House and Hope Academy. Charles will be most remembered whenever we need to know why thunder follows lightning how jet engines work and why leaves change colors in fall.

Giacomo Bagnara

What’s Up? (Nov. 7-13)

G.E. Is Breaking Up. So Is J.&J.

On Tuesday General Electric said it will spin off its health care division in early 2023 and its energy business a year later. Only its aviation division will remain. The 129-year-old company’s breakup marks an end to an era of global conglomerates. Other large companies like Siemens and Honeywell International have also pared down their businesses over the last few years and Toshiba and Johnson & Johnson announced last week that they would split up their businesses. But as industrial conglomerates are breaking up a new breed of conglomerate has emerged: Big Tech companies like Amazon and Alphabet have embraced the strategy of multiple business lines putting odd bedfellows like books and grocery delivery or maps and phones under the same umbrella.

Inflation Is Going Up

Consumer prices rose faster in October than at any other point in the last three decades according to data released by the Labor Department on Wednesday. Most policymakers expected that rapid inflation caused by the pandemic would slow sooner. That it has stuck around complicates plans for the Federal Reserve which may face pressure to speed its lifting of pandemic support measures and for President Biden who said Wednesday that “reversing this trend is a top priority for me.” The Biden administration has argued that its infrastructure bill and broader economic package would slow inflation by increasing the economy’s capacity for supplying goods and services. Economists generally agree that the legislation would slow inflation in the long term but many say it could add to inflation next year.

A Good Day for Rivian

Rivian the electric truck company had a blockbuster debut on public markets Wednesday raising nearly $12 billion. Its shares jumped 29 percent in their first day of trading which valued Rivian at $86 billion — on a par with General Motors. Tesla another electric vehicle maker founded in 2003 has a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Though traditional automakers have invested in electric vehicles investors have not yet rewarded them for it. “General Motors is so undervalued as we start this wonderful period we’re in because we invested over three four years ago in electric vehicles” Mary Barra G.M.’s chief executive said about the company’s investment in electric vehicles at the DealBook Online Summit last week.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

Why trust us?

HP Victus 16 MSRP $1360.00 Score Details “The HP Victus 16 is a solid gaming laptop at an affordable price.” Pros Excellent productivity performance

Solid 1080p gaming performance

Comfortable keyboard

Display is good for both productivity and gaming

Reasonably priced Cons Build quality is subpar

Keyboard backlighting is limited

Poor battery life

Gaming laptops have never been more popular and HP has a new line of devices to meet the surge in interest. Victus is the name and it sits under HP’s premium Omen gaming brand and replaces the budget-level Pavilion gaming machines.

HP Victus brings a more premium design souped-up internals and Windows 11. I was sent a high-end configuration with a Core i7-11800H and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 that’s priced at $1360.

That’s a fair price for a moderately equipped gaming laptop — the closest Omen 16 configuration I could put together costs $1950 by comparison. Given the price difference and great performance the HP Victus 16 has already made its mark in the world of affordable gaming laptops.

Design

The first thing you might notice if you’re familiar with the Omen line is the Victus logo. It’s a “V” based on the same core geometry as the Omen logo with the bottom portion essentially isolated to stand on its own. The logo’s not only on the outside lid and on the display chin but it’s also embedded in the venting above the keyboard and outlines the venting on the chassis bottom. If nothing else the Victus has its branding down.

The rest of the Victus 16’s aesthetic is minimalist with few nods to a more flashy gaming design. In fact the only real gaming design element is the row of vents along the back of the chassis. They lend some visual flair while also providing enhanced thermals (more on that in a bit). My review unit was in the Mica Silver (black) color; Performance Blue and Ceramic White are the other options.

Overall the Victus 16 is a gaming laptop inside a more traditional laptop design. We’ve seen that with a few other gaming machines such as the conservatively designed (and much more expensive) Razer Blade 15 and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 which other than its lid and rear venting also sports a nongaming aesthetic. The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro lives in both worlds at once with a businesslike design with some gaming elements like aggressive vents seemingly pasted on. Conversely the Asus ROG Strix G15 and the Alienware laptops maintain a die-hard gaming aesthetic through and through.

The Victus 16 has reasonably small bezels for a gaming machine at least on top and along the sides. Even with a massive chin the combination results in an 84% screen-to-body ratio — not bad for a gaming laptop . That made it possible to fit the 16-inch display into a chassis that’s closer to a 15-inch gaming machine. The Legion 5 Pro has smaller bezels around its 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display and is almost identical to the Victus 16 which sports an old-school 16:9 panel in width and depth.

The Asus ROG Strix G15 with a 15.6-inch 16:9 display is fractions of an inch wider and deeper. The Victus 16 is 0.93 inches thick and weighs 5.5 pounds compared to the Legion 5 Pro at 1.1 inches and 5.4 pounds and the ROG Strix G15 at about an inch and 5.7 pounds. That makes the Victus 16 a reasonably sized gaming laptop given the display and components. You can get thinner gaming laptops  like the Razer Blade 15 at just 0.67 inches and the HP Omen 16 at 0.89 inches but you’ll pay for it.

One area where the Victus 16 doesn’t quite live up to its price is its build quality. It’s an all-plastic laptop which is fine but the lid is too bendable and the keyboard deck has enough flex that you can feel your fingers pressing against whatever’s directly underneath the keyboard and palm rest. The Legion 5 Pro and ROG Strix G15 felt sturdier to us and those are about the same price as the Victus 16. The hinge was incredibly wobbly easy to open with one hand but prone to shaking during gaming sessions. Maybe the build quality carried over from the budget-oriented Pavilion Gaming line but HP might want to improve it in future generations.

One of the more meaningful upgrades from the Pavilion Gaming 16 is the thermal design. HP incorporated a new system with five-way airflow thanks to an additional outlet vent on the RTX 3060 model four heat pipes and larger fans. The result is a 30% increase in airflow according to HP which makes the laptop rather loud when working hard but keeps it cooler than its predecessor. As we’ll see in the performance section below the Victus 16 makes the most of its components and that’s in part due to the excellent thermal design.

There’s a mix of connections available on the Victus 16 with a focus on being able to connect numerous gaming peripherals. There’s an Ethernet port a full-size HDMI port a USB-A 3.2 port a USB-C 3.2 port a 3.5mm audio jack and a full-size SD card reader along the left-hand side and two more USB-A 3.2 ports along the right-hand side. Juice is provided by a massive 200-watt power brick and a proprietary barrel connector.

There’s no Thunderbolt 4 support though which is disappointing. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 provide wireless connectivity.

Performance

The Victus 16 is equipped with a 45-watt eight-core/16-thread Intel Core i7-11800H — a workhorse among Intel’s lineup that provides some of the best creative application performance you’ll find outside of AMD’s Ryzen 5000 series. That’s not to mention its productivity performance which is overkill for even demanding office workers.

There’s nothing that says a gaming laptop can’t be used to get work done and so it’s worth looking at how well the Victus 16 performs on non-gaming tasks. Consider my wife an interior designer: She was handed an Alienware gaming laptop as her work machine because it sports both a fast CPU and a discrete GPU for speeding up applications like AutoCAD Revit CET and the Adobe suite. The HP Victus 16 would fit in an office setting more discretely than an Alienware machine that’s for sure.

In any event the Victus 16 is undoubtedly a fast laptop even compared to comparably equipped mainstream laptops . It led the pack in Geekbench 5 with impressively high scores tied for third place in Cinebench R23 (with the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro and its Ryzen 7 5800H being the fastest machine) took first place in our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB video as H.265 and even achieved the high score in PCMark 10 a primarily productivity-oriented benchmark.

In PugetBench which uses Premiere Pro to crunch through a series of demanding tasks and that can utilize a discrete GPU the Victus 16 again achieved the highest score among its closest competitors.

If you’re looking for a fast laptop for productivity and creative tasks then you can’t go wrong with the HP Victus 16. It pushes its components to the extreme thanks mainly to its excellent thermal design and it’s certainly faster than your typical mainstream — and often thin and light — laptop. Note that you can also purchase the Victus 16 with an AMD Ryzen 7 4800H if you’d like even faster CPU performance.

Gaming

But of course the Victus 16 is a gaming laptop  and so it should be measured against other gaming laptops . Here it also impressed performing quite well given that it has one of the slower GPUs in our comparison group. Note that HP includes its Omen Gaming Hub app with the Victus 16 which enables undervolting and three power modes: Quiet default and performance.

I ran all the benchmarks — including those in the section above — in both default and performance modes and saw very little difference in performance. In most games performance mode squeezed out only a few extra frame rates.

Its 3DMark Time Spy score was in line with our comparison group coming in next-to-last place with only the MSI Creator Z16 — a nongaming machine with the same GPU that I added for comparison purposes — posting a lower score.

In actual games the Victus 16 did well. It managed to come within a couple of frames of the Razer Blade 14 and Lenovo Legion 5 Pro in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla — and both of those are equipped with RTX 3070s. It almost matched the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro in Battlefield V and it beat out the Razer Blade 14 in Fortnite. Finally it beat both the RTX 3070-equipped machines in Civilization VI.

Best yet these are very playable frame rates across the board making the Victus 16 a highly capable 1080p gaming machine. These results are all at high graphical settings meaning you don’t need to turn things down to maintain high frame rates. For a gaming laptop equipped with an RTX 3060 the Victus 16 is competitive. If you select the AMD version of the laptop you can opt for a slower AMD Radeon RX5500M GPU to save some cash.

The Victus 16 moves a lot of air when it’s working hard and so fan noise was quite audble. It’s not enough to force you to wear headphones at all times but you might choose to do so nonetheless. The surface of the laptop remained reasonable hitting 101 degrees Fahrenheit on the right side of the keyboard deck during benchmarking. The bottom of the chassis didn’t exceed 115 degrees F during my testing. During nongaming use the laptop remained cool and quiet.

According to 3DMark GPU temperatures ran between about 75 degrees C and 100 degrees C at the maximum which is the highest possible safe temperature. We don’t typically like to see temperatures get that high and you’ll find better thermals in laptops like the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro.

Configurations

While our $1360 review configuration was at the high end — with the Core i7-11800H RTX 3060 16GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and the 144Hz Full HD display — you can get the Victus 16 for much less money. For example for just $730 you can get a Core i5-11400H GTX 1650 8GB of RAM  a 256GB SSD and the entry-level 60Hz Full HD panel. But this quite frankly isn’t a configuration that most people are going to enjoy between the outdated graphics card and the 60Hz screen.

The most you can spend is $1640 by upgrading our configuration to 32GB of RAM  a 1TB SSD and a QHD (2560 x 1440) 165Hz display.

If you want to save money but not compromise so much on performance then you can still keep your purchase price under $1000. For $920 you can get the Core i5 an RTX 3050 Ti 8GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and a 144Hz Full HD display — a solid entry-level gaming laptop for a very attractive price especially if you’re trying to buy a gaming laptop under $1000.

Display

Gaming laptops don’t always boast displays with wide and accurate colors and high contrast and instead focus on things like refresh rates. The display installed on my review Victus 16 avoided those limitations. It’s a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display running at a 144Hz refresh rate with its one weakness being its old-school 16:9 aspect ratio.

But as I used the display it seemed like a similar panel to what I might find on a premium thin and light laptop aimed at productivity work. It was bright with dynamic colors that weren’t oversaturated and enough contrast that blacks stood out from whites.

I was very pleased with the Victus 16’s display.

My colorimeter confirmed my impressions. The display is indeed bright at 375 nits well above our 300-nit threshold and the contrast came in at 1120:1 exceeding our preferred 1000:1. Colors were wider than average at 79% of AdobeRGB (where around 72% is the norm) and 100% of sRGB and they were fairly accurate at a DeltaE of 1.85 (1.0 or less is considered excellent).

The Asus ROG Strix G15 wasn’t nearly as good coming in at 278 nits a 1090:1 contrast ratio (a good result) and just 48% of AdobeRGB and 64% of sRGB with a color accuracy of 2.19. The Legion 5 Pro’s display was also good at 515 nits a 1380:1 contrast ratio 74% of AdobeRGB and 97% of sRGB and a color accuracy of 1.36.

I was very pleased with the Victus 16’s display. Not only is it fast for gaming but it can perform well for productivity work. It can even do some creative work in a pinch thanks to its fast performance.

The audio wasn’t quite as impressive. The two downward-firing speakers were very quiet even when turned up all the way although there was no distortion. Mids and highs were clear enough but the bass was lacking. You’ll want a pair of headphones when you’re gaming at full strength because the sound won’t be loud enough to overcome the fan noise comfortably. The same goes for bingeing Netflix and listening to music — headphones are a must.

Keyboard and touchpad

Here’s one thing the Victus 16 did not inherit from the Omen line: Per-key RGB lighting on the keyboard. In fact although the Victus 16’s keyboard is indeed backlit with white lighting it’s only on or off with no levels in between. So HP has very carefully ensured that the Omen retains its advantage here. The keyboard feels great though with deep travel and very snappy switches that provide excellent responsiveness for both gamers and productivity users. It’s not a mechanical keyboard but it shouldn’t hold back competitive gamers.

The touchpad is increased in size over the Pavilion Gaming 16 and it takes up most of the available space on the palm rest. It has a comfortable surface for swiping but I found the buttons a little loose and they vibrated just a touch when pressed. It’s nothing egregious and as a Microsoft Precision touchpad it supports the full complement of Windows 11 multitouch gestures. Overall I’d rate the touchpad as competent but nothing to write home about.

There’s no Windows 11 Hello password-less support and the display isn’t touch-enabled. So those are two missing features that would have been welcome but are commonly missing in midrange gaming laptops .

Battery life

The Victus 16 is a gaming laptop with relatively high-end components and a 70 watt-hour battery. I didn’t expect great battery life from the machine and I didn’t get it.

In our web-browsing test that cycles through a series of complex websites the Victus 16 managed just 4.5 hours — a terrible score. The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro worked for over seven hours which still isn’t great but it’s far better than the HP managed while the Asus ROG Strix G15 did even worse at just 3.8 hours.

In our video test that loops through a local 1080p movie trailer the Victus 16 hit 6.5 hours another terrible score. The ROG Strix G15 managed eight hours and we didn’t submit the Legion 5 Pro to this test.

I also ran the PCMark 10 Applications battery test where the Victus 16 made it to just over five hours. We haven’t tested any other gaming laptops with this benchmark but most laptops get 10 hours or better. In the PCMark 10 Gaming battery test the Victus 16 managed 92 minutes which means it keeps working while unplugged.

The Victus 16 isn’t meant to be a portable productivity machine so these battery results are forgivable. Just know that you’ll want to keep your rather large power adapter with you when you’re switching gaming environments.

Our take

The HP Victus 16 is a legitimate contender in the medium-priced gaming market. It’s well-equipped and performs admirably. Its chassis although a bit too bendable isn’t too large to carry around.

HP struck a nice balance with the Victus 16. And now the company has a genuine gaming brand sitting beneath the Omen lineup that should better entice gamers with less money to spend.

Are there any alternatives?

The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro is likely the best alternative to the Victus 16. It’s about the same size although its display is in the superior 16:10 aspect ratio and its gaming performance is similar. You’ll also spend around the same money.

You could also consider the AMD-equipped Asus ROG Strix G15 as a good value alternative and the ROG Zephyrus G15 offers a more streamlined chassis and higher specs for anyone who wants to step up their gaming a notch.

How long will it last?

Despite a loose hinge and a slightly bendable lid and chassis the Victus 16 should still last for years of hard gaming. The one-year warranty remains as disappointing as ever.

Should you buy it?

Yes. The HP Victus 16 is a competent gaming performer for the price in a comfortable chassis.

Their latest venture unleashes the new RZR Pro R side-by-side a beast with a whopping 225 horsepower.

That's right folks; what you have before you is the newest side-by-side from Polaris the RZR Pro R . Sure this team has put out side-by-sides before but the new Pro R is one hell of a machine. Why? Just to give you an idea of what we're dealing with here know that the Pro R is a 225-horsepower machine. Now you're starting to get the idea.First off to make things easier to follow have a look in the gallery and then come back to the text to get a clear idea of what you've witnessed. All good? Great.Now the Pro R is available in four different packages and as a 4-seater too. Nonetheless what differs between models are the trim and color packages starting at 32000 USD (27964 EUR at current exchange rates) for the Sport version. At the top of the range the 41000 USD (35830 EUR at current exchange rates) for the Ultimate Launch Edition which might I add you is already sold out.What makes the Pro R so unique is the motor. Polaris is using its freshly designed ProStar Fury 2.0-liter engine. With a naturally aspirated four-cylinder flow when you step on it you'll get the power you want. With the addition of a larger clutch belt and selectable throttle control you can even play around with the amount of power you have available.But all that power will only go so far. Another essence of any side-by-side is its ability to handle terrains of every kind. Well the Pro R will have no problems taming asphalt dust sand and even rock climbing. This is done by the addition of a Max-Link suspension which Polaris calls their ""...strongest smartest suspension ever developed...""What does this mean? To kick things off we can consider the 74-inch (188-centimeter) stance offering stability and control. 32-inch (81-inch) Maxxis Rampage tires offer adequate grip. With a 133.5-inch (339-centimeter) wheelbase 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) of ground clearance 27 inches (68.5 centimeters) and 29 inches (73.6 centimeters) of suspension travel you can do all that you see in the video below.Making your ride near perfect  boxed steel front A-arms with three-piece stabilizer bars and FOX 3.0 Live Valve X2 shocks offer 27 inches (68.5 centimeters) of travel at the front. The rear sports a similar setup with the addition of high-clearance rods and stabilizer bars with the same Fox shocks bring 29 inches (73.6 centimeters) of travel.However the real magic isn't in just the suspension itself but the control system behind it all. It's called Dynamix DV and it is a suspension controller that independently adjusts compression and rebound. Four modes are available including a Rock Mode each choice tuned for a specific purpose Top all that off with an all-new chassis and cage design that yields a one-piece cage built from 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) tubing and you get a two-fold increase in torsional stiffness. Not only this but the cockpit is also more spacious features storage options and blasts audio through a Rockford Fosgate Audio system.This story doesn't end here either. If you fall in love with the Pro R and want to order one you can build your own on the manufacturer's website. However you can add so many options to your Pro R that I urge you to have some extra bucks ready and I mean thousands of dollars extra. You can select different doors fenders cages add wenches and coolers and even change tires and wheels. The options seem to be endless so take your time. After all you'll be creating one beast of a machine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtMTAwMC1ocC1kb2RnZS1zcnQtY2hhbGxlbmdlci1oZWxsY2F0LXJlZGV5ZS1kb21pbmF0ZXMtd2l0aC1pdHMtc3BlZWQtYW5kLXNvdW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 1000-HP Dodge SRT Challenger Hellcat Redeye Dominates With Its Speed And Sound,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtMTAwMC1ocC1kb2RnZS1zcnQtY2hhbGxlbmdlci1oZWxsY2F0LXJlZGV5ZS1kb21pbmF0ZXMtd2l0aC1pdHMtc3BlZWQtYW5kLXNvdW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc29tYWxpLzU5Mjc4MTI00gEnaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zb21hbGkvNTkyNzgxMjQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Imise ayaad siisan lahayd kombuyuutor 45 sano ka hor ah oo weli shaqaynaya?,

NEWPORT NEWS Va. — Newport News Shipbuilding and United Steelworkers union reached a tentative labor deal according to a union spokesperson Sunday.

The agreement with NNS parent company Huntington Ingalls Industries comes as the current contract is scheduled to expire midnight on Sunday November 14.

According to a release the proposed 5-year-deal ""would enhance wages improve pension curb health care costs and bolster promotional opportunities in lower job categories.""

Union members were briefed on the deal Sunday afternoon during a members-only meeting in Hampton wrote a union spokesperson.

USW Local 8888 represents more than 10000 workers at Newport News Shipbuilding and union members will hold a ballot vote on the proposal on Tuesday.

Huntington Ingalls Industries spokesperson Duane Bourne said ""We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement on a new contract with the United Steelworkers. The union vote with eligible employees is expected to take place soon; meanwhile our workforce will continue working under a contract extension during the voting process.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExL2hpaS1jaHJpc3RlbnMtdmlyZ2luaWEtY2xhc3MtYXR0YWNrLXN1Ym1hcmluZS1uZXctamVyc2V5LXNzbi03OTYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HII Christens Virginia-class Attack Submarine New Jersey (SSN 796),"HII Christens Virginia-class Attack Submarine New Jersey (SSN 796) Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) yesterday christened the 23rd Virginia-class submarine New Jersey (SSN 796) at the company’s Newport News Shipbuilding division.

Huntington Ingalls Industries press release

“The christening is a Navy and shipbuilder tradition that celebrates the hard work and dedication of the women and men who are building this magnificent submarine readying her for the next phase of construction which includes launch testing sea trials and delivery to the Navy” said Jennifer Boykin president of Newport News Shipbuilding. “We commemorate these American builders during a challenging time in our nation’s history.”

“When New Jersey joins the Navy’s fleet she will deliver firepower for freedom taking with her the skill of her shipbuilders the spirit of her sponsor the courage of her commander and crew and the pride of her fellow New Jerseyans” Boykin added. “These characteristics united forge a strong national defense that defines America.”

Susan DiMarco who is a New Jersey resident retired dentist and wife of former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson serves as the ship’s sponsor and performed the traditional honor of breaking a bottle of American sparkling wine across the submarine’s bow during the ceremony.

“As citizens today we are more divided and disconnected from one another than at any time in our last 50 years but the efforts that went into building New Jersey say otherwise” DiMarco said. “In order to complete this great ship there must have been vital partnership and purpose. As a country we are cooperative generous and tenacious and we can work together on exceptional ideas.”

The ceremony took place outside of Newport News Shipbuilding’s Module Outfitting Facility and was attended by more than 1800 guests including Newport News Shipbuilding employees who are building New Jersey members of the submarine’s crew Navy personnel and other government officials including Jeh Johnson.

U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia and U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross of New Jersey both delivered remarks. Other speakers included New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy; Jay Stefany acting assistant secretary of the Navy for research development and acquisition; Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe Jr. director of the Navy’s strategic systems programs; and Kevin Graney president of General Dynamics Electric Boat.

Ceremony participants included U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia; Capt. Andrew P. Johnson commanding officer of Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion and Repair Newport News; and Cmdr. Carlos Otero the ship’s prospective commanding officer.

Retired U.S. Navy Adm. Michael Mullen former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former chief of naval operations provided the keynote address.

“Today is a day of gratitude especially to the 4000 men and women whose hard work put New Jersey together” said Mullen adding that the nation must prevail in an ideological battle against an adversary it has not seen before.

“The future USS New Jersey will be a critical — some say the most critical — arrow in our quiver” he said.

The company reached the pressure hull complete milestone in February meaning that all of the ship’s hull sections were joined to form a single watertight unit. This was one of the last major milestones before the christening and is floated off to a pierside berth for additional outfitting and testing at a future date.

New Jersey is the 23rd Virginia-class submarine and the 11th to be delivered by Newport News Shipbuilding. It is first submarine designed with a modification for gender integration. Construction began in March 2016 and is 82% complete. The submarine is scheduled to be delivered to the U.S. Navy in late 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51c25pLm9yZy8yMDIxLzExLzEzL2F0dGFjay1ib2F0LW5ldy1qZXJzZXktY2hyaXN0ZW5lZC1hcy1zdWItY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1wYW5kZW1pYy1yZWNvdmVyedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Attack Boat New Jersey Christened as Sub Construction Continues Pandemic Recovery - USNI News,"NEWPORT NEWS Va. — Nuclear attack boat New Jersey (SSN-796) was christened on Saturday as shipbuilder Newport News continues to recover from the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on submarine construction.

The ceremony naming New Jersey — the fifth Block IV Virginia nuclear attack boat — comes as the two yards responsible for building U.S. nuclear submarines continue to recover from pandemic delays and prepare for the construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN-826) nuclear ballistic missile submarine.

“During COVID last year we did have to make some prioritization decisions based on a significant reduction of our workforce here and we prioritized through collaboration with the Navy really the vessels that were closest to delivery” Jason Ward Huntington Ingalls Industries’ vice president of Virginia-class submarine construction told USNI News on Friday at the shipyard.

Builders Newport News and General Dynamics Electric Boat each build components of the Virginia-class submarines and barge the sections to each other’s yard for final assembly.

According to a June report from the Government Accountability Office eight of the ten Block IV Virginias have been delayed about four months on average and put follow-on Block Vs at risk.

The yards “stated that the overall increase in submarine workload and resulting increase of inexperienced new hires at both the suppliers and the shipbuilders along with long-term challenges meeting staffing levels are driving these unfavorable cost trends for both blocks” reads the GAO report.

Both yards are balancing the boats under ongoing construction with the demands of Columbia-class submarine production.

“The important part of the Virginia program is really about cadence” Ward said. “Two [boats] per year is really what enables a six-month build cadence that supports efficiency learning curve [and] cost advantages [for] a stable production.”

To that end EB HII and the Navy are taking an integrated approach to building Navy’s nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers Ward said.

“Coupled with that strategic initiative is the support from Congress with supplier development funds to invest in industrial capacity and capability to support the increased demand for these weapons systems” Ward said.

The two yards have studied the capital investment needed to produce three Virginia-class submarines a year. Ward said expanding the yard to reach that goal would take four to five years.

In the short term Newport News is building 200-foot extensions on its construction bays to accommodate the Block V Virginia Payload Module’s planned 84-foot extension.

Attack submarines are a key advantage the U.S. has over geopolitical strategic competitors China and Russia.

“New Jersey and her sister ships will fill an ever-increasing need to counter Russia in the Atlantic and China’s growing anti-access threats in the western Pacific” Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe the head of the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs said in a speech during the ceremony.

“Why is each submarine we build more capable than the one before it? The answer is it’s because our adversaries are working tirelessly to do the same” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivwFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtbmV3cy1hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjEvbm92ZW1iZXIvMTA5OTEtdXMtbmF2eS11c3MtbmV3LWplcnNleS1zc24tNzk2LXZpcmdpbmlhLWNsYXNzLW51Y2xlYXItZmFzdC1hdHRhY2stc3VibWFyaW5lLXRvLWJlLWNocmlzdGVuZWQtdG9kYXkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Navy USS New Jersey SSN 796 Virginia-class nuclear fast-attack submarine to be christened today,"According to information published by the United States Department of Defense the U.S. Navy will christen one of its newest Virginia-class fast-attack submarines the future USS New Jersey (SSN 796) during a ceremony on Saturday November 13 2021 at Huntington Ingalls Industry in Newport News Va.

The future USS New Jersey (SSN 796) is the third Navy vessel named in recognition of the state and is the 5th Block IV Virginia-class submarine to be built.



The USS Jersey (SSN-796) is a nuclear powered Virginia-class attack submarine design to operate in the world's littoral and deep waters while conducting anti-submarine warfare; anti-surface ship warfare; strike warfare; special operations forces support; intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare missions. Their inherent stealth endurance mobility and firepower directly enable these submarines to support five of the six maritime strategy core capabilities – sea control power projection forward presence maritime security and deterrence. Virginia-class submarines are replacing Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarines as they retire.



The Virginia-class is a series of nuclear-powered cruise missile fast-attack submarines in service in the United States Navy. Designed by General Dynamics's Electric Boat (EB) and Huntington Ingalls Industries the Virginia-class is the United States Navy's latest submarine model which incorporates the latest in stealth intelligence gathering and weapons systems technology.

The U.S. Navy has been procuring Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) since FY1998 and a total of 34 have been procured through FY2021. Since FY2011 Virginia-class boats have been procured at a rate of two per year.

The first Virginia-class submarine entered service in October 2004. The Virginia-class design was developed to be less expensive and better optimized for post-Cold War submarine missions than the Seawolf-class design. The baseline Virginia-class design is slightly larger than the Los Angeles-class design but incorporates newer technologies including technologies used in the Seawolf-class design.



The Virginia-class submarine includes Block I II III IV and V versions. Block I involved 4 submarines and modular construction techniques were incorporated during construction. Block II involved 6 submarines that were built in four sections rather than ten sections. Block III submarines feature a revised bow with a Large Aperture Bow (LAB) sonar array as well as technology from Ohio-class SSGNs (2 VLS tubes each containing 6 missiles). Block IV involved 10 submarines. The main improvement over Block III is the reduction of major maintenance periods from four to three increasing each boat's total lifetime deployments by one. Block V involves 10 boats and may incorporate the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) which would give guided-missile capability when the SSGNs are retired from service.



The Virginia-class submarine has a length of 114.8 m a beam of 10.36 m and a displacement of approximately 7800 tons. The submarine can reach a top speed of 28 miles per hour (45 km/h). She has a crew of 132 people including 15 officers and 117 enlisted.



Citing the Naval-Technology website the Virginia-Class attack submarine is equipped with 12 vertical missile launch tubes and four 533mm torpedo tubes. The vertical launching system has the capacity to launch 16 Tomahawk submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCM) in a single salvo. There is a capacity for up to 26 mk48 ADCAP mod 6 heavyweight torpedoes and sub harpoon anti-ship missiles to be fired from the 21in torpedo tubes. Mk60 CAPTOR mines may also be fitted.",,,

The news announced at IBM Quantum Summit highlights IBM's hardware progress. Last year IBM outlined its hardware and software roadmaps. By 2025 IBM is projecting that there will be frictionless quantum computing to enable a broad array of applications that will surpass classical computing.

Quantum computing is a hot market as IonQ shares have been surging amid pacts with Accenture and Softbank. Honeywell Quantum and Cambridge Quantum will combine forces and likely go public. IBM also expects quantum to become a big part of its business over time to build out the ecosystem.

Eagle represents a big step toward scaling quantum computing and is the company's first processor to contain more than 100 qubits said Bob Sutor chief quantum exponent at IBM. ""Eagle is a punctuation point of where we are and that everything is on track"" said Sutor.

IBM has deployed about 50 quantum systems to date with about 20 available via the cloud. IBM also has two quantum systems installed outside of the US. Eagle was manufactured in IBM's own fabrication plant but Sutor noted that the volumes aren't high. For now IBM is using its processors on its own systems.

According to IBM Eagle leverages new techniques that place control components on multiple physical levels while keeping qubits on a single layer. ""Building quantum processors is a lot more complicated because of the nature of qubits and how they all need to work together"" said Sutor who added that it's critical to eliminate interference.

The upshot of that Eagle 3D packaging architecture is that more usable qubits can be used. Sutor added that Eagle couldn't be completely simulated on a classical computer.

In a blog post IBM outlined Eagle's architecture.

We had to combine and improve upon techniques developed in previous generations of IBM Quantum processors in order to develop a processorarchitecture including advanced 3D packagingtechniquesthat we're confident can form the backbone ofprocessors up to and including our planned 1000+ qubit Condor processor. Eagle is based upon our heavy-hexagonal qubit layout asdebuted with our Falcon processor where qubits connect witheithertwo or three neighbors as ifsitting upon the edges and corners of tessellated hexagons.This particular connectivity decreased the potential for errors caused by interactions between neighboring qubits-providing significant boosts in yielding functional processors.

Eagle will be made available to select members of the IBM Quantum Network in December. Here's a look at Eagle unstacked.

IBM's Eagle quantum processor features a 3D architecture and layers so qubits work well together. IBM

IBM also previewed its Quantum System Two which is designed to work with processors with more than 1000 qubits. IBM Quantum System Two will be more modular with the ability to house and cool multiple processors in one system.

This Quantum System Two architecture enables customers to manipulate and test portions of the system without affecting the entire setup. The latest quantum system from IBM will be up and running in 2023 at IBM Research.

On the modularity of Quantum System Two IBM said:

With this system we're giving flexibility to our hardware to continue to increase the scale of our chips. The team is taking a holistic systems approach to understand the necessary resources to support not only our upcoming Osprey and Condor processors but also quantum processors into the future as we continue to progress along our hardware roadmap. System Two incorporates a new generation of scalable qubit control electronics together with higher-density cryogenic components and cabling. Furthermore we are working jointly with Bluefors Cryogenics to re-imagine the cryogenic platform. Bluefors' new Kide Cryogenic platform and its hexagonal footprint optimizes space inside of the fridge in order to accommodate increased support hardware required by larger processors while ensuring that engineers can easily access and service the hardware inside the fridge.

Sutor didn't provide goals for the number of IBM Quantum System Two to be deployed. Sutor however was optimistic that IBM can use Quantum System Two to expand its footprint. The COVID-19 pandemictaught IBM engineers how to deploy quantum systems remotely.

""We learned a lot of techniques and methodology from having other people install and support remote systems"" said Sutor. ""It's similar to how NASA has had to instruct astronauts in space to make repairs.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL2libS1hbWF6b24tcGFydG5lci1leHRlbmQtcmVhY2gtMDUwOTE0MDA3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM Amazon partner to extend reach of data tools for oil companies,"By Stephen Nellis and Liz Hampton

(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp and Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services said on Monday they would work together to extend the reach of a set of tools that oil companies use to manage disparate types of data.

Amazon in 2018 worked with Royal Dutch Shell to create a technology to turn data from more than a century of oil production largely from paper records into a standardized format for multinational oil companies to improve efficiency across their operations.

The technology is being shared industry-wide on an open-source basis and only works in cloud computing data centers. Some oil producing countries such as Nigeria Saudi Arabia and Russia have no Amazon data centers but require companies to store their data within the country's borders.

IBM and Amazon said they have worked together to resolve that problem. Using IBM technology called OpenShift oil companies can use the oil-industry cloud data tools in their privately owned data centers within their countries.

""The data residency requirement is virtually 50% of the oil producing world today"" said Manish Chawla global managing director for energy resources and manufacturing at IBM in an interview. ""This is a pretty significant part of the market.""

Bill Vass vice president of engineering at AWS said expanding the reach of the data tools would also help oil companies add non-petroleum assets such as wind and solar to their portfolios. Renewable energy requires producers to know their output at various locations at different times.

It is often said that small businesses are the backbone of the economy. The mom and pop shops restaurants and grocery stores help supply countries all over the world with millions of jobs as well as providing community support.

However the challenge that most small businesses face today is one of limited access to capital. In fact currently most small businesses turn to banks to ask for a bank account a loan and other financial services such as point of sale or ecommerce solutions to collect customer card payments take orders online or pay employees via a payroll solution to employee bank cards instead of cash.

The challenge for small businesses is that Banks demand collateral audited financials references proof of ID and other forms of documentation. Through the tiresome application process only a very small number of businesses get the support they need to grow while the vast majority are rejected simply because they are too small to add value to the bank’s balance sheet.

This problem exists for over 260 million small businesses around the world which is why Nexxo has developed a blockchain solution that works with local banks and governments to help provide small businesses with the necessary tools (commercial bank accounts loans point of sale devices ecommerce applications financing etc.) to succeed.

As a Fintech company built on IBM’s hyperledger technology Nexxo operates in multiple countries servicing 15k small business and 300k consumers.

Nexxo is launching a token sale from December 1st 2018 – December 31st 2018. Their presale began on October 31st 2018 and will end on December 1st 2018. The company is aiming to raise a hard cap of $44285714.

And today while browsing through Twitter I came across an image that really put things in perspective on how storage as a medium has evolved and what it used to be decades ago.



The image shared by Twitter user @jonerlichman showed a hard drive that’s as large as a double-door refrigerator being lifted up an aircraft using a forklift.

This was a hard drive 65 years ago.



It would store 1 iPhone photo today. pic.twitter.com/M9YyrpegRE — Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) November 11 2021

A little digging (via ComputerHistory.org) revealed that this massive drive was actually developed by a team led by Reynold Johnson at IBM R&D Laboratory in San Jose California. This drive was the world’s first fast mass storage system that was designed to replace the conventional punched cards and magnetic tape-based storage.

IBM

The end result was the world’s first commercial hard disk drive (HDD) -- the Model 350 disk storage unit. The image shows the first delivery for this drive to be made to Zellerbach Paper in San Francisco in June 1956 as a part of the IBM 305 RAMAC (Random Access Method of Accounting and Control) system.



The drive was capable of storing digital data in magnetic material on firm rotating disks. The information was registered and accessed via dedicated read and write units dubbed heads. The movement of the heads processing signal waveforms and running the entire system efficiently as possible with the help of electronic circuits and software.



Mark Richards

The Model 350 featured fifty 24-inch diameter disks stacked on a spindle that spun at 1200 RPM (rounds per minute) -- a fraction of the 10000 RPMs SATA hard drives are capable of doing today -- and was capable of storing 5 million 6-bit characters at an areal density of 2000 bits per square similar to 3.75 Megabytes of data storage.

The 24-week data from the phase 3 TRuE-V clinical trial program which includes TRuE-V1 (NCT04052425) and TRuE-V2 (NCT04057573) investigated the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor as a treatment for patients 12 years and older with nonsegmental vitiligo.

Findings from the week 24 analysis showed treatment with 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily (BID) resulted in greater improvement to vehicle for the primary and all key secondary endpoints in both the TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2 studies according to a company press release.1

Results which were consistent across both studies showed:

29.9% of patients applying ruxolitinib cream achieved greater than or equal to 75% improvement from baseline in the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI75) at week 24. This was the primary endpoint.

More than 51% of patients from baseline who were in the ruxolitinib treatment arm achieved F-VASI50 and more than 15% of patients applying ruxolitinib cream achieved F-VASI90 key secondary endpoints.

Additional key secondary endpoints were met including a significantly higher proportion of patients achieving greater than or equal to 50% improvement from baseline in total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI50) and a Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS) response with application of ruxolitinib cream compared to vehicle. Study data also uncovered a significant improvement in the percentage change from baseline in facial body surface area (F-BSA) with application of ruxolitinib cream compared to vehicle.

“We are pleased to share the full 24-week results from our pivotal phase 3 TRuE-V program which resulted in significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation in vitiligo patients treated with ruxolitinib cream” said Jim Lee MD PhD group vice president inflammation and autoimmunity Incyte in Wilmington Delaware. “These positive results reinforce the potential for ruxolitinib cream as a meaningful treatment option for people suffering from vitiligo and we look forward to working with regulators to bring the first approved medical treatment that directly addresses repigmentation to patients in the U.S. and Europe.”

The overall safety profile of ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo was consistent with previous study data according to the release. The patients in the ruxolitinib cream treatment arm did not report clinically significant application site reactions and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with previous studies with no serious TEAEs reported.

“The skin depigmentation associated with vitiligo can have a profound impact on a person’s life and patients are in need of additional treatment options” said David Rosmarin MD vice chair of research and education in the Dermatology Department at Tufts Medical Center in Boston Massachusetts. “I am extremely encouraged about the potential of ruxolitinib cream as evidenced by the clinically meaningful improvements in repigmentation shown in the pivotal trials and the potential benefits it may bring for my patients.”

Incyte expects to submit a marketing application for ruxolitinib cream for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with vitiligo to the FDA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given ruxolitinib cream a European Marketing Authorization Application (MAA).

In September 2021 ruxolitinib cream was approved by the FDA for the short-term and non-continuous treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.

Data like this and more are being presented at the 2021 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference for Pas & NPs this weekend November 12 to 14.

An interesting thread has recently appeared on Reddit. It covers the concept of the Digital Linear Voltage Regulator (DLVR) which might be used with the upcoming Intel Raptor Lake CPU series.

Intel Raptor Lake Digital Linear Voltage Regulator Source: VideoCardz

The thread actually redirects to patent hunter Underfox who discovered that Intel had plans for DLVR since January 2020 at least but the patent was not published till July 8th this year. This is not the first time we are hearing about DLVR though as the acronym had already appeared in a leaked slide that we posted exclusively back in March 2021 except at the time we had no idea exactly what it meant.

Power supply architecture with digital linear VR clamp Source: Intel

So as it turns out DLVR stands for Digital Linear Voltage Regulator and it is explained by Intel in a patent called “Digital Linear Regulator Clamping Method and Apparatus”. The document claims that by placing an additional voltage regulator in parrel to the primary regulator for instance on a motherboard the power consumption of the processor core can be lowered. This power delivery modification is relatively cheap to implement and has low complexity of tuning the document explains.

Intel researchers claim that it is important to determine input voltage for the regulator in order to account for sudden loading requirements for the SoC CPU or GPU. It is said that higher than the necessary voltage for the regulator will generate more heat and power consumption. There are several factors that cause this increased voltage mainly motherboard load-line (LL) and maximum processor current requirement but also inaccuracy in motherboards voltage regulator. By implementing digital-LVR in parrel to the primary voltage regulator the CPU core input voltage is lower and as a result power consumption is reduced.

Core voltage drop and power benefit of DLVR Source: Intel

Intel researchers have concluded that DLVR can reduce CPU voltage by 160mV which translates to about a 20% to 25% drop in CPU power consumption. A 21% of voltage drop on the CPU translates to approximately 7% performance gain.

With all this in mind it appears that Intel 13th Gen Core series codenamed Raptor Lake (launching for both desktop and mobile devices) will not only increase the core count (16 Atom cores) but also provide improvements to CPU cache LPDDR5X memory support and performance and power efficiency gains due to new Digital Linear Voltage Regulator. Some of the features may require an upgrade to Intel 700 series motherboards though.

Both benchmarks have been criticized in the past for showing perceived bias toward Intel SKUs though.

4 Reviews

The Intel Core i9-12900KF chip which comes without the burden of an iGPU has found itself topping both the PassMark CPU Mark chart for desktop CPUs and the UserBenchmark chart for average bench. The former benchmark had been headed by Apple Silicon for many months before Alder Lake’s release with the Intel Core i9-12900K finally ending M1-related dominance at the top. Now that Intel processor has been replaced by its “F” variant and there are also new appearances for the i7-12700K and i7-12700KF at the top end of the single-thread performance chart. All five of the leading Alder Lake chips manage scores that break the 4000-point barrier.

Over at UserBenchmark there is an even better picture painted for Alder Lake which will come as no surprise to anyone who is familiar with the benchmark. However our last report detailed how three “K” processors had tentatively grabbed the top spots based on very few samples. Now the Intel Core i9-12900KF leads with an average bench of 120% while hundreds of i9-12900K i7-12700K and i5-12600K samples have apparently been tested to cement their lofty positions. They are joined in the top six places by the Intel Core i7-12700KF and the Intel Core i5-12600KF.

Alder Lake appears to have been a positive release for Intel which was needed considering how much ground Team Blue has given up to AMD since the rise of Zen microarchitecture. However UserBenchmark is notoriously Ryzen-unfriendly with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X down in 16th place as the best performer on this site from Team Red. PassMark has also had issues with Ryzen processors when they were practically wiped out from its charts in 2020 after the version 10 update was introduced. AMD will not pull any punches with its Zen 4 desktop parts (“Raphael”) so it will be fascinating to see how these two benchmarks process the ensuing results for Ryzen 7000.

The White House has reportedly discouraged an #Intel plan to increase chip production in China over security concerns according to a new report.

Intel has proposed using a facility in Chengdu China to make silicon wafers. According to Bloomberg the production could kick off by the end of 2022 and could help mitigate supply chain issues.

Bloomberg reports that the Biden administration strongly discouraged the plan. Although the White House is working to alleviate supply crunches it's also working to bring critical component construction back to the U.S.

Reportedly the administration is currently mulling whether to place restrictions on investments into China. A spokesperson for the White House said the administration is ""very focused on preventing China from using U.S. technologies know-how and investment to develop state-of-the-art capabilities.""

In a statement to Bloomberg Intel said that it remains open to other potential solutions that could help meet the high demand for essential semiconductor components.

""Intel and the Biden administration share a goal to address the ongoing industrywide shortage of microchips and we have explored a number of approaches with the U.S. government. Our focus is on the significant ongoing expansion of our existing semiconductor manufacturing operations and our plans to invest tens of billions of dollars in new wafer fabrication plants in the U.S. and Europe"" Intel said

Following the discussions with administration officials Intel has no plans to move forward with its China production plans sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2NvbXBhcmlzb24vOTA3NTIvaW50ZWwtY29yZS1pOS0xMjkwMGstdnMtY29yZS1pOS0xMTkwMGstYWxkZXItbGFrZS1hbmQtcm9ja2V0LWxha2UtY3B1cy1mYWNlLW9mZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: 'Alder Lake' and 'Rocket Lake' CPUs Face Off,"Table of Contents Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Specs and Architecture Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Platforms and Compatibility Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Productivity Performance Ryzen Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Gaming Performance The Verdict: Intel Gets Some of Its Swagger Back

Intel's November 2021 launch of its first 12th Generation Core desktop CPUs (code-named ""Alder Lake"") is now in the bag. Let's take some time to look at all the improvements that the company's flagship option the Core i9-12900K offers up over its 11th Generation ""Rocket Lake"" predecessor in the form of the Core i9-11900K.

Intel has made a whole host of changes and improvements to the platforms and the chips themselves between these two launches. But what are they all exactly and are they worth the price bump of a whole new platform to wade into Alder Lake? Let's soak ourselves in the details and find out.

Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Specs and Architecture

To start off our comparison between these two top-end chips let's take a peek at some base specs...

As you can see above there's already a bit of a problem trying to put these two head-to-head: there's a whole bunch of new cores to talk about!

With Alder Lake Intel is finally moving beyond the 14nm+++ lithography of 11th Gen Core. Its new Intel 7 Process (at its heart a 10nm manufacturing process) underpins in the Core i9-12900K what the company is calling its ""Performance cores"" (P-cores) and ""Efficiency cores"" (E-cores). This is part of 12th Gen Core's new ""big.LITTLE""-style architecture an approach which (in this specific chip) pairs eight P-cores with eight E-cores and divides the demands of your PC across them depending on the task at hand. (This is why we see the core/thread disparity; only the eight P-cores are Hyper-Threaded in this new chip design for two threads per core.)

For example if you're playing a game while talking to your friends on Discord the load of the game will be handled by the P-cores while the job of processing Discord is sent to the E-cores. This is all done through intelligent scheduling in Windows 11 via what Intel is calling its Thread Director service. The company says it plans to make this tech available only for that operating system. No Windows 10-based Thread Director is set for release.

Meanwhile the eight cores (regular ol' cores you're used to no new definitions needed here) for the $539-list Intel Core i9-11900K are based on an umpteenth revision of Intel's 14nm lithography. The Core i9-11900K as well as the rest of 11th Generation chips marks the end of a long affair with 14nm and shows the process' age in both specs and performance.

That $50 savings compared to the Core i9-12900K may look enticing at first but once you do the math on how many cores you're getting for the cost the equation falls back into 12th Gen's favor assuming you can find the chip for close to list price.

WINNER: Intel Core i9-12900K in process specs and price-per-core

Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Platforms and Compatibility

Next up platform compatibility. You can take a deep dive into all the newness on offer from Intel in our explainer on the Z690 platform. But for those who just want the basics let's run through a quick primer.

Intel's new 12th Gen chips come with a change to another new motherboard socket LGA 1700 as well as the new Z690 chipset for a refreshed offering of motherboards. This is an upgrade from Z590 on 11th Gen (largely considered a dead-end platform by this point) and it brings with it a whole host of improvements that may or may not be relevant to you depending on what you do with your PC.

The key upgrades between the two platforms include more PCI Express (PCIe) lanes as well as those lanes being upgraded from the PCIe 4.0 spec up to PCIe 5.0. (That said PCIe 5.0 SSDs are only in the preview stage at the moment.) The new boards also bring with them support for DDR5 RAM (though some alternately support old-style DDR4) as well as XMP 3.0 (Intel's Extreme Memory Profiler service for overclockers) and Dynamic Memory Boost Technology.

Overall many of these improvements won't mean much to your average gamer or productivity hound. However if you're a serious overclocker Intel has integrated a litany of new ways to control how your chip performs under pressure especially when pushed to its limits.

The only area where 12th Generation lacks in relation to platforms is on cost of adoption compared with what you can find for Intel's 11th Gen chips. At this mid-November writing there are no 600-class midrange or budget motherboards in the typical ""H"" or ""B"" series on shelves for 12th Gen chips though we should expect to see more info on those in the coming months. For now if you want to go the more cost-conscious route an Intel Core i9-11900K will have a lot more motherboard options on offer by default...and maybe you have some DDR4 memory on hand already.

TIE: Intel Core i9-12900K wins on new features and added flexibility Intel Core i9-11900K wins on cost of adoption

Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Productivity Performance

So with eight more cores onboard (albeit less powerful ones) it should be a total blowout for the Intel Core i9-12900K on content creation right? Let's dive into the benchmarks to see what's what...

(All of these runs were performed on respective Windows 10 testbeds.)

Overall there's little contest to be shown here; overwhelmingly the Intel Core i9-12900K with its 16 available cores and 24 available threads beats out the Core i9-11900K with its eight cores and 16 threads in content creation. Not too many surprises there!

However as you can see there are still a few kinks that Intel has yet to work out when testing in Windows 10 such as in our POV-Ray run. It should be noted however that those aren't down to outright diminished performance as much as they are the idiosyncrasies that come with using an Intel Core i9-12900K on a Windows 10 system. Regardless of that small slip the Core i9-12900K still comes out looking roses compared to what the Core i9-11900K posted in the same runs.

WINNER: Intel Core i9-12900K for Windows 11 users

Ryzen Core i9-12900K vs. Core i9-11900K: Gaming Performance

Last but not least we arrive at gaming performance for the Core i9-12900K versus the i9-11900K the former of which Intel has dubbed the ""World's Best Gaming Processor."" How did those claims bear out in testing? Let's find out...

We tested the CPUs here on their respective platforms in Windows 10 using a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti card. As you can see from our gaming runs above things are actually quite close between the two processors despite 12th Gen's ostensible platform and newness advantage. Between the two the difference falls nearly within the margin of error for all tests aside from 3DMark and that score is one that more accurately reflects the system advantage as a whole rather than just the performance of the chip on its own.

If you're having a hard time picking between these two choices on gaming alone the platform-adoption cost of 12th Gen may be the deciding factor. The performance difference is negligible enough to keep 11th Gen chips in the running for gamers and the few extra bucks you'll have left over to spend on a new graphics card might seal the deal.

We need to close out this section with a caveat: Intel's 12th Gen processors may not work on all games regardless of your operating system. During our testing we found that our Assassin's Creed: Valhalla benchmark title wouldn't boot in. Only after consulting with Intel did we find out this is due to an issue with the DRM service Denuvo which confuses the two core types of 12th Gen as two separate systems. You can read all about the issue as well as look through a list of the affected titles and their timetables for an applied fix in our full breakdown here.

TIE: Core i9-12900K wins on outright performance Core i9-11900K stays competitive on cost of adoption

The Verdict: Intel Gets Some of Its Swagger Back

By most of the measures we've gathered here today it's clear that the move to 10nm and Intel 7 Process has done wonders for the company's competitiveness in content creation on chips like the Core i9-12900K versus previous generations. But it all comes at a cost.

Until we see more Alder Lake-compatible motherboards outside of the pricey Z690 chipset family being released ownership of any Intel 12th Gen chips will come at a premium. This rule proves itself out further if you plan on using DDR5 RAM like we tested with here. (As noted DDR4-compatible Z690 boards are also available though not often at much of a reduced price versus their DDR5 counterparts. See our guide to the initial wave of Z690 boards.)

Intel's Core i9-11900K may not have been our No. 1 choice for desktop gaming or content creation CPUs when it launched. But in comparison to 12th Gen and the Core i9-12900K at least in segments like gaming the chip remains a cost-competitive option. With more platforms to choose from its gaming performance keeps relative pace with Intel's newest and it has the added advantage of remaining compatible with all Denuvo-protected games.

If you want the best non-HEDT Intel processor out there right now for content creation and most games regardless of price the Intel Core i9-12900K is your best option of the bunch. But if you're more focused on keeping your budget in check and plan to spend most of your time gaming the Intel Core i9-11900K is still a perfectly viable option for your next build with its competitive gaming frame rates and cheaper supporting components in the form of motherboards and DDR4 RAM.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy93aW5kb3dzLTExLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLW92ZXJ3aGVsbXMtbGludXgtb24taW50ZWwtMTJ0aC1nZW4tYWxkZXItbGFrZS1zLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrLXBjL9IBdGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvYW1wL3dpbmRvd3MtMTEtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Utb3ZlcndoZWxtcy1saW51eC1vbi1pbnRlbC0xMnRoLWdlbi1hbGRlci1sYWtlLXMtY29yZS1pOS0xMjkwMGstcGMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Windows 11 performance overwhelms Linux on Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake-S Core i9-12900K PC,"When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works

Back at its Architecture Day 2021 event when Intel shared the core design details of its Alder Lake CPU architecture the firm stated that Windows 11 was optimized in a way to best take advantage of the Alder Lake's Performance Hybrid architecture and the new Thread Director technology that helps Windows 11 task scheduling.

To test those claims and see how well Alder Lake fares on Windows 11 against Linux Phoronix decided to do a deep-dive and benchmarked the recently launched Core i9-12900K from the Alder Lake-S family which is Intel's 12th gen desktop flagship part.

The testbed consisted of:

Core i9-12900K

ROG STRIX Z690E GAMING WIFI

64GB Corsair DDR5-4400

Windows 11 Pro Build 22000

You can find more details on the testbed here.

Overall the 12900K has put up an impressive showing on the Windows platform managing to beat out the Linux systems in most of the tests. While there were many more tests (a total of 104) conducted we have only shown here the most interesting results.

First we have a few browser and web application benchmarks using Selenium:

After that we have a couple of AV1 decoding and encoding tests respectively.

Finally performances in a decompression test and a large data visualization test have been provided.

Out of the total 104 Phoronix says the Windows 11 system came out on top in 45.2% of the tests. The publication has also noted that a previous Tiger Lake-based CPU was slower against Ubuntu compared to Alder Lake kind of validating Intel's claim that the architecture carries Windows 11 specific optimizations at least at the moment when compared with Linux.

You can find the full performance review with a lot more benchmark numbers on Phoronix's website linked in the source link below.

The Nile. Mt. Sinai. Ice hockey.

Warren County is helping to bring international hockey to Egypt.

Matt Gernold a Warren County Adult Probation offier joined the Friendship League because it sounded like a good way to use his interest in hockey for good.

“The Friendship League is a sports tourism organization that uses sport to foster cross-cultural engagement between otherwise distant communities” Gernold said.

It’s not just hockey. But in Gernold’s case “They identify organizations in unusual destinations that are trying to grow the game of hockey” he said. “They’ve gone to North Korea Turkmenistan Kenya.”

Gernold’s team including members from Japan Sweden Canada and the United States went to Cairo Egypt in October.

“We participated in the first ever international ice hockey tournament in Egyptian history” Gernold said.

The team’s members represented a variety of skill levels. Gernold a goaltender played collegiate hockey at Mercyhurst University for three years. “I still play in the adult hockey league in Jamestown” he said.

It was the perfect opportunity.

“Egypt has always been on the top of the bucket list” he said. “I couldn’t turn down the opportunity.”

The Friendship League was one of six teams in the tournament. There were teams from Detroit – the Duster Line and Germany. One team was made up of Egyptians. The other two were comprised of players who were of Egyptian heritage.

“It was a friendly tournament to show people in Egypt what hockey is about” he said. The guys on the ice knew what they were doing. “The level of play was a lot higher than I expected.”

Gernold didn’t have as much free time as some of the other players. He was the only goalie on his team. “The Detroit team and the German team didn’t bring a goalie” he said. They asked Gernold to mind the net for them when his team wasn’t on the ice.

Bringing hockey to a place that doesn’t have it meant improvising the facility.

“They have an ice rink in Genena Mall – literally in the middle of a mall” Gernold said. “Our locker room was in a storage room. When we got dressed we had to walk probably 50 yards through the mall.”

“You get some strange looks walking through the mall in full goalie gear” he said.

The mall was not a temperature-regulated arena. The ice conditions were not ideal. “In the mall it was about 80 degrees” Gernold said. “That was rough. The ice started out rough and it was pretty flooded at the end.”

The rink was not intended for hockey. The ice was about half as long and half as wide as a regulation hockey rink.

They made do. “It was three-on-three – three skaters and a goalie” he said.

“We brought and donated regulation goals” he said. That was another part of the mission.

“We were all asked to bring old equipment to donate to help build the sport” Gernold said. “They definitely need it more than I do.”

The Friendship League team and the German team each played semifinal games against the Egyptian heritage teams. Gernold was in net for both but didn’t get to the all-Egyptian heritage finals.

Still he was a medalist. “Thanks to the Egyptian Ministry all the participants came home with solid silver medals.”

Competition was not the primary goal. “One of the days we had kids from an orphanage come to our game” Gernold said. “We took them out of the ice and were able to teach them how to skate.”

The players did not feel any danger he said. “Everyone that we came across was nice hospitable super friendly.”

The players were famous enough to justify an armed escort though. “We ended up getting press coverage from many countries” Gernold said.

During down times the players went out and saw the sights. “We went to the Church of St. Simon. We went on the dinner cruise down the Nile. We saw the Pyramids of Giza and Saqqara. We saw the Ancient Civilizations Museum. We went camping in the White Desert. The ancient mosques were beautiful. I rode a camel through the streets of Giza.”

Some of the players chose add-on experiences. “They had an extension – Mt. Sinai Dahab the Blue Hole” he said. “A couple of people went skydiving over the pyramids.”

He recommends the Friendship League for those interested in travel sports and building cross-cultural engagement. “They’re an awesome group to go with” Gernold said. “Highly recommend.”

“It was definitely a humbling experience to be able to go over there and interact with people and help build the sport” he said.

He plans to go again but not at the next opportunity. That is in April with Ecuador as the destination.

But he is excited about the one after that. “Mongolia in October… definitely going to that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The first-time developer may have just cleared his biggest sale yet — convincing the city of St. Paul to back a 62-unit $18.7 million affordable-housing development just east of downtown.

For Opara the president founder and chief executive officer of the JO Cos. it’s been a long four years. The licensed Realtor sat down with St. Paul City Council member Jane Prince in 2017 to pick her brain about potential sites ripe for new housing. Prince suggested vacant city-owned land off Payne Avenue and East Seventh Street almost across the street from the Minnesota Music Cafe.

“I thought wow 520 Payne is such a phenomenal gateway location” Prince said. “It is a gateway property to Payne Avenue to the East Seventh Street business district. It is right down the hill from Metro State University.”

Opara a Central High School and Augsburg University graduate who came to the U.S. from Nigeria as an infant and was raised on Rice Street in St. Paul drove by the site the same day and then called Prince to confirm he was hooked. “I always say St. Paul raised me” said Opara in an interview Thursday. “I visited the site and I saw the Hollows. I knew exactly what was going to be built.”

CHALLENGING YEARS

What he didn’t know at the time was that easements airport flight paths cell towers financing challenges a recession and a pandemic would put years of potential stumbles in his path.

Those were overcome in part with the help of Prince and city council President Amy Brendmoen who took pains to introduce him to neighboring property owners as well as city staff wrangling the intricacies of tax increment financing.

Opara took his mission personally. He recalled moving his father — who had suffered a debilitating stroke that atrophied half his body many years prior — from one affordable-housing complex to the next. The move to a better property management company seemed to brighten his dad’s spirits in the weeks before his death in 2018.

“I’m really thankful for the support the city of St. Paul has given to a first-time developer” said Opara addressing the seven members of the city council on Wednesday during a meeting of the St. Paul Housing and Redevelopment Authority. “This is a transformative project. … I’m really looking forward to hopefully closing before the end of the year and beginning construction.”

He plans to develop “The Hollows” — the JO Cos.’ inaugural project — on an empty lot that the Housing and Redevelopment Authority has owned for nearly 20 years in the somewhat under-the-radar Railroad Island/Swede Hollow neighborhood.

After years of trying to make the numbers work Opara expects to move forward with a four-story apartment building that will include at least a handful of “deeply affordable” one-bedroom apartments renting for less than $600 a month a rarity for new construction. The site will include 29 underground parking spaces and 16 surface stalls.

In 2003 the city acquired the 520 Payne Ave. property which is located across the street from Fire Station No. 4 for $655000 from Standard Truck.

“This location is really a downtown neighborhood” said Brendmoen on Wednesday noting the city has invested in a nearby overlook as well as bicycle access into Railroad Island and improved traffic flow. “It’s a phenomenal place and I think it was kind of hiding. We’ve done our best to daylight that. … This is a big deal.”

TAX INCREMENT FINANCING

The stew or alphabet soup of funding sources that will support the Hollows is almost dizzying.

It includes $3.2 million in tax increment financing — about two-thirds of it “pooled TIF” funds generated off-site within special property tax districts including $700000 from around Spruce Tree Centre at Snelling and University avenues and $1.5 million from Carondelet Village in Highland Park. In other words the Hollows will be able to use money that would have otherwise gone towards its own property taxes — as well as TIF revenue from other projects across the city — to pay off certain development costs over 25 years.

“TIF can be controversial sometimes but I think this is a really good use of tax increment financing” said city council member Chris Tolbert who chairs the city’s Housing and Redevelopment Authority.

Prince a frequent critic of tax increment financing said building new affordable housing would not be possible without a mountain of different funding sources. “TIF has become a really important piece of that puzzle” she said.

All 62 units will technically qualify as affordable housing though housing advocates have pointed out that “affordable” is a relative term. In 2021 the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) determined the median household income for a family of four in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan statistical area which spans 15 counties was $105000. That’s nearly double the median household income in St. Paul which is around $58000.

The Hollows is slated to include 32 studios and alcove units with monthly rents of about $1100. In addition 11 one-bedroom units will be priced at $1180. Six units each of them two-bedroom apartments will be priced at $1417. All of these units will be income-limited to households earning no more than 60 percent area median income which roughly translates to a household income limit of $63000 based on the HUD figures.

Eight one-bedroom units will be priced somewhat below 60 percent area median income at $1078 which is considered fair market value.

A FEW ‘DEEPLY AFFORDABLE’ UNITS

The building will also include a few units of what’s considered “deeply affordable” housing a rare feat for new development. That totals five apartments each of them one-bedroom priced at $590. Those five units will be targeted to households earning no more than 30 percent of area median income which translates to a household income limit of $31500. City officials and housing advocates have applauded their inclusion noting new housing at this lower price-point has proven to be elusive in St. Paul.

On Wednesday the city council approved $3.2 million in both new tax increment financing and “pooled TIF” dollars the sale of the vacant lot to the JO Cos. for $364900 and $9.1 million in conduit housing revenue bonds issued through the city.

Financing sources will include low-income housing tax credits a deferred developer fee of $1 million a Ramsey County grant for $209000 and a Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development grant for $81000.

“This has been challenging to put together. There have been any number of obstacles related to the site that had nothing to do with (city Planning and Economic Development) and nothing to do with Johnny” said Prince on Wednesday calling the location ideal for those looking for an urban living experience. “I could not be more excited.”

Get Used to It.,"Like most people in the developed world Kirsten Gjesdal had long taken for granted her ability to order whatever she needed and then watch the goods arrive without any thought about the factories container ships and trucks involved in delivery.

Not anymore.

At her kitchen supply store in Brookings S.D. Ms. Gjesdal has given up stocking place mats having wearied of telling customers that she can only guess when more will come. She recently received a pot lid she had purchased eight months earlier. She has grown accustomed to paying surcharges to cover the soaring shipping costs of the goods she buys. She has already placed orders for Christmas items like wreaths and baking pans.

“It’s nuts” she said. “It’s definitely not getting back to normal.”

The challenges confronting Ms. Gjesdal’s shop Carrot Seed Kitchen are a testament to the breadth and persistence of the chaos roiling the global economy as manufacturers and the shipping industry contend with an unrelenting pandemic.

Delays product shortages and rising costs continue to bedevil businesses large and small. And consumers are confronted with an experience once rare in modern times: no stock available and no idea when it will come in."

So where to eat before or after a game or concert?

At SoFi Stadium chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo of Jon & Vinny’s are consulting on the culinary program. They recently worked with Jimmy Kimmel on creating a special limited-time roast beef sandwich for the Dec. 18 Jimmy Kimmel L.A. Bowl.

And next year the 300-acre Hollywood Park in which SoFi is located will debut an outdoor mall with a slew of new dining spots. These will include a new location of Sky’s Gourmet Tacos led by restaurateur Barbara “Sky” Burrell; a new offering from Lynne Weaver the co-founder of Inglewood’s Three Weavers Brewing Company; and a restaurant to be called Lovefull from Peace Love Reedburg the South Los Angeles entrepreneur behind Grilled Fraiche restaurant in Hyde Park.

In the meantime here are 11 Inglewood restaurants to try now.

Banadir Somali Restaurant

137 Arbor Vitae Street

HBO’s Insecure creator and star Issa Rae has praised Banadir Somali Restaurant and not without reason. Individuals looking for some unique East African food experiences will love the rice platters with meat options including chicken lamb goat and fish. All of the main entrees come with a banana and tea as well.

Bruno’s Burgers

450 E. Manchester Blvd.

There’s nothing guilt-free about Bruno’s Burgers a classic California burger joint. Besides favorites like the Colos Burger which features a beef patty and pastrami the chili cheese fries are divine.

Coni’Seafood

3544 W. Imperial Highway

For a little over 30 years Coni’Seafood has been considered the most unique seafood restaurant offering in Inglewood. Come for dishes (including the ceviche appetizers) inspired by the Mexican state Nayarit.

Dulan’s Soul Food Kitchen

202 E. Manchester Blvd.

Though Dulan’s On Crenshaw may have attracted celebrities and politicians alike the original Inglewood location is still popular among locals. As with anything bearing the Dulan’s name soul food in Los Angeles County doesn’t get any better than this from the fried chicken to the collard greens and black-eyed peas.

Little Belize Restaurant

217 E. Nutwood St.

Popular dishes at Little Belize include the panades tamales and the oxtail stew with salad and fried plantains on the side.

Martin’s Cocina y Cantina

162 N. La Brea Ave.

The Martin family has several Mexican eateries in the city including its more upscale Martin’s Cocina y Cantina with classic dishes served alongside sushi and steaks.

According to Christian Martin they’ve seen spikes due to both Sofi Stadium games as well as performances from The Forum. “We saw a huge spike from our traditional traffic who come during the week but we already practiced when The Forum was opening and we would be slammed at the other restaurants” said Martin. “We knew what we were getting into but we didn’t know with both The Forum and Sofi Stadium opened.”

Once the Hollywood Park shopping center project is complete sometime next year the Martin brand will open Antojitos Martin a grab-and-go dining concept there.

Randy’s Donuts & Chinese Food

210 N. Market St.

Some of the area’s best cheap Chinese food can be found at Randy’s from fried rice to chicken sticks.

The Serving Spoon

1403 Centinela Ave.

The Serving Spoon is so popular that when it nearly closed last year because of the pandemic Rams player Andrew Whitworth and his wife Melissa donated $50000 to help keep it open along with other donors. Both breakfast and lunch menus offer incredible portions for a reasonable price. Shaquille O’Neal and Magic Johnson are also fans and even Stevie Wonder has a drink named after him there.

Stuff I Eat

114 N. Market St.

Stuff I Eat owner-chef Babette Davis Amaechina who was featured in an episode of HBO’s Insecure offers vegan takes on traditional soul food and Tex-Mex plus beet lemonade and plant-based kids’ menu.

Sunday Gravy

1122 Centinela Ave.

Jino’s Pizza had a 50-year history in Inglewood but after owner Ahmad Bashirian retired his children Sol and Ghazi rebranded it as Italian eatery Sunday Gravy spotlighting ingredients sourced from Inglewood. Since SoFi opened in September says Sol “We’ve seen a lot more foot traffic.”

“What we see more is during concerts than anything and understandably so” he continues. “Since it’s a new stadium I think many people want to try the food that’s available there. I will say that when there are concerts at the Forum we see a lot of individuals coming before the show. If a football game ends earlier we will get some foot traffic as well.”

The Wood BBQ & Sports Lounge

129 N. Market Street

Though Phillips and Woody’s are the city’s undisputed homestyle barbecue kings The Wood has a more upscale vibe. Great for pregame drinks.

Shares of robotic-assisted surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical have been on a tear recently up some 33% so far in 2021 and more than quadrupling over the past five years. After such an epic run is it too late to buy Intuitive Surgical stock? Well if long-term growth is what you’re after this proven winner in the health care space is worth considering.

More than two decades into its development of robotic-assisted surgery Intuitive’s management has said that its da Vinci X and Xi models now have over 70 clinical uses ranging from general procedures to specialty uses such as transoral surgery. Tens of thousands of surgeons use da Vinci surgical systems worldwide with more than 6500 systems installed in hospitals and surgery centers. The newer single-port system is starting to be placed in the U.S. and South Korea while the new Ion machine used for lung biopsies has 98 units placed so far.

Intuitive has plenty of room to continue expanding its reach in the next decade and it’s likely to get a lift as the effects of the pandemic continue to ease. Intuitive’s recent stock price with a price-to-earnings ratio near 78 reflects high expectations. But given the steady rate of sales growth and an even faster-growing bottom line it’s arguably a reasonable price tag for long-term believers. (The Motley Fool owns shares of Intuitive Surgical and has recommended Intuitive Surgical shares and options.)

Ask the Fool

From L.R. in Warren Ohio: When I buy a company’s stock does the company get the money? And what do I really get?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: You may assume you’re buying the shares from the company but when you buy stock on the open market you’re not. Companies that are publicly traded have already sold shares in themselves when they “went public” via an initial public offering. After that the shares are traded on the open market between investors. Someone who thinks a stock is a good value will buy shares from someone who is unloading their shares. The company doesn’t get the proceeds from the trading.

Companies do care about their stock though because a falling stock price looks bad and can make them vulnerable to being bought out by other companies. A rising stock price meanwhile means insiders with stock options or shares of stock in the company can get richer. It can also allow the company to buy another company with fewer shares of its stock.

Owning stock in a company means you’re an actual part-owner in the business entitled to share in its success.

From C.C. in Phoenix: What do “tulips” refer to financially speaking?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: Just as we experienced an internet (or “dot-com”) stock bubble bursting in 2000 causing many stock prices to plunge people in Holland in the mid-1600s also experienced a bubble bursting: one tied to tulip bulb prices.

This “tulipmania” is one of the earliest documented cases of a speculative investing frenzy. Supposedly certain tulip bulbs were worth more than $750000 (in today’s value) and some investors mortgaged their homes to buy tulip bulbs. As you might expect it didn’t end well.

The Fool’s School

You may not have heard of Benjamin Graham but he holds a place on the roster of great investors and was Warren Buffett’s mentor. So he knew a thing or two about investing — and he shared his insights. Here are some instructive quotations from his classic book The Intelligent Investor (Harper Business $25).

(Collins Business / AP)

“The investor’s chief problem — and even his worst enemy — is likely to be himself.” Many investors jump into the stock market only to quickly bail out as soon as it slumps. There are gobs of other costly mistakes investors make when they haven’t taken the time to learn about investing and don’t control their impulses.

“The distinction between investment and speculation in common stocks has always been a useful one and its disappearance is cause for concern.” This is indeed a critical distinction to understand. If you’re buying stocks simply because someone recommended them without really understanding how the underlying companies make money you’re speculating. You’re also speculating if you’re jumping in and out of stocks. Savvy investors study companies and know what they’re buying into — and why. They also aim to hang on for a long time to give the companies time to grow.

Graham distilled “the secret of sound investment” into these three words: “margin of safety.” Demanding a margin of safety when you invest means aiming to buy stocks at prices well below what you deem them to be worth. As Graham further explained: “The margin of safety is always dependent on the price paid. It will be large at one price small at some higher price nonexistent at some still higher price.”

“There are no sure and easy paths to riches on Wall Street or anywhere else.” Average investors can get rich over long periods by investing in broad-market index funds but it takes time — and perseverance.

Buffett has called The Intelligent Investor “by far the best book on investing ever written.” If you want to improve your investing you might check it out.

My Dumbest Investment

From T.D. online: My dumbest investment was investing $10000 in Hertz after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Robinhood traders had piled into the stock driving it higher. I got drawn in and bought; by the next day it had crashed by 80% or so at which point I sold. Never again.

Advertisement

The Fool responds: In general seeing the words “Chapter 11″ near any company’s name is a big red flag. Companies file for Chapter 11 when they’re in hot water and having trouble keeping the lights on. Many never emerge from it successfully while others that do emerge typically do so after having reorganized themselves leaving shareholders with little or nothing.

Hertz’s recent experience played out differently though. The company declared bankruptcy in May 2020 after the pandemic had severely curtailed travel. Savvy investors knew that as the company reorganized and got on firmer footing it would pay its creditors first including bondholders and that holders of common stock would be last in line.

Many investors piled into Hertz shares though plenty coming from Robinhood a stock-trading business with many young and inexperienced investors. Shares were volatile surging and plunging sharply. A group of investors won a bid to supply Hertz with billions in funding and the company emerged from Chapter 11 at the end of June 2021 without wiping out existing shareholders. That’s not the norm though.

People doubted me when I started using “mini-mills” to make new steel from post-consumer scrap metal via electricity. But it worked. Today based in Charlotte N.C. and with a market value recently near $31 billion I’m North America’s most diversified steel and steel products company as well as its largest recycler employing more than 27000 people. My offerings include carbon and alloy steel beams precision castings fasteners grating wire joists electrical conduit metal building systems and much more.

Next year he’ll be continuing that mentality in a different lot. Hill was unanimously named superintendent of Houghton-Portage Township Schools during Tuesday’s board meeting.

Hill has been principal at Houghton Elementary School since 2013. As he did in that role he will replace Doreen Kramer who is retiring at the end of December.

Before coming to Houghton Hill spent five years as principal at various schools in Menominee.

Prior to the vote members praised Hill for his leadership style and his connection with the student who he high-fives at the entrance each day.

“Eight years ago I saw the high-fives and the first bumps and I was like ‘I give this guy six months and he’s going to be sitting in his office'” said Vice President Amanda Massaway. “I’m glad to say I was wrong.”

Hill said he was humbled by the hire and the praise for him.

“That kind of positive talk doesn’t happen” he said. “I’ve always been lucky to work with great people and I think that’s a testament to people at the elementary school. I know I’m filling big shoes. We have a great superintendent there now and I have a lot of work to do to earn trust and be as competent as she is.”

Hill becomes the fourth superintendent in a row to have previously been elementary school principal. Board President Nels Christopherson said as leader of a separate building the position has proven to be a good training ground for district leaders.

The hire is contingent on mutual agreement of his employment contract. If all goes as planned Hill will start in the position Jan. 3. His first major challenge: finding his successor as elementary school principal.

“There’s a lot of really qualified people in our district and I know there’s people out there who are smarter than I am” he said. “We’re going to really work to find the right person the right fit for that building.”

Hill was the only applicant for the position. He answered 16 questions from the board Monday night on topics such as how to build consensus or programs he has initiated to address all student learning styles.

Someone once told him “Tradition is Latin for ‘Nobody had any good ideas'” Hill said. He talked about additions such as a partnership with the University of Oregon on reading instruction that had led to gains among students.

“I think as educational leaders we need to keep finding the next things we can try especially if teachers are excited about it” he said.

Asked about how he incorporated data as principal Hill discussed the steps the school took to address a reading gap between girls and boys. They found that all children and particularly boys benefitted from reading non-fiction. For the past six or seven years the school has also built in time during the day for students to read.

“We’ve seen that gap close and we’ve seen all of our scores go up” he said.

A Copper Country native Hill attended Central Michigan University where he majored in education. He student-taught at Iron Mountain High School before his first teaching job in McBain Michigan near Cadillac. He taught eighth grade science and coached four sports.

When the principal who hired him became superintendent in Menominee he asked Hill to apply for an assistant principal position at the high school. After three years as elementary principal he became principal of the middle high and alternative high school.

“I really recruited Houghton” he said. “Houghton was where I wanted to be. I was looking for opportunities here where I was going to be the principal or that’s where my kids are going to go to school.

This level towpath was once used by mules to pull canal boats to the headgates which makes it a unique slice of Georgia history. Hikers can stroll the same towpaths that were used decades ago and see how far transportation has come since then. Plus did we mention this entire trail is a wildlife paradise?!

Keep in mind there are elevation changes along this trail and it is mostly unpaved so it may not be suitable for everyone.

Having worked at the Minnesota bank for nearly two decades he'd seen other small community banks consolidate.

Established in 1902 the First National Bank of Buhl has just two branches one in Buhl and a main office in nearby Mountain Iron. Its 11 employees serve roughly 900 customers with some $30 million in assets. Banking in the area is concentrated according to a recent OCC filing: Just two institutions Wells Fargo and US Bank control some 50% of the market where Buhl is located.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""With trying to keep up with regulations and the cost of software and everything else a sale was a matter of time. It was destiny at some point"" Peterson who took over as CEO of the First National Bank of Buhl in 2013.

Peterson had two main concerns when the time came to make a deal. That Buhl's employees got to keep their jobs. And that the bank's mascot Penny — taking the form of either a 9-foot-tall styrofoam pig originally made for a local parade or a pink Volkswagen modified by Peterson to resemble a pig — got to stay.

""We've got a lot of customers from it"" Peterson said. ""They say 'You know what if you have a giant pig in your driveway I think I want to bank with you guys.'""

Penny the Pig stands watch outside the First National Bank of Buhl's branch in Mountain Iron Minnesota. First National Bank of Buhl

And while Peterson expected another bank would be the eventual landing spot for Buhl an unexpected buyer came along in January 2021: Brian Barnes founder and CEO of fintech unicorn M1 Finance.

Peterson was familiar with M1 from an account he had with the investment app but he was surprised to hear that a Chicago-based startup with $5 billion in assets was interested in Buhl.

""We joked that it was like the Jetsons meeting Mayberry"" Peterson said.

But in actuality the odd couple wasn't so odd.

As a fintech M1 doesn't have a national banking charter of its own instead partnering with banks like the Iowa-based Lincoln Savings Bank to offer checking and savings accounts.

For Buhl meanwhile Barnes brings both the capital necessary for tech upgrades and the experience of building a fintech from the ground up.

'He had to match the personality of the bank'

Barnes heard of Buhl from M1's human-resources head's spouse a lawyer who had represented an acquirer that had backed out of buying Buhl at the beginning of the pandemic. Buhl had already been through the contracting process and due diligence the lawyer told Barnes all it needed was a new name to fill in the blanks.

Buhl declined to disclose the failed acquirer.

Shortly after reaching out Barnes traveled from his home base of Chicago to visit Peterson at the bank's headquarters where the weather was -40F. Peterson gave him a tour of Buhl and Mountain Iron — with populations of roughly 1000 and 2900 respectively — introduced him to all the employees and walked him through opening a checking account.

After a month and a half of talks Peterson was reassured that M1 wouldn't swallow the bank whole but invest in Buhl's growth while keeping its small-town spirit — and Penny.

""He has grand ideas and he has the technology to do it but he's a very real person and it just felt right"" Peterson said. ""He had to match the personality of the bank. He's a very down-to-earth person.""

The deal — which took about six-and-a-half months to get approved by regulators — was announced in October in a blog post on M1's website.

The transaction was unique in that Barnes not M1 bought the First National Bank of Buhl. Because Barnes personally owns the the bank M1 can ""benefit from a new product feature perspective"" without having to go through a longer regulatory approval process that comes with a fintech becoming a bank holding company Barnes said.

It took LendingClub just shy of a year to close its acquisition of Radius Bank. SoFi's proposed acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp which was announced in March has still yet to be approved.

""Ideally M1 would have bought the bank but we just have a little bit of work to do before we're ready to bite that bullet and become the bank holding company"" Barnes said.

Barnes declined to disclose how much he paid for the bank but said it was in line with traditional bank valuations. In Buhl's case which had $2.6 million in equity capital at the end of the second quarter that would imply a sale value in the range of roughly $2.5 to $5 million.

Buhl will be a test case for new banking tools

When Peterson joined Buhl as its CFO in 2004 upgrading tech consisted of transitioning from ""green screens"" — computers with ancient operating systems — to PCs he said.

In the years since Peterson said the bank has grown its assets by more than three times from about $11 million to $30 million in the second quarter per FDIC data. It's a figure that ""on a grand scale isn't a lot but when you think about it in terms of what it started from that's quite a bit of growth"" he said.

For years however the First National Bank of Buhl confronted the same problem that many other community and regional lenders face across the country: It lacked the money to really go after the major tech upgrades that have come to define modern banking and financial technology.

""We were somewhat capital restrained for many years and you have to have some capital to jump into that arena"" Peterson said.

As one example Peterson pointed to Buhl's development of a mobile app for customers.

""That mobile app cost 20% of our annual income. That's expensive and we had a customer base of 900 customers. You're talking significant expense per customer to be able to do it"" Peterson said.

""We still do it but it just gets to the point where most small banks look at it and say 'I just don't think I can keep up with this'"" he added.

What's next for Penny's Crew

Now Barnes has come to Buhl promising a balance of both continuity and change. To start Buhl's employees — known as 'Penny's Crew' — now have new laptops high-speed internet and compliance tools Barnes said. According to Peterson the bank is following its normal schedule of raises but pay ""has been a little bit better"" since the acquisition.

Further down the line Barnes said he envisions working with Buhl to offer through M1 any sort of ""deposit product any payment product any lending product"" that might typically be offered by traditional banks through the fintech's app.

The First National Bank of Buhl's website now lists 13 open job opportunities added in recent days ranging from an assistant general counsel to a vice president of finance. For Buhl which has had roughly the same staff for the past six years the openings represent a more-than-doubling of the bank's current headcount.

Employees at Buhl also now have new avenues for career growth that might not have been previously possible at a bank of its size. ""This makes advancement opportunities for everybody because it's going to scale everything up considerably"" Peterson said.

""The unknown part there's always a fear. But from the other side too we're very open here. We've always been very open and everyone wants the ability to have some of the technology that we couldn't afford"" he added.

For his part Barnes was able to add one other sweetener into the deal when he purchased the First National Bank of Buhl. He said he is open to giving Penny a larger profile — literally.

""I told [Peterson] there's a marketing budget if he wants to make it bigger. There may be a bigger Penny at some point.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9yYXBpZGNpdHkvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLWdyb3Zlcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMTU0NzU5NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Groves Obituary (1946 - 2021) - Rapid City SD - Rapid City Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/rapidcity/name/william-groves-obituary?id=31547595 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9yYXBpZGNpdHkvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLWdyb3Zlcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMTU0NzU5NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Sean King for the Daily Herald

Prospect's Owen Walter took a crash course in Quarterback 101 this past week. And after his performance Saturday in the Class 7A quarterfinals the senior earned an A-plus.

Walter directed a ground-oriented Prospect offense that moved the ball and controlled the clock. The 11th-seeded Knights used that and a attacking defense to beat 19th-seeded Jacobs 35-21.

""The O-line and everyone had trust in me"" said Walter who had 19 carries for 137 yards. ""(Coach Dan) DeBeouf had trust in me. I was freaking out Monday and it was super difficult. It got easier and everyone was here to help me.""

DeBeouf said that Walter picked things up quickly.

""We had a whole new offense this week"" DeBeouf said. ""Owen is all heart and a team-first guy. He learned how to play quarterback in three days and obviously played real well tonight.""

Prospect (10-2) is making it first semifinal appearance since 2006. The Knights will play at 10th-seeded St. Rita next week. St. Rita (10-2) beat second-seeded Hononegah 36-16 Saturday.

Prospect got off to an incredibly fast start scoring 2 touchdowns less than a minute into the game.

The Knights scored on the third play from scrimmage when Matthew Raitano (13 carries 99 yards) broke off a 56-yard run right up the middle. Prospect opted for a trick play on the conversion and Jake Parisi took a direct snap and ran for 2 points and an 8-0 lead.

""When I saw that I was so happy"" Walter said. ""I told the guys in the huddle that we are scoring here. Then three plays later I saw the back of Raitano number 44 running to the end zone.""

On the first play from scrimmage the interior of the Prospect defensive line forced a fumble. An opportunistic Charlie Carroll scooped up the loose ball and ran 14 yards for a 15-0 lead.

""I came free off the line"" Carroll said. ""I picked it up and saw nobody behind me. It was awesome and surreal. There was nothing like it.""

After a defensive stop and short punt Prospect was back in business. When the Knights drive stalled Ben Sahakian added a 33-yard field goal to increase the lead to 18-0 with 7:15 left in the first quarter.

Jacobs (8-4) nearly used up the balance of the quarter to get its offense back on track. The Golden Eagles went 80 yards in 15 plays with Nasir Canty scoring on. 4-yard run to make it 18-7.

Sahakian would add a 40-yard field goal in the second quarter to make it 21-7 Prospect. The Knights then were able to increase their lead just before the end of the half.

After Jacobs fumbled the snap on the punt a subsequent incomplete pass gave Prospect the ball at the 24-yard line. Two plays later Bradley Vierneisel came off the bench and hooked up with Gavin Flanagan on a swing pass to the left side for a 20-yard touchdown and a 28-7 halftime lead.

Jacobs tried to rally to get back into the game. Ben Ludlum scored for the Golden Eagles on the first series of the second half on a 4-yard run to cut the lead to 28-14.

After a defensive stop Jacobs was driving again. But an errant pass was tipped and Prospect's Nick Grassano caught it at the Jacobs 40 and returned it for a touchdown and a 35-14 lead.

""I saw the ball and it was tipped"" Grassano said. ""We run that drill in practice all the time. After I caught it I saw open space and saw blockers and ran to the sideline and got to the end zone.""

Jacobs got a late touchdown from Canty on a 5-yard run to make it 35-21. But the Eagles' onside kick went out of bounds and Prospect ran out the clock.

""I am proud of our kids"" Jacobs coach Brian Zimmerman said. ""We were picked to go 3-6 and I think we exceeded everyone's expectations. Things didn't go our way and turnovers killed us. But we felt we could still be in this. Give credit to their defense they stuck it to us.""

The Prospect defense led by Carroll Grassano John Gavin Sahakian Parisi and Peyton Burgh forced 3 turnovers and held Jacobs' running attack to 163 yards.

""Our defense was incredible per usual"" DeBeouf said. ""They have had a great year. We will keep leaning on them and hopefully we can get one more.""

Canty’s contributions continued Saturday when the senior running back rushed for two touchdowns in the Golden Eagles’ 35-21 loss to Prospect in a Class 7A quarterfinal in Mount Prospect.

“I love all these guys” Canty said. “It had to come to an end at some point. (Saturday) was just that night.”

The problems started early for Jacobs (8-4) which was playing in a quarterfinal for the second time in program history. Prospect (10-2) got on the board on Matthew Raitano’s 54-yard touchdown run on the third play of the game. The Golden Eagles then fumbled on their first offensive play and Prospect’s Charlie Carroll scooped it up and took it 13 yards to the end zone.

Prospect added a field goal after a three-and-out and suddenly Jacobs was down 18-0 while running just four offensive plays.

“It’s not the way you want to start the game especially during the playoffs” Canty said. “When you go down like that it’s kind of hard to get yourself out of that deep hole.”

Jacobs’ Ben Ludlum (2) tries to spin away from Prospect’s Nick Grassano during a Class 7A state quarterfinal in Mount Prospect on Saturday Nov. 13 2021.

The Golden Eagles were resilient however. They put together a 15-play 80-yard scoring drive which Canty capped with a 5-yard TD run.

Another field goal pushed Prospect’s lead to 21-7. After a bad snap on a punt attempt Prospect got the ball deep in Jacobs’ territory. Two plays later Carroll hit Gavin Flanagan on a 20-yard TD pass on a gadget play for a 28-7 lead.

Senior running back Ben Ludlum scored on a 3-yard run on Jacobs’ first possession of the second half to cut it to 28-14. The Golden Eagles then forced a punt and were moving the ball before Prospect’s Nick Grassano picked off junior quarterback Max Benner and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown for a 35-14 lead.

Jacobs’ Joey Scrivani reacts after making a big hit during a Class 7A state quarterfinal against Prospect in Mount Prospect on Saturday Nov. 13 2021.

“It was a whole new game” Jacobs coach Brian Zimmerman said. “Max will be back. He’ll be better. A pick six those things happen. I told him that he exceeded everyone’s expectations. All these guys have. You can’t do those things in these types of games. We had to get through adversity.”

Canty tacked on his second TD run of the night also a 5-yarder with 1:51 left in the fourth quarter. But Jacobs was unable to recover the onside kick to keep its hopes alive.

Canty led Jacobs with 71 yards on 17 carries in his final high school game.

“I’m just proud of him” Zimmerman said. “He’s grown a lot over the course of four years. I’m just proud to see where he’s come from. He really embraced everything and ran super hard.”

Jacobs’ Grant Stec (7) eludes Prospect’s Matt Schacke during a Class 7A state quarterfinal in Mount Prospect on Saturday Nov. 13 2021.

Canty was quick to credit Prospect which will play St. Rita in a state semifinal.

“It’s a good football team right there” Canty said. “I have much respect for them.”

Canty and the seniors did what they set out to do as freshmen. But he thinks the best is yet to come.

“When it’s all said and done we made history” Canty said. “You have a lot of young guys on this team that are going to step up next year. They’ll go farther than us I promise you that.”

It wasn’t until midway through last season Trouba’s second with the Rangers that his teammates began singling him out as a prominent voice in the locker room. They identified him as the player they looked to after a bad period and someone who consistently led by example. It didn’t take long for Trouba to join Chris Kreider and Mika Zibanejad two of the longest-tenured Rangers as the players who spoke on behalf of the team after the losses that were the most difficult to put into words.

An alternate captain for the Rangers the past two seasons Trouba has evolved into a hybrid leader. The 27-year-old has taken qualities from each of the players who helped shape him throughout his career in addition to his experiences and implemented it into his own style.

“I learned a lot of it is [setting an] example and how what you do every day people watch” Trouba told The Post. “How you treat yourself how you treat other people people watch. On the ice I would say I think I’ve always worked hard and battled and led in that aspect.

Jacob Trouba Robert Sabo

“I wasn’t the most outgoing kid it was never easy for me to speak out especially in new places. I’m the type of person who needs to get comfortable around people before I’m comfortable being myself. It’s something I’ve tried to work on a lot in my life.

“I think picking your times to be vocal building relationships with people caring about people caring about your teammates on a deeper level than hockey that’s where you build leadership that’s where you build trust. And when it’s time when you ask someone to do something then you have that trust and they trust you.”

During his first six NHL seasons with the Jets the organization that drafted him ninth overall in 2012 Trouba looked up to Andrew Ladd Mark Stuart Chris Thorburn and Blake Wheeler. Ladd was Winnipeg’s captain when Trouba was a rookie in 2013-14. Trouba said he needed to be steered in the right direction and Ladd did just that.

Stuart who last played in the NHL in 2017 and now works as an assistant coach at Colorado College was Trouba’s defense partner and locker buddy.

“He just taught me a lot about being a pro” Trouba said of Stuart. “I was a very immature kid I can admit that.”

Thorburn who retired in June 2020 showed Trouba the importance of having a good attitude and treating people the right way — teammates staff and trainers alike. Wheeler who had played six seasons in the NHL before Trouba arrived in Winnipeg developed a strong relationship with the Michigan native away from the ice. Seeing Wheeler interact with his wife and kids at home had a lasting impact on Trouba.

The Jets traded Trouba to the Rangers in June 2019 in exchange for Neal Pionk and Winnipeg’s own first-round pick in that year’s draft. It took some time for Trouba to find his footing but by the end of his first season with the Rangers he had seemingly settled in.

When Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury announced that naming a captain ahead of this season was a priority Trouba was near the top of the list along with Kreider and Zibanejad. Instead head coach Gerard Gallant named those three as alternates in addition to Artemi Panarin Ryan Strome and Barclay Goodrow.

While it was strange to backtrack on such an assertion Trouba said the Rangers have moved on and are comfortable with their group of leaders.

“Ultimately it doesn’t change anything whether you have a ‘C’ an ‘A’ or nothing on your chest” Trouba said. “You’re going to be who you are and that’s the reason you’re a leader is because of who you are. It’s not because someone told you [that] you are.”

Teammates old and current rave about Jacob Trouba’s maturation. Corey Sipkin

Gallant said he’s not surprised Trouba has taken an initiative in the Rangers’ room. What has stood out to the new head coach the most however is how Trouba gives 100 percent of himself every game.

Trouba who has three assists in 13 games so far this season is ranked within the top-50 NHL defensemen in ice time per game (22:19) heading into the game at Columbus on Saturday.

“Guys respect him” Panarin said. “[That’s] really important because he’s a good guy. Everybody feels that he’s an honest guy.”

Added Kreider: “He’s a calming presence very genuine doesn’t try to be something he’s not. He’s very consistent in terms of his approach to the way he shows up the way he treats people. He’s soft spoken but when something needs to be said he’s very good at taking advantage of those situations. He comes across like he’s a lot older than he actually is. Sometimes I forget that he’s a few years younger than am because he’s very mature and very wise.”

Even though he has already commanded respect in the Rangers’ locker room and has an “A” stitched onto his jersey Trouba wants to continue to learn how to be a better leader. As much as coaches and management help guide a team Trouba believes it’s up to the players to set the standard for a winning attitude and show the next generation how to play the right way.

“I think I realized how important it was in my life and my career” he said. “I understand it’s now my time to kind of give that back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JldGhsYW5kbWFuLzIwMjEvMTEvMTQvZmFjaWFsLXBsYXN0aWMtc3VyZ2Vvbi1kci1hbmRyZXctamFjb25vLXRhbGtzLWZhY2VsaWZ0LXRlY2huaXF1ZS1hbmQtd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93LWlmLXlvdS1hcmUtY29uc2lkZXJpbmctb25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facial Plastic Surgeon Dr. Andrew Jacono Talks Deep Plane Facelift Technique And What You Need To Know If You ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethlandman/2021/11/14/facial-plastic-surgeon-dr-andrew-jacono-talks-facelift-technique-and-what-you-need-to-know-if-you-are-considering-one/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2JldGhsYW5kbWFuLzIwMjEvMTEvMTQvZmFjaWFsLXBsYXN0aWMtc3VyZ2Vvbi1kci1hbmRyZXctamFjb25vLXRhbGtzLWZhY2VsaWZ0LXRlY2huaXF1ZS1hbmQtd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93LWlmLXlvdS1hcmUtY29uc2lkZXJpbmctb25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L3RoZS1pbmZlcm5hbC1tYWNoaW5lLXN0ZXBoZW4tam9obnNvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: ‘The Infernal Machine’ by Steven Johnson,"THE INFERNAL MACHINE: A True Story of Dynamite Terror and the Rise of the Modern Detective by Steven Johnson

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9qaW1teS1qb2huc29uLWxlZ2VuZGFyeS00OWVyLWhhbGwtMDI0MzA4ODI3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jimmy Johnson legendary 49er Hall of Famer dies at 86,"May 9 (UPI) -- Former NFL legend Jimmy Johnson who spent his entire 16-year pro football career with the San Francisco 49ers and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994 is dead at 86 the Hall announced Thursday.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look in his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.""

The 49ers organization also expressed its condolences in a social media post.

And the team released a statement marking his passing.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

""Jimmy"" Johnson played college ball at UCLA. But Johnson wasn't just a football standout for the Bruins -- he was also exceptional on the track though not quite as good as his brother. Jimmy Johnson won All-American honors and an NCAA 100-meter championship while his brother Rafer garnered a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Jimmy Johnson was the 6th overall pick in the 1961 NFL Draft and made his presence felt right away in his rookie year with 5 catches in his first dozen games. He achieved Pro Bowl status from 1969 to 1972.

Johnson died Wednesday evening the Hall of Fame and 49ers announced.

A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up its value.

A game-worn jersey that belonged to Washington Senators pitcher and Baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson is currently at auction. Heritage House which is hosting the auction says the unique uniform is over a century old and valued at $3 million.

Production Manager Mike Provenzale told WTOP in the 20 years he’s worked for Heritage House Johnson’s jersey ranks at the top of all the items they’ve ever sold.

“It’s one of the most impressive items we’ve ever offered” he said calling the right-hander “one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.”

Using photo-matching the auction house traced the jersey back to April 29 1920 when the Washington Senators defeated the New York Yankees 2-1 at the Polo Grounds. It was the first time Johnson faced legendary hitter Babe Ruth. According to Provenzale Johnson earned his 299th career win while Ruth was only able to get a an RBI off a sacrifice fly.

“Through that photo-matching you’re able to identify the exact moment he was wearing it and when you can do that and it’s an important game with a lot of significant notes like that that just really piques the interest of high level collectors” he said.

This jersey was gifted by Johnson to teammate Eric “Swat” Erickson as a retirement gift after the 1920 season. Provenzale said Erickson brought a ranch in New York and had a barn where he kept all his sports collectibles including Johnson’s jersey.

“Decades later his granddaughter discovered it in the barn” Provenzale said adding that she was the one who initially sold it to a private seller.

Johnson’s legacy added an additional element that makes the jersey extremely valuable.

Known as “The Big Train” Johnson helped the Senators win its only World Series championship in 1924. He spent his entire 20-year playing career in Washington earning a record of 417-279 with a 2.17 ERA. For more than 50 years his 3509 strikeouts were the most thrown by a pitcher in the majors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 prior to his death 10 years later.

“He was the most dominant pitcher. He holds numerous records. He has the most scoreless games the most consecutive years leading the league in strikeouts” Provenzale said. “Essentially it’s him and Cy Young who are considered … the greatest pitchers of all time.”

Unlike modern jerseys which teams and players hold on to due to their value at the time uniforms were not seen with much significance other than being work clothes. The fact that Johnson’s gift survived is “a miracle” Provenzale said.

“Jerseys in that era were considered disposable” he said. “They were worn and worn and repaired until they could no longer be repaired.”

There is only one other known jersey worn by Johnson that exists and it is sitting in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York. Combined with the disposable nature of uniforms in the past it is unlikely that another game-worn Johnson jersey will surface Provenzale said.

“So if you’re interested” he said. “This is the opportunity to get it”

The auction ends on May 17.

""Me and Giannis are blessed to be in the situation where we can afford them"" Riddlesprigger said. ""But not everybody can.""

To celebrate the birth of Maverick Shai Antetokounmpo and help Milwaukee-area families in need they're putting on Maverick's Diaper Mission a diaper drive from Nov. 14 to 21. It's in collaboration with the Milwaukee Diaper Mission the Milwaukee Bucks and the premium baby brand Nuna.

""We're thinking about always giving back 'cause I'm blessed to be a part of this family and this is something very very special for me and Mariah"" Antetokounmpo said.

How the diaper drive came about

What Antetokounmpo and Riddlesprigger do for one of their children they want to do for the other Riddlesprigger said.

Two big baby showers were thrown for their son Liam who was born in winter 2020 by family and friends. So when Maverick was on the way they wanted to do something special for him too.

But with the Bucks championship run going into July and Riddlesprigger being so far along in her pregnancy they decided to wait until after Maverick's birth.

Riddlesprigger came up with the diaper drive idea then reached out to the Milwaukee Diaper Mission a basic needs bank that aims to provide a reliable source of diapers and period products to local families in need.

""It's a dream come true not just because of their platform and their importance in the city but just because of their kind hearts and the people that they are"" said Meagan Johnson who co-founded the organization with her cousin Jessica Syburg in September 2020.

How you can help

Diapers — both disposable and cloth — and wipes will be collected around Fiserv Forum during the three Bucks games scheduled the week of the drive: Nov. 17 19 and 20. Collection will begin one hour before tip off and will go into the end of the first quarter.

A main tent will be located in the Deer District across from the Bucks Pro Shop. There will also be drop-off spots at three atrium entrance doors and the entrances of BMO South and North Sky Bridge and Johnson Controls.

The volunteer-run organization — which is part of the National Diaper Bank Network — already has drop boxes throughout the Milwaukee area including at:

Colectivo Coffee: 4500 N. Oakland Ave. Shorewood and 6745 W. Wells St. Wauwatosa

4500 N. Oakland Ave. Shorewood and 6745 W. Wells St. Wauwatosa The Glass Pantry: 1039 S. 5th St. Milwaukee

1039 S. 5th St. Milwaukee Bay View's Café Corazón: 2394 S. Kinnickinnic Ave. Milwaukee

2394 S. Kinnickinnic Ave. Milwaukee Beans & Barley: 1901 E. North Ave. Milwaukee

1901 E. North Ave. Milwaukee Early Beginnings Chiropractic: N54W6135 Mill St. No. 120 Cedarburg

N54W6135 Mill St. No. 120 Cedarburg Little Sprouts Play Cafe: 4606 N. Wilson Drive Shorewood and 1406 W. Mequon Road Mequon

4606 N. Wilson Drive Shorewood and 1406 W. Mequon Road Mequon Authentic Birth Center and Wellness Collective: 530 N. 108th Place Wauwatosa

People can also donate open packages of unused diapers which are inspected and repackaged before being distributed.

Monetary donations can be made at secure.givelively.org/donate/milwaukee-diaper-mission-inc/maverick-s-diaper-mission or by texting ""MDM"" to 44321. Nuna will be matching monetary contributions up to $25000 Johnson said.

Financial donations are used to purchase products and fund the diaper mission's warehouse space. The group outgrew its home — an 1100-square-foot space in Bay View — ""immediately"" Johnson said. They've been on the hunt for a new one — ideally on a first floor — for the past eight months.

How the diapers are distributed

The organization distributes diapers monthly to nine local social service agencies including the Riverwest Food Pantry Lola's New Beginnings Next Door Milwaukee Metcalfe Park Community Bridges the Bay View Community Center Hmong American Woman’s Association the Jewish Community Pantry Maroon Calabash and the Robyn’s Nest program at Children’s Wisconsin.

Those organizations then give the supplies to their clients.

Since its formation the mission has distributed about 173900 disposable and 1900 cloth diapers according to its website milwaukeediapermission.org.

The next distribution will be two weeks after Maverick's Diaper Mission.

""I'm happy that (Mariah) took the step to do (the diaper drive) to accomplish to reach out to people to give back"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I can't wait for the future where she's going to do more great things like this.""

Mariah's passion for giving back

Riddlesprigger has always had a passion for giving back. But that drive increased when she started dating Antetokounmpo and heard about the struggles he faced growing up in Greece.

""I was born in place of privilege"" Riddlesprigger said. ""Giannis wasn't as everyone knows his story. Since dating him and hearing about his life story and how he grew up it's impacted me even more on wanting to give back and make sure kids can be kids and families can have a stable environment.""

Her ultimate goal is to start a nonprofit focused on helping families and children she said in a previous Milwaukee Journal Sentinel interview.

Riddlesprigger founded and runs the Sincerely Mariah apparel brand which focuses on building others up and spreading positivity while overcoming her own challenges. She's also adjusting to life as a mom of two.

""You see how much of a bond they're going to have already"" she said of the boys. ""There's days where it's hard. But then there's days when I sit back and I'm like 'Wow I can't believe this is real.' It's surreal that this is my life and I'm blessed to have two healthy baby boys.""

Prince Harry and Meghan the Duchess of Sussex are getting into the investment business. They are joining Ethic a fintech asset manager in the fast-growing environmental social and governance space as “impact partners” and investors. Ethic has $1.3 billion under management and creates separately managed accounts to invest in social responsibility themes.

The couple could attract more attention to sustainable investing. Harry and Meghan can make E.S.G. investing part of pop culture in a way that say BlackRock’s Larry Fink can’t. “From the world I come from you don’t talk about investing right?” Meghan told DealBook in a joint interview with Harry. “You don’t have the luxury to invest. That sounds so fancy.”

“My husband has been saying for years ‘Gosh don’t you wish there was a place where if your values were aligned like this you could put your money to that same sort of thing?’” Meghan said. They were introduced to Ethic by friends she said.

Harry and Meghan said they hoped that their involvement would help democratize investing making people — especially younger people — more deliberate in their choices and conscious of investing in sustainable companies. “You already have the younger generation voting with their dollars and their pounds you know all over the world when it comes to brands they select and choose from” Harry said suggesting it was a natural extension to do the same with investments."

Nobody? Well consider yourself average.

Now let’s meet Joe Davis. And no not your average Joe.

Davis was a kid who grew up in tiny Potterville Mich. whose dad made a basketball court for him in the basement with two little tykes’ hoops and also painted a football field for him in the backyard.

“In addition to pretending to play the games’’ Davis said “I pretended to announce them too.’’

When he graduated high school Davis still wanted to play football but a Division 1 opportunity was out of reach. What he absolutely knew is he wanted to become a broadcaster so naturally he chose … Beloit College?

“Obviously it’s not a broadcasting school’’ Davis said. “But I found that there were a lot of people there who seemed willing to help me chase those dreams. Whatever opportunities could be created I knew there were people there who would help me create them and that wound up being true.’’

True that. Today the kid who once pretended to be Keith Jackson at the Rose Bowl is now the voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

And all he had to do once he got the job was do what many in his profession would want no part of: Follow a national treasure in Vin Scully.

“It was like whoever is following Vin that’s a death sentence’’ said Davis of the view from the world outside. “But I couldn’t look at it like that. For me it was part of it what made that job appealing.

“So instead of looking at it as a burden or a pressure I looked at it as a great responsibility and a great opportunity to do something that I had never envisioned of ever having the chance to do. And I knew if I didn’t take the job out of fear of it not working I would probably come to regret it.’’

There are zero regrets today. Davis not only has one of the best jobs in baseball he gets to do it every day with one of his best friends from college Rick Krajewski who is in the booth with Davis serving as the Dodgers’ statistician.

“When we’re sitting in the booth with (baseball hall of famer) John Smoltz’’ said Davis “and he’s yucking it up with Smoltz about fantasy football and there are many times I’m like ‘Man how did we get here?’’’



****

Krajewski remembers one of the first times he met Davis and quickly realized this guy was not like any other college freshman.

“It’s just he was always unique to me because people go to college to figure out what they want to do’’ Krajewski said “and Joe went to college knowing what he wanted to do and doing everything he could to get to that point.’’

Davis was already broadcasting Beloit College basketball games as a freshman. He learned about production and changed the primitive one-camera setup and expanded it to three. He started his own community access program at a downtown Irish pub. And then after his junior year he landed an internship with the Schaumburg Flyers (Ill.) independent baseball team in Illinois.

“It was an unpaid internship’’ said Davis “and I would get their early 8 or 9 a.m. do all kinds of stuff besides broadcasting like the game notes and make sales calls and everything but I loved it. Every day I’d get to drive up to the park I had butterflies in my stomach. ‘Man oh man I’m not getting paid a cent — this is probably kind of illegal to have a kid do this much work and not pay him.’ But I just loved every second. And it was the first chance to do baseball every day and there’s no better way to improve and to learn than just to do it every day.”

Davis also sought the help of Amy Sarno associate professor of theatre at Beloit College to help with a variety of things with his voice. They met independently once a week for more than a year.

“I was always kind of unsure what the actual sports casting was all about’’ Sarno said. “But I knew in order to do it you had to be able to use language well and make the most of your voice.”

She worked with Davis on enunciation and pronunciation. She impressed upon him the use of words and how the sound of it can impact its emotional quality. She also worked with him on his breathing while he announced.

“So a lot of it was not only how you pronounce or how do you use consonants and vowels’’ she said “but what words do you choose to move the audience to feel something.”

Davis would bring her his broadcast tapes and they would go over them together and she would point areas in which he could improve.

“One thing that makes him different from a lot of other students I’ve had is that he wanted to do everything he could to be the best that he could be’’ said Sarno. “And so he kept his mind open. And a lot of college students kind of sort through things thinking ‘Well that might not be important to me.’ But Joe never did that. He looked at every opportunity as a way of contributing to what he did and what he wanted to do.’’

Krajewski said there was many an evening when his friend would take a pass on the typical college experience to work on his craft.

“On Friday nights when the other guys were out having a good time partying he was upstairs watching games and a recorder calling the game himself’’ Krajewski said. “To get reps and to practice. He made sacrifices and like at the time we thought ‘What’s this guy’s deal? We like him but he’s a little too serious.’ And now he’s the guy who’s earned every bit of success that he’s gotten.’’



****

Krajewski was just grinding through another day in his San Francisco office working the phones doing insurance technology and digital marketing sales.

Then his phone rang. It was Joe. His old fraternity brother who had gone from calling minor-league baseball in Memphis to ESPN and then FOX Sports in what seemed like five minutes was calling looking for help.

He needed a statistician. And since Krajewski had a degree in business administration and had played on the Beloit College baseball team Davis thought why not?

“And as I always say’’ said Krajewski “my initial reaction was I didn’t know that job existed.”

Krajewski wanted to help his friend and the opportunity was more than intriguing but he wasn’t sure it was a good idea.

“More than anything I said ‘Joe I’m happy to do this. But I’m nervous that this is your opportunity at FOX and I’m going to be someone that screws up what you’re doing your career path’” said Krajewski.

Davis proved to be a capable scout. This experiment turned into a career change for Krajewski who eventually joined his friend in the Dodgers’ television booth along with former Cy Young and World Series MVP Orel Hershiser.

And despite the disparity in age the three have become tighter than Fort Knox.

“For me personally besides Joe being my best friend Orel is right up there as one of the most influential people in my life’’ Krajewski said.



****

It was 2017 when Davis who also still works for FOX Sports took over for one of the most popular and talented persons to ever sit behind a microphone. And it was Vin Scully himself who introduced Davis to the fans at Dodger Stadium on Opening Day.

By all accounts Davis has handled this transition with aplomb.

“Of course there were questions ‘What is it going to be like post-Vin’’’ he said. “But I felt like I was given a chance from the beginning.’’

So the guy who decided to attend a small liberal arts college pretty much noted for everything but broadcasting has become one of its most famous graduates.

“There is no one right path. There’s no one way to do it’’ Davis said. “And I wondered about that ‘Am I making the right decisions? Am I going the right way to get where I want to go?’ I think it’s proof that there is no one right way.

“And it’s also a testament to the kind of place Beloit is. It’s not a broadcasting school but I was able to create this career that I have because of the people there. I knew what I wanted to do and there were so many people there willing to help me do it.’’

At least 75 past and present employees own shares in Klarna worth seven figures according to a Sifted analysis of its shareholder book.

A small handful of staff even hold over $10m worth of shares. That includes Klarna’s departing deputy chief executive who has been at the firm since 2012 as well as Klarna's first head of IT who left the firm back in 2010.

Klarna’s share price soared after it secured a $45.6bn valuation in June propped up by investors like SoftBank. The deal made Klarna Europe’s top private startup and the world's second most valuable fintech at the time — seeing its valuation jump fourfold from September 2020 and pricing its shares at $1756 each.

Following the raise employees who owned as little as 0.0022% of the company became paper millionaires.

This pool of employees has benefited from generous equity packages over Klarna's 15-year history. In 2020 according to Di Digital staff who had been at the company for four years or longer were also reportedly invited to buy shares at a heavily discounted price back.

Employees who own as little as 0.0022% of Klarna are now paper millionaires

For now these fortunes only really exist on paper. But with Klarna hinting at a public listing within the next year employees could have the opportunity to cash in very soon.

An IPO would also create a huge payday for Klarna's cofounders. Chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski owns about 7% of the company worth over $3.1bn. That's trumped only by cofounder Victor Jacobsson who left the company in 2012 and owns nearly 10% of Klarna.

Klarna which today employs 4000 people worldwide declined to comment.

More millionaires in the works

While 75 confirmed employee-millionaires is a feat dozens more could soon join the ranks.

That's because Klarna’s shareholder records which are available upon request in Sweden only list individuals who have already exercised their options into real shares.

Klarna's millionaire staff pool could therefore be far larger when accounting for those with large unexercised equity packages.

Indeed according to Klarna’s last annual report there were 434000 employee stock options still outstanding. At the most recent valuation that option pool amounts to $762m.

Moreover if Klarna's share price increases further — at the IPO or otherwise — another batch of employees who are already close to hitting the $1m mark will join the millionaire club.

Staff at other large fintechs are also profiting from the sector's success.

British fintech Revolut has banked at least 76 employee-millionaires according to a recent Sifted analysis. Its last filings show that its outstanding staff options pool is worth around $1.54bn — double that of Klarna's.

An ecosystem boost?

With so many employee-millionaires lined up Klarna’s exit could be a welcome boost for the ecosystem as successful alumni tend to plough money back into new startups.

Dozens of former Klarna employees have already gone on to found their own startups including Mikael Hussain the cofounder and chief executive of Anyfin and Kristofer Ekman Sinclair the cofounder of Zimpler.

Many of the employee-millionaires are residents in Sweden Klarna’s home base so could look to invest in startups in the country and Nordic region.

Nonetheless the distribution of wealth won't be felt everywhere. Women make up just ~13% of the Klarna employees listed as millionaires in the shareholder book.

A note on methodology

Klarna's shareholder book is dated October 2021 and is available upon request in Sweden. Sifted counted any individual associated with the firm as an employee.

It's worth noting that the records don't include employees in the US. Those stock options are counted under a different scheme which Sifted was unable to access.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Other recall advisory sites had not published the news before the weekend but we've got the details on this Costco recall announcement you need to know.

On their website and reportedly via their mobile alerts system for customers who have purchased this product Costco has published a recall announcement on behalf of the Kraft Heinz Company and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The recall is for Kool-Aid Tropical Punch Mix which the warehouse chain cites as item number 95740. This is for Kool-Aid Tropical Punch Mix specifically in 82.5-ounce containers bearing ""Best When Used By"" dates of 2023-08-31 and 2023-09-01.

This Is the Best Supermarket in America New Survey Says

The reason for this recall is ""the potential presence of foreign material specifically very small pieces of metal or glass.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Costco says this Kool-Aid recall applies to select Costco Business Centers as well as Costco warehouses in the Los Angeles region and the Northwest Region. If you've purchased this product in the regions indicated Costco recommends that you do not consume it and instead return it to your local Costco for a full refund. Signed from the Kraft Heinz Company the recall announcement says: ""We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.""

This Costco recall announcement comes just weeks after the October 19 2021 recall announcement for some Midwest customers on Ivar's Clam Chowder with Uncured Bacon which the Ivar's brand said was ""due to the possibility that the product may be contaminated with hard sharp opaque plastic pieces.""

The high fives the fist pounds and all the other salutations shared between us is what makes the scene so uplifting.

In basketball it’s not just the play on the court that spawns these toasts and gestures though. As was the case during the Orlando Magic’s game against the Washington Wizards sometimes it’s what’s being celebrated off the court that elicits those same cheers.

Saturday at Amway Center was Seats for Soldiers Night presented by L3Harris. It was the 18th consecutive season the Magic and L3Harris teamed up to honor military men women and their families at this event which featured several activities giveaways and entertainment including the playing of Magic player messages on the jumbotron thanking military members for their service.

“It means the world. This country wouldn’t run the way it would if those guys didn’t have our backs out there wherever they are out there in the world” Magic center Mo Bamba said. “I personally have someone in my family who served and it’s tough. The sacrifices that you have to make….It may be a small gesture of kindness but it means the world to us that we can go out there and have that kind of effect.”

The entire Magic team honored fallen soldiers by holding their jerseys with each soldiers' name listed on the back while standing on court during Taps prior to the National Anthem. Each player had signed the jersey that will be given to the families of the fallen soldiers. A few of the families of the lost military men and women were in attendance to receive their family member's signed jersey.

The last name on the back of the jersey Cole Anthony was holding was Mann in honor of Amine Mann an Army vet who died in 2014 at the age of 33 after a four-year battle with liver cancer. His surviving wife Georgiana Mann and their children watched the game from a suite at Amway Center with several other families who lost a loved one.

Although he didn’t die during combat it is believed that Amine’s illness was caused by the toxic exposures absorbed while deployed in Iraq. Him getting honored by the Magic and L3Harris means so much to his family which they know he would have been extremely humbled by and appreciative of especially since he was an athlete himself while growing up in Long Island New York.

“This is actually the very first time that my family is getting honored in such a way and it will leave an impact on us forever” Georgiana said. “I am beyond moved by this opportunity to be here tonight and to be able to bring my children and keep his memory alive. Besides the grief and missing them that’s all we want to do is keep their honor and keep them in our memories and honor them in such a way.”

Spending time with the families in that same suite was Jose Belen a U.S. Army combat veteran himself who founded Mission Zero a Florida-based organization aimed at ending the PTSD and veteran suicide epidemic.

“I just try to normalize and say hey if you are going through something if you have PTSD as a veteran or non-veteran if you are a grieving mother father you are not alone” he said. “The brotherhood-sisterhood is here to serve you. So I’m a humbled servant that at the end of the day uses the opportunity before me to me like this to shed the light on those that people don’t see that I carry on my back…There are a lot of people screaming for help and for whatever reason they are not being heard so I stand and be a voice to the voiceless give hope to the hopeless.”

More than 2700 active and retired military personnel and their families were provided game tickets courtesy of the Magic L3Harris and season ticket holders who donated their seats for the occasion. The Seats for Soldiers celebration included veterans active military families from all branches along with ROTC OCSO OPD OFD Orange County Public Schools Osceola County Public Schools Seminole County Government Community Services Department Blue Star families Mission Zero and Fraternal Order of Police.

L3Harris and the Magic also provided two hospitality suites to the game for Central Florida military personnel and L3Harris and Levy Restaurants provided complimentary food and beverage for each suite.

“We are just grateful to them for their sacrifice and the time and the effort and the energy that they put in to keep us safe” Magic Head Coach Jamahl Mosley said. “It’s just a beautiful thing that we can celebrate them.”

It’s partnerships like the one between the Magic and L3Harris that help make events like Seats for Soldiers happen. With over 7500 employees at L3Harris that are veterans it’s a staple of their organization to pay tribute to the military.

“It’s a visible display from the community that we are supporting the military” said Ed Zoiss president of the Space and Airborne systems segment for L3Harris. “The military needs to see that. They need to know that the country the community supports them to the deepest core because they need to continue to do the very hard mission that they have often times away from their families away from their loved ones as they protect our freedoms and they protect our country. We are very honored to be here tonight with them.”

Seeing the joy on the faces of the military men women and their families is always a special experience for the Magic. It’s an event they look forward to every year and one they are proud to host side by side with L3Harris.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGRiYW5uZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9zcGxpdC1jb3VudHktY29tbWlzc2lvbmVycy1hZG9wdC1yZWRpc3RyaWN0aW5nLXBsYW4vYXJ0aWNsZV8xNjVkOTdlYS00NDBmLTExZWMtYTdlOC05ZjI2MjgzMmNlMmYuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGRiYW5uZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9zcGxpdC1jb3VudHktY29tbWlzc2lvbmVycy1hZG9wdC1yZWRpc3RyaWN0aW5nLXBsYW4vYXJ0aWNsZV8xNjVkOTdlYS00NDBmLTExZWMtYTdlOC05ZjI2MjgzMmNlMmYuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Split county commissioners adopt redistricting plan,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The recovery in casino gambling in Macao always seems to be just around the corner but it never quite arrives. Yet another plunge in monthly gambling revenue in October shows the rebound remains over the horizon and makes Las Vegas casinos the better bet.

For those resort operators like Las Vegas Sands (LVS -1.40%) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN -0.82%) that make most or virtually all of their money from the Chinese enclave the losing streak is going to hurt for some time to come.

In contrast the likes of MGM Resorts International (MGM -0.69%) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR -3.00%) which rely primarily upon Las Vegas and other regional U.S. gambling markets that are playing a hot hand should be where investors put their money.

Macao's not the odds-on favorite

Macao's reported gross gambling revenue (GGR) last month tumbled to just 4.3 billion patacas which is the local currency and is the equivalent of around $544 million a 40% drop compared to last year and almost 26% below what the city took in the month prior.

It's the only place where it's legal to gamble in China and Beijing has been watching the money flow in and out of the casinos with a wary eye. Over the years it has imposed increasingly stringent regulations on casinos gamblers and the junket operators who ferry VIPs to and from the peninsula while lending them money to gamble.

The pandemic exacerbated the situation as virtually all travel to the city was closed. And outbreaks of COVID-19 variants have led nearby provinces where most of the travel to Macao originates to restrict travel once more.

Las Vegas Sands sold all of its U.S.-based properties to go all-in on Asian markets which at this point is essentially just Macao. It reported third-quarter revenue of $857 million last month. While that is nearly double the $446 million it took in for the same period in 2020 it remains far below the $3.2 billion it generated in 2019.

Similarly Wynn Resorts just reported third-quarter revenue of $995 million and while that's below the $1.6 billion realized two years ago it is not as bad as what Sands experienced because of Wynn's Las Vegas operations which represented almost half of this quarter's revenue. Typically Macao accounts for two thirds to three quarters of Wynn's net revenue.

Viva Las Vegas!

In contrast casino operators with a greater U.S. presence are seeing a rebound. MGM Resorts saw revenue surge 140% year over year to $2.7 billion this past quarter which is only 18% below 2019's $3.3 billion total. But more importantly its Las Vegas adjusted property EBITDAR (earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and restructuring or rent costs) was 21% higher than two years ago and regional casino EBITDAR was 29% higher.

And Caesars generated $2.7 billion in the third quarter versus $1.4 billion last year (because it merged with Eldorado Resorts in July 2020 there's no comparison to 2019).

In short Las Vegas and various regional markets have done away with most restrictions on casinos such as mask mandates and capacity restraints which led gamblers to flow back into the resorts. And as vaccinations proliferate even with the potential need for booster shots to follow consumers are more comfortable being in large crowded venues again.

Don't double down on Macao

Macao was once the world's biggest gambling market and it might eventually regain such status. Yet with the possibility of Japan opening its doors to casinos in the next few years along with Singapore and other Asian markets expanding their own gambling opportunities high rollers might find these other venues more attractive since they won't be under the government microscope Macao faces.

For investors looking for top casino growth stocks MGM Resorts or Caesars seem like winning hands as do regional players like Boyd Gaming or Penn National Gaming.

It’s no wonder why states across the nation are in various stages of introducing some form of gaming to their citizens.

The American Gaming Association last week reported that commercial gaming revenue hit a quarterly record for the months of July August and September and that revenue is on a record pace for 2021.

The AGA said that with $38.67 billion in revenue through the first nine months of the year the industry has already passed revenue generated for the full year 2020 and is on pace to smash its annual record of $43.65 billion set in 2019.

For states that already offer some form of gaming that means the generation of tax revenue to help solve a multitude of problems ranging from underfunded education to homelessness and housing issues.

“Two straight quarters of record gaming revenue is an incredible accomplishment in any context let alone after the most challenging year in industry history” said AGA President and CEO Bill Miller. “Our recovery is not a flash in the pan but rather a sustained result of our leadership in responsible reopening world-class entertainment offerings and widespread favorability.”

The explosive growth which industry executives and analysts attribute to pent-up demand resulting from being cooped up during the coronavirus pandemic and available cash from stimulus checks also is being felt in Nevada.

In a year in which gross gaming revenue across the Silver State is on the verge of hitting its record-breaking eighth consecutive month of gaming win exceeding $1 billion the third quarter was particularly impressive.

For July September and October the state’s casinos collected $3.683 billion a 58.7 percent increase over the third quarter of 2020. The Control Board said revenue broke down to $2.479 billion won on slot machines and $1.205 billion on table games.

The total won in Nevada in the third quarter was 26.5 percent of the nationwide third-quarter amount.

The list of future projects already underway for the next wave of expansion is short but the pipeline of new proposals is lengthy.

Here’s a summary of gaming expansion being contemplated in other states:

Virginia

The expansion of commercial gaming in Virginia seemed to be going smoothly up until just recently.

The state’s Legislature legalized sports betting in 2020 and legal bets were wagered in the Old Dominion commonwealth starting in January.

And last November voters in four Virginia cities voted to allow for casino gambling through partnerships with gaming companies. Those included the cities of Danville which partnered with Caesars Entertainment Bristol (Hard Rock International) Portsmouth (Rush Street Gaming) and Norfolk (Pamunkey Indian Tribe).

So when Richmond voters went to the polls Nov. 2 to decide if it would become the fifth Virginia city to make the jump through a referendum that would allow Urban One to build a 250-room resort with 1800 slots it seemed like momentum was on expansion’s side. The city’s mayor Levar Stoney had even thrown his support behind the project.

But the referendum failed by a narrow 51-49 margin.

The other four cities that voted in favor of casino gambling should be well positioned for their respective markets said Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors.

“Obviously these aren’t going to be the next Las Vegas but you’ll see a good regional product” he said.

Bussmann said he doesn’t expect much movement on additional expansion proposals in Virginia anytime soon.

Colorado

Another sure expansion is in Cripple Creek Colorado where Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts is building Chamonix a 300-room property next door to its existing Bronco Billy’s casino in the small mountain town near Colorado Springs. The company said the property would have the first luxury guest rooms in the market.

Colorado already is seeing a boost in revenue thanks to the elimination of betting limits in Black Hawk Central City and Cripple Creek in May.

Full House President and CEO Dan Lee said laborers have been working on utility relocation and the installation of foundation footings and walls for Chamonix named for a resort in the French Alps. Lee said the project would go vertical after steel arrives onsite in the next three weeks. One tower is expected to top out in April and another in August.

Illinois Indiana and Chicago

Chicago may have the largest potential for gaming expansion as the country’s third-largest metropolitan area with 9.5 million residents.

“It’s a huge opportunity for a great city” Bussmann said.

But a high tax rate of 40 percent scared off some potential developers. When the deadline for submittals came five proposals from four different companies came in.

“The submission of bid responses represents a major step toward the thoughtful development of a casino-resort that uplifts our businesses employs and empowers our residents and encourages tourism” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “We are thrilled to have received five high-caliber proposals from Bally’s Corp.; HR Chicago LLC; Rivers Chicago at McCormick LLC; and Rivers 78 Gaming LLC” she said.

The Chicago proposal is the largest among six regions where the Illinois Legislature authorized casinos. Regions include Danville Rockford South Suburbs Waukegan and Williamson County.

Winning bids are expected to be selected by the Illinois Gaming Board in January.

In Indiana four companies have submitted proposals for a casino in Vigo County and four in Terre Haute. Full House Resorts is in the mix at Terre Haute.

The company could get an answer as soon as Wednesday on its Terre Haute plan. Lee said his company is among four prospective developers that will make presentations to the Indiana Gaming Commission on that day. The commission has indicated it would deliberate and make a decision on the development later that day.

The Full House proposal called American Place would include a 100-room hotel elevated above an interior greenscape with a rooftop pool and restaurant.

New York

Two processes are in place in New York a market with the nation’s greatest population base a strong tourism economy and entertainment that could easily connect with gaming.

Nine companies are in line to have sports wagering licenses with a 51 percent tax rate and a requirement that operators can’t deduct promotion play when calculating gross income.

Operators expect to take wagers before the end of the National Football League season.

The second gaming process involves a request for information for three downstate casinos with licensing expected to occur by 2023 although the New York Legislature could move that up.

Las Vegas Sands Corp. made headlines after Sportico a sports business website reported that Sands was in preliminary talks with Steven Cohen the majority owner of the New York Mets baseball team to build a casino next door to the Mets’ Citi Field at Flushing in Queens.

Sands has not confirmed that report; however it has expressed interest in the New York City region.

“If the state were to activate the three gaming licenses available for the New York City region it would undoubtedly attract significant interest and ultimately investment from interested parties like us” the company said in a statement. “The amount of good paying middle-class jobs and the tax revenue generated by these projects would be meaningful to the state and the local communities as well.”

Texas

Texas always has been considered one of the best prospects for casino gambling because of its large population base low taxes and an appreciation for entertainment Bussmann said.

Sands hired a team of lobbyists to explain how the state would benefit from the development of four integrated resorts across the state.

Now that the state Legislature has adjourned efforts to lobby lawmakers have scaled back but they’re expected to ramp up again when a new session begins in 2023 which means it’s likely there won’t be anything on the ballot for Texans to consider until 2024.

Still the gaming industry will continue to be visible.

Next month the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States will convene in Austin and one of the event’s speakers will be Sands executive Andy Abboud.

Florida

The Florida Legislature approved of a compact negotiated by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Seminole Tribe of Florida that gave the tribe control of sports betting in the nation’s third most populous state. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland approved the compact in August.

But multiple groups have filed lawsuits against Haaland challenging her authority to approve the compact and arguing that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or IGRA allows the Seminoles to accept bets that are placed off -property as would be allowed under Florida’s agreement with the tribe.

A federal judge in October dismissed one lawsuit but another is still moving forward.

Other groups meanwhile are going to the state’s voters to push for further expansion. And those efforts have major backing from some of the biggest gaming companies.

FanDuel and DraftKings each wrote $10 million checks to Florida Education Champions which is pushing for a 2022 ballot measure that would allow for online sports betting across the state.

Las Vegas Sands had as of July donated $17 million to Florida Voters in Charge which is pushing for two measures that would allow for as many as three new casinos in north Florida.

With more than 20 million residents it’s understandable why major companies want to carve out a piece of what the Seminole Tribe has.

“It’s one of the largest population states where there’s tremendous opportunity to diversify a gaming product” Bussmann said.

Nebraska

Nebraska voters had to pass three initiatives in order to introduce casino gambling to the state one to amend the Constitution to allow games of chance to be played one to establish a tax rate of 20 percent and one to establish the Nebraska Gaming and Racing Commission to regulate the industry.

Now that the voters have passed them state legislators went to work cleaning up the bills and expanding the number of locations gaming will be allowed.

The initial bill enabled casinos linked with horse tracks at Lincoln Omaha Grand Island Hastings Columbus and South Sioux City. In the cleanup process lawmakers added tracks in Bellevue York Norfolk North Platte and Gering.

The regulatory structure in Nebraska is expected to be approved in mid-December and when the Legislature convenes in January another cleanup bill is anticipated that could expand games and regulate sports wagering.

Georgia

The debates over legalizing casino gambling and sports betting are not new to Georgia. For the better part of a decade the state has toyed with the ideas but each time they’ve run into a brick wall.

Casino gaming expansion would require a ballot initiative to be approved by voters in the nation’s eighth most populous state. Lawyers for the state’s legislature think that there is a legal avenue to pass sports betting simply through legislation however and gaming industry watchers like Bussmann expect that debate to come up when the body convenes next January.

And it will be backed by a coalition of Atlanta’s pro sports teams including the Braves Falcons Hawks and Atlanta United.

Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has said that while he opposes casino gambling he would not stand in the way if voters were to approve it as long as it’s written so that the revenue will benefit the state’s merit-based scholarship program that is entirely funded by the state lottery.

Getting that support at the polls would be one of the biggest issues according to Bussmann given that the state leans more conservative and religious — two groups historically opposed casino gambling on moral grounds.

“My fear with Georgia is overcoming what happens at the pulpit every Sunday” Bussmann said.

But those long-held anti-gambling beliefs could be shifting. Tennessee’s Legislature passed a bill to legalize sports betting in the state in 2019 and that law went live in November 2020.

But there will be other challenges.

Any ballot measures in 2022 will be fighting for the political airwaves against several huge state and federal races including what will be nationally watched races for governor and U.S. Senate.

“Georgia’s gonna be expensive” Bussmann said.

USA TODAY

Whatever findings or even criminal charges flow from the Houston police investigation into the tragedy that left ten people dead at rapper Travis Scott's Nov. 5 concert two questions cry out for answers.

How much authority over the event did the city and Harris County cede to the performer and concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment?

And who was making decisions about whether the show should be stopped when people started dying?

A review of Houston Fire Department logs by USA TODAY reporter Rick Jervis showed that even before Scott took the stage at 9:15 p.m. — in a temporary venue erected on parking lots of the county's sprawling NRG sports and entertainment complex — hundreds of concertgoers had already been treated for injuries from crowds surging past barricades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuaWRsaXZlLmNvbS9uYXRpb25hbC9sYXdzdWl0cy1hZ2FpbnN0LXRyYXZpcy1zY290dC1hc3Ryb3dvcmxkLW9yZ2FuaXplcnMtcGlsZS11cC010gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawsuits against Travis Scott Astroworld organizers pile up – EnidLIVE!,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.enidlive.com/national/lawsuits-against-travis-scott-astroworld-organizers-pile-up-5 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuaWRsaXZlLmNvbS9uYXRpb25hbC9sYXdzdWl0cy1hZ2FpbnN0LXRyYXZpcy1zY290dC1hc3Ryb3dvcmxkLW9yZ2FuaXplcnMtcGlsZS11cC010gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTQvdXMvYXN0cm93b3JsZC12aWN0aW0tZXpyYS1ibG91bnQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9-Year-Old Boy Who Was Injured at Astroworld Festival Dies (Published 2021),"A 9-year-old boy on Sunday became the 10th and youngest person to die from injuries sustained at the Astroworld festival.

The boy Ezra Blount had been in a medically induced coma from injuries his family believes he sustained after being trampled at the Nov. 5 festival an outdoor concert in Houston headlined by the rapper Travis Scott that was attended by 50000 and took a tragic turn after a crowd surge occurred near the stage during his performance. Authorities are still trying to determine the cause.

The death was announced on Sunday night by the mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner.

“Our city tonight prays for his mom dad grandparents other family members and classmates at this time” Mr. Turner wrote on Twitter. “They will need all of our support in the months and years to come. May God give them strength.”

""The allegation about Drake is that he also should have been aware that people were being injured and hurt"" said Meredith Duncan a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center Faculty.

""And by him taking the stage and performing that he was going to add to that situation.""

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed and a criminal investigation opened after nine people died and hundreds were injured in an apparent crowd surge at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld outdoor music festival. Authorities have said 50000 people attended the Nov. 5 event.

Among those named in the lawsuits include promoter Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Scott. Drake who was a surprise guest performer and appeared on stage with Scott has also been named a defendant in some of the legal action since taken.

'Helped incite the crowd'

One of those lawsuits filed by concertgoer Kristian Paredes 23 from Texas includes Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Scott and Drake. The suit alleges the Toronto rapper who is referred to by his real name Aubrey Drake Graham ""helped incite the crowd"" and that he continued to be on stage with Scott ""as the crowd became out of control"" and ""the crowd mayhem continued.""

Concertgoers have described the packed crowd growing dangerous even before Scott appeared on stage and seeing people collapse while the rapper performed. Scott reportedly paused his performance once it was clear people needed medical attention and encouraged the audience to make room for an ambulance that was winding through the crowd but later finished his set.

Authorities gave word at about 10:03 p.m. CT that the concert was in the process of shutting down but witnesses say Scott and Drake kept performing.

Scott's attorneys have said their client did not know about the deaths and injuries until after the show. Other news reports have quoted sources saying Drake was also unaware of what had happened. In an Instagram post Drake said his heart was ""broken for the families and friends of those who lost their lives and for anyone who is suffering.""

Some lawsuits claim both negligence — that all the defendants failed to take reasonable precautions to protect against physical injuries and death — and gross negligence meaning the defendants were aware of the risk but consciously disregarded those risks.

Responsibility to take steps

As for Scott's potential liability if he was able to see and observe that harm was occurring as a result of the way the concert was being conducted then he had a responsibility to take steps to stop that harm according to C.J. Baker a Texas-based injury lawyer.

""There's a lot of video out there. And if that video ultimately shows that he could tell or that he should have been able to tell then he could have prevented the harm by ending the show sooner.or by taking some kind of steps to prevent it"" he said.

Scott has history that could also play a role in any legal proceedings. He previously pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges related to two separate incidents of encouraging fans to rush the stage once at a 2015 music festival in Chicago and later at a 2017 concert in Arkansas local media in both places reported at the time.

However as for Drake Baker said it 's too soon to tell exactly what role he played at Astroworld.

""But it's important that everyone who was involved in the concert be brought into the lawsuit so that we can figure out through the discovery process who bears what fault"" he said.

Ezra Blount died at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston family attorney Ben Crump said.

The tragedy brought the death toll from the Nov. 5 concert to 10. College student Bharti Shahani died Nov. 10 and eight others were pronounced dead the night of the event.

The devastated father of Ezra Blount had held onto hope until the end.

“I could tell that he was damaged” Treston Blount told ABC 13 on Friday. “I’m not ready to lose my boy at all. We still got a bunch of living to do. … That’s my boy.”

“The Blount family tonight is grieving the incomprehensible loss of their precious young son” said civil rights attorney Crump who has filed nearly 100 lawsuits on behalf of the Blounts and other bereaved families in a news release Sunday. “This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert what should have been a joyful celebration. Ezra’s death is absolutely heartbreaking. We are committed to seeking answers and justice for the Blount family. But tonight we stand in solidarity with the family in grief and in prayer.”

Ezra who his father described as a huge Scott fan was on his dad’s shoulders when Treston fell unconscious in the out-of-control crowd. By the time he came to Ezra had seemingly vanished.

Eventually the Blounts tracked Ezra down at a local hospital where he had been admitted as a John Doe.

Rapper Travis Scott left and 9-year-old Ezra Blount

Doctors found severe swelling in Ezra’s brain and the young boy went into cardiac arrest either at the concert or on the way to the hospital according to a lawsuit obtained by the Daily News. Ezra also suffered liver and kidney damage after being “kicked stepped on and trampled and nearly crushed to death.”

The Blounts with the help of Crump have filed a lawsuit against Scott ScoreMore Management Live Nation Entertainment Cactus Jack Records and others. In total more than 100 lawsuits have been filed after the deadly concert many accusing Scott of negligence.

The rapper’s attorneys have decried the finger-pointing saying Scott cannot be held responsible for the crowd and that he had no idea how rowdy his audience got.

“Travis didn’t really understand the full effect of everything until the next morning. Truly he did not know what was going on” one of his lawyers Edwin McPherson said on “Good Morning America” Friday.

“Understand that when he’s up on the stage and he has flashpots going off around him and he has an ear monitor that has music blasting through it and his own voice he can’t hear anything he can’t see anything.”

Scott has offered to pay for the funerals of the concertgoers and therapy for the survivors."

Last year India signed a USD $2.1 billion deal with the United States Government as part of its Foreign Military Sales program for the purchase of 24 Lockheed Martin anti-submarine MH-60R helicopters. The first three of these MH-60R all-weather helicopters which can support multiple missions with state-of-the-art avionics and sensors have been delivered to the Indian Navy and are currently undergoing pilot and crew training in the United States.

The delivery of 24 helicopters will be completed in five years from the time the deal was concluded. The helicopters will be modified with a variety of “India-unique” equipment and weapons. The induction of these fourth-generation MH-60Rs is expected to further enhance the Indian Navy’s three-dimensional capabilities.

“We are honored to have been selected to manufacture wire harnesses for the MH-60R an important equipment for India. We are committed to producing high-quality parts on time from India furthering India’s growing strength in manufacturing to global standards and contributing to Aatmanirbhar Bharat” said Mr. Prabhat Kumar Bhagvandas chief executive officer Rossell Techsys.

The seat a derivative of the company’s Mk. 18 escape system was selected by Lockheed Martin as part of an open competition.

The installation of the seat on F-16 Block 70s for Foreign Military Sales customers is the first time the UK ejection seat manufacturer has had a seat installed on the ubiquitous single-engine fighter. The seat is due to enter production in 2023.

Four countries have signed up to purchase new-build Block 70 F-16C/Ds—Bahrain Bulgaria Morocco and Slovakia.

Until now all other F-16s apart from the prototype YF-16s have been fitted with variants of the Collins Aerospace Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES II).

Martin-Baker says the US18E seat replaces the ACES II without affecting cockpit or canopy systems and also features head and neck load protection through the use of a head support panel and neck protection device. Both systems are particularly important as more and more fighter aircraft adopt new helmet-mounted sights.

The seat also has been designed for different sized pilots including the so-called Case 1 described as the smallest pilots on an anthropometric scale.

Commenting on the selection Steve Roberts head of business development at Martin-Baker said the company was “confident that the new US18E Ejection Seat offers new unprecedented life-saving capabilities” for the F-16 Block 70.

The Mk. 18 ejection seat also has been adopted for use on the indigenous Korea Aerospace Industries KF-21 Boraemae. Testing of the KF-21 seat called the KR18A will begin in early 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExL3dpbGwtdGhlLXVhZS1hY3R1YWxseS1nZXQtZi0zNS1ob3ctaHVhd2VpLXJ1c3NpYS1mYWN0b3ItaW50by1kZWNpc2lvbi_SAXBodHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS93aWxsLXRoZS11YWUtYWN0dWFsbHktZ2V0LWYtMzUtaG93LWh1YXdlaS1ydXNzaWEtZmFjdG9yLWludG8tZGVjaXNpb24vP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the UAE actually get F-35? How Huawei Russia factor into decision,"DUBAI: It is no secret that the F-35 fighter deal to the UAE is politically sensitive tied up with questions about the UAE’s military actions in Yemen and maintaining Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge in the region. But the impact of Russia and China America’s great power competitors on the question of the sale is a growing factor that can’t be ignored.

For several months rumors have abounded that the Biden administration is holding up movement on the F-35 sale — cleared in the literal last hours of the Trump administration — unless the Emiratis agreed to terminate a 5G contract with Chinese technology firm Huawei. On the record officials from both the UAE and the US have avoided confirming that situation.

However ahead of the Dubai Airshow when all three major powers are expected to show of their wares to the Middle Eastern market a reliable UAE military source tells Breaking Defense that Emirati leadership understands the severing of ties with Huawei to be a red line on moving the F-35 deal forward.

“It is very unlikely the UAE will do so” he said. “The [UAE] leadership is now ignoring the Biden admin and letting the defense companies and its lobby do their work on the Hill.”

Asked directly by Breaking Defense whether the US was conditioning the F-35 sale on Huawei Mira Resnick the US deputy assistant secretary of state for regional security said that the United States has made clear to the UAE and other partners that “untrusted vendors represent a threat to their own security [and] to US security.

“We are working with with partners around the world to look at other options there to make sure that their security can be maintained” she said during the Nov. 12 exclusive interview.

While noting the US is “fully committed” to moving forward to the sale Resnick added that “I think that there are a number of obligations when it comes to technology security that the UAE must be able to provide assurances on and and we are looking for clarification of those assurances.”

Her comments underscore that Huawei’s presence as the primary 5G provider for the UAE would enable the Chinese to possible steal American technology including from the highly-networked F-35.

“The Biden administration went as far as requesting Abu Dhabi to choose between the Chinese technology and the F-35” said Fadi Assaf co-founder of Beirut-based consultancy Middle East Strategic Perspectives (MESP). “This issue seems nonnegotiable” he added. “How would Abu Dhabi deal with it? Will it look for alternatives or offer guaranties?”

If the US is holding firm on a no-Huawei line for the F-35 “The UAE will have to follow suit of UK in giving up the Huawei 5G contract with China in favor of joining the F-35 club for national security purposes” said Kuwaiti defense expert Ali Al Hashim.

The UK’s mobile providers are being banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after Dec. 31 and they must also remove all the Chinese firm’s 5G kit from their networks by 2027.

From its end the UAE has attempted to quiet concerns regarding the overall F-35 deal. In a clear message a year ago Ambassador to Washington Youssef Al Otaiba said in a tweet: “There has never been a report of US technology being diverted to an adversary by the UAE. For more than 20 years the US has entrusted the UAE to purchase and operate F-16s Patriots THAAD and many other of the most advanced US-supplied defense systems.”

Getting the F-35 isn’t just a matter of upgrading the UAE’s military. There is also a major prestige factor at stake; the UAE has long thought of themselves as the likely first Arab recipient of the jet and they cannot imagine being excluded from the program said Assaf.

“They consider themselves as totally legitimate” said Assaf. “The UAE is the US’s closest Arab ally and is now deepening its partnership with Israel sharing with both countries most of their strategic concerns and geopolitical priorities. Enhancing interoperability with their allies is too a high priority for their Armed Forces.”

Hence the UAE is motivated to make the deal happen — and there are plenty of supporters in Washington thanks to the industrial impact and a desire to keep the Emiratis closely tied to US strategic interests.

As a result said Bilal Saab a former Pentagon official now director of the defense and security program at the Middle East Institute “When the political dust settles in Washington I expect Emirati fighter pilots to be operating a variant of the F-35 some time in the next few years.”

Prime contractor Lockheed Martin unsurprisingly remains fully committed to the program showcasing a full-scale model of the F-35 jet at the Dubai air show taking place here. “We see strong global interest in the F-35 and look for opportunities at trade shows to showcase why the F-35 is the most advanced capable and affordable aircraft available as the only 5th generation fighter” a Lockheed Martin spokesperson told Breaking Defense.

Asked about the Huawei situation the spokesperson responded “Questions about foreign military sales of the F-35 are best addressed by the US government and questions about the UAE’s interest in F-35 are best addressed by the UAE government.”

Russia seeks to put UAE in Checkmate

While the US and China politically duke it out behind the scenes Russia is not-so-subtly pitching a potential replacement should the F-35 deal fall apart.

Russia’s Su-75 Checkmate fifth-generation single-engine fighter will be be making its international debut following its unveiling at the MAKS-2021 air show in July.

“Russia is mainly trying to win more support from the Emiratis for this program” said the UAE military source. “The Emiratis on the other hand could benefit from this to send a very strong signal to Washington that they have other options in case they want to undo the F-35 deal.”

RELATED: Russia’s New SU-75 Checkmate Promises A Lot. Can It Deliver?

So as a plan B the UAE could go for either a Russian alternative or a sort of a second best fighter jet probably the French Rafale. At least that’s on paper. Analysts are less convinced that’s a real option for the UAE.

“That will only happen if they sense that there will be more delays in the [F-35] program or that strict conditions are imposed to the use of the F-35s or if there is a risk of further downgrading their systems” said Assaf.

The UAE will consider procuring fighter jets from other countries “if and only if the deal with the US falls apart” predicted Saab. “Abu Dhabi fully understands how sensitive this topic is for US decision makers.”

Added Samuel Archer a senior military analyst with Aviation Week “While UAE flirting with the checkmate could even be likely actual procurement of the system is fairly unrealistic.” He called the UAE buying the Su-75 “unrealistic.”

Analysts also question where Russia’s new fighter will perform as advertised by the scheduled production timeframe.

“Sukhoi and the Russians are depending on new technology to set the Su-75 apart from western 5th gen fighters but new technology hasn’t been Russia’s strong suit in recent decades” said Brandon C. Patrick a Mid-East defense analyst. “The idea that Russia will as they’ve put it offer a 5th generation platform capable of consistently defeating its western counterparts seems far-fetched.”

Al Hashim sees eye to eye. “The checkmate still needs to prove itself first to even compete with the F-35” he said. “Even if the UAE decided to invest in the new Russian technology it would have to wait for at least seven to ten years to have it ready assuming the Russians would cooperate in all development aspects.”

Back at IDEX 2017 Rostec and the UAE announced they will be co-developing a fifth generation joint light fighter aircraft. Clearly that hasn’t materialized which may provide a clear view on how the UAE views its partnership with Russia.

“The attempt to co-develop a fifth-gen fighter with the UAE is very like the attempt to co-develop with India in the FGFA project that also seemingly evaporated” said Archer. “The program announced in 2017 is as dead as the FGFA but Russia is almost certainly still pursuing both opportunities.”

The Checkmate seems to embody this. “It really was not made to fill a domestic requirement but secure a major export customer and hopefully also a developmental partner to justify continued development of the Su-57 and other next-gen fighter technology” concluded Archer.

— John F. Kennedy

It was inevitable.

The madness that US President John F. Kennedy foresaw in the early 1960s of his administration has come to pass.

Mankind is now making weapons that simply cannot be stopped.

This week the US Army’s 56th Artillery Command based in the Western District of Mainz-Kastel Germany held a quiet recommissioning ceremony UK’s The Sun reported.

It was a move completely ignored by the rest of the world but it sure made a splash at the Kremlin in Moscow. That you can bet on.

The ceremony in question involved the reactivation of a nuclear unit in Germany since the Cold War.

It is now armed with “Dark Eagle” — a long-range hypersonic weapon (LRHW) capable of travelling at 4000 mph.

The message was clear … Dark Eagle could blitz Russia in just 21 minutes and 30 seconds.

The decision to reactivate is amid the growing concerns in the Pentagon that Russia has succeeded NATO and the US in creating long-range artillery rockets.

The Command was first formed in 1942 and fought in Europe during World War II but was deactivated in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union.

The commanding general of the artillery unit General Stephen Maranian said the development will “provide the US Army Europe and Africa with significant capabilities in multi-domain operations.”

It was believed that the US was falling behind in the creation of a hypersonic weapon until last month when it was announced that the US had completed its delivery of the Dark Eagle.

“From a blank piece of paper in March 2019 we along with our industry partners and joint services delivered this hardware in just over two years. Now Soldiers can begin training” Lt. Gen. L. Neil Thurgood said in a statement.

“It’s going to be a battery of four launchers two missiles per for basic load of eight” Bob Strider Deputy Director of the Army Hypersonic Project Office told The Drive at the annual Space and Missile Defense Symposium in August.

“It’s going to be a Battery Operations Center — that’s our C2 system that is based against an AFATDS the [Advanced] Field Artillery Tactical Data System …. with a support vehicle.”

“This will be a road-mobile system which is critical the ability to move around the battlefield” he added.

In its statement on the prototype LRHW delivery the Army says the weapon once fielded will “provide a unique combination of speed maneuverability and altitude to defeat time-critical heavily defended and high-value targets.”

As far as speed is concerned the Pentagon has previously said that the Common Hypersonic Glide Body or C-HGB will be capable of reaching a maximum speed of Mach 17.

It also said it would be able to strike targets at a distance of at least 1725 miles.

Last month China appeared to have taken a shock lead in the hypersonic arms race after it was revealed that Beijing flew a nuclear-capable missile around the world.

US intelligence and military officials were reportedly left stunned after China launched a rocket in space carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) that circled the globe before speeding towards its target.

The next generation of weapons can hit speeds of up to 21000 mph — and potentially even faster — and are seen as a devastating new frontier for warfare.

Hypersonic missiles are a game-changer because unlike ballistic missiles which fly into space before returning on steep trajectories they zoom in on targets at lower altitudes.

This combined with typical speeds of five times the speed of sound – or around 4000mph – makes them extremely hard if not impossible to shoot down.

China — followed closely by Russia — are regarded as having the most potent hypersonic missile arsenals pouring billions into them but others are catching up.

Still the shocking revelations of their missile test back in August has sent shockwaves through Western intelligence who fear they actually underestimated Beijing.

US intelligence and military officials were reportedly left stunned after China launched a rocket in space carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle that circled the globe before speeding towards its target.

Circling the globe it shows the weapon potentially has a range of some 25000 miles and can operate in space.

It means the missile can theoretically hit anywhere on Earth — a terrifying thought for military planners at the Pentagon.

Previously referred to as Project 4202 Russia’s Avangard is a boost-glide Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) missile system that was first unveiled during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 2018 annual state-of-the-nation address.

“The Avangard is invulnerable to intercept by any existing and prospective missile defense means of the potential adversary” the Russian leader boasted in Krushchev fashion.

As an HGV Avangard combines a high-performance ballistic missile with an unmanned glider vehicle. Once the missile reaches a sufficient altitude the glide vehicle separates to find its target at staggeringly high speeds drastically reducing the window of opportunity for successful interception.

The weapon can reportedly travel at up to Mach 27 and is capable of maneuvering mid-flight potentially allowing it to overcome even the most sophisticated enemy missile defenses through sheer speed and flight path alteration.

The Army worked with industry to build the industrial base for the hypersonic weapon glide body because the domestic private sector had never built one.

The service also separately produced launchers trucks trailers and the battle operation center necessary to put together the weapon battery.

“We took existing trailers and modified them with hydraulics and electronics and everything associated with being a launcher” said Robert Strider the deputy director of the Army Hypersonic Project Office.

“We are number three in this race. We have to catch up.”

Transportable on board an Air Force C-17 Globemaster III the LRHW is intended to be road-mobile such that it can hold targets at risk from multiple changing locations to maximize surprise and speed of attack.

“We will shoot exactly the same thing the Navy shoots out of a sub or ship” said Strider.

Lockheed Martin is the weapon system integrator for the Army’s hypersonic capability that will be launched from a mobile truck. Dynetics was chosen to build the glide body for the missile.

The focus of the exhibition is next-generation fighter aircraft and unmanned aerial systems. Apart from Russia’s latest stealth aircraft Checkmate American F-35 and MQ-9 Reaper drones have also become a hot topic in this edition of the event.

All eyes will be on whether previous agreements reached by the Trump administration to sell the Lockheed Martin F-35 and the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drone to the UAE will be fulfilled. The Biden administration has put the entire agreement under review.

If the UAE becomes successful in completing this contract it will boost the standing of its air force and make the UAE the first Arab country to own these weapons.

Richard Aboulafia vice president of analysis at Teal Group told CNBC that the UAE has had a major fighter aircraft requirement for a long time and is now considering purchasing the F-35 which is of course riddled with issues.

The $23-billion contract which was finalized by the Trump administration includes the sale of 50 F-35 fighter jets and at least 18 armed drones.

The US historically has ruled out the selling of the F-35 to the UAE due to a legislative obligation to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge in the Middle East. All of that changed in August 2020 when Israel and the UAE inked the Abraham Accords restoring relations and clearing the road for cooperation and trade in practically every industry.

Previously US export restrictions prohibited the sale of armed drones to any of its Arab allies.

Combat Drones

Drones are undeniably playing a key role in today’s warfare; practically every government in the world is either acquiring or developing drones to meet their specific needs.

When it comes to the world’s greatest and most sophisticated unmanned aerial weaponry Turkey the United States China and Russia are among the leading players in the defense market.

Some of the world’s most technologically advanced drones will be showcased in the Dubai Airshow. According to Kronshtadt a Russian military system manufacturer it will demonstrate a new control system that will give swarming army drones more autonomy.

The system incorporates cutting-edge information technology such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality as well as 3D terrain visualization.

Instead of just directing and commanding each drone individually and computing flight routes this sophisticated system according to Kronshtadt would set a goal for the swarming drones to “agree” on the order of operations task division and urgency.

American company Fortem Technologies a pioneer in airspace security and defense officially confirmed its participation at this year’s Dubai Airshow.

Its latest offering SkyDome System 3.7 commands the longest distance for safely stopping an autonomous drone threat entering a protected venue campus or metro region.

The UAE and some of its neighbors have been purchasing Chinese-made Wing Loong weaponized drones. However the deals are fraught with complications.

Apart from some performance concerns the Chinese technology cannot be connected with the UAE’s command and control systems which were developed by American firms.

US-UAE Defense Deals Under Biden

At the start of his presidency Biden announced a review of the major arms contracts with the UAE but later said in April that the sale could go through. However momentum was halted shortly afterward apparently due to Washington’s concerns over the UAE’s expanding relations with China.

According to reports the Biden administration has been pushing UAE to remove Huawei Technologies from its telecoms network and abandon other Chinese military technology over security concerns.

To make the UAE’s traditional network more reliable Huawei and UAE-based telecommunication provider ‘du’ introduced the world’s first commercial transport software-defined network on the host network in 2016.

After a few years the UAE’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority asked the tech giant to open a “5G & IoT Joint OpenLab” in Dubai.

In May the Wall Street Journal reported that two Chinese military planes landed on a UAE airfield and transported unidentified material. However the concerns were dismissed by the UAE government.

Yousef al-Otaiba UAE’s Ambassador to the US said that Abu Dhabi has a long history of safeguarding American military technologies. He emphasized that they had worked alongside the US military and in the UAE for many years where a wide spectrum of sensitive US military assets are stationed.

Russia’s Checkmate

The Russian state corporation Rostec will present its new stealth fifth-generation fighter aircraft Su-75 Checkmate at Dubai Airshow the aircraft’s first overseas event.

According to Emirates News Agency (WAM) Viktor Kladov Director of Rostec’s International Cooperation and Regional Policy Department said that the single-engine light tactical aircraft is likely to pique “great attention from the Middle East region” as it exhibits apparent advantages.

The aircraft can concurrently seek and detect targets scan space and carry out mapping prevent jamming and jam the enemy owing to its low visibility a built-in optical location station airborne electronic security systems and an Active Phased Array Radar (APAR). As Russia Takes Its Latest Fighter Jet To Dubai Will Su-75 ‘Checkmate’ American F-35 Aircraft For UAE Deal?

The first flight is scheduled for 2023 and serial production will begin in 2026. Within the next 15 years Rostec’s United Aircraft Corporation expects to produce roughly 300 Checkmate combat jets.

Besides Checkmate Russia will display at the Dubai Airshow in 2021. A modernized Ka-226T helicopter is one of the items and it is the first helicopter in Russia to be built using digital design documentation."

As an avid Home Depot shopper this deeply saddens me. The ability for me to grab a meal while I'm grabbing supplies is a job-saver. I don't need more shitty grills or fence displays outside.

What a shame. The ability to grab lunch and some supplies for work in one stop was such a time-saver.

Why is Home Depot trying to shut down people's businesses and livelihoods?

They should be using all that parking-lot space to bring in food trucks — and that my friends would attract more customers. This is a disgusting moment for them to shut down the little guy vs a big greedy corporation.

Many amenities have been lost to the pandemic — including the hot dog stands outside of metro area Home Depot and Lowe’s stores . Back in January vendors at these locations were told they had thirty days to remove their equipment and they haven't been invited back. ""We’re continuously evaluating the needs of our business and we found that in some areas we need to repurpose the space to better serve our customers’ home improvement needs"" a Home Depot spokesperson toldthis fall. ""The fact is that all food vendors at our stores have remained closed since March 2020 and many voluntarily chose to move their business somewhere else during that time.""But another fact is that many of these vendors did not want to leave and would happily reopen at their old locations today. “At my Lowe’s they replaced my hot dog stand with a water cooler” says one vendor.

According to actor Rob Lowe a close friend of Johnson the tweets that have made the Lakers great a viral sensation for stating the obvious are done by an assistant who turns what Johnson says out loud into a tweet.

“Last night I found out Magic Johnson does not physically do any of the tweets which may explain some of it” Lowe said on the Pardon My Take podcast on Friday. “So it’s articulated clearly across the room while he’s doing 17 other things — a titan of the industry — and then there is a woman whose job it is to figure out what he’s talking about and make it into a tweet.”

If we can take Lowe’s word for it here this of course sounds brilliant. The 62-year-old Johnson who has 5.1 million Twitter followers wouldn’t be the first celebrity to have a social media manager but to do it in quite that style seems to explain a lot.

“I think he doesn’t say ‘Send tweet’ so she never knows when it’s ending so you get what you get” Lowe said. “I can promise here’s what it’s not ‘Hey hello. I have an idea for a tweet. Are you ready? Lakers look very stiff tonight period. Perhaps they need a change in the lineup period. Send that.’ I don’t think that’s happening.”

We got a hint of this over the summer when ESPN’s Christine Williamson said on SportsNation that she knew the person who wrote Johnson’s tweets. Williamson said on the show that the person kept things basic because she was afraid of accidentally making him look bad. Though according to Lowe Johnson doesn’t know his own account’s notoriety.

“I’m not sure he’s aware of what a viral sensation he is” Lowe said.

If the pass goes then a try not so much beckons but is a racing certainty. New Zealand's shot at an unlikely redemption was snuffed out in a nanosecond.

Lowe’s read was as beautiful as his timing. Peter O’Mahony completed the pincer movement by latching onto the ball and winning a penalty turnover. Two independent actions fused in perfect harmony. The explosion of noise from the stands was both recognition for the actions of the two players and a massive outpouring of relief.

The Irish wing offered his insight into the pivotal play flecked with typical humour. “I saw we were in trouble. I thought ’sh*t we are under the pump here’. And then I just tried to anticipate where I thought the ball was going to be get myself in a better position make the tackle and was able to wrap and then Peter O’Mahony got the turnover.

“Mate it was huge. What you boll****s always get on to me about (defence) I’ve been working on for the last six months. Hopefully you can abuse me for something else.”

So was it better than the try he scored on 13 minutes dotting down in the corner in defiance of Jordie Barrett’s last ditch tackle. “100 percent that’s what I told you I’d been working on to be able to show it on the biggest stage [80]minutes of rugby that’s what it’s about.”

Ireland were challenged to back up the performance notes in the victory over Japan and they were pitch perfect in many respects. They demonstrated the courage to play using the full expanse of the pitch and cleverly switching the points of attack. They won the gainline battle for large tranches of the game.

Lowe agreed that Andy Farrell’s Ireland has a playing identity that’s become really clear and clicked impressively in the last two matches. “We’re playing the way rugby should be played. Tight shapes connections out the back boys wanting to be on the front foot boys wanting to catch the ball on the line a little bit of footwork get the hands free.

“To play against the best team the way they probably play the game and to beat them at their own game in a lot of ways it’s huge for the confidence. I feel like people will be like ‘that’s not the Ireland of old the box-kick Ireland it’s playing off the cuff pretty tight shapes making defenders make decisions. It’s huge and it’s what we want to carry on doing.”

He admitted that he was pretty blown away by the atmosphere. “Absolutely amazing the whole cliché of the 16th man sort of thing it was electric from start to finish; when we needed a lift they were there. When we needed an extra hand the crowd was there they stayed around to the end.

“We could feel it from the start; we felt it at the end. I’m ecstatic I’ve never played in something like that before.”

So how did it feel playing against the country of his birth? Weird? Motivating? He smiled: “It was all of those things. Confusion. There was a sense of pride to be able to stand in front of the haka; there was a sense of stress. But we played footy and won.

“We didn’t play negative footy like the stereotype South Africa. They’re not playing the game the way it should be played when they win. We’ve got our own identity and it’s great. Sorry I’m mentally fatigued; I’ll probably just ramble on. I get confused at the best of times I’m sorry.”

""You b******s always talk about my D"" - Lowe on defensive criticism after All Blacks win

Ireland winger James Lowe won't be paying much attention to any criticism of his defensive input after a clutch tackle in the final minutes of Saturday's 29-20 win over world No. 1 New Zealand.

Andy Farrell's side weathered a storm at the Aviva Stadium to come up with the win following scores from Lowe along with Leinster team-mates Ronan Kelleher and Caelan Doris.

It's the third time in five meetings that Ireland have got the better of their southern-hemisphere rivals and it just so happened to come with three New Zealand-born talents in their starting XV.

Lowe is highly touted going forward with the ball but the 29-year-old has encountered criticism of his defence in the past both for club and country.

He won't stand for that talk anymore however after it was his rush out of the line to wrap up New Zealand centre Rieko Ioane that led to a titanic turnover in the 72nd minute:

“You b********s always talk about my [defence] and I got up and I whacked Rieko and we got the turnover from it"" he told Channel 4 after Saturday's special win.

""I don’t care about that first try I don’t care about anything. It was that moment to do everything I’ve been doing in the last six or seven months in the 70 minutes that’s what I’m happy about.”

As significant as the win was for all of Ireland it will have held special significance to New Zealand natives Lowe Jamison Gibson-Park and Bundee Aki.

Each among that trio enjoyed moderate Super Rugby success but have cemented themselves as stars in Ireland particularly since coming to feature for their adopted national team.

“It's amazing. Never in a million years did I think this day would come"" Lowe said before acknowledging his old desire to pull on New Zealand's black.

Dear MarketWatch

I am 67 and have not yet taken my Social Security benefits.

I am still working. In fact I got a $30000 raise in July 2023. I am trying to save for retirement. With my new salary I can afford to put more into my government savings plan but of course I know I will never catch up on all the years I couldn’t contribute. I will receive a pension from my government agency.

I thought I would maybe take my Social Security now pay my bills with that and take money from my paycheck to put in my government savings plan. I am allowed to contribute up to the amount of $30000 a year as a pretax catch-up. I have $25000 in my government savings plan. It’s not very much but I am saving. I don’t have a financial adviser because no one‘s going to take $25000 as a total investment — it would need to be much more than that.

Can you make any recommendations?

Trying to Save

Dear Trying

You’re trying and that’s significantly better than giving up on your retirement savings goals — please remember that.

As for your Social Security the good news is you’re past your Full Retirement Age so you’d get more than 100% of the benefits you’re owed. The iffy news — while you would get more in benefits if you’re still working you’ll have to pay more for that money too.

There is no rule that says you can’t claim Social Security while still working but you should consider the impact it could have. For people who are under Full Retirement Age their benefits can be temporarily reduced (although they would get that money back). This does not apply to you since you are past FRA but it is important to note for any fellow readers who might not have reached that milestone yet.

What will impact you however are taxes. If your combined income which constitutes as any earned income plus 50% of your benefit is between $25000 and $34000 per year for single filers or between $32000 to $44000 a year for married individuals filing jointly Social Security benefits may be taxed up to 50%. For single filers with an annual combined income of more than $34000 or more than $44000 for individuals married filing jointly the percentage of benefits taxed goes up to 85% according to the Social Security Administration.

Story continues

You mentioned your raise was $30000 and that you are allowed to put up to $30000 in your government plan. If you were living comfortably prior to your raise consider putting more into your retirement plan because you might not feel it as much as you would have prior to the raise. Of course you do need to live so contribute as much as you can without putting yourself in a perilous situation.

You may not have as much as you would like in your retirement savings account but you do also get a pension which is not common these days (at least for workers in the private sector). If you continue to hold out on claiming Social Security benefits you would get up to 8% per year that you delay until age 70. That extra money can certainly help you pay the bills in the future and would mean paying less in taxes now.

What matters most is what you’re doing now to take care of yourself in the future. There are so many reasons people aren’t able to contribute to their retirement plans — the cost of living raising a family education health expenses emergencies and so on. That you’re doing the numbers now and you’re still working (and with a raise no less) puts you in a good spot to optimize your strategies for your later years.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Still Reigning With $52M-$55M Opening – Saturday Box Office Update,"SATURDAY AM: For those hooked on a theory last weekend that star power no longer works in opening films their concerns are further underscored this weekend as a bunch of no-name apes are driving 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to what might be the biggest B.O. opening this May of $52M-$55M. This is all fueled by PLFs and Imax screens which are delivering 44% of the weekend’s till. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits showed that 43% of the moviegoers bought tickets because they love the franchise natch.

We’ll see if a Cannes Premiere this week can lift Furiosa past its current $40M-$50M projection but word of mouth is excellent out of early screenings for the George Miller directed Mad Max: Fury Road prequel. Unlike Disney with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny last Cannes a movie that wasn’t ready for primetime Warners is truly in pole position here to blast Furiosa off.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes posted a very good Friday of $22.2M thanks to late night business which isn’t that far from the first Friday results of Tim Burton’s 2001 version ($24.6M) and ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M) and pennies lighter than War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M). However the Wes Ball directed version of the 56-year old franchise gets a B Cinemascore and 3 1/2 stars/77% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak so hopefully these apes don’t lose their muscle. On a whole 85% of the CinemaScore audience gave Kingdom an A or a B. That’s one of the lowest grades for an Apes movie in the millennium down there with Burton’s which got a B-. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience score has eased to 79%. Still good on Disney for getting this movie opened their first try with the franchise post 20th Century Fox. Despite the audience exits there’s confidence at Disney for the sequel to arrive at the higher end of its projections due to its better-than-expected Friday.

Social media monitor RelishMix detected mixed to positive word of mouth before Kingdom‘s opening. That said on the bright side: “Fans anticipating the sequel seem excited primarily because of one thing — sheer love for the past three films. ‘This looks freaking incredible. I gotta rewatch all the previous ones before this comes out. These movies are so cool.’ The quality of the past films is driving immense interest in this one” ‘This is one of the best franchises ever made. Every movie was awesome. A near-perfect trilogy. I was not expecting a fourth installment but man this looks great!’ Whatever direction the Apes franchise goes next it looks like fans will follow.”

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes saw 64% men turnout with 18-34 year olds repping 57% of the audience with the 25-34 year old segment being the biggest demo at close to a third. Solid diversity demos in 35% Caucasian 27% Latino and Hispanic 22% Black and 9% Asian. Those moviegoers going bananas for this sequel were in the South South Central and West. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing theater in the nation with $67K.

The social media universe for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stands at 331.6M followers across TikTok Facebook X YouTube and Instagram. Compared to other action sci-fi comps Kingdom‘s smu runs 24% above genre norms but below recent pics such as Dune: Part Two (575.7M) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (508.8M) and even Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (393M).

Ryan Gosling in ‘The Fall Guy’ Universal Pictures

Universal’s second weekend of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s Fall Guy is eyeing $14.4M -48% a very good hold. The second weekend is better than Lost City‘s -51% but a little lighter as that Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum film posted $14.7M. The pic’s slither out of the gate had more to do with the marketplace and the insider type of movie that it was and less about stars — it was Gosling’s third highest opening of his career. Some were even put off by the mixed genres. “It’s a problem when you’re pushing a romantic comedy and a majority of men show up” sniped one rival studio source.

Elsewhere there’s Briarcliff Entertainment’s comedy satire Not Another Church Movie booked at 1108 theaters which had no P&A spend and is resulting in $120K Friday and a $300K 3-day. Critics didn’t think it was funny at 17% on RT nor did moviegoers at 44%. Johnny Mack wrote and directed the movie which stars Mickey Rouke as the Devil Jamie Foxx as God and Kevin Daniels as Taylor Pharry.

Overall weekend stands at $93.8M which is 27% ahead of last weekend but 7% off from the same frame in May a year ago when the second weekend of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivered $62M.

Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,"“With regards to the gift and the processing of it and so forth in terms of future processing we’ve already decided it’s in our best interest to put that on hold” Robinson said during the meeting.

The alleged windfall donation to FAMU came from Batterson Farms Corporation’s Gregory Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust and would’ve almost tripled the school’s endowment helping students and faculty for generations. But after the announcement was made — with major fanfare during a Saturday commencement ceremony — skepticism quickly quelled the celebration.

For one Batterson Farms Corporation appears to be a relatively small outfit based in Texas selling hydroponic hemp farm products leading some to question how its stocks could be worth millions. The doubts have been heightened by reports about Gerami’s past dealings including a $95 million donation to Coastal Carolina University in 2020 that was terminated by school officials only weeks after it was publicly announced.

FAMU foundation members raised these points during Thursday’s emergency meeting while venting frustrations about how school staff transacted a nine-figure donation without telling them or the board of trustees. Some board members claimed to have learned about the donation from the university’s press release or from friends after graduation. The board of trustees had already called a special meeting for next week to discuss the donation before Thursday’s shock announcement.

“How did we get this far without knowledge of the transaction or the donor?” asked Chekesha Kidd a foundation member who is co-founder and CEO of Kinumi a concierge service.

School leaders — including Robinson and Shawnta Friday-Stroud FAMU’s vice president for university advancement — said they were barred from discussing the gift publicly due to a non-disclosure agreement. They defended accepting the donation from Batterson Farms Corporation noting the potential upside should the company go public. Batterson Farms did not respond to a request for comment about the potential future value of its stock.

Still the shares could be worth “$500 million or it could be zero” Laurence A. Humphries a member of the foundation’s board noted at the meeting.

“Yes there is clearly risk and we are seeing that in everything that has shaken out” Friday-Stroud said during the meeting. “But at the time that was the decision.”

FAMU did not reach out to Coastal Carolina University as they vetted Gerami’s gift officials confirmed Thursday.

That failed donation was one of several red flags that should have been raised during the vetting of FAMU’s gift according to finance experts.

The gift would have been paid out over the next decade according to an agreement obtained through a records request Thursday by the Tallahassee Democrat. The agreement shows that Gerami “donated 14 million shares of stock of intrinsic value worth at least $239000000 and will donate an additional $61000000 over 10 years” — valuations that don’t match what the school announced only days ago.

The agreement though does not specifically name a company and it’s unclear where and how the stocks were valued.

“Where does this valuation come from?” Rebel Cole a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University said in an interview. “It raises more questions than it answers. If I were a dog my hackles would be up.”"
MRO,Marathon Oil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vcHJpbWVtb3Zlcm1hZy5jb20uYXUvbWFyYXRob24tbWFuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marathon MAN,"An Australian-owned and operated company that’s been in business for more than a quarter of a century Liberty Oil appreciates the value of a supremely comfortable and quiet cab environment in minimising the fatigue of its drivers. It’s for this reason among others that the company recently began upgrading some of its fleet with MAN prime movers.

Liberty oil is a fuel and oil distributor that operates around the clock to ensure petroleum products that are the lifeblood of society are available when and where they are required.

The company has a broad customer base including retail fuel stations farmers and commercial businesses to name a few.

All up there are about 80 trucks in the fleet covering the entire spectrum from rigids to triple-trailer roadtrain prime movers that operate all over the country.

Having acquired the first MAN TGS 540 L Cab in November 2020 another eight were added to the fleet throughout 2021.

As a company that views safety as being of utmost importance and also highly values the skills and commitment of its drivers Liberty Oil wanted a brand of prime mover that ticked all the boxes in terms of safety comfort and fatigue reduction measures.

It’s for this reason says Darren Karslake National Operations and Fleet Manager at Liberty Oil that the company has chosen to invest in MAN power.

“My initial experience with MAN trucks was through the relationship between Shell V-Power Racing and Penske which put me in contact with Shannon Mair Penske Australia’s Head of Fleet” Darren says.

“Shannon showed me some of the MANs and I really liked what I saw in terms of the full-on safety and comfort features they come standard with.”

From a driver’s perspective Darren says the MANs are hard to beat. The drivers are pleased that they are not fighting with them all day.

It means importantly at the end of a long shift that they’re not worn out from the experience.

“Our drivers can be on the road for up to 12 hours a day and their feedback is that the MAN trucks provide a level of comfort that is close to the same as driving their own car for the day” Darren says.

Operations require the company to deliver fuel to a wide variety of customers ranging from retail service stations commercial businesses and rural or farming properties to refuelling trains and boats.

Liberty aims for an old-school business approach by striving to conduct in-person meetings with customers as much as possible.

However according to Darren traditional business values do not prevent the team at Liberty from investing in the latest in technological advancements when it comes to the trucks that move its products.

“We purchased our first MAN from the Penske Australia national fleet team in November 2020 and we now have five in our fleet” he says.

“We have three at our depots in Victoria and two at our Queensland depots.”

The Penske national fleet team supported by the company’s Brisbane branch has been very helpful and easy to work with.

“We also deal with Westar Truck Centre in Melbourne. With both organisations we have experienced all-around good communication and assistance” Darren enthuses.

“Some of our vehicles travel hundreds of kilometres a day while others may do less but there is always consistent use of the pumping equipment across the board.”

Penske in Darren’s estimation has been proficient at specifying the right vehicles to suit the application and ensuring every detail is spot on.

“Penske offers fuel tanker setups with the MAN trucks fitted with Liquip pumping and metering equipment to provide the most efficient management of our fuel haulage operations” he says.

“We know we can trust Penske to provide the best equipment for our needs and the highest quality service and support.”

The relatively light tare weight of the MAN TGS 26.540 L Cab model enables a higher payload which translates to greater volume and better flexibility in the movement of product.

While Darren agrees this is an important consideration he stresses that driver welfare always takes precedence in the company’s eyes.

“A low tare weight is always a positive when looking for the maximum payloads however that’s not our top priority” he explains.

“Our business is heavily focused on the safety of our drivers. Without a constant eye on safety and the wellbeing of our drivers we have no service to provide.” It’s a view with which Scott Prossor Depot and Area Manager for Liberty Oil in Bowen and the Whitsundays is in wholehearted agreeance. “Ensuring our drivers are safe at all times is far and away the highest priority in our operations” Scott says.

“Our drivers do about 500 to 600km each day on the road and the MAN trucks’ controls and features mean safety is maintained at the highest level. For example our drivers receive alerts when they get too close to a vehicle in front thanks to the radar and camera that are part of the automatic braking system called Electronic Brake Assist.”

Scott’s region is primarily coastal with many of the trips being from the depot to the fuel terminal and then delivering to farms in the surrounding districts which often means bumpy off-road conditions for the trucks.

In addition to safety the MAN fleet also has a number of inherent features that provide an extra-comfy ride including a quiet and ergonomic cab interior that helps minimise driver fatigue.

“The new MAN vehicle is like a new toy to play with here in our yard” Scott says with a laugh.

“It’s a significant upgrade from the older truck models. The biggest talking point from our drivers has been that the new gear is much more comfortable over longer distances and smoother for off-road hauling.”

The MAN TGS 26.540 L Cab prime movers in the Liberty Oil fleet are ideally suited to local regional and interstate operations pulling single semi-trailer and B-double tanker configurations.

Sporting a 70-tonne Gross Combination Mass (GCM) rating they are powered by MAN’s D26 13-litre inline six-cylinder engine featuring common-rail injection and twin turbochargers with intercooling.

The engine produces 540hp (397kW) and 2500Nm (1850lb/ft) of torque and complies with Euro 5 emissions standards using AdBlue as part of a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system.

Feeding from the engine is a 12-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) which is said to help the trucks deliver market-leading fuel efficiency without sacrificing power or driver comfort. The L sleeper cab provides a generous berth measuring 2240mm wide and 2280mm long beneath in which resides a slide-out refrigerator.

On-board telematics provides a host of information including live vehicle tracking historical location and trip data fuel economy and driver behaviour reports.

There is also Bluetooth connection enabling hands-free phone use. Other standard driver assistance and safety features include disc brakes with electronic braking and anti-lock braking (EBS and ABS) in addition to an important accident mitigation system called Electronic Brake Assist.

EBA uses a radar and camera to constantly monitor the distance between the truck and the vehicle ahead alerting the driver both visually and acoustically if the distance narrows indicating the vehicle in front is slowing.

If the driver fails to react to the warning by applying the brakes automatic emergency braking is deployed to rapidly slow the truck and thus prevent a high-speed collision. During emergency braking an emergency stopping signal (ESS) is activated in addition to the brake lights.

The hazard light system signals the emergency situation to surrounding vehicles by an increasing flashing frequency thereby reducing the risk of a rear-end collision.

Auxiliary braking comes courtesy of MAN’s Brakematic automatically modulated engine brake which helps maintain a safe velocity on steep descents without overuse of the primary braking system.

Anti-Slip Regulator (traction control) Hill Start Aid and Electronic Stability Program are also part of the standard package. Liberty Oil’s TGS 540s ride on a 3875mm wheelbase and feature twin rectangular fuel tanks with a combined capacity of 1200 litres and an 85-litre AdBlue tank.

Completing the package are polished aluminium Front Under-Run Protection System (FUPS)-compliant bullbars with LED light bars to ensure optimum night-time visibility.

It’s for this reason among others that the company recently began upgrading some of its fleet with MAN prime movers.

Liberty oil is a fuel and oil distributor that operates around the clock to ensure petroleum products that are the lifeblood of society are available when and where they are required.

The company has a broad customer base including retail fuel stations farmers and commercial businesses to name a few.

All up there are about 80 trucks in the fleet covering the entire spectrum from rigids to triple-trailer roadtrain prime movers that operate all over the country.

Having acquired the first MAN TGS 540 L Cab in November 2020 another eight were added to the fleet throughout 2021.

As a company that views safety as being of utmost importance and also highly values the skills and commitment of its drivers Liberty Oil wanted a brand of prime mover that ticked all the boxes in terms of safety comfort and fatigue reduction measures.

It’s for this reason says Darren Karslake National Operations and Fleet Manager at Liberty Oil that the company has chosen to invest in MAN power.

“My initial experience with MAN trucks was through the relationship between Shell V-Power Racing and Penske which put me in contact with Shannon Mair Penske Australia’s Head of Fleet” Darren says.

“Shannon showed me some of the MANs and I really liked what I saw in terms of the full-on safety and comfort features they come standard with.”

From a driver’s perspective Darren says the MANs are hard to beat. The drivers are pleased that they are not fighting with them all day.

It means importantly at the end of a long shift that they’re not worn out from the experience.

“Our drivers can be on the road for up to 12 hours a day and their feedback is that the MAN trucks provide a level of comfort that is close to the same as driving their own car for the day” Darren says.

Operations require the company to deliver fuel to a wide variety of customers ranging from retail service stations commercial businesses and rural or farming properties to refuelling trains and boats.

Liberty aims for an old-school business approach by striving to conduct in-person meetings with customers as much as possible.

However according to Darren traditional business values do not prevent the team at Liberty from investing in the latest in technological advancements when it comes to the trucks that move its products.

“We purchased our first MAN from the Penske Australia national fleet team in November 2020 and we now have five in our fleet” he says.

“We have three at our depots in Victoria and two at our Queensland depots.”

The Penske national fleet team supported by the company’s Brisbane branch has been very helpful and easy to work with.

“We also deal with Westar Truck Centre in Melbourne. With both organisations we have experienced all-around good communication and assistance” Darren enthuses.

“Some of our vehicles travel hundreds of kilometres a day while others may do less but there is always consistent use of the pumping equipment across the board.”

Penske in Darren’s estimation has been proficient at specifying the right vehicles to suit the application and ensuring every detail is spot on.

“Penske offers fuel tanker setups with the MAN trucks fitted with Liquip pumping and metering equipment to provide the most efficient management of our fuel haulage operations” he says.

“We know we can trust Penske to provide the best equipment for our needs and the highest quality service and support.”

The relatively light tare weight of the MAN TGS 26.540 L Cab model enables a higher payload which translates to greater volume and better flexibility in the movement of product.

While Darren agrees this is an important consideration he stresses that driver welfare always takes precedence in the company’s eyes.

“A low tare weight is always a positive when looking for the maximum payloads however that’s not our top priority” he explains.

“Our business is heavily focused on the safety of our drivers. Without a constant eye on safety and the wellbeing of our drivers we have no service to provide.” It’s a view with which Scott Prossor Depot and Area Manager for Liberty Oil in Bowen and the Whitsundays is in wholehearted agreeance. “Ensuring our drivers are safe at all times is far and away the highest priority in our operations” Scott says.

“Our drivers do about 500 to 600km each day on the road and the MAN trucks’ controls and features mean safety is maintained at the highest level. For example our drivers receive alerts when they get too close to a vehicle in front thanks to the radar and camera that are part of the automatic braking system called Electronic Brake Assist.”

Scott’s region is primarily coastal with many of the trips being from the depot to the fuel terminal and then delivering to farms in the surrounding districts which often means bumpy off-road conditions for the trucks.

In addition to safety the MAN fleet also has a number of inherent features that provide an extra-comfy ride including a quiet and ergonomic cab interior that helps minimise driver fatigue.

“The new MAN vehicle is like a new toy to play with here in our yard” Scott says with a laugh.

“It’s a significant upgrade from the older truck models. The biggest talking point from our drivers has been that the new gear is much more comfortable over longer distances and smoother for off-road hauling.”

The MAN TGS 26.540 L Cab prime movers in the Liberty Oil fleet are ideally suited to local regional and interstate operations pulling single semi-trailer and B-double tanker configurations.

Sporting a 70-tonne Gross Combination Mass (GCM) rating they are powered by MAN’s D26 13-litre inline six-cylinder engine featuring common-rail injection and twin turbochargers with intercooling.

The engine produces 540hp (397kW) and 2500Nm (1850lb/ft) of torque and complies with Euro 5 emissions standards using AdBlue as part of a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system.

Feeding from the engine is a 12-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) which is said to help the trucks deliver market-leading fuel efficiency without sacrificing power or driver comfort. The L sleeper cab provides a generous berth measuring 2240mm wide and 2280mm long beneath in which resides a slide-out refrigerator.

On-board telematics provides a host of information including live vehicle tracking historical location and trip data fuel economy and driver behaviour reports.

There is also Bluetooth connection enabling hands-free phone use. Other standard driver assistance and safety features include disc brakes with electronic braking and anti-lock braking (EBS and ABS) in addition to an important accident mitigation system called Electronic Brake Assist.

EBA uses a radar and camera to constantly monitor the distance between the truck and the vehicle ahead alerting the driver both visually and acoustically if the distance narrows indicating the vehicle in front is slowing.

If the driver fails to react to the warning by applying the brakes automatic emergency braking is deployed to rapidly slow the truck and thus prevent a high-speed collision. During emergency braking an emergency stopping signal (ESS) is activated in addition to the brake lights.

The hazard light system signals the emergency situation to surrounding vehicles by an increasing flashing frequency thereby reducing the risk of a rear-end collision.

Auxiliary braking comes courtesy of MAN’s Brakematic automatically modulated engine brake which helps maintain a safe velocity on steep descents without overuse of the primary braking system.

Anti-Slip Regulator (traction control) Hill Start Aid and Electronic Stability Program are also part of the standard package. Liberty Oil’s TGS 540s ride on a 3875mm wheelbase and feature twin rectangular fuel tanks with a combined capacity of 1200 litres and an 85-litre AdBlue tank.

Completing the package are polished aluminium Front Under-Run Protection System (FUPS)-compliant bullbars with LED light bars to ensure optimum night-time visibility.

Excerpt.

Congratulations on your leading role at Marriott. Why the interest in hospitality considering that you are trained in accounting?

Thanks I got my bachelor’s degree in Accounting however my first job was at the Marriott headquarters in Bethesda Maryland USA. It was an accounting role but it provided me with a lot of exposure to the hospitality business. I have always been interested in traveling and I saw hospitality as an opportunity to marry this interest with my career. I started looking for graduate school programs and when I found a hospitality MBA program I knew I had found the perfect opportunity to make the move. I got an MBA degree in international hospitality management and I have been in the hospitality industry since.

How did you get to this role and what is the experience like?

After years of consulting on hospitality projects and working for a hotel investment firm I was ready for a role with a hotel operator. I thought a position like this would be the perfect fit for my educational and professional background. I have been in this role for a little over two years now and I remain convinced that this is a great fit and the right move for my personal and professional development. The role puts me at the forefront of the development of the hotel industry in various West African markets and I have found it exhilarating and highly fulfilling.

What are your responsibilities as the Director Lodging Development West Africa?

My role handles the company’s hotel development efforts in West Africa. Since our business model is asset light we partner with the investors who will build and own the hotels that we operate. My job is to identify potential partnerships that will generate new management or franchise hotel agreements that add new hotels to our portfolio. I receive and source new leads negotiate agreement terms with potential partners and coordinate the in-house processes and teams involved in getting a hotel deal from initiation to signing.

As the Director Lodging Development West Africa how really is the Marriott brand doing in the region when compared with other regions in Africa?

It is important to note that we have the largest portfolio and number of hotel brands globally and this of course also translates to many African markets. Currently our portfolio includes brands that have been well known and well-represented in African markets such as Sheraton Four Points by Sheraton Le Meridien and Protea. In total there are 30 hotel brands that can be found in over 132 countries and territories and in more than 7500 hotels. Nigeria is a very important and key growth market and outside of South Africa it has the largest number of hotels of any African country we operate in. We have eight hotels with five more in the pipeline and we continue to focus our growth efforts here and in the rest of West Africa. We also have opened and pipeline hotels in Ghana Senegal Ivory Coast Guinea and Cape Verde which are all major markets in West Africa.

The Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja is the latest and probably the most sophisticated of Marriott hotels in West Africa. How has the new hotel impacted Lagos and the Nigerian hospitality market?

The entrance of the new Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja has elevated the hotel offering in the Lagos market especially in the Ikeja area. The hotel no doubt reflects the newest global design vision for Marriott Hotels and features sophisticated and intuitively designed spaces for today’s modern traveler. It opened in May 2021 in the middle of a global pandemic and this is a great testament to the resilience of the Lagos and Nigerian hospitality market as well as the confidence of our investors. The hotel has performed above expectations so far and is expected to maintain a very positive outlook in the medium and long term. This new addition bodes well for hotel products that are developed to international standards and at the same time targeted at the right demand markets.

What would you like to see more of in the hospitality industry in Nigeria?

I would like to see more institutionalized hotel investors. Hotels are a unique asset class. We need more investors who will take the time to be educated and understand the exceptional nature of hotel assets and also build strong structures around hotel ownership and management. We need investors who are willing to invest in standard international quality hotels at the midscale levels across the country. We need investors who will look beyond the major cities of Lagos and Abuja and into the secondary markets that also have hotel demand generators that are not being adequately satisfied. At the same time we need increased capacity in the training institutions that produce the pipeline of people who work in these hospitality businesses. The supply of hotels restaurants and other hospitality establishments will continue to grow in Nigeria and it is important that we have a better trained workforce in these establishments. It is also an effective way of carrying along significant portions of our population in education job training and employment opportunities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZXRoaW9waWFubW9uaXRvci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xMy9tYXJyaW90dC10by1vcGVyYXRlLW1pZHJvYy1ldGhpb3BpYXMtd2VzdGluLWhvdGVsLWluLWFkZGlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott to Operate Midroc Ethiopia's Westin Hotel in Addis – Ethiopian Monitor,"ADDIS ABABA – Midroc Ethiopia Plc said it has signed an agreement with Marriott International to operate Westin Hotel.

There is one pivotal difference between global trade and shipping in general and the global trade of food specifically. For manufactured goods China largely dominates global trade. That is not the case for food. Food production happens virtually everywhere but few countries are self-sufficient.

Trade is important to them all. But — and this is a significant but — food production and trade are both far more decentralized.

Container Shortages Are Hitting Food Chains

Certainly there are countries that dominate in the production and trade of cereal grains and oilseed — eight countries represent 65% and 85% of these products respectively. But other countries dominate fresh frozen or processed fruits and vegetables as well as animal proteins and seafood. And while cereals and oil seeds might be shipped in the holds of ships most of the food items that people eat that aren’t processed into flour feed or vegetable oils are shipped in containers.

Odd then that much of the current news on the shipping container crisis isn’t focused on food or what percentage of containers are used for global food trade.

What people are not yet talking about but should be are the ghosts in the food system.

While grocery shortages are not as visible now as at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak supply has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Are grocers just better at hiding it? Maybe there’s such an abundance of food products (in certain countries) that it’s not as much of an inconvenience? Food price increases are noticeable — up 4.6%-10% depending on the product — but not quite as harsh as luxury goods like sofas. I recently read that the average price of a sofa is now $1000 more due to shipping costs.

Perhaps it’s because food production is so global and even specialized that trade in food has become increasingly important. Many countries cannot produce what they want to consume because of geographic climatic or other reasons for example tropical crops (coffee cocoa banana pineapple avocado tea) those affected by seasonality (fresh fruits and vegetables) or even because the global prices are much higher than what they can afford domestically (seafood).

Labor Shortages Are Having the Biggest Impact

The biggest impact on every stage of the food supply chain from the field to vessel to fork is the impact of the pandemic on labor even more than container availability. Increasingly people are not willing to bet their life on the kind of low-paying and often dangerous jobs that are most common in food supply chains.

On top of already strenuous jobs almost two years of pandemic stress has taken a very human toll. Seafarers on fishing and container vessels for example aren’t allowed to disembark because of inconsistent border and travel restrictions. And inequitable and unregulated vaccine distribution and varying vaccine regulations means some can’t do their jobs even if they want to.

One study showed that for food workers in restaurants food production and agriculture the risk of dying went up by 40% during a period of the pandemic — and 60% for Latinx workers.

To break the logjam of ships stranded off the coast of the U.S. President Joe Biden plans to open several California ports 24/7. But are there enough workers to staff them? Or will this lead to dock worker strikes which have already occurred in several countries over vaccines and unsafe working conditions?

Furthermore while the pandemic caused this disruption climate change will cause similar disruptions as production becomes more variable and processing and trade volumes follow.

Bad Trade Policies Can Cause Major Food Shocks

Having a more distributed system seems to make the global food system less vulnerable to production shocks. But many of the biggest food shocks have been caused by trade policies which have led to riots and political unrest particularly in cities not in the countryside. Policies that restrict trade from the largest areas of production are precisely what triggered food shortages riots and political unrest in consumer countries that culminated in the Arab Spring. That was precipitated by Russian wheat exports closing due to the fear of domestic price rises in Russia and political instability. And yet history may repeat itself. Russian wheat supplies are low and prices have risen 42% in the past year. After instating a permanent floating-rate tax exports will decrease.

Droughts in the U.S. and Canada have reduced production as well meaning three of the eight largest exporters will have less product on the market. Trade from these eight countries helps fill the global gaps when there are droughts natural disasters or even political upheaval.

Each Year the Impact of Climate On Food Chains Increases

Climate change is now affecting more key production areas each year. In the future it will exacerbate scarcities food shortages national reserves and shipping disruptions. Coastal transport infrastructure (both ports and vessels) is also highly vulnerable to climate change and severe weather events.

The question going forward is how many of the main exporting countries can be affected before we feel the difference from a global food security perspective? The time to watch out for is the 2030s where most of the major production areas are expected to be experiencing a decade-long drought.

What people are not yet talking about but should be are the ghosts in the food system.

Globally we are much more dependent on massive movements of labor to fill shortages in food-producing countries. In the past this was often done through economic enticements or having better benefits than the prospects at home.

How Will We Feed Climate Refugees?

Today many from rural areas are becoming refugees — climate refugees — because they are being pushed out of their homes from food insecurity extreme weather conflict agricultural degradation and lack of water access. In the next 30 years projections suggest that there may be one billion or more of them.

When people are displaced what will this mean both for their ability to find livelihoods and for food production and supply chain labor? What can we redesign now to better prepare for the future?

This all suggests that climate change is already creating rolling impacts on global food production our supply chain infrastructure and food-producing communities themselves. It will be hard to grow ourselves out of this problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The best (and worst) quotes adoption and regulation highlights leading coins predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.

Top Stories This Week

At the start of this week the combined cryptocurrency market cap broke $3 trillion for the first time. The market has fluctuated heavily this year previously topping out at $2.62 trillion during the height of the bull run in May before crashing down to as low as $1.24 trillion in mid-July.

CoinGecko’s data tracks 10418 digital assets across 518 cryptocurrency exchanges and the surging momentum in the latter half of 2021 comes on the back of Bitcoin (BTC) Ether (ETH) Polkadot (DOT) and Solana (SOL) all pushing past new all-time highs.

Bitcoin still remains the dominant force in crypto with its $1.21 trillion market cap being more than double that of second-ranked Ethereum at $550 billion. Meanwhile the combined capitalization of all other crypto assets sits at roughly 40% or $1.24 trillion.

On Tuesday Mastercard announced that it will be launching crypto-linked payment cards across the Asia-Pacific region that will enable users to instantly convert their digital assets into fiat currency.

The cards are being launched in collaboration with three crypto service providers: Amber Group and Bitkub in Thailand and CoinJar in Australia. Mastercard hasn’t outlined what crypto assets will be supported at this stage but did hint that Bitcoin and Ether would be at the top of the list.

“Rather than directly transferring cryptocurrencies to a merchant cardholders will now be able to instantly convert their cryptocurrencies into traditional fiat currency which can be spent everywhere Mastercard is accepted around the world both online and offline” Mastercard said.

NewYorkCityCoin (NYCCoin) launched on Thursday with Mayor-elect Eric Adams giving the coin’s issuers CityCoins a public endorsement ahead of the rollout. Adams stated last week that he wanted to have a CityCoin for NYC that mirrors Miami’s MiamiCoin.

While Adams welcomed the project to New York this week CityCoins has yet to officially partner with the local government. It may want to do so soon however as the NYCCoin project will divert 30% of its mining rewards to a custodied reserve wallet that the local government can use to support whatever initiatives it chooses.

“We’re glad to welcome you to the global home of Web3! We’re counting on tech and innovation to help drive our city forward” Adams said.

According to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission erratic billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk offloaded more than 934000 Tesla shares worth around $1.1 billion on Thursday.

Musk made around a 180% gain on his sold shares with an average sale price of around $1170 marking his largest fire sale of Tesla stock to date. The CEO had teased a potential sale over the weekend after polling his 63 million Twitter followers about whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. The poll was in response to public pushback against billionaires who may or may not have paid their fair share of tax.

This sale only accounted for 1% of Musk’s holdings and the filings show that he planned to sell the stock as part of his tax obligations back in September. The world now awaits if he will sell another 9% to appease the 58% of respondents who voted “yes” to his poll.

Zimbabwe’s government was rumored to be looking at utilizing Bitcoin as a legal tender to meet growing demand in the country according to local news outlets.

The news reported on Nov. 7 suggested that discussions with local businesses are already underway. Retired Brigadier Colonel Charles Wekwete permanent secretary and head of the e-government technology unit in the office of the president and cabinet was confirmed as the source of the speculation.

A couple of days later however news also surfaced that Zimbabwe was not looking to adopt Bitcoin whatsoever and was instead exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Zimbabwe’s minister of information Monica Mutsvangwa had the unfortunate job of quashing the rumors and providing a major buzzkill for Bitcoin maxis.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week Bitcoin (BTC) is at $63185 Ether (ETH) at $4577 and XRP at $1.17. The total market cap is at $2.75 trillion according to CoinMarketCap.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Loopring (LRC) at 100.64% Kadena (KDA) at 99.70% and Livepeer (LPT) at 80.35%.

The top three altcoin losers of the week are OMG Network (OMG) at -25.57% Arweave (AR) at -16.86% and Cosmos (ATOM) at -15.68%.

Prediction of the Week

Digital currency analyst Matthew Hyland recently tweeted his thoughts about Bitcoin’s potential upcoming price action. In short his multi-tweet write-up essentially explained his prediction that BTC will surpass $100000 on its way to $250000 validating one popular price model and invalidating another.

The Stock-to-Flow (S2F) and Stock-to-Flow Cross-Asset (S2FX) price models built by PlanB a pseudonymous Twitter personality known for his Bitcoin analysis each have price targets of upcoming relevancy. December 2021 should tap into a BTC price of at least $100000 per coin according to the S2F model. The S2FX model notes a price expectancy of around $288000 per BTC before the next halving which should occur in 2024.

The price models are based around Bitcoin’s block reward halving cycles. Bitcoin halvings occur every 210000 blocks — which takes about four years. The time in between is the halving cycles.

Essentially Hyland thinks BTC will keep pace with the S2F model in hitting $100000 but the asset will only reach about $250000 during the present halving cycle (concluding in 2024) — the result of big players selling early before $288000. Big players will likely get retail investors hyped for BTC after $100000 is reached in line with the S2F model according to Hyland leading those mainstream folks to look next toward the $288000 price target of the S2FX model.

This week produced notable excitement in the Bitcoin price category. The asset turned in a new all-time high just below $69000 before dropping slightly below $63000 all on Wednesday according to Cointelegraph’s BTC price index.

FUD of the Week

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was reportedly laying on the FUD this week after it ordered local commercial banks to freeze accounts tied to at least two crypto traders. The CBN banned banks from servicing local crypto exchanges over concerns of volatility money laundering and terrorism financing.

Local media outlet Peoples Gazette reported the news on Nov. 7 stating that CBN’s director of banking supervision J.Y. Mammanand laid down the law directing his bank to shut down the naughty crypto traders’ accounts and move their funds to “suspense accounts.”

The crackdown is reportedly part of a broader move from banking regulators to immediately close the accounts of Nigerian residents or companies “transacting in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges” using local banks as CBN execs think that the majority of these transactions are nefarious.

Coinbase (COIN) shares promptly dipped around 13.1% in after-hours trading following the release of underwhelming third-quarter financial results on Thursday. The firm posted $1.235 billion worth of revenue in Q3 falling well below FactSet’s estimates of $1.614 billion.

The firm’s profits equated to $406 million which marked a 74.7% decrease compared to the second quarter but did beat analysts’ expectations of $380 million. Coinbase also reported earnings of $1.62 per share which came in 10% short of the consensus estimate. The firm appeared to be unfazed by the results and the report highlighted that Coinbase is focused on the long term.

“Coinbase is not a quarter-to-quarter investment but rather a long-term investment in the growth of the crypto economy and our ability to serve users through our products and services. We encourage our investors to take this point of view” the report read.

An admin account for Beeple’s official Discord channel was hacked on Wednesday resulting in a fake NFT drop being promoted to the group that saw users duped out of an estimated 38 ETH.

An admin account with the handle “Multi” confirmed to the group on Wednesday that their account had been compromised despite having two-factor authentication settings switched on. The hacker went on to impersonate an admin and the Beeple Announcements Bot and promote a fake and “cheap” NFT drop from Beeple on Nifty Gateway.

The members of the group were expecting a cheap NFT drop to be released on the back of Beeple’s most recent $29 million auction as the artist has done such a thing before to cater to all audiences. However not only did the members partake in a fake drop they didn’t even receive any NFTs for their trouble.

Think of how essential the internet is to everyday life now — that’s what the Metaverse could become in a lot less time than the internet did.

It would be safe to say that a song-and-dance routine is something that is uniquely if not exclusively Indian in nature. Our culture combined with the nature of the content we consume sets our standard for content apart. This is what makes the Citi Mastercard collaboration stand out so much.

Here are three reasons why the Citi-Mastercard campaign is one like no other.

Instagram as a dominant space for communication

Instagram was at the forefront of the campaign. Stories from various influencers like Shivesh Bhatia Sakshi Sindhwani and many more were put up across social media to stir up the conversation around the idea: Celebration Uninterrupted. Then the core campaign piece was put out: a music video featuring Hrithik Roshan and music by Shankar Mahadevan. The video is the perfect cue to welcome the season of festivities. The video was posted by the brand pages as well on Hrithik Roshan’s page.

Personalized Focus on the Artists

What made the campaign really stand out is the fact that it integrated Citi India Mastercard as the enabler of good times in a way that was personalised and unique to the characteristics of the influencers. For example Shivesh Bhatia baker extraordinaire and influencer had the campaign idea of ‘uninterrupted’ woven into his feed post for the campaign- the video also featured his dog Yoda which helped his audience connect even more with the content. This personalisation was followed through and through with the long list of influencers attached with this campaign: including Kamiya Jani Rohina Arjun Kanungo. Employing the unique characteristics of these influencers helped the brands grasp on passion points most of us could relate to: be it about retail or travel food or fashion. The relatability factor brought the viewer closer to their own experiences with respect to what they were watching.

Standing Out Makes All the Difference

By integrating a Bollywood style music video as the leading piece of the campaign Citi and Mastercard did something that made the overall campaign a more relatable piece of content. The track created by Shankar Mahadevan for the campaign had characteristics of the Mastercard sonic weaved into it. This is how the campaign is trying to incorporate the sonic into the veins of our popular culture.

This is what Arnika Dixit Business Head - Credit Cards Digital Data and Marketing Citibank India had to say about the campaign and its music: “This festive season we bring back the fun by fulfilling those overdue commitments and spending quality time with our loved ones. This being a special year we went all out by creating our very own festive anthem to the words and music of legendary Shankar Mahadevan and the moves of Indian superstar Hrithik Roshan shot internationally. Our campaign is live across multiple platforms and we are excited to bring this unique collaboration exclusively for the festive season to our clients.”

“Music is a powerful way to create an emotionally and culturally relevant connection with consumers. This being the biggest festive anthem of the year Mastercard in collaboration with Citi brings you an experience that is truly Priceless. The distinct and memorable Mastercard melody Sonic will bring an additional layer of assurance to consumers about the safety and security that comes with their Mastercard. Owing to the credibility and authenticity these renowned personalities bring our campaign narrative aims to resonate with the audience at a personal level” added Manasi Narasimhan Vice President India South Asia at Mastercard.

It is not the most obvious way of marketing the offers of the season but one which made the difference. The campaign was not only exclusive to videos; it spread across multichannel promotions - be it OOH or print digital or OTT. It helped the track created by Shankar Mahadevan truly become an anthem of the season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTE1OTczMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Davao Oriental supports national ID system,"REGISTRATION.

DAVAO CITY – There is a widespread support for the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) in Davao Oriental with residents of all ages registering for the Philippine Identification (PhilID) card or the national ID.

In Barangay Central in Baganga Davao Oriental the local government recently posted on Facebook that cops provided security coverage during a registration activity held at a covered court.

In Mati City the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)-based PhilSys Fixed Registration Center (FRC) announced recently that walk-in registrants will be accommodated.

“You may come to register Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Health and safety protocols must be followed while in FRC” a Facebook post last month read.

National ID registration is likewise ongoing in Lupon town.

PSA-Davao Oriental in a November 2 post also reminded that application for Land Bank of the Philippines’ Mastercard prepaid cards are allowed after the Step 2 biometrics process.



The card which is free of charge will be provided in LandBank booths located at PhilSys registration centers.

“Just present your PhilSys claim stub and your valid ID” PSA Davao Oriental said.

As of November 10 a total of 40264550 have already registered for the PhilID while more than 3 million cards have been delivered by the Philippine Postal Corporation.

Signed into law by President Rodrigo R. Duterte in August 2018 Republic Act 11055 or the Philippine Identification System Act aims to establish a single national ID for all Filipinos and resident aliens.

The national ID shall be a valid proof of identity that shall be a means of simplifying public and private transactions enrollment in schools and the opening of bank accounts.

It also seeks to boost efficiency especially in dealing with government services where people will only need to present one ID during transactions. (PNA)

Belgium was less spectacular beating Estonia 3-1 at home but has an unassailable five point-lead over second-place Wales which beat Belarus 5-1 in Cardiff and has a three-point lead over the Czech Republic for a playoff spot.

After missing out on the last World Cup the Dutch looked set to go through after leading 2-0 at Montenegro with goals from Memphis Depay.

Yet Montenegro struck twice in the last eight minutes to make it 2-2 and that gives Turkey and Norway a chance for top spot since they are two points behind with one game left.

“I don’t know what to say. Unbelievable” Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk told Dutch broadcaster NOS. “It’s scandalous how we played in the second half.""

GROUP D

France was playing away from its usual home venue Stade de France and took the field at Parc des Princes where Mbappe stars for Paris Saint-Germain.

He became the first France player since Just Fontaine at the 1958 World Cup to score four times in one game.

“The most important thing was qualifying and we have players in our squad who have never played in the World Cup"" said Mbappe who starred in the last one. “It’s a dream to play in it for your country.”

After 32 minutes he had his first international hat trick.

Karim Benzema combined with Theo Hernandez to set up his first goal and then Kingsley Coman picked him out twice the second with a cross from the right met by a rare header.

Mbappe has bounced back from a disappointing Euro 2020 where he failed to score and his late goal helped France win the Nations League final last month. Benzema also scored in that game.

The irrepressible Hernandez whipped over another cross from the left for another assist as Benzema met it at the near post for 4-0 in the 55th.

Four minutes later Benzema played a slick one-two with Mbappe for his second goal and 35th for France.

His partnership with Mbappe is blossoming fast.

“We showed we have a good understanding and combine well together” Benzema said. “Personally I’m delighted to play in another World Cup (after 2014).”

Adrien Rabiot and Antoine Griezmann also scored late before Mbappe emulated the great Fontaine — the all-time leading scorer in a single World Cup with 13 goals in '58.

The second-place finisher enters the playoffs and Finland has a chance although it next hosts rampant France.

The Finns won 3-1 at Bosnia and Herzegovina despite playing more than 50 minutes with a player less to move above Ukraine and into second place.

The home side was missing all-time 60-goal top scorer Edin Dzeko through injury and lacked a cutting edge.

GROUP E

There was no Romelu Lukaku up front for Belgium as he recovers from a minor injury so Christian Benteke stepped in and put his side ahead against Estonia after 11 minutes.

Aaron Ramsey was even quicker taking three minutes to put Wales 1-0 up and Liverpool defender Neco Williams doubled the lead in the 20th.

Ramsey 's penalty made it 3-0 shortly after the break.

Yannick Carrasco and Thorgan Hazard netted second-half goals for Belgium while goals from Ben Davies and Conner Roberts capped a fine night for Wales — which next hosts Belgium. Gareth Bale made his 100th appearance for Wales

GROUP G

Turkey profited from Norway's slip to move into second and the playoff spot on goal difference after rocking Gibraltar 6-0.

Veteran striker Burak Yilmaz did not score but Galatasaray marksman Halil Dervisoglu — 15 years his junior — netted twice.

Norway missed star striker Erling Haaland because of a hip injury and failed to break down Latvia at home in a 0-0 draw.

Depay’s penalty put the Netherlands ahead midway through the first half and he tucked away a right-wing cross from Denzel Dumfries with a backheel at the front post in the 54th to reach 37 international goals.

Turkey has a narrow +1 advantage over Norway on goal difference heading into their final group games on Tuesday where scoring could prove crucial.

Norway travels to the Netherlands without the prolific Haaland and Montenegro hosts Turkey.

France Germany Belgium and Denmark are among the eventual 10 European group winners.

The 10 group runners-up will be joined in the playoffs by two teams which won a Nations League group last year. Runners-up with the six best records will play at home first in the semifinals.

FIFA will make the playoffs draw on Nov. 26 in Zurich.

The three winners of the playoffs finals on March 29 will complete the lineup of 13 European teams present in Qatar.

As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9wcm9mb290YmFsbHRhbGsvcnVtb3ItbWlsbC9uZXdzL3N0ZWVsZXJzLXNpZ24tZm91cnRoLXJvdW5kZXItbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLXNpeHRoLXJvdW5kZXItbG9nYW4tbGVl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers sign fourth-rounder Mason McCormick sixth-rounder Logan Lee,"The Steelers got a couple of draft picks under contract on Friday.

The team announced that they have signed fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round defensive tackle Logan Lee. Both players signed four-year deals with the team.

McCormick was one of three offensive linemen that the Steelers drafted last month. He played in 70 games for South Dakota State that included a school-record of 57 straight games so the Steelers are getting an experienced rookie.

Lee had 158 tackles 18.5 tackles for a loss and nine sacks in 43 games at Iowa.

The Steelers also announced the signing of four undrafted free agents. They are West Virginia cornerback Beanie Bishop Jr. Georgia running back Daijun Edwards UCF quarterback John Rhys Plumlee and Michigan State linebacker Jacoby Windmon."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbGlhYy5jb20vY2VsaWFjLWRpc2Vhc2UvdGhlLWdyZWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1maWFzY28tcjU3MTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Great McDonald's Fiasco,"Celiac.com 11/12/2021 - Is it possible for a large multi-billion dollar multi-national corporation like McDonald’s to make an honest mistake—even if that mistake benefits them directly by increasing their sales and bottom line? For many people the answer is no—never—there must be some conspiracy or greedy modus operandi at work which better explains the situation. If you are a die-hard conspiracy theorist there may be little in this article that will change your position with regard to McDonald’s and their recent “gluten problem.” My hope however is that people on both sides of this issue will gain some knowledge here—especially with respect to how difficult it really is for all food companies to determine and guarantee the gluten-free status of their foods. Additionally I believe that we can all learn something from McDonald’s mistake (or uncovered secret plot!) and how they have dealt with it.

For many years McDonald’s has told its customers via their Web site and customer service telephone line that their French fries and hash browns were gluten-free. Due to their wide availability and low price these menu items have become a staple for many people on a gluten-free diet. The drama surrounding these foods began on February 13 2006 when the Houston Chronicle broke this story: “McDonald’s: Fries Have Potential Allergens.” This article revealed that the natural flavoring used in those menu items actually contains wheat as an ingredient. According to a March 8th email from Catherine E. Adams Ph.D R.D. McDonald’s Corporate Vice President Worldwide Quality Systems and Nutrition McDonald’s first noticed this potential problem when one of their ingredient suppliers had to comply with the new Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act which required that supplier to list if present any of the eight major allergens (or their derivatives) on the packaged food’s product label. The supplier complied and informed McDonald’s of their “use of wheat as an ingredient in the natural flavoring.”

A Case for Innocence

Celiac.com Sponsor (A12):

There are several reasons why I believe that this whole incident was a large avoidable mistake on the part of McDonald’s (rather than a secret plot):

The timing of the event: This story broke one month after the new labeling laws took effect. McDonald’s likely had no idea that wheat was in the natural flavoring until it was revealed to them by their supplier (of course they should have done due diligence and known this back when they created their gluten-free product listing.); Something that was contained in Ms. Adams’ March 8th email response: “While the new law applies to packaged food products—not the restaurant industry—in our ongoing efforts to communicate to our customers we thought it was important to share this information.” She is legally correct here—the new law does not require McDonald’s to reveal the fact that there is a wheat-derivative in their natural flavoring—the law does not apply to the restaurant industry and only applies to the packaged food consumer market (certainly this is a loophole that needs to be changed in the future). If McDonald’s wanted to keep this a secret from the public they could easily have done so because there is no legal requirement for them to disclose any allergens in their foods. They have done this on a strictly voluntarily basis for many years now; Public image: McDonald’s has gone to a great deal of effort over the years to voluntarily disclose their list of “safe” foods for people with various allergies—mainly because it is good for their public image—and to a certain extent the allergy market has been a source of revenue and has likely increased their sales. Misleading people with regard to the allergens in their foods whether it is done on purpose or by mistake would surely lead to major lawsuits that would likely negate any financial gain achieved from this relatively small market—and would create a public relations nightmare. To a company like McDonald’s public image is everything. It seems doubtful that they would intentionally take such a great risk to gain a share in such a small market.

Let the Lawsuits Begin

Very soon after the newspaper story broke the French fries and hash browns were taken off of McDonald’s gluten-free list on their Web site. On February 19 2006 the Wall Street Journal ran the article: “McDonald’s Faces Three Lawsuits” and thus began the “lawsuit bandwagon” that continues to the present. It has the potential to ultimately cost them tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars through a class action suit. At about this same time I actually had to ban a major Colorado law firm from the Gluten-Free Forum (www.glutenfreeforum.com) because they were trying to use the site to solicit forum users to join a class action suit that they planned to bring against McDonald’s. This violated the site’s rules against advertising.

McDonald’s Response

On February 20 2006 only one day after the Wall Street Journal article appeared Jack Daly Senior Vice President of McDonald’s Corporation issued a media statement on their Web site titled: “McDonald’s Fries are ‘Gluten and Allergen Free’ According to Expert.” It stated that:

“Scientific evaluation by one of the world’s leading experts on gluten sensitivity and allergenicity Dr. Steven Taylor of the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program of the University of Nebraska has confirmed again that our fries are gluten free and allergen free. Based on this analysis we believe the lawsuits filed are without legal merit.”

Support Groups to the Rescue

Shortly after the release of Jack Daly’s media statement the Gluten Intolerance Group (GIG) issued a press release titled “McDonald’s: A Safe Place for Celiacs to Eat According to the Gluten Intolerance Group” which backs up McDonald’s claim that their fries and hash browns are gluten-free. The Celiac Sprue Association (CSA) also released a statement on their Web site that supported McDonald’s and in much more detail than the GIG’s including the following statement:

“The CSA has examined the commercial manufacturing process of the natural flavoring with wheat as a starting ingredient which is used in connection with the McDonald’s Corporation French fries and hash browns. CSA provides the following statement after knowledgeable careful evaluation and review of the process and pertinent test results. French fries and hash browns prepared in oils with this flavoring might be considered commercially to ‘contain no gluten.’”

What Does “Gluten-Free” Mean Anyway?

Reliable sources have since revealed that the wheat used in McDonald’s natural flavoring is processed in such a way that nearly all proteins are removed much like the distillation process removes gluten from wheat and that the actual gluten content in the French fries and hash browns—according to RidaScreen Gliadin Elisa testing—is less than 3 parts per million (PPM). It is still possible for partially broken down wheat proteins to be present so a Rast test was also done and no wheat-allergic residue was detected. Together these results are convincing and indicate that McDonald’s French fries and hash browns are indeed gluten-free by any current standards that are in use anywhere. But “less than 3 PPM” is not zero gluten—right? Keep in mind that it is currently impossible for anyone to say that any food or product is 100% gluten-free—there is no analytical technique that can say that there is zero gluten in a sample and the best detection limits I have seen report low ranges from 2 to 20 PPM—not zero. The Codex Alimentarius which covers the U.S.A. and Canadian standards for gluten-free is 20 PPM for naturally gluten-free foods and there is currently no gluten-free standard for the U.S.A.

Do the Lawsuits have Merit?

Based on the aforementioned test results it is highly doubtful that McDonald’s has hurt anyone with these products—which is what must be shown in such cases—the claimants must demonstrate actual damages loss or injuries related to the defendant’s actions (or inactions) and if they cannot do this their suits will be without merit and will be thrown out (which is what I believe will happen here). Even if the testing had found higher levels of gluten in the products the claimants would still be facing an uphill battle. This is because they would still have to demonstrate that a specific injury was caused to them by McDonald’s and that their injury didn’t occur by another means. In other words they would have to show that there were no other sources of gluten contamination in their diets which is something that is difficult if not impossible to do in a legal context. On top of these problems the claimants must overcome the fact that in the U.S.A. there are no current legal regulations regarding the use of the term “gluten-free” on packaged or restaurant foods. The only thing that comes close is the Codex Alimentarius which are voluntary industry guidelines and not legal regulations.

The Damage Done

Whether or not McDonald’s wins or loses these lawsuits may however be irrelevant. To a certain extent the damage has already been done—and it does not stop simply with the damage that was done to their public image and reputation. The fact that many people with allergies and intolerances will never again trust McDonald’s (or companies like them) is just the most obvious fallout from this whole mess. There is a much larger picture taking shape that began with McDonald’s no longer listing the gluten-free product information for many of the items that they used to list. Their French fries hash browns shakes dressings etc. and other companies have also discontinued their “gluten-free” product listings. Some companies have even stopped using the term “gluten-free” on their labels even though their products remain gluten-free. One company even contacted me and wanted to be removed from the offerings at The Gluten-Free Mall due to liability concerns that began when they heard about the McDonald’s fiasco.

For companies like McDonald’s the potential benefits of providing such voluntary information must outweighs the risks. The extensive publicity surrounding these events has made it clear that the risk of being wrong when making the claim that a product is free from an allergen even if the mistake is an honest one that began with perfectly good intentions is very great. So why risk making such claims at all? (This will be the question asked by the companies’ lawyers anyway.) The fallout from this may not end for some time. Certainly anyone making selling or claiming that their products are gluten-free (or free from some other allergen) must be concerned about the possibility of litigation. In the end it will likely be easier for many companies not to bother with the allergen market at all especially once real gluten-free regulations are created here in the U.S.A. which will happen in the next couple of years.

Hindsight

How could McDonald’s have avoided all these problems in the first place? The most obvious answer is that they could have avoided making any claims about the allergens in their products. That would have left those of us who have food challenges in the dark. Does that sound like McDonald’s to you? I hope such a negative scenario doesn’t become the norm for such companies. Perhaps the best solution would have been for them to consult with some of the many celiac disease/gluten-free experts for example the Gluten Intolerance Group’s new Food Certification Program or with Donald D. Kasarda Former Research Chemist for the United States Department of Agriculture and made 100% sure that their lists were accurate (in this case it appears that their lists were accurate but disclosing ALL of the actual ingredients in their products would have avoided much of this controversy).

I think that all food companies can learn a valuable lesson from these events: it is better to test your products before you have any issues and to continue to test them periodically. It is better to conduct ingredient research up front and consult with experts before publishing any gluten-free product listings—this is an ongoing process and must be done regularly because ingredient suppliers may change. Once the information is compiled and determined to be accurate it is better to disclose ALL ingredients used in every product. Web sites are a great place for such information. Even if you operate a restaurant and are not legally required to do so public disclosure is best when it comes to things that your customers put in their mouths—and your customers have a right to know exactly what they are eating. Fast food companies should print ALL ingredients on the packaging no matter how scary they sound. Individuals who are concerned about such matters will or should be familiar with what is and is not safe for them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3dtdC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvbWNkb25hbGRzLXRvLWRlYnV0LW1hcmlhaC1tZW51LWZvci0xMi1kYXlzLW9mLWhvbGlkYXktZGVhbHPSAWJodHRwczovL3d3bXQuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9tY2RvbmFsZHMtdG8tZGVidXQtbWFyaWFoLW1lbnUtZm9yLTEyLWRheXMtb2YtaG9saWRheS1kZWFscw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's to debut 'Mariah Menu' for 12 days of holiday deals,"KALAMAZOO Mich.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbWV0YS1wbGF0Zm9ybXM6LXRocmVlLWFzcGVjdHMtdG8tY29uc2lkZXItMjAyMS0xMS0xNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta Platforms: Three Aspects To Consider,"Meta Platforms Inc. (FB) is the world’s largest social media network providing some of the most popular applications to connect and communicate online such as Facebook Instagram Messenger WhatsApp and Oculus which makes virtual headsets for gaming and entertainment. The main revenue source for Meta Platforms comes from the advertising business.

The corporate rebrand to Meta Platforms from the previously named Facebook comes at a time when investors need to consider three different factors that could impact the business prospects of this leading social media empire. I am bearish on FB stock considering all three of these factors. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)

Mixed Q3 Results

Meta Platforms reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings but missed estimates on revenue. The social media and technology company reported earnings of $3.22 versus $3.19 per share expected by analysts. Revenue reported was $29.01 billion versus the expected $29.57 billion. Meanwhile the daily active users (DAUs) reported figure of 1.93 billion came in-line with consensus and monthly active users (MAUs) were weaker-than-expected coming in at 2.91 billion vs. 2.93 billion.

Additionally the average revenue per user (ARPU) also was weaker-than-expected with a figure of $10 compared to $10.15.

The positive news is that Meta Platforms announced a $50 billion increase to its share buyback program. The company said that they ""repurchased $14.37 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and had $7.97 billion remaining on our prior share repurchase authorization as of September 30 2021.”

Although this is good news for the intrinsic value of FB stock a deceleration in revenue growth which has been present for three consecutive years is a cause for concern. The 2018 2019 and 2020 data shows that revenue growth was 37.35% 26.61% and 21.60% respectively. In absolute numbers revenue continues to grow but this growth is losing momentum.

During itsearnings call Meta Platforms attributed the decline in revenue to changes Apple (AAPL) made to its iOS 14.5 privacy options. Apple allowed its users to opt-out of apps tracking them across the web resulting in lower conversion rates for advertisers and lower advertising revenue consequently for Meta Platforms.

Bearing this in mind Meta Platforms will have to spend and invest in its targeting system related to the advertising business and improve the algorithms.

Pivot Toward the Metaverse

The decision to rebrand from Facebook to Meta Platforms is a major business decision. CEO Mark Zuckerberg considers the metaverse to be a “successor to the Internet.” But what is a metaverse? A metaverse is a completely digital world in which multiple people can interact within a 3D environment create avatars and engage in activities such as entertainment gaming and online shopping.

It is difficult to say if other social media platforms will follow Meta Platforms' example and pivot toward a metaverse-centric business model but until widespread adoption occurs it remains a considerable risk.

An Ethical Accusation

Meta Platforms has recently faced a PR crisis after a whistleblower publicly testified to U.S. lawmakers accusing the company of putting “profits before people.” Numerous leaked documents were published which suggested the Facebook algorithms had been drawing users toward circles of hate and misinformation.

Zuckerberg has defended the practices of his firm by stating that the testimony was “a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.”

This is hardly the first high-profile controversy in which FB has been embroiled. Headlines were published in 2017 alleging that political consulting and strategic communications firm Cambridge Analytica had collected personal information from about 87 million users on Facebook. This data security breach may now have been left behind by the investment community but the ethical track record of FB has only seemed to garner more and more negative media attention.

Putting profit over public safety is a dangerous game to play. Meta Platforms has announced that it will soon remove advanced targeting options which involve sensitive topics. These issues can include health race religion ethnicity and political affiliation.

Wall Street’s Take

On TipRanks Meta Platforms has an analyst consensus rating of Strong Buy based on 29 Buys 6 Holds and 1 Sell rating. The average Meta Platforms price target of $405.59 implies a 12-month 18.98% upside potential.

Coming off one of the most egregious losses in their history the debacle last week at Jacksonville there was no gray area here. Face to face with yet another clearly inferior opponent in the New York Jets the Bills not only needed to win they needed to get right.

I’d say 45-17 did the job.

The Buffalo defense made Jets QB Mike White look like the career practice squad player he had been until a month ago intercepting him four times and the offense – after a little stumbling in the second quarter – lit up a terrible New York defense both on the ground and through the air.

The win enabled Buffalo (6-3) to remain alone in first place in the AFC East just ahead of the red-hot New England Patriots (6-4) who sorry to say are back and a legitimate concern after their one-year hiatus. Their 45-7 annihilation of the Browns added further proof of that.

Here are some instant reactions.

1. Getting Stefon Diggs involved paid off

As I wrote earlier this week Diggs’ numbers this season – targets and catches specifically – really aren’t that far off from 2020. It only felt like they weren’t at the same level. The difference between this year and last was that there just hadn’t been a game where Josh Allen continually fed Diggs and allowed him to take control.

That changed in New York. Allen made a concerted effort to get the ball to Diggs and the results were predictably impressive. In the first half alone Diggs had nine targets more than he had in four full games – both Miami games Chiefs and Jaguars.

Diggs caught five of those for 88 yards including a 57-yarder that turned the game back in Buffalo’s favor late in the first half. At that point the Bills – who had started well with 10 points on their first two possessions – needed a big play and Diggs provided it.

That long pass set up Diggs’ 12-yard touchdown reception two snaps later which gave the Bills a 17-3 lead.

And then on the first play of the third quarter Diggs made a 23-yard reception that started Buffalo on a quick 75-yard touchdown drive which basically put the game out of reach. That one gave Diggs his second 100-yard game of the season and he finished with eight catches on 13 targets for 162 yards.

That’s what Allen has to do more often; look to get Diggs involved early and often because when he does good things almost always happen.

2. Maybe Matt Breida should have been used earlier

The struggles in the run game had become a major point of contention for the Buffalo offense. Not only was there a lack of production but because there was no threat on the ground opposing defenses were starting to make things difficult for Allen and the receivers.

Breida was active the first two weeks but was hardly used on offense then spent the next six games inactive. Sunday Breida got the call and while playing on special teams in place of Jake Kumerow – who is out with COVID-19 – Breida was given a chance to play offense and he came through in a big way.

He scored a touchdown on the Bills’ first possession when he altered his route when Josh Allen was pressured and worked his way open in the end zone for a 15-yard reception. And then in the third quarter Breida first carry resulted in a 15-yard TD run as he showed off his speed around the edge.

Breida gives defenses a different look than Devin Singletary and Zack Moss and the Bills need to find a way to keep him involved in the offense moving forward.

However that fumble early in the fourth quarter? That was not ideal and that’s the kind of thing that could land him right back on the bench.

3. When does Zach Wilson return for the Jets?

Look White got some people excited because he somehow found a way to throw for 405 yards in his first career NFL start a few weeks ago which led the Jets to a stunning 34-31 victory over the Bengals.

But against a Buffalo defense that came into the game No. 1 in both fewest points and yards allowed White was unmasked. He was helpless until the Bils decided to stop caring in the fourth quarter and he piled up plenty of garbage time yardage that was all meaningless.

Wilson was held out of the game not only to make sure his knee is better but because White had provided the Jets with a little bit of a spark. But Wilson is the Jets future and they need to get him back out there as soon as possible.

Running Backs

The Bills still had trouble running the football (or even calling a running play) with their running backs managing just 11 rushing attempts for 69 yards during the first three quarters. Devin Singletary and Zack Moss each handled five carries with Singletary going for 38 yards and Moss going for 16.

Wide Receivers/Tight Ends

Stefon Diggs and Gabriel Davis each went for over 100 receiving yards.

Diggs racked up 162 yards on 13 targets. He caught eight passes in total with six going for first downs.

Davis was the big-play threat. He caught all three of his targets for 105 yards and went 2-for-2 in contested scenarios.

Offensive Line

The offensive line was charged with two sacks but only gave up five pressures in total. Ike Boettger gave up two pressures while Daryl Williams and Tommy Doyle gave up the sacks.

Defensive Line

It was a monster day for Ed Oliver who came up with four pressures and three quarterback hits without a sack. He was one of six linemen who had multiple pressures.

A.J Epenesa and Efe Obada each had three pressures.

Linebackers A.J. Klein produced three tackles for loss against the run. However he was singled out in coverage giving up six catches on eight targets for 85 yards.

Secondary

Levi Wallace had a big day allowing only three catches on seven targets for 35 yards and an interception. Tre'Davious White Taron Johnson and Jordan Poyer came down with the other interceptions.

Quarterback

Mike White threw four interceptions with two of them coming from a clean pocket. His clean-pocket passing left a lot to be desired but he was pressured on over two-thirds of his dropbacks — where he was even worse.

Completions Attempts Yards TD:INT Under Pressure 5 16 73 0:2 Clean Pocket 18 27 174 0:2

Running Backs

Michael Carter was the focal point of the running game and received 16 carries for 39 yards with 29 of them coming after contact. He averaged 0.6 yards before contact per attempt. He also caught four of his six targets for 43 yards with 45 coming after the catch.

Wide Receivers/Tight Ends

Keelan Cole and Elijah Moore combined to see eight targets and only two catches. Cole caught an 18-yard pass on five targets and Moore caught a four-yarder on three targets.

Corey Davis tallied five catches on seven targets for 93 yards with four going for first downs.

Offensive Line

Even though the offensive line wasn’t charged with a sack they combined to allow six hurries five hits and 11 pressures. Greg Van Roten led the team in pressures allowed with three.

Defensive Line

Shaq Lawson and Sheldon Rankins combined for a sack and Rankins was the only defensive lineman with multiple pressures. Lawson was the only one with a tackle for loss against the run.

Linebackers

The linebackers were credited with just one positively graded play against the run on first review. They weren’t targeted much through the air with C.J. Mosley being the most-targeted player. Mosley allowed two catches for 16 yards and a first down on three targets.

Secondary

Six players allowed more than 30 yards in coverage with Brandin Echols allowing 90 yards on four catches that all went for first downs. Michael Carter II allowed 80% of the throws in coverage to be caught as he allowed four catches on five targets for 53 yards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvamV0cy9uZXdzL2hvdy1uZXcteW9yay1qZXRzLXByZXBhcmluZy1zdG9wLWJ1ZmZhbG8tYmlsbHMtb2ZmZW5zZS1qb3NoLWFsbGVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the Jets Are Preparing to Stop Josh Allen and the Bills' Offense,"The Jets have their hands full this week taking on the fourth-best scoring offense in the league and star quarterback Josh Allen. Here's how they're prepping to keep a lid on Buffalo's offense.

Just because Josh Allen and the Bills lost to the Jaguars last week doesn't mean the Jets are taking Sunday's matchup with Buffalo lightly.

New York will be lining up on defense at MetLife Stadium against one of the best young quarterbacks in the National Football League the leader of an offense that averages 29.4 points per game this season (the fourth-highest total in football)

Meanwhile the Jets have allowed 408.1 yards and 31.4 points per game entering play in Week 10 both the worst marks in the NFL.

So how does the league's worst defense contain one of the best offensive units and their star quarterback?

""Make them one dimensional"" Jets defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich told reporters this week. ""We have to play the run well. We have to make the play action not as valid. When we play the run really really well it creates longer third downs longer second downs where we have an opportunity to pressure and play more coverage-based defenses where we can manipulate the backend a little bit help with the matchups hopefully cause a little bit of confusion.

""But that’s it. It’s an extremely tough opponent in that way because they don’t have a true weakness. They have good scheme good players and when it’s clicking for them they’re as tough as it gets.""

Ulbrich has a point. Buffalo has their star quarterback but the weapons around him have excelled this year as well. Wideouts Stefon Diggs Emmanuel Sanders and Cole Beasley each have more than 400 receiving yards while running back Devin Singletary leads the way with 355 yards on the ground.

That's where this matchup get even trickier. Allen has a booming arm throwing for 2236 yards over eight games (with 17 touchdowns and just five interceptions) but he's also mobile. The fourth-year quarterback has already rushed for 319 yards this season on pace to blow past his career high in that category.

Allen's ability to scramble and beat a defense with his feet is something that head coach Robert Saleh is taking into consideration with his defensive game plan.

""Especially a guy who can escape the pocket and get off schedule and now you’ve got the backend in one-on-one’s all over the place with one high safety"" Saleh explained. ""And they’ve got playmakers all over the football field. So it is a cat and mouse game in terms of trying to change looks for Josh and trying to change coverages and be multiple so he can’t just tee off on you. There’s a chess match in there and it’s going to be a challenge but the biggest challenge is just trying our best to keep him in the pocket so we don’t have to get to that in the first place.""

Last week against Jacksonville was Allen's worst game of the season. He didn't have a touchdown pass was picked off twice he fumbled once and was sacked four times. Buffalo scored only six points in the loss their third of the year.

Pressure on Allen in the pocket can be New York's ticket to another upset victory. The problem is after sacking Ryan Tannehill seven times in their win over Tennessee the Jets have just five sacks in four games since.

Ulbrich explained that he's noticed more of a concerted effort from opponents to protect their quarterback since the Titans game. From manipulated protection schemes to simply placing more bodies in the box on the line of scrimmage it's been tougher for New York's defensive line to make their presence felt.

""They look at our defense and say our defensive line especially our interior defensive line is our strength"" he said. ""They’re not going to let that part of our defense beat them. So it’s definitely changed but it’s something we have to overcome. Whether that’s calls whether it’s the way that we rush them blitz them pressure them. We've got to find a way still.""

If the Jets can break through this week while simultaneously keeping a lid on Allen's mobility there's a good chance they can keep their offense—manned by magic Mike White for a third straight week—in the game. Easier said than done but it starts with the battle in the trenches getting to No. 17 before he can shine.

""He’s a special young man because he can play quarterback and by that I mean get the ball where it needs to go quickly and then he can play off schedule"" Saleh added. ""So the challenge in playing Josh is the fact that you have to defend two plays in one. There’s a play in timing and then there’s Josh Allen scrambling around. We have to be great up front with regards to our rush lanes and keeping him in the pocket. And we have to be great in the back end with regards to plaster and staying connected to our coverage and understand that you’re not defending three plays you’re not defending three seconds you’re defending upwards around 10. You have to strain.""

The chairman and CEO of Florida-based Fontainebleau Development who walked away from the planned $2 billion development when his financing disappeared was perplexed. He couldn’t understand why another builder didn’t finish the planned nearly-3800-room hotel-casino project at the north end of the Strip.

“I was surprised it sat here that long” Soffer told The Nevada Independent last week.

“I saw the articles over the years that it should be torn down crazy stuff like that” Soffer said while sitting in a conference room built inside the parking garage attached to the 67-story blue-tinted glass tower. “The building itself was very well-built as a physical structure. It’s in pristine shape.”

An hour later Soffer participated in a second groundbreaking and commencement ceremony with Gov. Steve Sisolak Clark County officials Las Vegas tourism leaders and his partners 14 years and nine months after the initial groundbreaking event. Soffer announced plans to “finish what I started” and have the 25-acre Fontainebleau site open by the fourth quarter of 2023.

“It’s a crazy story but I could never understand why no one really had the vision to follow this through” Soffer said. “[Fontainebleau President Brett Mufson] came to me and said we had an opportunity to buy it back and I said ‘yeah let’s do it.’”

Much has changed on the Strip’s north end since the 9-million-square-foot development was halted.

The Sahara and Circus Circus have new owners the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opened in June and a $1 billion expansion to the Las Vegas Convention Center opened next door to the Fontainebleau on land that once housed the aging Riviera.

“My plan from day one was to have two properties one in Miami and one in Las Vegas” Soffer said referencing the company’s flagship Fontainebleau resort on Miami Beach. “I always thought Las Vegas was a good fit for our brand.”

He reacquired the Las Vegas project in February with a new financial partner: Koch Real Estate Investments the Dallas-based subsidiary of Koch Industries. Neither Soffer nor Koch Real Estate Investments President Jake Francis revealed what they paid to buy back the project nor did they provide details on the costs expected to complete the development.

Both companies said Soffer’s Fontainebleau team will manage the resort. A deal with hotel chain Marriott International reached with a previous owner was scrapped; Soffer said Fontainebleau’s worldwide customer database would fill the property.

“We generate a lot of traffic and a lot of revenue” Soffer said. “We have a brand that is known all around the world.”

Soffer who was married to supermodel Elle MacPherson from 2013 to 2017 and first made the Forbes billionaire rankings in 2015 is the son of Miami real estate developer Donald Soffer who built a large mall office building and condominium towers on a 785-acre parcel in Miami-Dade County.

Various parts of the Koch business empire have made investments in Las Vegas over the years including multi-family housing developments and industrial projects but the Fontainebleau marks the company’s first gaming investment.

Francis said the Fontainebleau presented “an opportunity” for Koch Industries to enter the Las Vegas market “at a significant discount” rather than the start-up costs associated with building a property from the ground up.

He was quite familiar with the Las Vegas resort industry’s revenue mix where pre-pandemic non-gaming spending by visitors accounted for roughly 65 percent of the Strip’s revenue market.

“We're big believers in the continued movement of Las Vegas towards the north end of the Strip” Francis said. He views the Fontainebleau as the “third leg of the stool” that includes Resorts World and the convention center expansion.

“There is only more to come here” Francis added. “There's more sports teams bigger conventions. So just with the growth of the market in general [the Fontainebleau] is definitely a better location today than it was 14 years ago.”

Is Vegas ready for another resort?

Gaming revenue has rebounded in 2021 after the pandemic closed the casino industry statewide for nearly three months in 2020 and handed the Strip its lowest gaming revenue total since 1996. But through September Strip gaming revenue was less than 1 percent ahead of 2019’s pre-pandemic figures.

Analysts said they would question the viability of the Fontainebleau if the project were opening next month. Mid-week convention business has been slow to return to pre-pandemic numbers and international airline passenger travel into Las Vegas is still 85.6 percent below 2019. The day before the Fontainebleau’s ribbon-cutting event Las Vegas welcomed the arrival of its first transcontinental flight from the United Kingdom in 20 months.

The two-year wait could make a difference in Fontainebleau’s success analysts said.

Fitch Ratings Service gaming analyst Colin Mansfield reiterated his previous view that Las Vegas could return to the 2019 pre-pandemic levels by 2023. In an interview he said time is probably on the side of the Fontainebleau.

“If you’re talking about a two-year window it’s something that will create an incremental positive for the city” Mansfield said. “Resorts World added a little over 2 percent room inventory increase and this project will add another 2 percent or so which should be absorbed by the market given all the good things going on in Las Vegas.”

Mansfield added that any new Las Vegas resort immediately “creates a buzz” that will drive visitors to the market.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said the “fast recovery” of Las Vegas gaming revenue and the anticipated return of non-gaming spending by customers lead him to believe the market is ready for a new property by late 2023 or early 2024.

“The revenues that we’ve seen during the past few months without any international travel and convention business have clearly shown that Las Vegas’ recovery is faster than anybody expected” Beynon said.

Brendan Bussmann a partner in Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors agreed the arrival of the Fontainebleau could coincide with the Strip’s return to pre-pandemic market conditions.

“If things remain on track we should be at recovery sometime in the second half of 2023 which would bode well for an expansion” Bussmann said. “The challenge is the headwinds we are seeing right now between inflation fuel costs and other economic concerns that are quickly reducing those lines of disposable income. That look[s] very recessionary. This will only elongate our recovery that may hamper a significant amount of room growth in the second half of 2023.”

Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas said by the time Fontainebleau opens the Las Vegas Strip could have several new operators.

Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International both announced plans two weeks ago to sell Strip resorts early next year. Also the gaming arm of Southern California’s San Manuel Indian Tribe is expected to take control of the off-Strip Palms Casino Resort if approved by gaming regulators next month.

Jonas also suggested the off-Strip Rio Resort Casino could eventually be operated by its New York-based investment firm ownership after a management deal with Caesars expires.

“You’re probably going to see new parties come to town so Fontainebleau is not going to be the only new guy fighting for market share” Jonas said. “We will have to see how competitive the market gets because the fourth quarter of 2023 is going to be a lot different than the fourth quarter of 2021.”

A few design changes

Soffer said the revived Fontainebleau will follow much of the original blueprint launched in 2007 – 3780 hotel rooms and suites 550000 square feet of convention and meeting space a casino restaurants and other amenities. The plan is to hire roughly 6000 full-time employees.

Condominium units are not part of the development something that was part of the original design. Soffer said the residential component was to help finance the project.

“It’s not the right fit and we don’t have to do that now” he said. “The condo thing is sort of a thing of the past.”

Another change is “greatly reducing” the once-planned 245000 square feet of retail space. Soffer also said a 20000-square-foot attraction on the Fontainebleau’s roof will be revealed at a later date.

“We’ll have announcements over the next two years” Soffer said.

More than 1800 of the Fontainebleau’s hotel rooms were ready for furniture when construction was halted. He said those rooms will need to be remodeled.

Soffer said the “bones” of the building – concrete steel plumbing and glass – remain strong after 14 years thanks to Southern Nevada’s dry climate although he noted some glass on the tower is missing and will be replaced. He added that the “finishes and the level of details” will take time to complete.

“We’re making some changes market-driven changes for the direction of where we want to go with the property” he said.

Plus growth on the north end of the Strip is likely to be a benefit. Having the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention just a short distance from Fontainebleau’s front door is a key marketing opportunity Soffer said.

“You can stay here and walk across the street where CES or another big show is here” he said. “Companies can use us as a headquarters for a special event.”

Las Vegas-based contractor W.A. Richardson Builders the company that finished Resorts World after Boyd Gaming halted construction on what was then known as Echelon in 2008 is overseeing the Fontainebleau project. Bill Richardson the firm’s owner was on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony as were some 3200 construction workers that have been on the job site since June.

A long history

The Great Recession caused banks to pull financing from the Fontainebleau in June 2009. Soffer’s company lost the project a year later in a bankruptcy court foreclosure sale to corporate raider Carl Icahn who paid $150 million for the unfinished building.

Icahn’s company stripped the Fontainebleau bare selling furnishings specially-made escalators and a construction crane atop the tower. Elected leaders at the time thought the unfinished building was an eyesore and Icahn was asked to beautify the site.

Instead he sold the project in 2017 for $600 million to New York developer Steven Witkoff whose plans included renaming the development Drew Las Vegas in honor of his son Andrew who died of a drug overdose in 2011.

Nevada gaming regulators found Witkoff suitable as an operator in January 2020 a designation he hoped would help secure $2 billion in financing to finish the building. Instead the financing dried up and Soffer got a second chance to complete Fontainebleau Las Vegas.

“I feel very privileged and honored to be in this situation” Soffer said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzEzL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1pcy1iZXR0ZXItYmV0LWFzLW1hY2FvLWdhbWluZy1yZXZlbnVlcy10L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Is a Better Bet as Macao Gambling Revenue Tumbles,"Heavy-handed restrictions continue to weigh on casinos in China while their U.S. counterparts enjoy expanding freedom.

The recovery in casino gambling in Macao always seems to be just around the corner but it never quite arrives. Yet another plunge in monthly gambling revenue in October shows the rebound remains over the horizon and makes Las Vegas casinos the better bet.

For those resort operators like Las Vegas Sands (LVS -1.40%) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN -0.82%) that make most or virtually all of their money from the Chinese enclave the losing streak is going to hurt for some time to come.

In contrast the likes of MGM Resorts International (MGM -0.69%) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR -3.00%) which rely primarily upon Las Vegas and other regional U.S. gambling markets that are playing a hot hand should be where investors put their money.

Macao's not the odds-on favorite

Macao's reported gross gambling revenue (GGR) last month tumbled to just 4.3 billion patacas which is the local currency and is the equivalent of around $544 million a 40% drop compared to last year and almost 26% below what the city took in the month prior.

It's the only place where it's legal to gamble in China and Beijing has been watching the money flow in and out of the casinos with a wary eye. Over the years it has imposed increasingly stringent regulations on casinos gamblers and the junket operators who ferry VIPs to and from the peninsula while lending them money to gamble.

The pandemic exacerbated the situation as virtually all travel to the city was closed. And outbreaks of COVID-19 variants have led nearby provinces where most of the travel to Macao originates to restrict travel once more.

Las Vegas Sands sold all of its U.S.-based properties to go all-in on Asian markets which at this point is essentially just Macao. It reported third-quarter revenue of $857 million last month. While that is nearly double the $446 million it took in for the same period in 2020 it remains far below the $3.2 billion it generated in 2019.

Similarly Wynn Resorts just reported third-quarter revenue of $995 million and while that's below the $1.6 billion realized two years ago it is not as bad as what Sands experienced because of Wynn's Las Vegas operations which represented almost half of this quarter's revenue. Typically Macao accounts for two thirds to three quarters of Wynn's net revenue.

Viva Las Vegas!

In contrast casino operators with a greater U.S. presence are seeing a rebound. MGM Resorts saw revenue surge 140% year over year to $2.7 billion this past quarter which is only 18% below 2019's $3.3 billion total. But more importantly its Las Vegas adjusted property EBITDAR (earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and restructuring or rent costs) was 21% higher than two years ago and regional casino EBITDAR was 29% higher.

And Caesars generated $2.7 billion in the third quarter versus $1.4 billion last year (because it merged with Eldorado Resorts in July 2020 there's no comparison to 2019).

In short Las Vegas and various regional markets have done away with most restrictions on casinos such as mask mandates and capacity restraints which led gamblers to flow back into the resorts. And as vaccinations proliferate even with the potential need for booster shots to follow consumers are more comfortable being in large crowded venues again.

Don't double down on Macao

Macao was once the world's biggest gambling market and it might eventually regain such status. Yet with the possibility of Japan opening its doors to casinos in the next few years along with Singapore and other Asian markets expanding their own gambling opportunities high rollers might find these other venues more attractive since they won't be under the government microscope Macao faces.

For investors looking for top casino growth stocks MGM Resorts or Caesars seem like winning hands as do regional players like Boyd Gaming or Penn National Gaming.

The odds are against those resort operators that call China home even figuratively and should probably be avoided.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1jb2x1bW5zL2thdHMvc2ltb24tY293ZWxsLW9uLXRoZS1zdHJpcC1hLWdvbGRlbi1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS0yNDc3NTE1L9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtY29sdW1ucy9rYXRzL3NpbW9uLWNvd2VsbC1vbi10aGUtc3RyaXAtYS1nb2xkZW4tb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktMjQ3NzUxNS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simon Cowell on the Strip: A golden opportunity,"Jimmie Herrod right and The Silhouettes perform during a preview of “America’s Got Talent: Live!” at the Luxor Theater in Las Vegas Wednesday Nov. 3 2021.

Simon Cowell is on the phone from his home in London talking of being knocked off a bike but never forgetting how to ride it.

For the creator of “America’s Got Talent” this is not a metaphor.

“I broke my back. I didn’t catch COVID. So there was a kind of an upside to it” says Cowell seriously injured in an e-bike accident at his residence in Malibu in August 2020. “Because of all the physical therapy you go through I am much fitter than I was before the accident. So it’s one of those things that had a kind of a silver lining. I mean at the time it was horrendous. But now I feel really good.”

Cowell is moving at high speed once again navigating his “AGT” empire and delivering his “America’s Got Talent: Live!” show to Luxor Theater. The show has launched its open-ended engagement at long last fulfilling Cowell’s dream of staging a variety show on the Las Vegas Strip.

Variety is the operative term. As is “AGT’s” tradition if you can spin a plate swallow a sword or dance on the head of a pin auditions are open.

“What we have discussed for years is to try and give the audience the experience you have when you come to the live show at the Dolby Theatre” Cowell says. “Anyone who comes to the finals they all have a great time. They always tell their friends that it’s a got-to-be-there kind of experience. So what we tried to do as much as we could was to replicate what we do in our live shows.”

The Luxor show is hosted by Season 12 finalist and stand-up comic Preacher Lawson. Reigning Season 16 champ Dustin Tavella and Season 15 champ spoken-word artist Brandon Leake lead the Vegas cast. Singer Kodi Lee danger duo Deadly Games performance artists Duo Transcend the mentalist team The Clairvoyants shadow-performance troupe The Silhouettes and Ukrainian LED dance troupe Light Balance round out the show’s opening lineup. French illusionist Lea Kyle a Season 16 finalist joins the cast at a date to be announced.

What is the audience for this cavalcade of performers?

“I think it’s the same as it is for the TV show which is pretty much a family audience” Cowell says. “You know I think kids in particular love the show young kids as well. I think that’s the reason the show has survived for so many years.”

“AGT” debuted in 2006 a chief competitor of another of Cowell’s brainstorms “American Idol.”

Cowell is certainly not the first or only person to want to build an entertainment empire in Las Vegas. But he is the rare entertainment mogul with the resources to pull it off as his show reaches across the country and beyond for great unknown acts with (ideally) compelling biographies.

Cowell already has achieved a peripheral presence in Las Vegas. He has long noted the former “AGT” champs and finalists dotting the Strip — among them Terry Fator Mat Franco Piff the Magic Dragon Shin Lim and Tape Face — who had their own dedicated Vegas productions. Though the performers have returned for guest spots on “AGT” their stage shows are not formally tied to the “AGT” brand.

“We have seen the success of the show on billboards in Las Vegas for years” Cowell says. “What we are looking for in our contestants is obviously talent and vision. I think what we’ve realized now with Vegas that’s really the USP (unique selling proposition) of the show right now. It’s a fantastic prize to perform in Vegas. I’d say 90 to 95 percent of the contestants who are entered in the show want to end up in Vegas.”

After performing the “AGT” all-star limited engagements at Planet Hollywood Resort and Paris Las Vegas in previous years Cowell’s Syco Entertainment production company and partner Fremantle Entertainment seized on the grand Luxor Theater left open after Cirque’s “R.U.N” hauled out in spring 2020. MGM Resorts International was only too willing to have an offshoot of a hit TV show play one of its theaters.

“As soon as we spoke to MGM you know we were completely on the same page in terms of what audience we were trying to attract” Cowell says. “I think it was their enthusiasm for it you know which made us decide to go with them because we’d had offers in the past but there was something about MGM’s enthusiasm. Their hearts are in this show and they’ve been amazing.”

Cowell is not likely to be at the show in person until next year. The production will be talked of routinely on the TV show. Ex-champs and finalists from Vegas will still visit Dolby Theatre though there is not a formal plan for the former “AGT” finalists to stop into the Luxor production.

Cowell has also pulled himself from the planned “Walk The Line” musical game show in the U.K. He had been in line as one of that show’s judges but instead ceded his seat to Gary Barlow late of the pop combo Take That. Cowell said he simply had too much to juggle with his TV responsibilities and getting the “Live” show up and running.

Cowell has held a fascination about Las Vegas since he was a kid learning of the Rat Pack and the Sands hotel and all of those classic Vegas icons. The conversation turns unexpectedly to Wayn Newton and again about riding bicycles.

We took a famous bike ride along the Strip with Newton in May 2020 when the boulevard was shut down during COVID.

Forever curious Cowell wants to know all about that ride when the Strip seemed more like a military zone than tourist destination. Barricades were up around all the famous resorts including Luxor where Cowell now has a home.

“If you ever bump into Wayne Newton which I’m sure you will will you tell him that ‘Danke Schoen’ is literally my favorite song of all time?” Cowell says. “I love that song. I heard it in ‘Ferris Bueller’s Day Off’ and I think it’s brilliant. The arrangement is incredible. I just love it.”

Maybe the 62-year-old Cowell was born later than he would prefer according to the Vegas calendar. So he’s creating his own golden-buzzer ispired golden era of Strip entertainment.

“I would love to have been around the time when you know the Rat Pack were performing at the Sands hotel and all that kind of stuff” Cowell says. “I think it must have been an amazing era. And it’s like now everything has gone full circle.”

Social distancing has meant that those who could work from home did making sure essential workers could do their jobs as safely as possible. While healthcare professionals are rightly heralded as the heroes of the pandemic supply chain teams were the unsung heroes battling at the front lines making sure that vital goods including fuel food and medical supplies continued to flow.

Supply chain has always been vulnerable to sudden changes and crises. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic ushered in a new era of disruption and along with it calls for contactless and touchless technologies that kept businesses open while protecting people. Radio frequency identification (RFID) was successful as a technology for contactless identification of assets that optimized processes and prevented errors. Although technology adoption was steadily increasing before the virus the prolonged interruption and RFID’s inherent ability to increase safety has necessitated adoption throughout supply chains.

How is RFID positively impacting supply chains during COVID-19?

Whether due to illness or workforce reductions the reality of a smaller staff required organizations to do more with less. The pandemic has laid bare that technology is critical not only to a company's survival but also to the survival of our global community. The ideas that Industry 5.0 is now bringing about automated systems and our ability to work with them are vital. RFID technology merges the digital and physical world to create trusted identities and delivers huge potential in the speed depth and breadth of processes in large sectors of the economy. Falling costs touchless solutions and the importance of visibility in supply chain are further driving RFID’s embrace.

RFID technology in healthcare. RFID was solving problems in healthcare supply chain before the pandemic. Overwhelmed ICUs and shrinking bed availability have made process optimization critical. Reducing variation in quality and eliminating errors literally mean the difference between life and death. RFID technology enables healthcare to automate logistics that improve capacity management and the care cycle.

Passive RFID applications in healthcare have far-reaching implications. RFID is safe for patient interaction easy to apply yet durable to resist high temperatures and water as well as offers transparent communication layers for integration with existing apps and systems. Facilities can track logistical chains manage inventory and ensure untampered delivery of sensitive assets such as vaccine kits and emergency drugs; automate the configuration and lifecycle of medical devices and provide audit trails that confirm the proper disinfection inspection repair use and billing of tools in treatment; and enable data mining capabilities for reporting metrics management and analysis. NFC tags offer provider authentication visit documentation secure proof of presence and confirmation of care through identifications that are cryptographically secure.

Active RFID that is cloud-connected offers location services within the healthcare ecosystem. Real-time location systems (RTLS) offer visibility into the immediate status of free and in-use inventory of devices and technology and save precious minutes in locating essential tools such as crash carts in emergency situations.

RFID in global tourism. Hotels resorts airlines and tourist attractions experienced a boom up until 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic caused shutdowns and travel restrictions. As sentiment improves over the coming months maintaining consumer trust will help to accelerate the recovery. Hotels and resorts using RFID tags fixed to laundry reduce the risk of human error and maintain safety along with high quality standards as linens are recorded identified and sorted electronically.

Active RFID in the form of RTLS has applications for tourism by assisting in pandemic-related efforts. Physical distancing can be enforced by deploying beacons within a room and tags affixed to wrist bands or badges for guests or personnel. Beacons are configured to detect tags that come within a specified space of one another and create real-time alerts so that social distancing can be enforced. RTLS also allows for occupancy level monitoring and contact tracing to comply with regulatory guidelines and requirements.

RFID in brand protection and authentication. Counterfeiting results in lost sales and very unpleasant customer experiences. Protecting major brands against grey market goods is a global challenge and successful brands are subject to more sophisticated attempts at imitation. In fact counterfeiting has skyrocketed since the onset of COVID-19 aided by shoppers having almost no choice but to turn to e-commerce.

NFC tags embedded in objects – such as rare shoes limited-edition bottled spirits collectibles antiques or even diplomas – are difficult to remove and generate a unique digital code with every use verifying authenticity. And now with larger support for NFC we see the uptake of embedded RFID technology as part of trusted brand authentication and protection strategies.

Final thoughts

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified weaknesses that existed in supply chain worsening bottlenecks and choking resources for those still operating on traditional models. RFID is empowering organizations to respond to the pandemic by implementing advanced technologies at scale. As the world returns to work RFID will aid in the continued recovery efforts. Markets will mature form factors will standardize and software interoperability will improve as use cases are better understood.

Industry 5.0 will bring into sharp focus how man and machine will work together to improve productivity adding a personal touch to the pillars of automation and efficiency brought on by Industry 4.0. RFID technology creates a robust portfolio of solutions for practical use including larger data storage capacity with cryptography and writeback capabilities. RFID and its advancing technologies will continue to shape new business models into the future driving growth and making the next revolution even smarter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwOi8vd3d3LnN1bmRheXRpbWVzLmxrLzIxMTExNC9lZHVjYXRpb24veW91bmctc3JpLWxhbmthbi1kcml2aW5nLWZvcndhcmQtdGhlLW5leHQtYmlnLXJldm9sdXRpb24taW4tY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMtdGVjaG5vbG9neS00NjE1NjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Young Sri Lankan Driving Forward the Next Big Revolution in Communications Technology,"Young Sri Lankan Driving Forward the Next Big Revolution in Communications Technology View(s):

Sri Lanka may be a small island but time and time again we have managed to produce talents to rival the best at global levels. In addition to reaching the pinnacle of their professions some of these exceptional individuals have even managed to revolutionise their respective fields. How our cricketing heroes completely remolded the way the game is approached in 1996 has now become the stuff of folklore and the vocals of Ms. Yohani Silva has recently managed to grab the attention of more than half the world. Although not as well known many Sri Lankans have excelled and made landmark contributions in numerous academic fields as well and continue to do so even today. Two prime examples are Prof. Bandula Wijay the inventor of the vascular stent which continues to save countless lives around the world and Prof. Sarath Gunapala whose work of solid-state physics has been instrumental in many of NASA’s recent successes. These prodigious talents are sources of immense pride to the nation and today’s article is on an individual who could well be the next link in the chain.

Dr. Viduranga Bandara Wijekoon is a young researcher on communications technology already with two US patents under his name. His work has brought us to the cusp of the next big revolution in communications data storage in DNA. The idea seems straight out of science fiction but Dr. Wijekoon and his research group have already managed to realise it. When it comes to practical data storage their prototype system does tick most of the boxes and it may not be long before we can carry all the data in a good-sized library inside a drop of DNA suspended in a vacuum and attached to a key tag. Fancy that.

Dr. Viduranga received his primary education from Highlands College Nugegoda and joined Royal College Colombo 7 in 2002 after getting through the scholarship examination with the third best results in the island. It seems he never took his foot off the pedal when it comes to academics and was duly ranked 6th in the island in ordinary level examinations in 2007 and then the first from physical sciences stream in 2010. Along the way he managed to secure 30+ prizes at college prize awarding ceremonies won several district and island level awards in science mathematics and creative writing served the college as a senior prefect and went on to represent Sri Lanka at the 51st International Mathematical Olympiad where he received an honorable mention. School years well spent I must say.

As per norm Viduranga joined the engineering faculty at University of Moratuwa at the culmination of his secondary education where he decided to pursue electronic and telecommunication engineering. His prowess as an original researcher was first identified at the University when he proposed a novel hardware architecture for software-defined networking which manages to reduce the implementation cost almost by half. This architecture was presented to academia at IEEE NFV-SDN conference a gathering of the top-tier researchers in networking in 2016 and received the second runners-up award in the IEEE Undergraduate project symposium. The accompanying research article continues to receive global attention. Viduranga graduated from University of Moratuwa in 2015 with first class honors and dean’s list placement in all academic semesters which requires an average grade of above 90%. In addition to all this his team managed to reach the top 100 in the IEEEXtreme programming competition the topmost international competition on algorithmic programming in 2015.

After graduating hungry for a taste of industry Viduranga joined Millennium Information Technologies (pvt) Ltd now re-branded as London Stock-Exchange technology as a software engineer. Although he was not focused on research his time there was far from uneventful. Viduranga managed to propose a novel software architecture for financial risk computation which at the time even outperformed hardwired architectures on latency by some margin at that. His architecture currently operates as the foundation of risk computation systems all over the world including at London and Paris Stock Exchanges.

The researcher in Viduranga could not be satiated for long on professional successes and he joined Monash University Australia in 2017 to pursue a doctoral degree on telecommunications under Prof. Emanuele Viterbo the inventor of the golden code which is the industry standard for error correction in multi-user communication. His studies were funded by four separate scholarships from Monash University and the Australian Research Council. Once at Monash Viduranga’s career as a researcher really took-off. Within a year of starting doctoral studies he invented a successful method to decode non-binary codes using binary graphs which was swiftly patented by no less an organisation than Microchip the semi-conductor giant. The invention and its applications were later published in the top-tier journals of his field and presented to the public in Australia USA Italy and Sweden. Microchip organization plans on using the invention to produce USB drives with a much longer lifespan.

During his doctoral studies in addition to his work on non-binary codes Viduranga worked on a few other research problems in his field some related to finite algebra and others to probability and statistics. His research findings on these were presented publicly in France South Korea and Australia and were later published in high quality journals. Moreover in 2020 his team was awarded the second runners-up prize in the Monash Innovation Competition for proposing a mathematical framework to accelerate COVID-19 testing. As recognition of his excellence in research Viduranga was selected as one of the only three nominees from Monash University for the Schmidt Science Fellowships a highly sought-after global fellowship scheme awarded for cross-discipline research. It is also worthy of mentioning that he delivered tutorials to Undergraduate and Masters students during his doctoral studies and received special commendation from the University for teaching an award based on student feedback.

At the culmination of his doctoral studies in December 2020 Viduranga was straightaway offered a research fellow position at Monash University offering him with another opportunity to make further impactful contributions to his field of research. The problem he chose to tackle at the inception of his new position is something that will be felt by almost all of us pretty soon; the lack of a sustainable storage medium to handle the ever-increasing amount of data produced globally. The production of Silicon globally will soon fail to keep pace with the increasing demand for digital data storage rendering the prevailing technologies such as solid state drives or magnetic tapes practically useless. In the search for a more sustainable medium DNA has attracted the attention of researchers worldwide due to the incredible data density it offers and its long term durability. A single gram DNA has the potential to hold the data in more than a million of hard drives and if kept at the right temperature will have a lifespan of more than one thousand years. Imagine being able to store all your photos and videos in some blob inside a cool box and a future descendant of yours thousands of years from now enjoying them. DNA allows us exactly that opportunity.

For a couple decades now researchers world-wide have strived to realise the potential of DNA as a data storage medium but none have been able to add the levels of reading accuracy or accessibility required to make it practically feasible. That is till Dr. Viduranga and his team at Monash University came up with a highly accessible and reliable DNA-based data storage scheme last year. On top of offering accuracy and reliability the prototype system they developed could be operated via a USB connection to a laptop similar to how you would use a hard drive now. The technology they developed has been patented by Nucleotrace an Australian bio-tech corporation developing technologies for Australian defence forces and US and EU Food and Drug Administration organisations. In addition to data storage Dr. Viduranga and his team are also hopeful of using their new technology for product tracking purposes especially for pharmaceuticals the most widely counterfeited commercial product worldwide. They are currently improving the technology and adding auxiliary features such as passwords based on a person’s DNA. They are also hopeful of making the technology operate via a smartphone in the coming years.

Despite achieving so much as a researcher Dr. Viduranga just turned 30 this year and definitely has his best years ahead of him. As Sri Lankans it is our fervent hope that he continues his fabulous journey and brings even more pride to the motherland.",,,,,,

The Biden administration spurned a plan by Intel Corp. to increase production in China over security concerns dealing a setback to an idea pitched as a fix for U.S. chip shortages according to people familiar with the deliberations.Intel the world’s largest chipmaker has proposed using a factory in Chengdu China to manufacture silicon wafers said the people who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. That production could have been online by the end of 2022 helping ease a global supply crunch. But at the same time it’s been seeking federal assistance to ramp up research and production in the U.S.When presented with the plan in recent weeks Biden administration officials strongly discouraged the move the people said.The situation underscores the challenges of the chip shortage  which has hobbled the tech and auto industries cost companies billions in lost revenue and forced plants to furlough workers. The administration is scrambling to address constraints but it’s also trying to bring production of vital components back to the U.S. -- a goal Intel’s China plan didn’t serve.In a statement Intel said it remains open to “other solutions that will also help us meet high demand for the semiconductors essential to innovation and the economy.”“Intel and the Biden administration share a goal to address the ongoing industrywide shortage of microchips and we have explored a number of approaches with the U.S. government ” the company said. “Our focus is on the significant ongoing expansion of our existing semiconductor manufacturing operations and our plans to invest tens of billions of dollars in new wafer fabrication plants in the U.S. and Europe.”The episode comes as the White House is debating whether to restrict certain strategic investments into China. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said the administration is considering an outbound investment screening mechanism and is working with allies on what it could look like. President Joe Biden also is set to meet virtually with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday.A representative for the White House declined to comment on specific transactions or investments but said the administration is “very focused on preventing China from using U.S. technologies know-how and investment to develop state-of-the-art capabilities” which could contribute to human rights abuses or activities that threaten U.S. national security.Like other chip companies Intel is eagerly waiting for Congress to pass $52 billion in funding for domestic research and manufacturing. That proposal called the CHIPS Act has been lingering in the House for months. The president and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo have been pitching the measure as a way to compete with China -- as well as preventing supply crunches in the longer term.Following deliberations with the Biden team Intel has no plans to add the production in China at the moment a person familiar with the decision said. Still such scenarios could arise again and the administration may need to decide what rules come attached to the grant money.Some Republican lawmakers have said that the money shouldn’t come without strings attached. They’ve pushed for guardrails to prevent companies from taking the grants and then still increasing their presence in China.The purpose of the CHIPS bill is to “ensure less dependence on vulnerable supply chains including with respect to semiconductors” according to the White House statement. When asked about potential guardrails in the implementation of the bill the representative said Congress hasn’t yet appropriated the funding.At the same time shortages have become a bigger political issue. Carmakers are losing more than $200 billion in revenue because of the lack of chips and workers at idle plants have lobbied politicians to do something about it. Even giant companies with fine-tuned supply chains aren’t immune. Apple Inc. expects to miss out on more than $6 billion of sales this quarter because it can’t get enough components.Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger meanwhile is trying to cope with the heightened level of public and governmental scrutiny surrounding the chip industry. The $400 billion business has become a key battleground in the increasing rivalry between China and the U.S. forcing companies operating in the Asian nation to navigate more obstacles.The chip industry has a complicated relationship with China one that became much more difficult during the Trump administration’s trade war.China is the biggest consumer of semiconductors for local use and it serves as the assembly center for much of the world’s electronics. To help with logistics and to keep Beijing happy chipmakers -- including Intel -- have located plants there. But they face longstanding U.S. government restrictions that prevent them from exporting cutting-edge semiconductors to the country.Intel also is trying to take on the world’s biggest contract manufacturers of semiconductors increasing its production needs -- and its potential reliance on China. To challenge the leaders in that industry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. Intel needs to be able to support Chinese customers or lose out on a huge chunk of the market.Intel’s plants have previously only manufactured chips of its own designs mainly the processors used by the personal-computer industry. But it faces mounting competition from products made by TSMC and Samsung so Gelsinger’s strategy is to challenge them at their own game.Intel is already opening two new plants near an existing site in Arizona to help with these efforts. The company has also said it will be building in Europe.Gelsinger has argued that relying too much on outsourced production in Asia is a supply chain risk. He’s lobbied for public money around the world to support spreading chipmaking capabilities to different areas. But TSMC and Samsung aren’t standing still themselves: They’re expanding in new areas too including by adding new plants in the U.S.",,,,,,,,,

While the first Surface Duo was dragged down by out-of-date processors and a single camera Microsoft corrected those missteps with the sequel.

So yes the Surface Duo 2 is much better than what came before it while also keeping the stellar design that made the original standout from the smartphone crowd.

And yet there's no phone that I've handled this year that makes me angrier than the Surface Duo 2.

When you review products right away you begin to recognize that not everything that comes across your desk is going to be built with your specific needs in mind. So when assessing a device like the Surface Duo 2 you have to set aside your own biases and focus on whether the product you're looking at addresses the demands of its target audience. In that regard it's difficult to see the Surface Duo 2 as anything but a well-intentioned failure.

Why foldable phones exist

Ask yourself this: Why would someone want a foldable phone (or in the case of the Surface Duo 2 a dual-screen phone that opens up to reveal 8.3 inches worth of workspace)? Even folded up a phone that gives you that kind of extra real estate isn't the easiest device to tote around. So there has to be some reason that justifies trying to fit a phone that big into your pocket.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

I would argue that the case in favor of the Surface Duo 2 — and indeed for any of the best foldable phones or dual-screen devices — is that it gives you the workspace of a tablet in the form factor of a phone. Smartphones give us the processing power of a portable computer in our pocket — yet they have the screen size of a device that's ill-suited for anything but quick easy work. I've tried to edit documents on everything from an iPhone 11 Pro Max down to a compact iPhone SE and it's a real drag.

Foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Fold 3 as well as dual-screen devices like Microsoft's latest Surface Duo address that problem. Instead of a screen that's confined to a smartphone-sized space you get a work area that's wider and taller — big enough for full-screen work like marking up documents or editing folders or for running multiple apps at once if you're so inclined. ""The productivity of a tablet in a device the size of a mobile phone"" is the sales pitch for foldable devices and as far as marketing spin goes it's a pretty compelling argument.

Where the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 falls short

So how does the Surface Duo 2 get this wrong? Because while its two 5.3-inch AMOLED panels can form a larger work area it's not an uninterrupted display like you get from the best foldable phones.

Open an an app so that it spreads across the Surface Duo 2's screen and you've got to contend with a noticeable gap where the two panels come together. This is even more prominent than the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and its visible crease where the screens bend - at least that display is fairly seamless. (For more on how these two phones compare see our Microsoft Surface Duo 2 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 face-off.)

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Microsoft might count that you're really not meant to run apps that way. Instead where the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 really earns its corn is as a multitasking device with two different apps running on opposite panels. You can still drag information aback and forth between the two screens and you can even pair apps to launch together.

Even then you're still working on a 5.3-inch screen — not the expansive 8.3-inch space Microsoft promised you. And even that individual panel is cramped — the bezels on the Surface Duo 2 are quite prominent making the phone feel rather claustrophobic. That's something you should never feel when using a dual-screen device.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

When I tested the Surface Duo 2 I spent some time watching a streaming soccer match with the display in tent mode propping up the phone so I could watch the action unfold on a single panel. It was all right but if I had just streamed the game on an iPhone 11 Pro Max I would have had a more expansive screen area for streaming.

Making the case for the Microsoft Surface Duo 2

Microsoft would counter that its phone has other factors in its favor besides the ability to spread your work across two panels. The phone is compatible with the Surface Slim Pen 2 after all giving you an accessory for note-taking and drawing on the phone's display (if you're willing to pay another $129 for the stylus on top of the $1499 the phone already costs). And Microsoft has worked to see that a number of apps are optimized for the Surface Duo 2's dual screen design.

The same things could be said though of Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 3. And while that phone costs $300 more than Microsoft's handset its truly foldable display doesn't suffer from as many limitations.

Ultimately the problem with the Surface Duo 2 doesn't come down to its feature set its price or any of the specs that usually make or break a phone. The problem here is that the phone simply ignores the reason why people would want to turn to a device with more screen space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYWNrcy5uZXQvMjAyMS8xMS8xMy90dXJucy1vdXQteW91LWNhbi1zdGlsbC1yZWRpcmVjdC1taWNyb3NvZnQtZWRnZS1saW5rcy1idXQtaXQtaXMtY29tcGxpY2F0ZWQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2hhY2tzLm5ldC8yMDIxLzExLzEzL3R1cm5zLW91dC15b3UtY2FuLXN0aWxsLXJlZGlyZWN0LW1pY3Jvc29mdC1lZGdlLWxpbmtzLWJ1dC1pdC1pcy1jb21wbGljYXRlZC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turns out you can still redirect Microsoft Edge links but it is complicated,"Microsoft locked the Microsoft Edge specific protocol that it created in a recent build of Windows 11. Up until now it was possible to use programs such as EdgeDeflector to redirect the requests to another web browser. Microsoft uses the protocol in various apps and pages on Windows 10 and Windows 11 but it is an artificial protocol that offers no advantage to the user.

ADVERTISEMENT

The implementation is anti-competitive and designed purely to boost the company's own web browser Microsoft Edge. Now with the build locking the protocol in place it is even more difficult to use another web browser. While that affects Windows 11 Insider devices currently only it is likely that the implementation will land in stable versions of Windows 11 eventually.

The developer of EdgeDeflector announced already that he won't put anymore effort into the program until Microsoft changes its way and unlocks the protocol again.

Windows 11 users who need to access apps that use the microsoft-edge:// protocol do have another option but it is not as straightforward as setting a different default for the protocol.

The open source tool MSEdgeRedirect uses a different method. Instead of changing the protocol handler it ""filters and passes the command line arguments of Microsoft Edge processes into your default browser "". That removes the reliance on the protocol but has the downside that it needs to be running in the background to work its magic.

The app redirects links that are designed to open in Microsoft Edge. It won't interfere with other links that are opened on the system. Currently Bing is the search engine that is used to open search results. The developer plans to add an option to future versions of the program that enables users to set a different search engine for these requests.

To use MSEdgeRedirect download the latest version of the open source tool from the GitHub repository. It is offered as a 32-bit or 64-bit program. Note that browsers and security applications may display warnings about the program: it is new and designed with AutoIt that's the reason why it may be flagged.

The only options provided at the moment are to start it with Windows and to check for updates. Both options are displayed when you double-click on the system tray icon of the application.

Closing Words

The program works as expected and users who use apps that use hardcoded microsoft-edge protocol links may test it to see if it works for them equally well. Another option that users have is to ignore all apps that use these internal links.

Now You: what is your take on all of this? (via Deskmodder)

Browne said the vaccines will be made available through the COVAX Facility.

Moderna will make several million doses of its vaccines available to the Caribbean and Latin America.

“We think it’s important for us to expand the choice and to ensure that we have Moderna in stock” he said while speaking on his weekly radio talk show.

About 10000 doses of Moderna will be ordered in the first instance.

The Moderna vaccine utilises Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and persons need two doses given 3-4 weeks apart to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Browne stated Antigua and Barbuda will have enough Sinopharm Pfizer AstraZeneca Sputnik V Johnson and Johnson and soon Moderna vaccines to inoculate the entire population.

The government is also looking towards having enough doses to offer booster shots of the vaccine to vulnerable groups this month.

Antigua and Barbuda is aiming achieve herd immunity by end of 2021.

Over 52600 persons in Antigua and Barbuda are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

The government is hoping to have at least 60000 persons vaccinated within a few weeks.

A COVID-19 vaccine mandate has been imposed for persons to access places such as bars and schools.

Browne expects more people to be vaccinated within the coming weeks.",,,,,,,,,

Its Managed Care segment offers health plan coverage to individuals through government-subsidized programs including Medicaid state children's health insurance programs long-term services and support foster care and Medicare-Medicaid plans . The Specialty Services segment provides pharmacy benefits management services; nurse advice line and after-hours support services; and vision and dental services as well as staffing services to correctional systems and other government agencies; and services to Military Health System eligible beneficiaries. This segment offers its services and products to state programs correctional facilities healthcare organizations employer groups and other commercial organizations.

Activist Commentary: Politan Capital Management was founded by Quentin Koffey. Most recently Koffey led the activism strategy at Senator Investment Group. Prior to that he led the activist practice at DE Shaw and before that he was at Elliott Associates. Koffey is operating Politan more like a private equity fund than a traditional long-short equity hedge fund as it can draw down locked up capital to give it enough time to accomplish its goals through active engagement with boards and management teams to improve governance operations or strategic direction. Politan looks for (i) high quality businesses that underperform their peers or potential (ii) where there is a clear fix and (iii) a clear pathway to implement that fix.

Centene is a managed care organization that provides health plan coverage to individuals through government-subsidized and commercial programs. Centene is hired by states and it works to improve the quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries as well as those of other government programs. The company receives a contracted premium per member and is responsible for medical costs. This reprices annually. Centene provides its services to many states which in turn also work with Centene's peers. This leads to a very stable predictable revenue flow for Centene. Moreover the states work with Centene and its peers to produce actuarially sound margins preventing these companies from making or losing a windfall on their services.

This is a very low margin business with net profit margins from 2% to 4%. When 2 percentage points of margin is the difference between doubling your profits or not the valuation of these businesses largely depends on how costs are managed. In this regard Centene has been significantly underperforming its peers with a 2.4% profit margin versus WellCare (which Centene recently acquired) at 4.2% and Molina Healthcare at 4.5%. Part of the reason why Centene's margins lag its peers is because it has been growing primarily through acquisitions most recently acquiring WellCare at a transaction valued at $19.6 billion. These acquisitions need to be integrated and operations need to be centralized.

Fortunately there is clear a roadmap to success here as this is exactly what management at WellCare and Molina did to bring their margins up. But this process has to start at the Board and this is where Koffey's activist expertise will come into play. Historically he has partnered with experienced industry operators as board candidates (i.e. CoreLogic – Bill Foley Lowe's – David Batchelder) and in this situation he has brought in Kenneth Burdick and Wayne DeVeydt. Burdick is the former CEO of WellCare who oversaw its margin improvement and DeVeydt is the former CFO of Anthem Inc. They are obvious choices to add to the board and with five spots up this year on the company's Board we expect Politan to name two additional and likely diverse nominees.

This is a board that is desperately in need of refreshment – the average tenure of the current Board is 11 years and the average age of the directors is 70 (both would be higher but for the new directors added only because of the WellCare merger). Over half the board has a tenure of over 15 years (versus 1% of all S&P 500 directors). The company's CEO is 78 years old and has served on the board for 25 years. Its lead director is 87 years old has also served on the board for 25 years and has been lead director that entire time (versus an average lead director's tenure of four years for S&P 500 companies). This company needs for the first time since it went public a board of experienced directors and fresh eyes to hold management accountable and develop a comprehensive succession plan.

Politan's style is to amicably and quietly work with management to achieve its objectives. They do not send angry public letters and they do not seek proxy fights. However they will also not back down from a proxy fight if their hand is forced: Koffey showed that at CoreLogic and Hess. Politan is likely going to strongly advocate for Burdick and DeVeydt as directors. In the end they will be more focused on how qualified and engaged the directors are – and less concerned with where they came from. This is a situation that should settle but if this does go to a proxy fight we expect that Politan will prevail. A new board that holds the right management team accountable can replicate what Burdick did at WellCare and getting the margins to 4.5% could lead to a tripling of the company's stock price.

So why are sales slow?,"Open this photo in gallery: Cannabis drinks were at one point in time expected to be the future of cannabis.Giordano Ciampini/The Canadian Press

For anyone who wants to drink their cannabis 2021 has been a good year. Consumers can now choose between THC-infused beverages in cans bottles powders and tea bags. Hot chocolate and kombucha options are on the table.

The reason for this surfeit of choice is that drinks were at one point in time expected to be the future of cannabis. A 2018 Deloitte survey for example estimated that the annual Canadian market for cannabis beverages could be worth $529-million. One in three likely cannabis consumers said they were eager to try them.

But despite the industry’s enthusiasm sales of the beverages have lagged expectations leading some observers to say that the category’s potential was exaggerated. Canadian consumers have been deterred by high prices and legislated limits on the potency of the products. Analysts and cannabis companies meanwhile remain optimistic about the segment’s future saying product development and regulation are slowing its expansion.

Whatever their future the current struggles of cannabis beverages add to the tumultuous story of Canada’s cannabis market which has seen underwhelming results since legalization.

According to data from the Ontario Cannabis Store the province’s online retailer and wholesale distributor cannabis beverage sales between April 1 and June 30 amounted to $4.8-million or 2 per cent of Ontario’s total cannabis market during that time. During the same period in 2020 Ontario beverage sales totalled $1.5-million or 1.2 per cent.

Frederico Gomes a cannabis analyst at ATB Capital Markets estimates that the total Canadian wholesale market for cannabis beverages in 2021 could amount to $60-million or close to $100-million at retail. But he noted that the totals could be larger than his estimate given the rapid expansion of the market.

“Obviously the market did not grow as expected” Mr. Gomes said. “You had these large companies investing in the space and they invested because they saw some potential. But you’re talking about manufacturing technology – you need volume to make that profitable and that’s not there yet.”

Beginning in 2017 beverage companies poured into the Canadian cannabis sector making huge investments to prepare for the development of a new drinks industry.

In 2017 beer and wine distributor Constellation Brands bought a $245-million stake in Canopy Growth – the start of a series of investments that now total more than $5-billion. The following year Hexo Corp. and brewer Molson Coors Canada partnered to create Truss Beverages. The two companies have since contributed over $100-million to the venture.

In 2019 Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev partnered with Tilray on Fluent Beverages a $100-million joint venture aimed at developing cannabis drinks. Later that year cannabis producer Valens GroWorks Corp. acquired beverage company Pommies Cider Co. for $7.5-million and said it would dedicate a further $10-million to facility upgrades.

There is data that suggests cannabis beverages are heading toward an upswing. According to Headset a cannabis research firm based in Seattle growth of cannabis beverage sales in Canada is expected to outpace the growth of the total cannabis market. Beverage sales nationally grew by 27 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 and another 34 per cent in the third quarter. This compares with total cannabis market growth of 12 per cent and 13 per cent for the same quarters.

Hexo one of only a few cannabis companies that separately reports its drink revenue says its products account for 50 per cent of cannabis beverage sales in Canada. It reported total fourth-quarter net revenue of around $5.1-million from the sale of beverages to provincial distributors up 70 per cent from the previous quarter.

Other companies have avoided the drinks category. Mandesh Dosanjh president of B.C.-based licensed cannabis producer Pure Sunfarms said that although he was initially interested in beverages further research into production costs regulations and demand dissuaded him.

“Given the headwinds that I see in beverages there’s no point for us to move into it. There’s no money to be made there” he said. “I think a lot of other people are trying to create demand that just doesn’t exist. They’re trying to push a rock up a hill.”

He said he would reconsider if cannabis beverages started to be sold alongside alcohol in government-run liquor stores – although at the moment there are no plans for that to happen. As for the slew of new product announcements in the space Mr. Dosanjh said big players are locked into their plans after “overhyping” the possibilities of the beverage market.

“They’ve got themselves in a pickle now where they put all their eggs in the basket of beverages. The only other alternative they have is to start shutting down and retracting and I think their ego stands in the way of making any pivots” he said.

Recently Hexo announced it was closing down two facilities and laying off 155 employees just weeks after the company’s auditors raised concerns about overwhelming debt payments.

“At the beginning it was about who could spread the fastest and cover the most real estate” said Lucas C. McCann chief scientific officer at Toronto cannabis consultancy CannDelta Inc.

“Now that’s shifting. We’re seeing companies centralizing their operations selling facilities at a fraction of the price and cutting jobs. They’re focusing much more on quality instead of world domination” he said.

Where beverages are concerned improving quality has meant advancing the science of the drinks themselves. In 2019 U.S.-based Lagunitas Brewing Company revealed that it was having trouble mixing oil-based cannabis ingredients with water. Now some manufacturers are using “nano-emulsification” a process that breaks down cannabis particles so they can distribute evenly within a drink.

This process also speeds up the onset of psychological effects Mr. McCann said. Users of the most potent cannabis beverages can expect the effects to peak around 10 minutes after consumption whereas other edibles can take as long as two hours to kick in.

Mr. McCann said the industry was betting on approval for cannabis lounges – bar-like spaces where people could use cannabis products in public – to help introduce both new and experienced cannabis users to beverage products but the pandemic halted progress.

“It’s not going happen any time soon. Until we see the opening of consumption lounges I don’t expect that beverage sales are going to change too much.”

Others say that regulation is to blame for slow sales. Toronto cannabis lawyer Harrison Jordan said possession limits as well as restrictions on product potency are suppressing interest in beverages.

Cannabis products including drinks are currently capped at a maximum 10 milligrams of THC (cannabis’s active ingredient) a package. This is at the bottom of the range of what a habitual user would consume in a sitting and it’s much more expensive per psychoactive unit than dried flower. In other words for regular cannabis users getting high with a drink is much more expensive than smoking.

The OCS charges $10.95 for the Regal Pink Grape Sparkler drink which contains the maximum 10 milligrams. Cheaper less potent options are also available. Houseplant’s Lemon Sparkling Water which contains 2.5 milligrams sells for $3.95 making it comparable in price to some craft beers.

Analysts say possession limits are an equally vexing problem. Current regulations require retailers to cap total sales to a customer at 30 grams of cannabis per visit. Some drinks like Canopy Growth’s 355-mililitre formats count for as many 5.1 grams towards that limit meaning consumers can only buy five at a time.

Despite the barriers cannabis producers continue to create new drinks: in early November Truss launched a beer-style cannabis beverage and Canopy launched a lemon-lime tonic under its Deep Space brand.

“It’s a very small market in Canada but obviously growing” Mr. Gomes said. “I think it has a good chance of becoming a real market but it’s going to take a while.”

Consumption trends driving growth for Mondelez in India include more people consuming premium chocolates even in rural India.Mondelez International president (India) Deepak Iyer told TOI the company has seen a double-digit CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in the last two years.During the third quarter over 80000 stores were added in India. Among categories biscuits witnessed a mid-single-digit growth while chocolates grew in double-digits.Given that rural India has witnessed huge tailwinds Mondelez India has expanded its reach to almost 1 lakh villages said Iyer. “This year urban has rebounded very strongly for us while rural is growing at 1.5 times urban because we believe there’s a lot of headroom for growth given the difference in per capita consumption between urban and rural markets. We have noticed rural consumers are happy consuming chocolates at Rs 5 and Rs 10 price points but they are also asking for ‘Silk’ ( Cadbury Dairy Milk (CDM) Silk ). In a digitally connected world with smartphones rural consumers are aware of premium products.”CDM at price points of Rs 20 and Rs 40 are also very salient now said Iyer while adding that Silk is now a fast-moving SKU (stock keeping unit) for the company. “A small village store would have 50-75% of the SKUs that one finds in an urban store” said Iyer.As to how the company is managing inflationary pressures along with maintaining price points Iyer said the company tries to maintain a balance between the three portfolios of affordable mainstream and premium. The affordable portfolio is used to recruit new consumers and thus no pricing action is taken here. On the other hand the premium portfolio is where pricing actions are taken. “The affordable portfolio will get us volume and new consumers. The premium portfolio will get us profit while the mainstream portfolio will be somewhere in between” said Iyer.On the kind of mega trends he sees for 2022 — whether they’ll peak or taper — Iyer said: “We may have to learn to coexist with Covid in 2022. It’s not going to be the old normal. It is going to be somewhere in between.“On what kept the company going since the pandemic broke Iyer credits it to the company’s employees and the workplace culture. “Even though the external situation in the country posed a lot of uncertainties for the industry there’s one thing that kept our business chugging along in these testing times and that’s our people. Our purpose of empowering people to snack right our mission of leading the future of snacking is something which really energises our teams very well. Over the years we have curated and nurtured a very enabling culture around mindsets and behaviours which have really helped us come out stronger from every disruption that has come our way” he said.,,,,,,,,,

New research suggests as many as half of the world’s fossil fuel assets could become worthless by 2036 if the green energy transition goes ahead at the pace projected coming out of COP26.

If these assets lose all value we could be facing a crash the likes of which we have not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. However earlier adopters of renewable infrastructure and technology could profit from the new economy supporting the creation of new job opportunities and building a new energy industry.

Governments need to plan for a potential oil and gas crash ensuring fossil fuel energy operations meet energy needs during the transition but that the supply does not outweigh the eventual waning international demand. At the current projected rate of production between $11 and $14 trillion could be lost in stranded assets. We could essentially be seeing an experience similar to that of the oil demand drop of April 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic when oil prices plummeted to minus figures. Except in this case demand will not rise again meaning that oil companies and economies relying on the oil sector will experience significant economic hardship.

Bill Gates is just one of the famous voices that have predicted that investing in Big Oil would be a big mistake. The tech billionaire stated at the COP26 climate summit this month “Some of these giants will fall. You know 30 years from now some of those oil companies will be worth very little”.

This prediction follows a fall in the stock prices of several oil supermajors in the past five years including ExxonMobil BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Earlier this year following a year of pandemic restrictions ExxonMobil announced a loss of over $20 billion in the last quarter of 2020. The story is similar for many oil firms around the world those that survived bankruptcy during the pandemic have had to fight to get back on their feet. Earlier this year a report by think-tank Carbon Tracker stated that fossil fuel and related companies stocks lost $123 billion over the last decade suggesting the trend which is set to continue following COP26 and mounting pressure from international organizations to transition away from fossil fuels has already begun. Gains in renewable energy stocks were substantially higher with returns on renewables tripling over the last decade. A positive return on investment was seen in developed countries as well as in emerging economies suggesting that this is a global phenomenon.

Henrik Jeppesen author of the report explained “Climate risk is now very much a material one that cannot be ignored and clean energy stocks are rapidly replacing the old order as the choice investment for a transitioning world.”

If correct the global economy could suffer as hundreds of thousands of energy jobs are lost as the world undergoes an energy transition. Those living in countries dependent on fossil fuel production for revenue and employment are understandably concerned about the shift putting training and job creation at the center of their focus for the emerging renewable energy industry.

According to a Morgan Stanley prediction the coal industry could disappear by as early as 2033 with developed states such as the U.K. pledging to end all coal production within the next five years. Once coal is gone it’s only a matter of time until oil and gas follow. The question is how much time?

Investment in clean energy is steadily rising as the eventual transition becomes an inevitability totaling $501.3 billion in 2020 around a 9 percent increase in 2019. This figure will continue to climb year-on-year until a total shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives has taken place.

But we must not overlook the fact the Big Oil has been focusing on portfolio expansion as investment in renewable energy has become a must for energy firms meaning many international oil majors will continue widescale energy projects thanks to their expertise and investment capabilities. Several oil majors have already invested significantly in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology as a means to make their oil output less carbon-intensive potentially providing its production operations with a longer shelf life as governments strive for net-zero emissions. In addition pretty much all oil supermajors have invested in renewable projects such as hydrogen wind solar and geothermal power. While this will allow many companies to maintain some of their value the lack of early commitment to renewables suggests that they will not become the market leaders of the energy transition.

Big Oil is unlikely to become worthless thanks to the rapid portfolio expansion in renewables by many supermajors. However fossil fuels have and will continue to steadily decline as investments in renewables increase. Furthermore states and oil firms around the globe must consider the rate at which this transition will take place to avoid a worthless reserve of oil piling up as demand gradually wanes which could ultimately lead to a global financial crisis.

The play a regional premiere is about a lot of things but birdwatching or “birding” as it is known today is not one of them. In fact according to Serge Seiden (he/his) co-founder of Mosaic Theater and its managing director this jewel of a play written by Anna Ouyang Moench is about human relationships. Specifically it’s about the maddening relationship of a father and daughter who can only bond over birds.

It’s a bittersweet play reflecting the passage of time the loss of hope and the inability of parent and child to connect. Birding becomes their lingua franca. It’s the only language they share.

(Jane Franklin’s beautifully written review reminds us all to “Seize the day.” The message on stage and off is that life’s precious moments are as fleeting as birds in the sky. Miss them and they are gone.)

After seeing Birds of North America at a recent matinee I joined Seiden who directed and the actors Regina Aquino (she/hers) and David Bryan Jackson (he/his) to learn about this remarkable production.

Although birds play a mostly metaphorical role in this drama they are not peripheral. In fact one of Seiden’s first steps as director was to make sure that the actors knew what birding was about.

To do this he tracked down Molly Herrmann a volunteer for the DC Audubon Society and a leading conservationist who agreed to lead the group on a field trip to the National Arboretum.

“The trip was an eye-opener” Seiden said. “None of us had really thought about birds before. I realized how rarely we stop to observe the life around us. Learning how different each bird is in looks as well as song was like piecing together a puzzle. And Molly was amazing.”

The visit lasted for just an hour but the group spotted many of the birds identified in the play. Most important according to Jackson was that he and Aquino who play the father and daughter were able to share the experience. “Birding is the medium through which our characters communicate” he said. “It’s how they dissolve the tension that keeps getting between them.”

“The irony” Seiden pointed out “is that in the play it’s the father who thinks he’s teaching the daughter. But in the end it’s she who is leading him.”

The notion that children surpass their parents was no surprise to Jackson who is a composer and musician as well as an accomplished actor. “It reminds me of my own children years ago when I set out to teach them to play the guitar. Within three years they were ahead of me.”

While Jackson and Aquino had often auditioned together in the past they had never before performed side by side. “Yet they are hypersensitive to each other” Seiden said “and that’s a necessity in a play like this where the characters constantly react to each other non-verbally.”

The play unfolds over the span of a decade. While the falling leaves symbolize the passage of time the characters must age too. That demands a full range of physical change.

“For example” Jackson explained “in real life I slouch a lot. So for this role I stand up straight at the beginning of the play when my character is full of hope. But then I switch to my normal posture to convey his loss of energy and faith as the years go by.”

“That transformation” Seiden observed “is the magic of theater. It’s an art form but it needs to be internalized to become believable on stage.”

The change is emotional as well as physical. Both characters go from confidence to despair and ultimately acceptance but it takes incredible speed to “reset.”

“I have 15 seconds in which to wipe away my tears change my clothing and restyle my hair” said Aquino who credits Kaylin Luces the assistant stage manager with performing miracles in helping her to change costumes and hair between scenes.

Asked about the effect of “woke” culture on the production Aquino was quick to respond. “The change is dramatic. Theater work today is more collaborative. Rehearsals are more humane. There are more women involved.

“Of course” she added “a lot is the result of the #MeToo movement. The process feels safer. Boundaries are respected and hierarchy is less frequently imposed.”

Safety is a critical factor for Seiden who has been directing plays for more than 25 years. “Actors need to feel safe so that they can experiment. It’s not possible to do that in a toxic environment.”

Jackson agreed. “Each role is a learning experience. For example there is a lot of the father’s character in me. I tend to be very cerebral but through this role I’ve learned how to loosen up and be more physical.”

Originally from London Jackson grew up in the UK as an “army brat” moving to a different city every few years. He moved to the U.S. about 40 years ago and met the director at Studio Theatre where he was understudying for a role and Seiden was stage manager.

For Aquino a Filipina who was born in Maryland one of the most appealing aspects of the play is the fact that the role she plays is that of an Asian-American who is part of an inter-racial family. “This role is a gift” she explained “allowing me to live my own ethnicity on stage.”

It helps that the playwright is Anna Ouyang Moench an astonishingly gifted writer who is also part of an inter-racial family. (Her parents attended the same production that I did.) Her works for the stage include Mothers Man of God and Sin-Eaters. She has also written for television and film and is currently a writer for Severance on Apple TV+.

This is a must-see play. And getting to Mosaic is easy—grab the Metro hop on the trolley and you’re there. In the words of DCMTA’s review Carpe Diem. Seize the day.

The 29-year-old is a designer and maker specialising in Ceramics and mixed media. She runs art workshops and also sells art kits for people to try at home.

Briony Machin's mosaic videos have gone viral on social media

Over the last year her designs and montage videos have captured the attention of millions of people on Tik Tok Facebook and Instagram causing her business to boom.

In the videos Briony can be seen creating stunning mosaic artwork a some of them have amassed millions of views.

Briony said: “People kept saying to me that I needed to post a video to Tik Tok because it is the new ‘cool thing’.

“I put it off for ages because I just didn’t know how to use it so didn’t bother.

“I posted one of the videos I already made to Instagram and then about three days later it had 400000 views which was mental.”

Briony's studio in Mawdesley (Photo: Jake Lawrenson)

“A couple of the videos on Tik Tok went viral like that and we’re even featured on Lad Bible Buzzfeed and more.

“That was in May and I’ve continued posting to Instagram and Tik Tok since.""

One Facebook video shows Briony making a “sunny floral mosaic” – at the time of writing it has racked up more than 18 million views which Briony still thinks is “crazy to think about.”

Thousands of people commented praising the gorgeous design and commenting on how much fun it looks.

She said: “I think so many people watch the videos because it is something new and there aren’t many people posting mosaic tutorials – I’m also guessing the social media algorithm liked them.”

She added that as a result of the videos the demand for her at home kits “has gone crazy”.

She added: “There has also been international interest. Before it was all UK and now my following is 60 per cent international and I get a lot of request from different countries”

Before she started posting the videos to her social media accounts Briony has 3000 Instagram followers.

Now her followers have exploded and she has amassed over 153000 followers on Instagram and 59500 on Facebook 30000 on Tik Tok

While she says she is grateful for the amount of people watching she also added that she can be “overwhelmed” with orders once a video takes off.

She said: “[Going viral] is really weird. Sometimes it can be a lot to get so many messages on top of my regular work.

“It’s just me I’m a one woman band having to make all the orders and pack all of them.

“However the messages I receive are so lovely. People tell me they find my videos therapeutic or that I have inspired them to pursue their own dreams.”

Briony Machin

Briony is planning to continue her successful business with plans to expand even further.

She added: “I’ve got plans for online workshops so people internationally can do workshops and I plan to expand all the kits.

“I want to do community projects subscription services and also to start making some of my own ceramics.”

Mixed sentiment across the stock market coupled with high inflation figures are keeping investors cautious. That said solar stocks appear to be heating up lately. We saw the likes of Daqo New Energy (NYSE: DQ) and Sunnova Energy International (NYSE: NOVA) edging higher during last week’s trading session. The driving force to this movement was news of the U.S. Department of Commerce rejecting a request from unnamed solar manufacturers for tariffs to be levied on solar panels made in South East Asia. So how would this benefit some of the solar companies?

Well an increase in tariffs would increase the cost of solar panels across the U.S. Hence leading to lower sales volumes and profits. However investors should not look too deeply into this new development as it does not change the fundamentals of the solar industry. Instead more emphasis should be placed on the fact that solar energy adoption is creeping higher by the day. With all said and done solar stocks appear to be well-positioned for growth in the foreseeable future. So here are some of the top solar stocks in the stock market today.

Best Solar Stocks To Watch This Month

Enphase Energy

First we will be looking at one of the leading energy technology companies in Enphase Energy. Essentially the company specializes in home energy solutions that manage energy generation storage and control on one platform. Besides that its semiconductor-based microinverter converts energy at the individual solar module level that provides advanced energy monitoring and control.

Last week Monday the company announced an expansion of partnership with battery storage solutions with Your Energy Solution. The companies are seeing growing interest in Enphase Solar and battery systems as energy consumers prepare for increasingly common power shutoffs. In particular the Enphase IQ™ Battery features a long cycle life and safe operation through excellent thermal stability. Thus delivering a safer solar-plus battery solution without exposing homeowners to high-voltage DC.

By the looks of its latest earnings report the company appears to be trending in the right direction. During its third quarter Enphase posted a record quarterly revenue of $351.5 million representing an increase of a staggering 96% year-over-year. Also the company shipped approximately 2599575 microinverters and 65-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage systems. Given these considerations would you consider adding ENPH stock to your watchlist?

JinkoSolar

JinkoSolar operates in the photovoltaic (PV) industry. The company builds a vertically integrated solar power product value chain manufacturing the likes of silicon wafers and solar modules. Its services include solar power generation and solar system Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) and processing services. Impressively JKS stock has almost doubled its value over the past six months.

Earlier this month the company announced plans of investing $70 million for equity in China’s Sichuan Yongxiang Energy Technology Co. It will be used for the construction of a high-purity polysilicon production line with an annual capacity of 100000 tons. Out of which Jinko will secure a stable supply of nearly 30000 tons of high-purity polysilicon every year once the project is fully operational.

On top of that the company also recently launched a new series of ultra-efficient 2021 Flagship Tiger Neo modules. This adopts N-type TOPCon technology with further enhancements in performance power energy density and reliability. Thus allowing a maximum power output of up to 620W and an ultra-high conversion efficiency of up to 22.3%. All things considered do you think JKS stock could continue to push on?

Sunrun

Following that we have the home solar battery storage and energy services company Sunrun. Put simply the company engages in the design development installment sale and maintenance of residential solar energy systems in the U.S. Not to mention it offers battery storage along with solar energy systems to its customers. With RUN stock trading sideways for most of the year could things be looking up now?

In October the company announced the expansion of its program with SPAN. For those unaware SPAN is the company that reinvented the electrical panel so homeowners can intelligently control their energy consumption and remove barriers for customers who want to electrify their homes and vehicles. So the program will accelerate the adoption of home solar and batteries electric vehicles and so much more.

During Sunrun’s third quarter it reported total revenue of $438.8 million more than double that of the prior year’s quarter. Another key metric to focus on would be the number of new customers it added. Sunrun was able to add 30698 new customers that includes 24836 Subscriber Additions. With that in mind do you see RUN stock as a top solar stock to watch now?

Canadian Solar

To sum things up we have Canadian Solar. This is a solar power company that provides solar power products services and system solutions around the world. In detail the company has a CSI Solar segment and Global Energy segment. The CSI Solar segment involves the design and manufacturing of a range of solar power products. On another hand the Global Energy segment consists of global solar and energy storage power projects and asset management services.

The company was recently awarded 52 MWp for the solar PV project Caracoli in the recent public auction by Colombia’s Ministry of Energy. This marks the company’s second landmark achievement in Colombia after the recent awarding of the country’s first utility-scale stand-alone 45 MWh battery project in Barranquilla. Safe to say Canadian Solar’s ability to reinforce its leadership position in Latin America is a testament to its healthy track record of excellence of service.

Keen investors should also take note that the company will be announcing its third-quarter earnings report on November 18. After posting strong financial figures across the board in its second quarter investors will be looking to see if Canadian Solar could keep up its stellar performance. With that said would you consider investing in CSIQ stock ahead of its earnings report?

This is despite only producing about 15 vehicles per week right now. The company has a bright future but investors looking for any value in electric vehicle stocks should probably look elsewhere right now.

Three of our Fool.com contributors Travis Hoium Howard Smith and Daniel Foelber think General Motors (NYSE: GM) ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE: CHPT) and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) are all better buys than Rivian today.

The leader in autonomous driving

Travis Hoium (General Motors): As companies like Rivian get all the headlines in electric vehicles General Motors is quietly building out the technology and manufacturing capacity to transition entirely to electric vehicles by 2035. That includes 30 EV models that will launch globally by 2025 including cars trucks and SUVs.

But it isn't GM's EV capacity that makes it a better buy than Rivian it's the company's majority ownership of Cruise the autonomous ride-sharing company that provides the most upside. GM is providing Cruise with design and manufacturing capabilities to build autonomous vehicles like the Cruise Origin (shown above) a self-driving shuttle for ride-sharing developed in a partnership between Cruise GM and Honda. Cruise is developing autonomous driving hardware and software that go into Origin and eventually a ride-sharing business. GM is also providing funding to build out Cruise's vehicle infrastructure which could cost many billions of dollars starting with a $5 billion line of credit to buy Cruise Origins.

In time autonomous vehicles could reduce the cost of traveling in cities and even make vehicle ownership obsolete. Cruise is leading the way into this market and that provides tremendous upside for GM. This may be an old company in the auto industry but it's making great strategic moves to be a leader in the future of electric and autonomous vehicles.

Picks and shovels

Howard Smith (ChargePoint Holdings): Rivian's public debut generated a lot of excitement for good reason. The company has big backers and reportedly a backlog of orders for both fleets and consumer electric vehicles (EVs). But investors have seen plenty of examples where initial excitement causes a spike in valuation that doesn't always last.

Another exciting recent event for EV investors was the passage of a federal infrastructure bill that will push $7.5 billion to help build out the charging infrastructure needed for this country to expand EV ownership. ChargePoint Holdings is the leader in that space with more than 118000 charging ports including more than 3700 DC fast chargers. The vast majority of those stations are in the U.S. though the company is also growing its business in Europe where it already has 5400 charging locations.

Those federal infrastructure funds will be sent to states that will issue grants to the charging network companies which will make up the country's network. And that should be a big shot in the arm for ChargePoint as the largest operator in the country. Even prior to the realization of that catalyst ChargePoint was growing its business beyond what it had predicted before its public debut.

The company recorded $146 million in revenue for its full fiscal year 2021 that ended Jan. 31 2021. In its most recently reported quarter ended July 31 2021 it raised its revenue guidance for its current fiscal year by 15% to a range of $225 million to $235 million. At the midpoint that would represent annual revenue growth of 57.5% even without the added catalyst of federal funds.

ChargePoint generated its own excitement when it announced it would begin trading publicly last year. The stock is almost 50% off the peak price reached at the end of Dec. 2020 prior to the closing of its merger with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that brought it public. It wouldn't be surprising to see Rivian's stock fluctuate as well. But for Rivian -- and all the other EV makers -- to be successful there will need to be charging infrastructure in place. That makes ChargePoint a ""picks and shovels"" type of investment for the rapidly growing EV sector. That could make it a better investment today than adding to Rivian's early hype.

Lucid is proving it can compete against the best in the business

Daniel Foelber (Lucid Group): Rivian's roughly $120 billion market capitalization is raising eyebrows considering the company is relatively unproven. Similarly Lucid Motors has received its fair share of criticism for sporting a $65 billion market cap just over a month into the mass production of its Lucid Air Dream Edition luxury sedan.

Rivian and Lucid are pricey and it's hard to say which is the better value now. Rivian has received backing from Amazon and Ford as it targets the higher-end electric lifestyle truck and electric delivery van markets. Similar to Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) the company is bypassing the dealership framework of traditional automakers by marketing directly to consumers. Rivian also plans to build its own charging network to make electricity more accessible in remote places where a core part of its outdoor-focused target demographic requires the ability to charge. By comparison Lucid doesn't feel the need to invest in its own charging network choosing instead to save money by partnering with the growing list of third-party charging providers.

Rivian has already faced delivery delays due to the global chip shortage. By comparison Lucid has quickly built a reputation for delivering on its promises having hit all of its major 2021 goals on time. Lucid also has an excellent management team and plenty of cash to fund its 2022 operations.

Arguably the best reason why there's never been a better time to buy Lucid stock is that the company has achieved incredible engineering feats that rival Tesla -- the undisputed champ in the EV industry. Packing in more battery cells can help improve performance but Lucid isn't doing that. Instead it has built a compact battery pack that sports a battery efficiency of 4.5 miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh) of stored energy which is higher than the Tesla Model S Jaguar I-Pace Porsche Taycan and other competitors. Lucid management believes that battery efficiency is the key differentiating factor not just higher horsepower and range. With the Lucid Air Dream Edition and Grand Touring it has outdone the competition in both efficiency ratings and performance -- albeit for a high price tag.

Rivian supporters would argue that not only does Rivian have a nice head start in the lifestyle EV pickup truck market but it's also going to be a relatively insulated market because seasoned automakers like Ford and GM are only challenging the standard pickup truck market (for now). By comparison Lucid plans to roll out lower prices trims of its sedan that would have to compete against expensive but much more ""affordable"" luxury sedan leaders. In doing so it plans to lower the horsepower and range of its cars which would bridge the gap between its advantages and the competition. However what gives Lucid the edge over Rivian is that it has proven it can go toe-to-toe with the best in the business hit its targets and has plans to grow quickly in 2022 and beyond.

Given that the growth trajectory is mapped out Lucid has a clear path toward even greater success. However investors should be aware that Lucid stock is likely to remain extremely volatile as the company works toward scaling production.

EVs are here to stay

What we all agree on is that electric vehicles are here to stay. They're now competitive with fossil fuel vehicles in range costs are coming down and the innovative companies making EVs are enabling autonomy as well. The entire EV space has huge potential; we just think GM ChargePoint and Lucid are better buys than Rivian at today's price.

(FB) is the world’s largest social media network providing some of the most popular applications to connect and communicate online such as Facebook Instagram Messenger WhatsApp and Oculus which makes virtual headsets for gaming and entertainment. The main revenue source for Meta Platforms comes from the advertising business.

The corporate rebrand to Meta Platforms from the previously named Facebook comes at a time when investors need to consider three different factors that could impact the business prospects of this leading social media empire. I am bearish on FB stock considering all three of these factors. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)

Mixed Q3 Results

Meta Platforms reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings but missed estimates on revenue. The social media and technology company reported earnings of $3.22 versus $3.19 per share expected by analysts. Revenue reported was $29.01 billion versus the expected $29.57 billion. Meanwhile the daily active users (DAUs) reported figure of 1.93 billion came in-line with consensus and monthly active users (MAUs) were weaker-than-expected coming in at 2.91 billion vs. 2.93 billion.

Additionally the average revenue per user (ARPU) also was weaker-than-expected with a figure of $10 compared to $10.15.

The positive news is that Meta Platforms announced a $50 billion increase to its share buyback program. The company said that they ""repurchased $14.37 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and had $7.97 billion remaining on our prior share repurchase authorization as of September 30 2021.”

Although this is good news for the intrinsic value of FB stock a deceleration in revenue growth which has been present for three consecutive years is a cause for concern. The 2018 2019 and 2020 data shows that revenue growth was 37.35% 26.61% and 21.60% respectively. In absolute numbers revenue continues to grow but this growth is losing momentum.

During itsearnings call Meta Platforms attributed the decline in revenue to changes Apple (AAPL) made to its iOS 14.5 privacy options. Apple allowed its users to opt-out of apps tracking them across the web resulting in lower conversion rates for advertisers and lower advertising revenue consequently for Meta Platforms.

Bearing this in mind Meta Platforms will have to spend and invest in its targeting system related to the advertising business and improve the algorithms.

Pivot Toward the Metaverse

The decision to rebrand from Facebook to Meta Platforms is a major business decision. CEO Mark Zuckerberg considers the metaverse to be a “successor to the Internet.” But what is a metaverse? A metaverse is a completely digital world in which multiple people can interact within a 3D environment create avatars and engage in activities such as entertainment gaming and online shopping.

It is difficult to say if other social media platforms will follow Meta Platforms' example and pivot toward a metaverse-centric business model but until widespread adoption occurs it remains a considerable risk.

An Ethical Accusation

Meta Platforms has recently faced a PR crisis after a whistleblower publicly testified to U.S. lawmakers accusing the company of putting “profits before people.” Numerous leaked documents were published which suggested the Facebook algorithms had been drawing users toward circles of hate and misinformation.

Zuckerberg has defended the practices of his firm by stating that the testimony was “a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.”

This is hardly the first high-profile controversy in which FB has been embroiled. Headlines were published in 2017 alleging that political consulting and strategic communications firm Cambridge Analytica had collected personal information from about 87 million users on Facebook. This data security breach may now have been left behind by the investment community but the ethical track record of FB has only seemed to garner more and more negative media attention.

Putting profit over public safety is a dangerous game to play. Meta Platforms has announced that it will soon remove advanced targeting options which involve sensitive topics. These issues can include health race religion ethnicity and political affiliation.

Wall Street’s Take

On TipRanks Meta Platforms has an analyst consensus rating of Strong Buy based on 29 Buys 6 Holds and 1 Sell rating. The average Meta Platforms price target of $405.59 implies a 12-month 18.98% upside potential.

10 stocks we like better than Twitter

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20 2021

Trevor Jennewine: The company reported earnings yesterday after the market closed. This stock is down over 10% today. We'll get into that in just a second but revenue came in at $1.3 billion -- that was roughly in line with management's forecasts -- up 37%. The big surprise was operating income was -$743 million and that was a huge miss. Management was expecting roughly flat operating income around $0 to slightly positive. A huge miss and of course that trickled down to the bottom line. On a GAAP basis earnings per share was -$0.67. Again huge miss.

The reason for that there was a class action shareholder lawsuit filed back in 2016 and the company ended up paying $809.5 million to settle that lawsuit. There were some insurance benefits they kicked back the other direction. The net charge was $766 million. When you back that out the company did have a positive operating income. Even if you do back it out though the operating income is still down from where it was in the previous year.

On the bright side daily active users hit 211 million. That's up 13% and that's a slight sequential acceleration. It jumped 11% in the previous quarter. And cash from operations was $389 million up 81%.

This being an ad-supported business Apple's changes to the iOS privacy terms were one of management's focuses here. They did say that it's too early to assess the long-term impact of the iOS changes but they did think that the impact to quarter three was less than what they were expecting. Maybe a small silver lining there for shareholders but definitely something worth paying attention to in the coming quarters.

One other thing that management mentions is that they're going to be selling MoPub which has an ad exchange they bought back in 2013 I believe. That sale is going to be closing in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. They mentioned that might be a headwind to revenue as the teams at MoPub shift to other areas of the business. The reason they're making the sale is Twitter sees opportunities in performance advertising and specifically in commerce as well on the platform. They're pursuing what they consider to be higher value opportunities. They did mention that this sale will not impact their previous forecast that they will reach $7.5 billion in annual revenue by 2023.

Turning to the outlook they're expecting $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter that will be up 24%. They're looking for operating income in the $130 million to $180 million range. That would be down 29% the prior year. Overall operating income coming in light this quarter. The weak guidance for the next quarter spooked Wall Street and the stock did sell off pretty significantly today.

Brian Withers: For me Twitter's always been -- I think it has a great product and people love it -- but they've had a tough time monetizing the business and really being consistent. Depending on when you bought it you could have made considerable amount of money if you owned it for the last five years but if you owned it for the last 10 -- eh not so great. Up 22% over the last 10 years but the last five it's up over 200%. It's been a tough stock for Fools to love.

While the number of customers the company adds in any given period is the primary focus for shareholders I think there is a bigger development to focus on right now.

During the third quarter Netflix produced an operating margin of 23.5%. This crucial financial metric foreshadows something investors have long waited for from the company: sustainable generation of positive free cash flow.

Benefits of scale

Since it first started developing content in-house in 2012 Netflix has spent over $80 billion producing original films and TV series. This is a colossal figure but it's categorized as a fixed cost it doesn't change relative to how many customers Netflix has at any specific time. Therefore adding more subscribers has a positive effect on margins.

Because of the company's massive scale demonstrated by trailing-12-month revenue of $28.6 billion and those previously mentioned 214 million subscribers it makes financial sense for Netflix to invest heavily in original content. These cash outlays can be spread out among an enormous user base a favorable atrribute few rival firms can match.



Netflix was the first and only guest at the streaming party for quite some time and this head start has now resulted in incredible economies of scale. The business is able to spend more money on content than its peers ($17 billion in cash this year alone) giving it a major competitive advantage. More dollars translate into a larger high-quality content library something that attracts subscribers in what is now becoming a very crowded space

In 2015 Netflix's operating margin was just 4.5%. For full-year 2021 management is expecting that figure to hit 20.4% so you can easily see the operating leverage unfolding as its revenue and subscriber base increase. This level of profitability is evidently the tipping point for Netflix to start producing positive free cash flow in the years ahead.

Going forward management still believes operating margin can rise roughly three percentage points annually. Though the margin growth will eventually level out there is plenty of room for the company to keep plowing money into the content machine while at the same time generating cash. Wall Street will certainly look favorably upon this.

A prediction for 2026

If we assume that revenue doubles over the next five years (which would mark a slowdown from Netflix's growth in the previous five years) sales would approach $60 billion in 2026. And according to the leadership team's margin expectation I discussed above annual operating income would total $21 billion in five years' time.

Based on its market capitalization of $300 billion as of this writing Netflix stock trades at 13.7 times its projected operating income in 2026. For being the clear leader in the burgeoning streaming industry with significant scale and first-mover advantages over its competitors that valuation seems completely reasonable to me. Netflix's current market cap is about 46 times trailing-12-month operating income so even if that multiple contracts over time there's still plenty of upside for the stock.

Also let's not forget Netflix is only in the early stages of generating cash opening up the opportunity to expand the current share-buyback program or pay dividends both of which can boost shareholder returns.

There's a lot to like about Netflix and its financial prospects. Recent trends in operating margin that we've all been witnessing are a clear indicator of what's to come.

Where to Watch “Insiders“: Netflix

At one point in “Insiders” there’s a montage of people being told they’re being put through into the next “round” of a reality show casting process. Nearly every one of them asks if they can give a hug or kiss to the producer giving them the good news. (They only get handshakes.) It’s a sustained burst of happiness and relief from a group of individuals who don’t even realize that the show they think they’re auditioning for is well under way.

That’s the main hook for “Insiders” a series that puts a dozen people through the paces of a “training” period ostensibly to see which of them is cut out for being on a show that none of them know will never actually come. Instead the minimalist practice living space that they’re all trapped in is the show complete with hidden cameras and microphones picking up every bit of scheming and covert alliance-building that’s already in motion.

Like most reality competition shows it’s all an elaborate social experiment under the guise of a bit of TV fame. And the audition ruse isn’t the only way that “Insiders” toys with the well-established formula. Host Najwa Nimri constantly teases the next new wrinkle sometimes even segueing into a clip from a few days ahead along the timeline that shows how someone’s plan or principles will eventually change.

Condensing multiple weeks into seven hour-long episodes is necessarily going to lose a lot of the context around some of these interactions. Given the “nothing is as it seems” carrots dangled in front of the contestants “Insiders” doesn’t go quite as diabolical in hiding key details from the audience watching them. But it’s still an interesting case study in reality-show strategy particularly in the conversations that happen when the people involved don’t suspect they’re being recorded.

It’s another drop in the overall ethical murkiness of reality TV. It’s obviously not the same as if the show pulled in a houseful of strangers to watch them against their will but there’s a distinct level of manipulation on display here that feels less like a game at points. There are segments that hinge on seeing people at a level of vulnerability that sometimes feels more invasive than the usual reality show idea.

With the permanent caveat that there’s always a question of emotional authenticity in this TV subgenre the eliminations on “Insiders” really do feel like funerals. It’s a question for the audience to answer whether the amount of tears at each sendoff come from sadness at someone leaving gratitude that they’re staying or fear that they could be next. There are inevitably some massaged narratives that pop up throughout the season but aside from highlighting some brewing rivalries and short tempers this stays away from pinning a specific someone from this dozen as an outright “me against the world” villain.

Eventually “Insiders” settles into a familiar groove even though the show reserves a few extra surprises for the season’s dwindling moments. Those are less about grafting manufactured drama onto an already tense situation and more about making simple tweaks to an ongoing developing situation. In a self-contained world of one-way mirrors and algorithmic personality biometrics all it takes is a tiny pebble for the ripples to go through the entire group.

Spending as much time as you do with this group without any outside trips or corporate brand tie-ins you do get attuned to the rhythm of the show and how much difference one or two people can make. There will always be a barrier between the “real” person and who they are on screen but this show goes a step further in trying to make that as thin as possible.

Pair It With: For a reality show there are few better complements than the “Frenemies” episode of “This American Life.” Not only is there a lexicographic discussion of that word’s origins and one of the signature contributions from the late David Rakoff it has the classic Rich Juzwiak breakdown of “I’m not here to make friends.”

And for an extra Netflix dose of people being unwittingly subjected to psychological conditions that they’re largely unaware of try the Derren Brown special “The Push” another example of TV looking at how suggestible people might be when they think no one else is paying attention.

All four seasons which consists of 40 episodes in total are set to leave on December 14th 2021.

First airing in 2014 the AMC show eventually went on to run for four years before wrapping up. It tells the story of the invention of some of the computer components and software that revolutionized the world in the early 1990s.

Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers created the show with

Lee Pace Scoot McNairy Mackenzie Davis Kerry Bishé and Toby Huss starring.

The series is often ranked among some of the best TV produced in the 21st Century. BBC Culture for instance ranked it in its top 50. We even include it in our big list of the top 50 TV shows on Netflix.

The series first touched down on Netflix in April 2015 and saw new seasons added every year thereafter with two seasons arriving in 2017. The final season of Halt and Touch Fire hit Netflix on December 15th 2017 and now four years on the dot it’s now set to leave.

AMC content on Netflix has been leaving in a dramatic fashion over the past few years as the licenses for their shows come up for renewal. For example we’ve seen the removal of Hell on Wheels (departed in December 2020) Mad Men (departed in June 2020) TURN: Washington’s Spies (also set to depart in December 2021).

Once Halt and Catch Fire departs that will leave only The Walking Dead Breaking Bad Into The Badlands and Better Call Saul in the US.

Netflix has conveniently added a show very much in the same ballpark recently in the form of The Billion Dollar Code. The series is similar in premise in the sense that it covers the early days of the world wide web. The series is produced in Germany and sees an artist and a hacker going up against Google after they allegedly infringed on their patent. It’s very much worth watching for Halt and Catch Fire fans.

Where will Halt and Catch Fire stream next?

The show is distributed by AMC Networks so our best bet is that the series will become exclusive to AMC+ but it’s unclear right now whether any other streaming service will also receive the show.

Will you miss when Halt and Catch Fire departs Netflix in December? Let us know in the comments down below.

Buttrose in a blistering statement called on the upper house to act to “defend the independence of the ABC” by passing a motion to terminate or suspend the government inquiry until an independent process commissioned by the ABC Board last month has been completed.

The government inquiry was announced last week after the ABC’s complaints division told Fox News it had not upheld any of the complaints made in a lengthy submission about a Four Corners program on Fox News aired in August.

“This is an act of political interference designed to intimidate the ABC and mute its role as this country’s most trusted source of public interest journalism” Buttrose said in a statement on Sunday.

“Any incursion of this kind into the ABC’s independence should be seen by Australians for what it is: an attempt to weaken the community’s trust in the public broadcaster.

“If politicians determine the operation of the national broadcaster’s complaints system they can influence what is reported by the ABC.”

The Labor opposition criticised the “wasteful and duplicative inquiry” as “yet another attempt at political interference from this government”.

“Meanwhile the Morrison-Joyce government has overseen funding cuts to the ABC misled the public about these cuts attacked the ABC board in response to a Four Corners investigation and failed to act on the recommendations of two inquiries into press freedom in the wake of AFP raids on journalists at the ABC and News” Labor’s communications spokesperson Michelle Rowland said.

In her strongest statement as chair Buttrose said the inquiry set up by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg on Thursday “appears to be a blatant attempt to usurp the role of the ABC board and undermine the operational independence of the ABC”.

“As senator Bragg is aware in October the ABC Board initiated an independent review of the ABC’s complaints system by two eminent experts Prof John McMillan former commonwealth and NSW ombudsman and Jim Carroll former SBS director – news and current affairs. The terms of reference for the review are comprehensive and wide-ranging.”

Buttrose said the power to develop codes of practice for the ABC lay with the board not the government and that was a key pillar of the ABC’s editorial independence.

Bragg announced the inquiry into the complaints handling arrangements of the ABC and SBS three weeks after the ABC established an external review and after he had been interviewed by reviewers about his concerns.

“Instead of respecting the integrity of this process the Senate committee under the leadership of senator Bragg has decided to initiate a parallel process” Buttrose said.

“I will leave it to senator Bragg to explain his motives but the impact of this action is clear. As chair of the ABC board I am duty-bound to call out any action that seeks to undermine the independence of the national broadcaster.

“A fundamental democratic principle underpinning the ABC has been its independence from interference by those motivated by political outcomes.

“Politicians like all citizens are welcome to criticise anything they find wrong or objectionable that is published by the ABC but they cannot be allowed to tell the ABC what it may or may not say.

“Transparency and accountability are important and the Senate committee performs a vital role. The ABC attends Senate estimates hearings on multiple occasions every year and answers hundreds of questions on notice.”

It is the second time in 12 months the ABC has accused the Morrison government of political interference.

In December 2020 Buttrose accused the government of a pattern of behaviour which “smacks of political interference” and earlier warned of an escalating campaign targeting the public broadcaster. She labelled claims it pushed agendas and campaigns against free enterprise as “malicious garbage”.

She also threw her support behind a media freedom act and declared 2019’s Australian federal police raids “clearly designed to intimidate”.

Buttrose accused the Morrison government of using News Corp Australia to attack its journalism last year after the Australian was briefed about a series of government questions for the broadcaster before the ABC received them.

After Four Corners spoke to former Fox News insiders who claimed the right-wing channel became a propaganda outlet for the former president under the watch of Rupert Murdoch himself News Corp went on the offensive publishing 45 articles attacking the public broadcaster in two days.

“The episode clearly violates the basic tenets of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s published standards by exhibiting bias and a failure to maintain any level of impartiality in the presentation of news and information” a Fox News spokesperson said at the time.

Bragg told Sky News Australia the ABC complaints system was akin to a kid “marking their own homework”.

“At the moment if you lodge a complaint with the ABC it’s not dealt with by an independent person” he said on Tuesday. “It’s a bit like Dracula and the blood bank. They basically mark their own homework.”

Bragg suggested a “litany” of people were unhappy with the ABC including veterans multicultural communities and Jewish groups.

Bragg told Guardian Australia a parliamentary review was necessary because there had been “extensive community concern over a number of programs and posts and the associated complaints handling”.

He denied the ABC review was external even though the board appointed two independent experts to undertake it.

“It is not an external review it’s an internal review and I believe the Senate inquiry will be a stronger mechanism” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMS8xMy9ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaC10b2xkLWJvcmlzLXRvLXNjcmFwLW9mLWJiYy1haGVhZC1vZi10di1jaGFubmVsLWxhdW5jaC0xNTU5NTQ2My_SAXFodHRwczovL21ldHJvLmNvLnVrLzIwMjEvMTEvMTMvcnVwZXJ0LW11cmRvY2gtdG9sZC1ib3Jpcy10by1zY3JhcC1vZi1iYmMtYWhlYWQtb2YtdHYtY2hhbm5lbC1sYXVuY2gtMTU1OTU0NjMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boris Johnson's sister says she 'was joking' about Murdoch telling PM to axe BBC,"Rupert Murdoch’s company is set to launch a TV channel called talkTV in early 2022 (Pictures: Getty)

Rachel Johnson has backtracked from claims Rupert Murdoch told her brother to ‘get rid of the BBC’ during a visit to his country house.

At a media industry event this week she said the tycoon ‘dandled’ the PM’s son Wilfred on his knee at Chequers as he made the case for scrapping the broadcaster.

The LBC radio presenter 56 said corporation was facing an ‘increasing struggle’ for survival amid competition from streaming and subscription services.

But after her remarks hit the news she distanced herself from them and claimed she wasn’t being serious.

In a tweet this morning she said: ‘Sorry to disappoint but Rupert Murdoch NEVER told the PM to get rid of the BBC as I am quoted as saying in today’s Daily Mail.

‘It never happened. Joke taken out of context. Totally my fault for agreeing to say “a few words” about future of the media. Apols to all who got excited.’

The comments come as News UK owned by Mr Murdoch is set to launch a TV channel called talkTV in early 2022 which has signed Piers Morgan as its star presenter.

Ms Johnson said part of the pressure was coming from the likes of the newspaper magnate who was making the case that the corporation was a threat to competition.

She said: ‘In my judgement the BBC will be here in 10 years.

‘But it is going to be an increasing struggle when the whole of the television story is about streaming and subscription to have the BBC which costs £4billion to run which gets £3billion in from the licence fee to have that entity as a competitor.

‘Especially when you have got people like Rupert Murdoch going to Chequers and saying to my brother as he dandles Wilf on his knee “Boris you’ve got to get rid of the BBC it’s eating my lunch they got a website they’re a publisher it’s not competitive”. You can see that there are pressures from all sides.’

It was reported earlier this year that the News Corp executive chairman and his top executives in the UK and US met the Prime Minister and other high-level Government politicians seven times between them in seven weeks last summer.

Boris Johnson was allegedly told to scrap the broadcasting service by the media mogul (Picture: Getty)

Mr Murdoch met with Mr Johnson paid for lunch with Chancellor Rishi Sunak ate a private dinner with Michael Gove and had an ‘informal lunch between friends’ with Jacob Rees-Mogg between August 8 and September 25 last year.

Even more News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks met with both the Prime Minister and Mr Sunak within one week in September.

Mr Murdoch’s UK empire includes The Sun The Times and the Sunday Times as well as the Wireless Group which operates radio stations including Virgin Radio and Talkradio and the publisher HarperCollins.

Ms Johnson told Radiocentre’s Tuning In event the Government should create a better environment for British broadcasters to make quality content.

The BBC needs ‘an environment where the Government actually encourages British producers to tell British stories to British audiences that we can then sell globally’ she said.

A Downing Street spokesperson did not comment on the allegations but said that ministers declare all meetings with senior media executives via the quarterly transparency return.

Metro.co.uk has also contacted News UK for a comment.

In a statement to the Daily Mail a spokesperson for the media company said: ‘The supposed quote is preposterous.

‘It is well known that our focus has been on the threat of the big digital platforms to publishers large and small.’

Monika Tu whose firm Black Diamondz helps rich incomers transition into the Australian market said key drivers were lifestyle education and business prospects.

And despite the Covid pandemic she said her business – which has an annual turnover of $200m – “keeps growing”.

“Australia is an attractive place to live because of the stable political environment strong economy and good education” Ms Tu says.

“The people I’ve been working with they’re all from 35 to about 65 years old and they’re all successful business people.

“They come to Australia not just here to retire they come here to look for an international opportunity to invest or to work and to grow or expand their business. Lifestyle is number one and then education.”

She also notes the attractiveness of a friendly community proximity to China by comparison to Europe or America and clean air.

“The pollution doesn’t discriminate in China it’s still very polluted” she adds.

Speaking to Sky News’ Peter Stefanovic for two-part special investigation China Rising – which examines all issues of China’s relationship with Australia from geopolitics to business – Ms Tu also addresses a “misunderstanding” around the influx of wealthy Chinese property purchasers.

She rejects that overseas investors are taking opportunities away from Australians suggesting “maybe it’s a misunderstanding because Chinese love the properties so all the media is talking about oh my God they buy up Australia.”

And she says she does feel Chinese investors can get picked on but acknowledges ”I’m a Chinese maybe I’m a little bit more sensitive about how they talk about China.”

Ms Tu who arrived in Australia in 1988 as a student speaking very little English and with no money to her name says she deals with clients from all over the world and Australia – not just the Chinese.

Within Sydney especially lavish spending has become commonplace among billionaires from mainland China Hong Kong and Singapore. Homegrown tycoons from Asian families have also been transforming the city into their playground spending big since 2018.

Popular areas for foreign investors include Hunters Hill Point Piper Bellevue Hill and Vaucluse with a noticeable new trend among Chinese buyers who initially went for the Upper North Shore due to the schools when they arrived some years ago to now move to the Eastern suburbs.

‘So salty’: Block’s cheater and sore loser exposed

Australia’s overall foreign investment policy usually encourages overseas buyers to purchase residential property and as a result increase the supply of new housing. Without foreign investment many new building projects would become unviable.

According to the 2019-20 FIRB annual report China ranks third among the top five countries investing in Australian real estate.

Chinese investment in Australian real estate significantly dropped from the peak of $32bn in 2015-16 to $7.1bn in 2019 due to the Covid pandemic and simmering political tensions.

When asked how her firm was impacted by Covid Ms Tu says in the short term her team have managed the situation well.

“In the long term I think we’ll be affected at the moment I think it’s business as usual. Since the pandemic my business keeps growing” she said.

“The trade war hasn’t affected the real estate business in general but in the long run I’m not sure because I think you will see maybe a declining interest in investing in business in Australia.”

Brandon Smith has a big decision to make on his future and there’s one club that is confident they have their “noses in front” in the race for the star’s signature.

Meanwhile a players anti-vax stance has cost him a $180000 deal for next season and the club is already looking to spend that cash.

A 16-year-old has signed a mammoth contract that could make him the highest paid player yet to debut while Josh Hodgson could be on his way out the door in Canberra in a matter of days.

Elsewhere the Broncos have ruled themselves out of the race for Reed Mahoney while also confirming they won’t be throwing an ex-Raider a lifeline.

DOLPHINS CONFIDENT THEY’RE LEADING SMITH RACE

Brandon Smith is expected to make a call on his future in the next couple of weeks and the Dolphins believe they could be the lucky winners according to News Corp.

Smith is the hottest name on the market at the moment. He comes off contract at the end of 2022 meaning he’s free to negotiate with rivals for 2023 and beyond.

The Storm tabled him a three-year extension but it wasn’t enough to convince the 25-year-old to sign on the dotted line and instead he began talks with several other clubs.

The Kiwi international was spotted in Townsville earlier this month suggesting a possible meeting with the Cowboys. Then he was seen with Titans officials and then at the Dolphins’ League Club on consecutive days.

He will reportedly meet with the Roosters on his way back to Melbourne before making a decision.

Despite the stiff competition Dolphins recruitment manager Peter O’Sullivan is confident his club is in the lead at the moment — and said coach Wayne Bennett has played huge role so far.

“I’m not saying we are definitely going to get him but I think we have our noses in front” he told News Corp.

“The Titans will think they are in front and I’m sure the Roosters will also think they are in front.

“We’ll find out in the next week or so who ends up in front.

“The money has stopped now so it’s a matter of where Brandon wants to go.

“Wayne is a huge factor in getting Brandon. I had a meeting with a manager the other day and he said I wouldn’t be meeting you if it wasn’t for Wayne Bennett.”

According to the report the Dolphins are willing to pay Smith around $900000 a season which is understood to be higher than what the Titans and Rosters can offer.

ANTI-VAX STANCE TO COST ASIATA DOGS CONTRACT

John Asiata’s time as a Bulldog looks to be over before it even really started with News Corp reporting the 28-year-old has informed the club to plan for 2022 without him.

Asiata has not received the Covid-19 vaccination and is strongly against it so much so he is willing to walk away from a $180000 one-year contract with the Bulldogs.

The NRL is not mandating vaccines but is reportedly discussing docking unvaccinated players by as much as 20 per cent with the same amount being deducted from the club’s salary cap.

The Bulldogs are understood to be preparing to mandate vaccination. That’s said to be due to the fact that they rely on financial support from the Canterbury Leagues Club and it seems unfair to require patrons to be fully vaccinated while unvaccinated players are free to train close by.

According to News Corp the Bulldogs have already counted Asiata out for next season and will either use his salary to upgrade an existing player or buy a replacement.

The good news for Bulldogs fans though is that star prop Luke Thompson has been vaccinated despite initial hesitation.

MANLY’S TEEN SENSATION

All the young gun talk last season was about Joseph Suaalii who got an exemption to play NRL before his 18th birthday his Roosters teammate Sam Walker and Bronco-turn-Warrior Reece Walsh.

But Manly have entered the conversation with a 16-year-old that’s destined for big things.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald five-eighth Latu Fainu has inked a four-year deal with the Sea Eagles. While the exact price of that deal has not been revealed he will earn a seven-figure amount over the four years if he meets the performance targets included in the contract.

New Dragons recruit Moses Suli made history as the highest-pad teenager in 2017 when he inked a three-year deal with the Wests Tigers worth $1.3 million.

According to the Herald if Fainu hits the performance targets and triggers his bonus’ he will beat that figure.

The name may sound familiar. He is the younger brother of stood down NRL hooker Manase and Manly forward Sione — who is yet to make his debut. There’s also another Fainu talent coming through 17-year-old Samuela who recently signed an extension to remain at the club until the end of 2024.

The Eels Warriors and Dolphins reportedly showed interested in Latu after he starred in the Harold Matthews Cup despite being two years younger than the cut-off age.

But the opportunity to potentially line-up with his three brothers for the Sea Eagles was enough to convince him to stay on the Northern Beaches.

Fainu is expected to break into the NRL around the same time skipper Daly Cherry-Evans hangs up his boots.

Latu recently signed on as an Adidas ambassador and is reportedly the youngest Australian athlete to do so.

But remarkably big brother Manase believes the playmaker isn’t even the best of all the brothers.

“I back Sammy (Samuela)” he told the Herald.

“He’s a big boy; I’d back him to be the best of all of us. He grew up playing at half he’s got all the skills in the world and he’s got the size too.”

HODGSON ON THE MOVE?

Josh Hodgson could end up in Tiger land this pre-season and not the nation’s capital with a decision expected in the coming days and a medical already completed.

That’s according to the Sydney Morning Herald which reports Hodgson who is due back at the Raiders on Friday is at the top of the Tigers’ hit list as they look to bring in some experience at dummy half.

The report adds: “Tigers officials have good reason to believe he no longer wants to be in the nation’s capital and is chasing a fresh start in Sydney under coach Michael Maguire.”

Right now the only sticking point is reportedly how much of Hodgson’s $900k contract the Tigers are willing to pay.

According to the Herald the Tigers aren’t willing to move up from the $500k mark and are keen on handing out a two-year contract — as long as they’re able to land Hodgson this season.

Still with Tom Starling set to face court in the new year the Raiders are in no rush to let Hodgson walk out the door.

MAHONEY A NO-GO FOR BRONCOS

There’s several clubs that are interested in the services of Parramatta’s star hooker Reed Mahoney but the Broncos are not one of them.

Mahoney comes off contract at the end of 2022 and his manager has been fielding interest from rival clubs despite an Eels offer on the table reportedly worth $1.3 million over three years.

Despite initial contact with Mahoney’s manager the Broncos have confirmed they won’t be going any further with the 23-year-old.

“Reed won’t be coming here” Broncos’ football director Ben Ikin told News Corp.

“There was a conversation between the club and Reed’s agent which I think has happened with multiple clubs.

“Reed was a name on a list with every other high-profile player coming off-contract but at this stage we are very happy with what we have got in the hooking position.

“We’ve got Jake Turpin and Cory Paix so we’re happy with what we have on our list. We want to get the best out of the players we have got.”

That now leaves the Dolphins — who are keeping an eye on the Queensland Origin prospect — and the Bulldogs.

Mahoney was spotted dining with Canterbury’s head coach Trent Barrett chairman John Khoury and football general manager Phil Gould earlier this week.

DOLPHINS EYE STARS

It feels as if the Dolphins have been linked with every name in rugby league with Junior Paulo the latest to have his name thrown in the mix.

According to The Australian Paulo and the Dolphins held “informal” talks earlier this week with the 27-year-old one of many Eels star off contract in 2023.

The report adds the Dolphins have been offered the chance to speak to Cowboys pair Reuben Cotter and Tom Gilbert — but the feeling is that both will remain in Townsville.

On top of that The Sydney Morning Herald is reporting the club is eyeing talented Dragons utility Talatau Amone.

The 19-year-old made his NRL debut this year and finished off the season with 11 games under his belt.

The Illawarra junior who can play in the halves and centres attracted interest from rivals but the Dragons were quick to lock him up on a three-year deal to keep him at the club until the end of 2023.

That means he wouldn’t be able to join the Dolphins until their second season in the NRL — and coach Wayne Bennett wouldn't even be able to begin negotiations until November 1 2022.

But the Dolphins are hopeful Amone might be able to gain an early release given the Dragons are stacked in the halves.

Skipper Ben Hunt will wear the No.7 jersey and Amone’s teammate from the Steeler’s 2019 SG Ball grand final Jayden Sullivan is expected to get first shot at five-eighth.

NO RED HILL LIFELINE FOR EX-RAIDER

Another player that won’t be going to the Broncos is one-time Maroons prop Dunamis Lui.

The 31-year-old was not re-signed by the Raiders for 2022 and was eyeing a switch to Queensland Cup.

However a lifeline emerged earlier this month when Ikin told AAP that the club was in discussions about signing Lui.

But the discussions haven’t progressed any further with Ikin confirming to News Corp that Lui won’t be joining the Broncos.

“We were keen to do something with Dunamis but things have fallen through so he is weighing up his future options” he said.

JOEY’S PLANS FOR YOUNG KNIGHT

The Knights are yet to announce a new deal for Tex Hoy but it seems the 22-year-old utility will remain in the Hunter next season despite interest from the Panthers.

Newcastle announced three re-signings earlier this week however Hoy was not one of them fuelling the rumours that he was heading to Penrith as Tyrone May’s replacement.

However News Corp revealed on Friday that Hoy had signed a one-year $60000 development deal to remain at the Knights.

And now club legend Andrew Johns — who sees plenty of potential in Hoy and could have been the deciding factor behind his new deal — hopes to reinvigorate the youngster’s career.

Johns who recently signed on as a coaching consultant with the Knights believes Hoy will only get ahead if he makes the permanent switch to five-eighth given Kalyn Ponga has locked down the fullback role.

Hoy has played 17 NRL games and majority of those have been at fullback but he can play in the halves.

With Mitchell Pearce set to be released it’s expected Jake Clifford will wear the No.7 jersey leaving the five-eighth spot up for grabs.

“Tex is a fullback but he’s got to commit to five-eighth” Johns told a Wide World of Sports podcast.

“He won’t be playing fullback at the Knights while Kalyn (Ponga) is there.

“They’ve got a bit of depth at the Knights. Interesting to see what happens with Mitchell (Pearce).”

Buttrose in a blistering statement called on the upper house to act to “defend the independence of the ABC” by passing a motion to terminate or suspend the government inquiry until an independent process commissioned by the ABC Board last month has been completed.

The government inquiry was announced last week after the ABC’s complaints division told Fox News it had not upheld any of the complaints made in a lengthy submission about a Four Corners program on Fox News aired in August.

“This is an act of political interference designed to intimidate the ABC and mute its role as this country’s most trusted source of public interest journalism” Buttrose said in a statement on Sunday.

“Any incursion of this kind into the ABC’s independence should be seen by Australians for what it is: an attempt to weaken the community’s trust in the public broadcaster.

“If politicians determine the operation of the national broadcaster’s complaints system they can influence what is reported by the ABC.”

The Labor opposition criticised the “wasteful and duplicative inquiry” as “yet another attempt at political interference from this government”.

“Meanwhile the Morrison-Joyce government has overseen funding cuts to the ABC misled the public about these cuts attacked the ABC board in response to a Four Corners investigation and failed to act on the recommendations of two inquiries into press freedom in the wake of AFP raids on journalists at the ABC and News” Labor’s communications spokesperson Michelle Rowland said.

In her strongest statement as chair Buttrose said the inquiry set up by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg on Thursday “appears to be a blatant attempt to usurp the role of the ABC board and undermine the operational independence of the ABC”.

“As senator Bragg is aware in October the ABC Board initiated an independent review of the ABC’s complaints system by two eminent experts Prof John McMillan former commonwealth and NSW ombudsman and Jim Carroll former SBS director – news and current affairs. The terms of reference for the review are comprehensive and wide-ranging.”

Buttrose said the power to develop codes of practice for the ABC lay with the board not the government and that was a key pillar of the ABC’s editorial independence.

Bragg announced the inquiry into the complaints handling arrangements of the ABC and SBS three weeks after the ABC established an external review and after he had been interviewed by reviewers about his concerns.

“Instead of respecting the integrity of this process the Senate committee under the leadership of senator Bragg has decided to initiate a parallel process” Buttrose said.

“I will leave it to senator Bragg to explain his motives but the impact of this action is clear. As chair of the ABC board I am duty-bound to call out any action that seeks to undermine the independence of the national broadcaster.

“A fundamental democratic principle underpinning the ABC has been its independence from interference by those motivated by political outcomes.

“Politicians like all citizens are welcome to criticise anything they find wrong or objectionable that is published by the ABC but they cannot be allowed to tell the ABC what it may or may not say.

“Transparency and accountability are important and the Senate committee performs a vital role. The ABC attends Senate estimates hearings on multiple occasions every year and answers hundreds of questions on notice.”

It is the second time in 12 months the ABC has accused the Morrison government of political interference.

In December 2020 Buttrose accused the government of a pattern of behaviour which “smacks of political interference” and earlier warned of an escalating campaign targeting the public broadcaster. She labelled claims it pushed agendas and campaigns against free enterprise as “malicious garbage”.

She also threw her support behind a media freedom act and declared 2019’s Australian federal police raids “clearly designed to intimidate”.

Buttrose accused the Morrison government of using News Corp Australia to attack its journalism last year after the Australian was briefed about a series of government questions for the broadcaster before the ABC received them.

After Four Corners spoke to former Fox News insiders who claimed the right-wing channel became a propaganda outlet for the former president under the watch of Rupert Murdoch himself News Corp went on the offensive publishing 45 articles attacking the public broadcaster in two days.

“The episode clearly violates the basic tenets of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s published standards by exhibiting bias and a failure to maintain any level of impartiality in the presentation of news and information” a Fox News spokesperson said at the time.

Bragg told Sky News Australia the ABC complaints system was akin to a kid “marking their own homework”.

“At the moment if you lodge a complaint with the ABC it’s not dealt with by an independent person” he said on Tuesday. “It’s a bit like Dracula and the blood bank. They basically mark their own homework.”

Bragg suggested a “litany” of people were unhappy with the ABC including veterans multicultural communities and Jewish groups.

Bragg told Guardian Australia a parliamentary review was necessary because there had been “extensive community concern over a number of programs and posts and the associated complaints handling”.

He denied the ABC review was external even though the board appointed two independent experts to undertake it.

“It is not an external review it’s an internal review and I believe the Senate inquiry will be a stronger mechanism” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMS8xMy9ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaC10b2xkLWJvcmlzLXRvLXNjcmFwLW9mLWJiYy1haGVhZC1vZi10di1jaGFubmVsLWxhdW5jaC0xNTU5NTQ2My_SAXFodHRwczovL21ldHJvLmNvLnVrLzIwMjEvMTEvMTMvcnVwZXJ0LW11cmRvY2gtdG9sZC1ib3Jpcy10by1zY3JhcC1vZi1iYmMtYWhlYWQtb2YtdHYtY2hhbm5lbC1sYXVuY2gtMTU1OTU0NjMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boris Johnson's sister says she 'was joking' about Murdoch telling PM to axe BBC,"Rupert Murdoch’s company is set to launch a TV channel called talkTV in early 2022 (Pictures: Getty)

Rachel Johnson has backtracked from claims Rupert Murdoch told her brother to ‘get rid of the BBC’ during a visit to his country house.

At a media industry event this week she said the tycoon ‘dandled’ the PM’s son Wilfred on his knee at Chequers as he made the case for scrapping the broadcaster.

The LBC radio presenter 56 said corporation was facing an ‘increasing struggle’ for survival amid competition from streaming and subscription services.

But after her remarks hit the news she distanced herself from them and claimed she wasn’t being serious.

In a tweet this morning she said: ‘Sorry to disappoint but Rupert Murdoch NEVER told the PM to get rid of the BBC as I am quoted as saying in today’s Daily Mail.

‘It never happened. Joke taken out of context. Totally my fault for agreeing to say “a few words” about future of the media. Apols to all who got excited.’

The comments come as News UK owned by Mr Murdoch is set to launch a TV channel called talkTV in early 2022 which has signed Piers Morgan as its star presenter.

Ms Johnson said part of the pressure was coming from the likes of the newspaper magnate who was making the case that the corporation was a threat to competition.

She said: ‘In my judgement the BBC will be here in 10 years.

‘But it is going to be an increasing struggle when the whole of the television story is about streaming and subscription to have the BBC which costs £4billion to run which gets £3billion in from the licence fee to have that entity as a competitor.

‘Especially when you have got people like Rupert Murdoch going to Chequers and saying to my brother as he dandles Wilf on his knee “Boris you’ve got to get rid of the BBC it’s eating my lunch they got a website they’re a publisher it’s not competitive”. You can see that there are pressures from all sides.’

It was reported earlier this year that the News Corp executive chairman and his top executives in the UK and US met the Prime Minister and other high-level Government politicians seven times between them in seven weeks last summer.

Boris Johnson was allegedly told to scrap the broadcasting service by the media mogul (Picture: Getty)

Mr Murdoch met with Mr Johnson paid for lunch with Chancellor Rishi Sunak ate a private dinner with Michael Gove and had an ‘informal lunch between friends’ with Jacob Rees-Mogg between August 8 and September 25 last year.

Even more News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks met with both the Prime Minister and Mr Sunak within one week in September.

Mr Murdoch’s UK empire includes The Sun The Times and the Sunday Times as well as the Wireless Group which operates radio stations including Virgin Radio and Talkradio and the publisher HarperCollins.

Ms Johnson told Radiocentre’s Tuning In event the Government should create a better environment for British broadcasters to make quality content.

The BBC needs ‘an environment where the Government actually encourages British producers to tell British stories to British audiences that we can then sell globally’ she said.

A Downing Street spokesperson did not comment on the allegations but said that ministers declare all meetings with senior media executives via the quarterly transparency return.

Metro.co.uk has also contacted News UK for a comment.

In a statement to the Daily Mail a spokesperson for the media company said: ‘The supposed quote is preposterous.

‘It is well known that our focus has been on the threat of the big digital platforms to publishers large and small.’

Monika Tu whose firm Black Diamondz helps rich incomers transition into the Australian market said key drivers were lifestyle education and business prospects.

And despite the Covid pandemic she said her business – which has an annual turnover of $200m – “keeps growing”.

“Australia is an attractive place to live because of the stable political environment strong economy and good education” Ms Tu says.

“The people I’ve been working with they’re all from 35 to about 65 years old and they’re all successful business people.

“They come to Australia not just here to retire they come here to look for an international opportunity to invest or to work and to grow or expand their business. Lifestyle is number one and then education.”

She also notes the attractiveness of a friendly community proximity to China by comparison to Europe or America and clean air.

“The pollution doesn’t discriminate in China it’s still very polluted” she adds.

Speaking to Sky News’ Peter Stefanovic for two-part special investigation China Rising – which examines all issues of China’s relationship with Australia from geopolitics to business – Ms Tu also addresses a “misunderstanding” around the influx of wealthy Chinese property purchasers.

She rejects that overseas investors are taking opportunities away from Australians suggesting “maybe it’s a misunderstanding because Chinese love the properties so all the media is talking about oh my God they buy up Australia.”

And she says she does feel Chinese investors can get picked on but acknowledges ”I’m a Chinese maybe I’m a little bit more sensitive about how they talk about China.”

Ms Tu who arrived in Australia in 1988 as a student speaking very little English and with no money to her name says she deals with clients from all over the world and Australia – not just the Chinese.

Within Sydney especially lavish spending has become commonplace among billionaires from mainland China Hong Kong and Singapore. Homegrown tycoons from Asian families have also been transforming the city into their playground spending big since 2018.

Popular areas for foreign investors include Hunters Hill Point Piper Bellevue Hill and Vaucluse with a noticeable new trend among Chinese buyers who initially went for the Upper North Shore due to the schools when they arrived some years ago to now move to the Eastern suburbs.

‘So salty’: Block’s cheater and sore loser exposed

Australia’s overall foreign investment policy usually encourages overseas buyers to purchase residential property and as a result increase the supply of new housing. Without foreign investment many new building projects would become unviable.

According to the 2019-20 FIRB annual report China ranks third among the top five countries investing in Australian real estate.

Chinese investment in Australian real estate significantly dropped from the peak of $32bn in 2015-16 to $7.1bn in 2019 due to the Covid pandemic and simmering political tensions.

When asked how her firm was impacted by Covid Ms Tu says in the short term her team have managed the situation well.

“In the long term I think we’ll be affected at the moment I think it’s business as usual. Since the pandemic my business keeps growing” she said.

“The trade war hasn’t affected the real estate business in general but in the long run I’m not sure because I think you will see maybe a declining interest in investing in business in Australia.”

Brandon Smith has a big decision to make on his future and there’s one club that is confident they have their “noses in front” in the race for the star’s signature.

Meanwhile a players anti-vax stance has cost him a $180000 deal for next season and the club is already looking to spend that cash.

A 16-year-old has signed a mammoth contract that could make him the highest paid player yet to debut while Josh Hodgson could be on his way out the door in Canberra in a matter of days.

Elsewhere the Broncos have ruled themselves out of the race for Reed Mahoney while also confirming they won’t be throwing an ex-Raider a lifeline.

DOLPHINS CONFIDENT THEY’RE LEADING SMITH RACE

Brandon Smith is expected to make a call on his future in the next couple of weeks and the Dolphins believe they could be the lucky winners according to News Corp.

Smith is the hottest name on the market at the moment. He comes off contract at the end of 2022 meaning he’s free to negotiate with rivals for 2023 and beyond.

The Storm tabled him a three-year extension but it wasn’t enough to convince the 25-year-old to sign on the dotted line and instead he began talks with several other clubs.

The Kiwi international was spotted in Townsville earlier this month suggesting a possible meeting with the Cowboys. Then he was seen with Titans officials and then at the Dolphins’ League Club on consecutive days.

He will reportedly meet with the Roosters on his way back to Melbourne before making a decision.

Despite the stiff competition Dolphins recruitment manager Peter O’Sullivan is confident his club is in the lead at the moment — and said coach Wayne Bennett has played huge role so far.

“I’m not saying we are definitely going to get him but I think we have our noses in front” he told News Corp.

“The Titans will think they are in front and I’m sure the Roosters will also think they are in front.

“We’ll find out in the next week or so who ends up in front.

“The money has stopped now so it’s a matter of where Brandon wants to go.

“Wayne is a huge factor in getting Brandon. I had a meeting with a manager the other day and he said I wouldn’t be meeting you if it wasn’t for Wayne Bennett.”

According to the report the Dolphins are willing to pay Smith around $900000 a season which is understood to be higher than what the Titans and Rosters can offer.

ANTI-VAX STANCE TO COST ASIATA DOGS CONTRACT

John Asiata’s time as a Bulldog looks to be over before it even really started with News Corp reporting the 28-year-old has informed the club to plan for 2022 without him.

Asiata has not received the Covid-19 vaccination and is strongly against it so much so he is willing to walk away from a $180000 one-year contract with the Bulldogs.

The NRL is not mandating vaccines but is reportedly discussing docking unvaccinated players by as much as 20 per cent with the same amount being deducted from the club’s salary cap.

The Bulldogs are understood to be preparing to mandate vaccination. That’s said to be due to the fact that they rely on financial support from the Canterbury Leagues Club and it seems unfair to require patrons to be fully vaccinated while unvaccinated players are free to train close by.

According to News Corp the Bulldogs have already counted Asiata out for next season and will either use his salary to upgrade an existing player or buy a replacement.

The good news for Bulldogs fans though is that star prop Luke Thompson has been vaccinated despite initial hesitation.

MANLY’S TEEN SENSATION

All the young gun talk last season was about Joseph Suaalii who got an exemption to play NRL before his 18th birthday his Roosters teammate Sam Walker and Bronco-turn-Warrior Reece Walsh.

But Manly have entered the conversation with a 16-year-old that’s destined for big things.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald five-eighth Latu Fainu has inked a four-year deal with the Sea Eagles. While the exact price of that deal has not been revealed he will earn a seven-figure amount over the four years if he meets the performance targets included in the contract.

New Dragons recruit Moses Suli made history as the highest-pad teenager in 2017 when he inked a three-year deal with the Wests Tigers worth $1.3 million.

According to the Herald if Fainu hits the performance targets and triggers his bonus’ he will beat that figure.

The name may sound familiar. He is the younger brother of stood down NRL hooker Manase and Manly forward Sione — who is yet to make his debut. There’s also another Fainu talent coming through 17-year-old Samuela who recently signed an extension to remain at the club until the end of 2024.

The Eels Warriors and Dolphins reportedly showed interested in Latu after he starred in the Harold Matthews Cup despite being two years younger than the cut-off age.

But the opportunity to potentially line-up with his three brothers for the Sea Eagles was enough to convince him to stay on the Northern Beaches.

Fainu is expected to break into the NRL around the same time skipper Daly Cherry-Evans hangs up his boots.

Latu recently signed on as an Adidas ambassador and is reportedly the youngest Australian athlete to do so.

But remarkably big brother Manase believes the playmaker isn’t even the best of all the brothers.

“I back Sammy (Samuela)” he told the Herald.

“He’s a big boy; I’d back him to be the best of all of us. He grew up playing at half he’s got all the skills in the world and he’s got the size too.”

HODGSON ON THE MOVE?

Josh Hodgson could end up in Tiger land this pre-season and not the nation’s capital with a decision expected in the coming days and a medical already completed.

That’s according to the Sydney Morning Herald which reports Hodgson who is due back at the Raiders on Friday is at the top of the Tigers’ hit list as they look to bring in some experience at dummy half.

The report adds: “Tigers officials have good reason to believe he no longer wants to be in the nation’s capital and is chasing a fresh start in Sydney under coach Michael Maguire.”

Right now the only sticking point is reportedly how much of Hodgson’s $900k contract the Tigers are willing to pay.

According to the Herald the Tigers aren’t willing to move up from the $500k mark and are keen on handing out a two-year contract — as long as they’re able to land Hodgson this season.

Still with Tom Starling set to face court in the new year the Raiders are in no rush to let Hodgson walk out the door.

MAHONEY A NO-GO FOR BRONCOS

There’s several clubs that are interested in the services of Parramatta’s star hooker Reed Mahoney but the Broncos are not one of them.

Mahoney comes off contract at the end of 2022 and his manager has been fielding interest from rival clubs despite an Eels offer on the table reportedly worth $1.3 million over three years.

Despite initial contact with Mahoney’s manager the Broncos have confirmed they won’t be going any further with the 23-year-old.

“Reed won’t be coming here” Broncos’ football director Ben Ikin told News Corp.

“There was a conversation between the club and Reed’s agent which I think has happened with multiple clubs.

“Reed was a name on a list with every other high-profile player coming off-contract but at this stage we are very happy with what we have got in the hooking position.

“We’ve got Jake Turpin and Cory Paix so we’re happy with what we have on our list. We want to get the best out of the players we have got.”

That now leaves the Dolphins — who are keeping an eye on the Queensland Origin prospect — and the Bulldogs.

Mahoney was spotted dining with Canterbury’s head coach Trent Barrett chairman John Khoury and football general manager Phil Gould earlier this week.

DOLPHINS EYE STARS

It feels as if the Dolphins have been linked with every name in rugby league with Junior Paulo the latest to have his name thrown in the mix.

According to The Australian Paulo and the Dolphins held “informal” talks earlier this week with the 27-year-old one of many Eels star off contract in 2023.

The report adds the Dolphins have been offered the chance to speak to Cowboys pair Reuben Cotter and Tom Gilbert — but the feeling is that both will remain in Townsville.

On top of that The Sydney Morning Herald is reporting the club is eyeing talented Dragons utility Talatau Amone.

The 19-year-old made his NRL debut this year and finished off the season with 11 games under his belt.

The Illawarra junior who can play in the halves and centres attracted interest from rivals but the Dragons were quick to lock him up on a three-year deal to keep him at the club until the end of 2023.

That means he wouldn’t be able to join the Dolphins until their second season in the NRL — and coach Wayne Bennett wouldn't even be able to begin negotiations until November 1 2022.

But the Dolphins are hopeful Amone might be able to gain an early release given the Dragons are stacked in the halves.

Skipper Ben Hunt will wear the No.7 jersey and Amone’s teammate from the Steeler’s 2019 SG Ball grand final Jayden Sullivan is expected to get first shot at five-eighth.

NO RED HILL LIFELINE FOR EX-RAIDER

Another player that won’t be going to the Broncos is one-time Maroons prop Dunamis Lui.

The 31-year-old was not re-signed by the Raiders for 2022 and was eyeing a switch to Queensland Cup.

However a lifeline emerged earlier this month when Ikin told AAP that the club was in discussions about signing Lui.

But the discussions haven’t progressed any further with Ikin confirming to News Corp that Lui won’t be joining the Broncos.

“We were keen to do something with Dunamis but things have fallen through so he is weighing up his future options” he said.

JOEY’S PLANS FOR YOUNG KNIGHT

The Knights are yet to announce a new deal for Tex Hoy but it seems the 22-year-old utility will remain in the Hunter next season despite interest from the Panthers.

Newcastle announced three re-signings earlier this week however Hoy was not one of them fuelling the rumours that he was heading to Penrith as Tyrone May’s replacement.

However News Corp revealed on Friday that Hoy had signed a one-year $60000 development deal to remain at the Knights.

And now club legend Andrew Johns — who sees plenty of potential in Hoy and could have been the deciding factor behind his new deal — hopes to reinvigorate the youngster’s career.

Johns who recently signed on as a coaching consultant with the Knights believes Hoy will only get ahead if he makes the permanent switch to five-eighth given Kalyn Ponga has locked down the fullback role.

Hoy has played 17 NRL games and majority of those have been at fullback but he can play in the halves.

With Mitchell Pearce set to be released it’s expected Jake Clifford will wear the No.7 jersey leaving the five-eighth spot up for grabs.

“Tex is a fullback but he’s got to commit to five-eighth” Johns told a Wide World of Sports podcast.

“He won’t be playing fullback at the Knights while Kalyn (Ponga) is there.

“They’ve got a bit of depth at the Knights. Interesting to see what happens with Mitchell (Pearce).”

The family of the man murdered by Nike executive Larry Miller has hit out at his new book where he confesses to the crime but fails to mention the victim’s name.

Edward White’s son Hasan Adams who was just eight months old when his father was shot dead by Mr Miller told the New York Times he didn’t even know who his dad’s killer was until the sports boss publicly revealed his secret last month.

He said it was “mind blowing” to learn that the man who killed his father on his way home from work was “a wealthy and successful businessman and he’s writing a book”.

The 56-year-old who said his family found it too painful to speak of the murder said he choked up trying to tell his wife saying: “I was scaring her”.

Mr White’s family said Mr Miller has never reached out to them about what happened and that they weren’t given any warning that he was about to speak out more than five decades on from the killing.

Instead they were left to stumble across his interview in Sports Illustrated in October where he shared his secret ahead of the release of his tell-all memoir Jump: My Secret Journey From the Streets to the Boardroom out in January.

The family criticised Mr Miller’s decision not to even name his victim in the book referring to him as “another Black boy”.

Family members said they want Mr White’s name to be added to the final version and some sort of reparations for his death such as a formal apology or meeting a scholarship set up under his name or financial compensation to the victim’s children from the book’s profits.

“You know his name give him that respect especially since you took his life” Mr White’s great-niece Mariah Green told the New York Times.

Mr Miller the chairman of Nike’s Jordan brand revealed he had shot and killed 18-year-old Mr White back in September 1965 when he was 16.

Mr Miller who is now 72 was in a West Philadelphia gang called Cedar Avenue at the time and that a member of his crew had been stabbed to death earlier that month by members of rival gang 53rd and Pine Streets.

He said he had gone out on the night of 30 September with fellow gang members looking to seek revenge on members of the rival gang.

Mr Miller said they were “all drunk” and he was “in a haze” when they came across Mr White.

He shot Mr White in the chest and left him for dead.

Mr Miller admitted that he didn’t even know for sure if Mr White was affiliated with the rival gang.

Mr White’s family told the New York Times he wasn’t in a gang and simply “got shot going home” from his job at a diner.

The Nike executive said he joined the Cedar Avenue street gang at the age of 13 and was “just a straight-up gangbanger thug” by 16.

He was convicted of second-degree murder and served four and a half years in a young offenders’ institution for Mr White’s murder.

Mr Miller later turned his life around before climbing the corporate ladder becoming the president of the NBA team the Portland Trail Blazers before rising up the ranks at Nike.

He kept his past a secret from his colleagues and friends but carried the guilt with him all these years he said.

""If I could go back and undo it I would absolutely do that"" Mr Miller said.

""I can’t. So all I can do is try to do what I can to help other people and try to maybe prevent this from happening to someone else.""

He told Sports Illustrated he wanted to reach out to the victim’s family.

While the 72-year-old has been praised for speaking out Mr White’s family said they were left blindsided by his actions and haven’t heard from him at all.

They criticised the lack of mention about Mr White or his life in the book and have contacted the publisher William Morrow.

The 18-year-old was set to marry his girlfriend Josephine Hobbs just months after he was killed.

The couple had an infant son – Mr Adams – together and Ms Hobbs was pregnant with their daughter Azizah Arline.

Ms Arline who never met her father told the New York Times her mother never “got over that trauma” and was so distraught that she tried to climb into her fiance’s grave at the funeral.

She dropped out of nursing school to raise their children and has repressed much of what happened.

“It changed the entire pattern of her life” said Ms Arline.

She added: “I never met the man. That’s not fair.”

Neither Mr Miller nor William Morrow responded to the New York Times’ requests for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTIvc3BvcnRzL2xhcnJ5LW1pbGxlci1uaWtlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Confessional Book a Nike Exec Omits the Name of the Man He Killed,"PHILADELPHIA — Late at night on Sept. 30 1965 Edward David White 18 walked toward his family’s rowhouse in the West Philadelphia neighborhood after his shift at a suburban diner. Known as David to his family and friends he had a son who was 8 months old and his girlfriend was pregnant with their daughter. They planned to marry in the spring.

Mr. White did not make it home. A 16-year-old gang member drunk on cheap wine and seeking retribution for the stabbing death of a member of his crew shot him with a .38-caliber handgun piercing his heart and his right lung. Mr. White who was unarmed and had no police record was left to die in the street.

His killer went on to a prosperous life as a sports and marketing executive.

Project Nike was a U.S. Army project proposed in 1945 by Bell Laboratories to develop a line-of-sight anti-aircraft missile system. The project created America’s first operational anti-aircraft missile system the Nike Ajax. Here's how the Great Falls Nike Fire Control Site W-83 played a critical role in the creation of GPS.

The first successful Nike test happened in November 1951 when a Nike Ajax intercepted a drone B-17 Flying Fortress. The Army initially ordered 1000 missiles and 60 sets of equipment. By 1953 the first missile had been deployed to Fort Meade Maryland. By 162 the DoD had built up an additional 240 launch sites across the country. Most of the missiles replaced radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.

Each of the 13 launch sites located around Washington D.C. included three parts separated by about 900 meters. One part contained the Integrated Fire Control radar systems used to detect incoming targets. The second part held one to three underground missile magazines that could service four launch assemblies. This site had a crew of 109 officers who operated 24 hours a day. The third part of the site was an administrative area and contained a battery headquarters barracks DFAC motor pool and rec area.

Nike sites were organized in defensive positions and placed near large population centers as well as strategic locations that might come under attack like long-range bomber bases nuclear plants and ICBM sites.

The Great Falls Nike Fire Control site was built in 1954 after being purchased from a dairy farmer. It was activated just a year later all in an attempt to ensure that the national capital region could be properly defended against air attacks. The 13 sites included everything the military might need to wage war. Integrated Fire Control Sites were located downrange from launch areas and the majority of the sites all operated first-generation Nike Ajax missiles.

Ajax missiles are massive and weigh around 2400 pounds. They’re 34 feet long and have a range of 25 miles. After being fired they can reach a max speed of Mach 2.3.

Military fears about defending the metro-DC area quickly faded. By 1962 the Great Falls Nike Missile Launch Site and the Integrated Fire Control Site ceased operations. Then it became a research station for the Army’s Map Services. Research focused on geo-location and navigation developments and it was at the Great Falls site that the Map Service initiated a satellite tracking program that would eventually become part of the Defense Mapping Agency.

This tracking system is the foundation of what we now know as GPS. The data that the Mapping Agency collected allowed geospatial scientists to establish geographical reference points on the Earth’s surface. This knowledge allowed the researchers to refine their estimates of the true shape of the planet as well as develop a better understanding of the variations in the gravitational field.

In the years following the deactivation the launch site’s buildings and other structures were left to rot. Weaponry and other harmful elements were removed but the government didn’t tear down any of the surrounding buildings. As suburban development reached out of urban D.C. in the late 1970s and early 1980s many of the launch building sites were finally torn down. Missile magazine hatches were buried where contractors found them. One of the missile launch sites was overtaken by the Fairfax County Park Authority and transformed into the Great Falls Nike Park complete with a tennis court and two baseball fields created right on top of the missile magazine hatches. IN 1980 Forestville Elementary School was built on top of the launch site’s barracks.

Between 2000 and 2002 all the remaining structures were finally torn down with the exception of two radar towers. The southern tower was repurposed as an observatory. In 2010 the dome was replaced with a newer and stronger telescope. Now there’s a roll-top observatory building located next to the telescope and both sites are utilized by local schools. Now all that’s left to mark the spot is a radar dome.

Nike missile sites might be all gone but the technology continues to live on. Many of the rocket systems used to develop the Ajax were later reused for many aeronautical functions. The missile’s first-stage solid rocket booster became the basis for several types of rockets including the Nike Hercules missile and NASA’s Nike Smoke rocket which has been used for upper atmosphere research."

Published reports and media show multiple large industrial properties in Chicago’s McKinley Park neighborhood recently changing hands or being placed up for sale including the iconic faux clock tower at South Damen Avenue and West Pershing Road.

Joining the historic Central Manufacturing District tower are three warehouses of the Clock Tower Industrial Center at 1919 to 1965 W. Pershing Road Chicago and adjoining land all for sale for $12 million according to a commercial real estate listing from property owner and manager Imperial Realty Company.

Although the property is currently zoned for manufacturing and is adjacent to a Planned Manufacturing District and related industry including the Norfolk Southern Railways rail yard and the MAT Asphalt plant its real estate listing presents the property as a “multi-family redevelopment opportunity.”

No Protections for Tower

Warehouse A of the Clock Tower Industrial Center is for sale along with the iconic Central Manufacturing District clock tower and two other warehouses.The faux clock tower — a water tower heavily adorned with architectural elements of its period — is not protected from demolition or alteration as it does not enjoy Chicago state or federal landmark status.

In 2020 Preservation Chicago named the Pershing Road section of the Central Manufacturing District which includes the clock tower and warehouses as one of Chicago’s most endangered historic places. In 2021 Preservation Chicago did the same for the Original East District.

Within the Original East District of the Central Manufacturing District the Atlanta-based Stonemont Financial Group has purchased property at 3501 3601 3647 and 3651 S. Ashland Ave. Chicago according to The Real Deal a publication focused on Chicago real estate news.

In the article “Stonemont Pays $80M for properties near Amazon shipping facility” reporter Connie Kim with research assistance from Christian Bautista reveals that Stonemont paid $80.3 million for these properties.

The article also provides background on Stonemont’s financial backing for the property now hosting Amazon’s last-mile warehouse at South Ashland Avenue and West 35th Street as well as Stonemont’s larger involvement in real estate to support the burgeoning logistics industry.

Historic Register

The entire Central Manufacturing district is on the National Register of Historic Places which provides federal and state tax credits for historic redevelopment. The Clock Tower Industrial Center real estate listing also noted that the property resides within a TIF district and Enterprise Zone.

“This investment represents an exceptional opportunity to acquire an extremely well-located existing industrial-warehouse property with tremendous value-add and multi-family redevelopment potential” the listing stated.

This property also recently received attention as part of a student-led redesign of the entire Pershing Road stretch of the Central Manufacturing District. As reported here in the McKinley Park News this project won the 2021 C40 Reinventing Cities international sustainable design competition.

In an unprecedented competitive environment the FMCG industry is facing inevitable price increases and is urged to take actions and reevaluate pricing strategies.

The way manufacturers can successfully navigate these turbulent times together with retailer partners in order to survive and thrive in the future was the relevant topic of a recent NielsenIQ webinar with the title “How to land price increases during turbulent times” directed at clients and partners in Europe Middle East and Africa.

Leading companies understand the importance of profit contribution on proactive pricing strategy management. There are five key steps to leverage a pricing strategy as recognized by NielsenIQ experts:

Constantly scout for pricing opportunities Set a shopper-centric pricing strategy informed by granular shopper response models Anticipate competitive pricing actions and responses Activate a net price appreciation plan with full view of retailer P&L economics Support value creation story with innovation plans that create headroom for growth

According to Didem Sekerel-Erdogan NielsenIQ Analytics Leader for Middle East and Africa:

“Now more than ever retailers and manufacturers need to help consumers manage their overall basket-spend by allowing them to flex their budgets. We want to help our clients to apply sustainable price strategies monitor opportunities and provide insights to formulate the best gross to net price structure to maintain profitability”.

With price increases across Europe Middle East and Africa consumers are constantly changing their purchase and consumption behavior adapting to turbulent times. At the same time NielsenIQ experts are working hard to identify patterns across regions. For example we see that in several markets Regular Price Elasticities are in the mid-to-high range:

Variations in elasticities across categories also apply on promo prices. Consumers have been making strategic shifts to consciously managing their budget both online and offline. Sekerel-Erdogan explains that: “While promotions remain key to drive sales it is important to remember that you cannot simply apply the same strategy to every category. It is important to keep in mind that market dynamics may differ between categories segments and brands and that all is dependent on the target consumer and how they were affected by the pandemic”.

At the same time it is evident that consumers are making strategic changes when it comes to spending and are getting savvier with their purchase decisions by opting for private label products. As prices take on new heights Private Label (PL) could become a more viable alternative especially where PL price tiered options are available. Private labels have become the new strategy to diminish grocery costs and they continue to catch-up on brand share – 46% of shoppers opt for PL where possible (Source: NielsenIQ RMS KSA UAE).

To summarize consumer price sensitivity is on the up while price elasticities shift depending on category and need. Consumers seem to be very savvy about spending have changed their shopping habits and traded down in categories. Quality safety and health remain key attributes.

A leading medic in Northern Ireland yesterday said he is concerned as he has ever been about the im​pact of the pandemic.

As health trusts continue to be stretched to the limit Dr George Gardiner a consultant in anaesthetics and critical care medicine with the Belfast Trust said there was no doubt that the health service was in the middle of a “crisis”.

“We have staff isolating due to children in the family testing positive illness and resignations and retirement. All areas are facing staff shortages” Dr Gardiner said.

“We have huge pressure on emergency admissions with long waits and ambulances backlogged. We have a massive amount of time-critical surgery and medical interventions to catch up with and we still have Covid after almost two years of a relentless fight against it.

""Anyone who believes that the health service in Northern Ireland isn't in crisis needs their head examined.”

Dr Gardiner said he was aware of ambulances being diverted away from hospitals in recent days in an effort to ease the pressure on those hospitals most affected.

Health trusts across Northern Ireland have renewed an appeal for people to only attend A&E if they require “urgent care”.

A Northern Trust spokesperson said Antrim Area Hospital was operating at 110pc occupancy while the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine was at 104pc occupancy.

The Western Trust said 60 people were yesterday waiting to be treated at the emergency department at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry with a further 32 people waiting to be admitted to the hospital.

A spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said their children’s emergency department was “extremely busy” on Friday and warned that any patients not in “urgent need” would face a “long wait”.

There was a similar warning from the Southern Trust who said that the emergency departments at Craigavon Area Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry were both “extremely busy” yesterday. Patients considering attending either hospital yesterday were asked only to do so “for emergencies”.

The latest Department of Health figures released yesterday showed there have been a further three Covid-related deaths in Northern Ireland.

The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 2787.

Another 1806 cases of coronavirus were reported yesterday up from 1087 on Friday.

A total of 291579 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began.

On Friday there were 397 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals up from 387 on Thursday.

There were 34 patients with Covid-19 in hospital intensive care units down from 37 on Thursday.

The latest figures show the Causeway Coast and Glens area has the highest Covid rate of the 11 council areas in Northern Ireland at a rate of 649 cases per 100000 population.

The Derry City and Strabane District Council area has the lowest rate of 309 cases per 100000 population.

The latest figures cover the period from November 5 to November 11 when a total of 80406 Covid tests were carried out across Northern Ireland.

Dr Tom Black chairman of the British Medical Association Northern Ireland and a GP in Derry says the region is going into “what will be the worst winter ever for the health service” with all parts of the NHS “overwhelmed”.

“We have grave concerns about maintaining the integrity of emergency services for the next few months. Healthcare workers are stressed and burned-out and doing their best to keep patients safe. Vaccinations will keep us safe but we need people to wear masks and keep social distance as well as keeping socialisation to a minimum” he said.

Meanwhile in the Republic there were 4642 new cases of Covid-19 confirmed to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) yesterday.

There were 556 people in hospital with the virus of whom 107 were in ICU. Another 15 people were admitted to ICU with the virus in a 24-hour period.

These figures represent the most people in hospital with the virus since February 26 and the most in ICU with Covid-19 since March 3.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNTkyODQwOTHSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLTU5Mjg0MDkxLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Craigavon: Ambulances diverted from hospital due to 'extreme pressure',"Allow Twitter content?

The Tomcat has its early roots in the Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX) program. Seeking to cut development costs and to streamline production chains then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara laid plans to procure a joint fighter for the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Against the wishes of the Navy the TFX program produced the ill-fated General Dynamics F-111B attack aircraft a long-range interceptor plagued by excessive weight and landing mechanism problems. The F-111B project was cut short by 1968 and the Navy was given the green light to develop a two-seat twin-engine air superiority fighter better suited to its mission parameters.

The first of the prolific “teen series” fighters that also included the F-15 Eagle F-16 Fighting Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets the F-14 Tomcat was designed to incorporate the air combat lessons learned from the poor service record of the F-4 Phantom II during the Vietnam War years particularly against the fighters in the formidable Soviet MiG catalog (and to more effectively engage Soviet bombers like the Tu-22). As noted in a deeply insightful 2014 lecture by Northrop Grumman VP Mike Ciminera the uphill struggles of the TFX program were not completely for naught—the F-111's many design deficiencies provided crucial engineering experience that helped mold the Tomcat into the well-rounded naval aviation fighter that it proved itself to be over its three decades of service.

The F-14 Tomcat was first deployed in 1974 aboard the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier as part of the U.S. withdrawal from Saigon. The fighter featured a host of improvements over its F-4 predecessor including an integrated M61 Vulcan cannon for additional flexibility in dogfights. At top speeds approaching Mach 2.4 the Tomcat could capably fulfill the Navy’s requirement for a fast-flying interceptor; it was also markedly more agile than the F-4 which despite its massively powerful J79 twin engines was not known for its stellar aerodynamic performance.

The F-14's versatile armament suite spread across ten hardpoints allowed it to perform both long-range interception and air superiority missions. The fighter's potent AN/AWG-9 radar complements its long-range Phoenix AIM-54A missiles giving it the ability to threaten high-value aerial targets at a range over 100 miles. Meanwhile its AIM-7 and AIM-9 medium and short-range missile loadout made it well-suited for an attack escort role.

The Tomcat drew its first blood during the Gulf of Sidra incident in which two F-14's destroyed two Sukhoi Su-22s belonging to the Libyan Air Force. The F-14 continued to see regular use throughout the 1990s and 2000s as a strike escort and reconnaissance and surveillance platform taking part in Operation Desert Storm the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and the Iraq War. But the title of all-time most successful F-14 pilot goes to Iranian ace of aces Jalil Zandi who is credited with downing as many as 11 Iraqi aircraft during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War.

The F-14B revision introduced in 1987 brought an updated engine and partially enhanced avionics. The final F-14 variant the F-14D incorporated a glass cockpit as well as a slew of new and updated electronic warfare and targeting systems.

Upwards of seven hundred F-14 models were produced through the early 1990s. The Tomcat was formally retired in 2006 following a final strike mission over Iraq capping off the career of one of the most iconic fighters in U.S. naval aviation history.

In the early 1990’s Grumman proposed a new iteration of the famed Top Gun fighter that was not only modern enough to still be in service today it would have marked a vast improvement in performance and capability over even Maverick’s highly capable F-14D.

While the F-14D took on the title “Super Tomcat” this effort to modernize the F-14 began under the moniker “ST21” which appropriately enough stood for “Super Tomcat for the 21st Century” and make no mistake — that’s exactly what it could have been.

The Navy needed a fighter with attack capabilities

In 1988 a joint team from McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics was awarded a development contract for what was to become the A-12 Avenger II not to be confused with Lockheed’s proposed A-12 of the 1960s which sought to arm an SR-71 sibling jet with air-to-air weapon systems. Once completed the Navy’s A-12 would have been a flying wing-design reminiscent of Northrop Grumman’s B-2 Spirit or forthcoming B-21 Raider though much smaller and more triangular; earning it the nickname “Flying Dorito.”

Once completed the A-12 would have actually been the world’s first true stealth fighter thanks to the inclusion of onboard radar and the ability to leverage AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles — but by 1991 the Flying Dorito was shot down by its own massive budget overruns and technical delays. You can read more about that in our full feature on the A-12 program here but suffice to say its cancelation left the Navy with a strike capability gap it needed to fill especially with the A-6 Intruder’s retirement looming on the horizon.

The Tomcat had been designed from the very onset with air-to-air combat as a primary focus with an emphasis placed on covering a great deal of ground very quickly while carrying a heavy payload of advanced AIM-54 Phoenix missiles to intercept approaching Soviet bombers. Grumman recognizing the Navy’s need for an aircraft capable of filling the attack role proposed a fairly inexpensive facelift for the Navy’s Tomcat fleet dubbed the F-14 Quick Strike. The Quick Strike upgrade would incorporate an infrared navigation and targeting pod similar to the LANTIRN system that found its way into the F-15E and F-16 along with upgrades to the aircraft’s powerful onboard radar for ground-attack modes. The addition of more hardpoints for standoff munitions rounded out the proposal as an economic-seeming solution.

An F-14 for the 21st Century

Of course as we’ve discussed at length in the past economic was never really the Tomcat’s specialty and the Navy wasn’t particularly interested in expanding the role of its expensive and sometimes problematic F-14 fleets as they stood. To make matters worse for Grumman McDonnell Douglas was rumored to be hard at work on development of a practically clean-sheet fighter modeled after the Navy’s other carrier-fighter the F/A-18 Hornet.

McDonnell Douglas’ plan was to present the Navy with a new more advanced fighter that could fill a broad swath of roles for the Navy but delivered in a package that looked and sounded like a continuation of the successful Hornet lineage. Not only would that make the aircraft sound proven and reliable it would be perceived as less expensive than funding development on a new fighter.

Grumman opted to offer an even more heavily upgraded iteration of the F-14 that could come as new aircraft or through remanufacture of existing platforms. The resulting ST21 (Super Tomcat for the 21st Century) and subsequent AST21(Attack Super Tomcat for the 21st Century) were designs that could have catapulted the Tomcat straight into the coming millennium it drew its name from.

Cramming a new fighter under the Tomcat’s hood

Despite the incredible capabilities offered by the most modern F-14Ds of the day the Tomcat’s design was already more than twenty years old by the time discussion about the Super Tomcat 21 began. Often when discussing fighter programs that are trying to stay relevant amid rapid technological progress a dated design is something engineers are trying to compensate for but in many ways the Tomcat’s dated layout created a glutton of opportunity when it came to introducing new technologies to the aircraft.

Leveraging lessons learned from more than a decade and a half of service the Super Tomcat 21 eliminated the “glove vanes” that were located just outside of each wingroot. These glove vanes were designed to create lift ahead of the aircraft’s center of gravity at supersonic speeds above Mach 1.4 pressing the nose of the aircraft up and unloading the tail planes to allow for greater high-speed maneuverability. However the systems that controlled these planes were a maintenance nightmare and they were eventually welded shut on most aircraft.

In place of those problematic glove vanes the ST21 and AST21 incorporated enlarged aerodynamic gloves that offered massive benefits in terms supersonic handling and dogfighting performance while simultaneously providing room for an additional 2200 pounds of fuel storage in each wing granting the aircraft even greater range.

When the F-14 first took to the skies with its incredible AIM-54A Phoenix missile the fighter had to include rail fairings to house the missile’s oil cooling system but by the ’90s the Navy had upgraded to AIM-54B and C iterations of the missile neither of which required the F-14 to manage oil cooling duties. In place of these systems the Super Tomcat 21 would house navigation and attack FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared Sensors) in these rail fairings.

Data from those systems would be fed into an entirely glass cockpit with dramatically improved avionics a wide-angle Heads Up Display (HUD) that could project imagery from the navigational FLIR pod upgraded APG-71 radar and entirely new mission computers making the Tomcat into a dated-looking fighter with the most advanced avionics available at the time.

The AST21 was largely a continuation of the ST21 design with additional bomb-carrying pylons a modified radar system with a Forward Air Controller (FAC) mode an Integrated Defensive Avionics Package (IDAP) and nuclear weapons carrying capabilities.

More power more speed and more range

Both Super Tomcat 21 iterations saw the use of upgraded GE-F110-129 turbofan engines in keeping with the Navy’s ongoing efforts (at the time) to replace the troubled Pratt & Whitney TF30 in their Tomcat fleets. The use of these engines in conjunction with the increased fuel capacity and improved wing aerodynamics resulted in what could have been an astonishingly capable fighter that may have been further bolstered by the inclusion of thrust vectoring nozzles taking their cues from the aircraft’s new flight computer.

The GE-F110-129 was not only a massive improvement over the TF30 still filling the fuselages of some Tomcats into the early 2000s it was also an improvement over the F110’s the Navy’s best Tomcats employed. With approximately 30000 pounds of thrust available from each engine under afterburner and a more efficient design the new Tomcat would have been able to fly further than ever before at higher sustained speeds. In fact the Super Tomcat 21 would have been able to super-cruise or fly at supersonic speeds without the use of its afterburner at a sustained jaw-dropping Mach 1.3.

Thrust vectoring nozzles if the Navy had opted to include them would have taken the new fighter’s maneuverability to a positively mind-boggling level when leveraged in conjunction with its automated sweep-wing design. According to some sources the AST21 would have already been able to sustain 77 degrees of sustained AoA (angle of attack) thanks to the aircraft’s planned aerodynamic improvements and thrust vector control would have pushed that even further.

With wing position controlled by an on-board computer for maximum benefit the massive (in comparison) F-14 could already turn tighter than its tiny Air Force sibling the F-16 Fighting Falcon under the right circumstances. The addition of thrust-vectoring would not only have improved upon that already-impressive Angle of Attack figure it likely would have made the Super Tomcat 21 the most acrobatic and maneuverable fighter not just of its era but likely for decades yet to come.

Thrust vector control effectively aims the outflow of the engine’s thrust independent of the aircraft itself. This can allow the aircraft to literally continue to push forward in the sky while pointing its nose (and weapons) down at an opponent as well as allowing for rapid maneuvering that seems to defy the laws of physics when shown on video.

Thrust vector control has long been an important element in Russian fighter design based on their emphasis on within-visual-range fights (dogfights) but within America stables it can only be found on the ranking king of the skies F-22 Raptor.

But Grumman wasn’t done yet. If the Navy didn’t think the ST21 or the AST21 designs were capable enough they had one more ace up their sleeve.

ASF-14: The ultimate Tomcat

While both the ST21 and AST21 were billed as both re-manufacture programs for existing Tomcats and new-build aircraft Grumman’s pitch to the Navy eventually included an entirely new-build Tomcat dubbed the ASF-14. The ASF-14 would have looked like its F-14 predecessors but the similarities would have been largely skin deep.

While the Super Tomcat 21 designs would have increased the Tomcat’s internal fuel storage to 18500 pounds the ASF-14 design added thicker wings (much like the Super Hornet versus the Hornet) to further increase fuel capacity. Other improvements over the ST21 and AST21 designs largely revolved around the fact that the ASF-14 would be an entirely new aircraft so Grumman wouldn’t be stuck working with many of the bulky legacy subsystems that an upgrade/remanufacture program would leave in place as a cost and time-saving measure.

That would mean this new “ultimate” Tomcat’s internals would have been state-of-the-air from nose to tail. Dated and bulky electrical systems would have been replaced with modern modular systems that would not only improve performance and reduce weight but would have made subsequent improvements cheaper and less time consuming. Perhaps most important to the Tomcat’s ability to survive budget cuts its troublesome electronic and hydraulic systems that made the aircraft such a maintenance nightmare would have been gutted in favor of modern systems that required less upkeep and weighed substantially less. Even parts of the aircraft that had always worked well would see improvements in materials used with carbon fiber replacing titanium or aluminum in a number of components.

In fact even with carrying all that extra fuel the new ASF-14 Super (Duper?) Tomcat would have weighed in at very close or perhaps even less than the Navy’s existing F-14s thanks to the massive weight savings allowed by the ASF-14 design.

When it first took to the skies the Tomcat was built to house the massive and incredibly powerful Hughes AWG-9 fire control radar which remains the largest radar system ever employed by an American fighter. All that real estate would have come in handy for a large active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar for air-to-air and air-to-ground operations.

The ASF-14 with some 60000 pounds of thrust and a better thrust-to-weight ratio than the F-14D thrust vector control massive internal fuel stores huge payload capabilities and incredible situational awareness provided by powerful onboard radar and a multitude of sensor pods could have been a 4th generation fighter with few — or maybe no — peers to this very day.

The Super Tomcat versus the Super Hornet

So if these designs were so good how did find ourselves here waxing poetic about how incredible they could have been? Well like all military acquisitions the Navy had to balance capability with capacity mission requirements with budgets and public perception with military doctrine. The Super Hornet the Navy ultimately chose doesn’t stir the same passion among many aviation fans as the F-14 Tomcat for many of the same reasons it’s proven itself to be such a solid choice for the Navy: It’s a little boring compared to the high drama that comes as part of the F-14’s package.

In a lot of ways the F-14 was like Rocky of movie fame: a troubled past and a rocky start ultimately produces an American powerhouse that becomes the star of its own movie. Couple that with the F-14D’s genuinely incredible performance and the near-constant threat of nuclear Armageddon and its no wonder we fell in love with this dynamic aircraft.

The Super Hornet on the other hand has been characterized as an “80%” solution to the Navy’s litany of problems at the time. It’s not as fast or as powerful as many other fighters and it certainly lacks the range of the F-14 let alone the steroid-injected range of the ASF-14… but it’s reliable efficient and battle proven. In fact America’s only air-to-air kill of the past two decades was scored by a Super Hornet.

It’s tough to argue that the Navy made the wrong call with the Super Hornet as its reliability and efficiency were both on full display throughout the past two decades of the Global War on Terror. But now as the the U.S. shifts its focus back toward Great Power Competition the ASF-14 with it’s insane range powerful radar bonkers speed and spine-crunching agility looks as appealing as any non-stealth fighter could.

America’s carrier-based fighters are struggling with a lack of range today something numerous programs are currently working to offset thanks in large part to the size of China’s area denial bubble created by hypersonic anti-ship missile systems. The Super Tomcat 21 or ASF-14 would lack stealth just like the Super Hornet but they could have had the legs they’d need to engage those weapons while keeping America’s carrier’s safely out of range. Today’s F-35Cs and F/A-18s simply don’t.

Of course aviation technology continues to steam ahead and even if the ASF-14 had entered service by the end of the 1990s it would likely still be flying toward an early retirement in favor of the Navy’s F/A-XX fighter being developed in conjunction with the Air Force in the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. With stealth increasingly a requirement for new designs it seems the years of people saying “they never should have retired the F-14” may soon be coming to an end.

But for now those of you who have long reveled in that salty declaration can rest easy knowing that the Super Tomcat 21 or ASF-14 could have been some of the greatest fighters the world has ever seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L3ZlcnktbGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQtdG9ycGVkby11cy1uYXZ5cy1zZWNyZXQtd2VhcG9uLTE5NjI3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Very Lightweight Torpedo: The U.S. Navy's Secret Weapon?,"Helicopters drones destroyers and submarines will soon be armed with a new high-speed explosive Very Lightweight Torpedo (VLWT) weapon designed to destroy enemy submarines ships and other targets.

The new weapon slated to enter production in the next several years represents a collaborative effort between U.S. Navy weapons developers academic researchers at Penn State University and industry partners from Northrop Grumman. Existing heavyweight torpedoes have been receiving numerous electronics explosives and guidance systems updates in recent years but the VLWT effort is the first full torpedo solicitation the Navy has put out since the 1990s.

“We have a prototype” Northrop Grumman senior program manager David Portner told the National Interest. “We learned a lot by building that prototype and then consulting with the Navy on where we saw the risks and the opportunity. We are also working on reducing the cost overall by trying to cut 50 percent of the current cost of some subcomponents.”

The VLWT program emerged from a previous effort to engineer and test a system designed to track intercept and destroy attacking enemy torpedoes. Penn State engineers adjusted the software to enable an offensive capability for the weapon which still retains the ability to be programmed for torpedo defense as well.

“It is a software-enabled hardware which has not lost its anti-torpedo software system so it could easily fill both roles” Portner said.

The VLWT is designed to fit into the six-inch countermeasure launchers on current submarines. They are not launched out of normal twenty-one-inch tubes. Interestingly the weapons can be launched by surface ships from twelve-and-a-half-inch torpedo tubes on cruisers and destroyers and even fired from drones and helicopters. The smaller form of the torpedo also opens up a range of new tactical possibilities for torpedo attack as it can fire from more platforms and be carried in larger numbers. The larger Mark 54 torpedo is too large and too heavy for many of these applications.

“The weapon has been demonstrated to be dropped from air and opens up the anti-submarine platforms” Portner said. “Submarines would be the initial platforms for the weapon yet once it demonstrates its effectiveness we imagine the Navy will want to employ it on all the other platforms it can use it on.”

The Flying Wing

Early aviation engineers appreciated the potential for a “flying wing” design. A flying wing which minimizes fuselage and usually eliminates the tail reduces many of the aerodynamic compromises associated with a normal fuselage reducing overall drag. However many of these features enhance stability meaning that a flying wing often lacks the stability of a traditional airframe. This makes the aircraft more difficult to fly especially before the advent of fly-by-wire technology. A flying wing can also struggle with creating space for crew payload and defensive armament as any of these can reduce the aerodynamic advantages that the shape offers.

Nevertheless engineers (especially in Germany and the Soviet Union) tried repeatedly in the interwar period to develop a viable flying wing either for transport or for military purposes. While these efforts yielded useful data they rarely resulted in practical airframes. Near the end of World War II the German successfully developed a jet fighter flying wing although it did not enter mass production.

From XB-35 to YB-49

In the early years of World War II U.S. strategists realized that it might become necessary to bomb Germany directly from the United States especially if Great Britain left the war. A U.S. Army Air Corps request triggered proposals from a Boeing-Consolidated alliance (eventually Convair) and from Northrop. The former resulted in the Convair B-36 Peacemaker the latter in the XB-35. The B-36 had a relatively conventional design; it looked more or less like a bigger version of the extant bombers of the time although it had innovative features. The XB-35 on the other hand was something new to U.S. military aviation; a flying wing. It was smaller than the B-36 but comparable in many performance features.

By 1944 the XB-35 had fallen behind the B-36 (although both suffered significant technological problems) and in any case the immediate strategic necessity for a trans-continental bomber had waned. The Air Force which acknowledged that both the B-36 and the XB-35 were largely obsolete canceled the latter instead of the former because it believed that the problems of the B-36 were easier to solve. However the U.S. Air Force (USAF) found the flying wing concept sufficiently intriguing that it proposed redesigning the XB-35 airframe around a jet rather than piston engines. Northrop developed a plan to re-engine a number of incomplete XB-35 frames with jets eventually completing three such conversions and preparing several more.

The jet engines improved the top speed of the bomber to 493 miles per hour an improvement of about 20% over its antecedent. The service ceiling of the YB-49 also increased an important consideration for escaping Soviet interceptors. However the fuel-hungry engines shrank the YB-49s combat radius making it more comparable to a medium bomber than to the long-range B-36. Unfortunately while the YB-49 could outrun the B-36 it lacked the speed of Boeing’s new B-47 Stratojet medium bomber.

Sabotage?

The YB-49 prototypes suffered an unusual run of bad luck. One prototype was lost with five crew members in June 1948 when the aircraft broke up in midflight. Another was lost during taxi when the nosewheel collapsed leading to a fire that destroyed the entire aircraft. The Air Force canceled the contract for the YB-49 in May 1950 shortly after this second accident. The last prototype a recon variant flew until 1951 and was scrapped in 1953.

Advocates of the YB-49 long nursed the belief that the Air Force had deliberately sabotaged the program in preference for the B-36 and other later bombers. Jack Northrop the founder of the company believed that the Air Force canceled the YB-49 because he would not agree to a merger with Convair. A few dark rumors implied that the accidents suffered by the YB-49 prototypes had not been accidental at all but rather the result of sabotage. No meaningful evidence has ever emerged to substantiate these allegations.

B-2

Northrop would not realize success in an all-wing airframe until decades later. The B-2 Spirit while utilizing radically different technology bears a strong visual resemblance to its distant cousin. Indeed the two aircraft share exactly the same wingspan. Northrop adopted the flying wing shape for the B-2 because it offers the advantage of a low radar cross-section. Advances in fly-by-wire technology have made the B-2 much easier to fly than the YB-49 (or the YB-35). All indications suggest that Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Raider stealth bomber will have a similar configuration as will the Xian H-20 strategic bomber and the Tupolev PAK DA.

Although the YB-49 never reached full production experience with the frame helped validate the concept which now dominates international thinking on strategic bomber design.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

LUTCHER — Representatives of Nucor Steel were up bright and early on Veterans Day to distribute fresh produce and grocery gift cards to unsung heroes at St. James Parish Hospital in partnership with Capital Area United Way.

More than 100 food boxes were distributed to hospital support staff through Capital Area United Way’s United We Feed initiative which began during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure families had access to fresh produce. United We Feed has continued to serve ALICE (Asset-Limited Income-Constrained Employed) families throughout Capital Area United Way’s 10-parish region.

As of 2018 45% of families in St. James Parish fell under the ALICE umbrella and Capital Area United Way President and CEO George Bell said this statistic has surely increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Ida.

According to Bell Thursday’s distribution was an opportunity to uplift members of the hospital support staff who have worked tirelessly through these life-changing events to provide a clean sanitary and safe environment for all.

“With what they’ve gone through with the pandemic and Ida many of the employees are in situations where their homes have been impacted. Working with Nucor we felt this population would be a prime target for receiving this type of assistance” Bell said. “During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic there was a lot of focus on doctors and nurses. Folks that were at the bedside got a lot of the attention. For this distribution we are targeting the folks that clean the hospital prepare the food tend to the patients. We like to call them unsung heroes who are very much deserving of something like this.”

Access to fresh food is especially important in St. James Parish where the impact of Hurricane Ida has left the area’s largest grocery store closed for an estimated eight months.

Along with produce boxes qualifying employees received a $25 gift card from Associated Groceries Nucor promotional items AETNA cleaning supplies and additional Capital Area United Way resources.

Nucor employees present for Thursday’s distribution chose to give back to the community on their day off. Some of the employees were veterans who wore their hearts on their sleeve through acts of service on Veterans Day according to Plant Manager Calvin Hart.

“We do a lot in the community in St. James Parish in particular. We have also reached a lot outside of St. James especially after Hurricane Ida because the need is so vast. With Nucor as a corporation where we live and where we work is extremely important to us” Hart said. “When I heard about the ALICE population it was something new to us. These guys get up every day and go to work with minimal means to meet their needs every single day. Considering we care about the community we wanted to partner with United Way and make an impact for the folks in this community who actually need it.”

Nucor Steel is also active in St. James Parish through leadership and mentorship programs at local schools with a goal to curb violence in the community. The company has given away more than $1 million in scholarships to propel children to a bright future.

Bell said it meant a lot to have Hart on-site for the distribution. After reaching employees at St. James Parish Hospital Capital Area United Way delivered donations including shovels gas cans tarps and more collected through the Show Up United program to the St. James Parish welcome center.

At each stop Capital Area United Way shared information about the 211 informational line which connects residents with more than 1000 resources relating to renter assistance food access mental health/social services and more seven days a week 365 days a year.

After Google's Stadia's perpetual stumbles and even Nvidia's own difficulties with courting some developers it's an encouraging sign that some players are still willing to give cloud gaming a chance.

Now players might have their best reason to try it yet: They can actually play games using the coveted RTX 3080 graphics card.

Right now Nvidia's RTX 3080 is among one of the best graphics cards you can('t) buy. It ranks towards the top of benchmark lists–and its Ti variant is the fastest graphics card according to PassMark right now. It's so sought after that months after its release gamers were still camping out at retail stores just to spend $700 on one while others have resorted to daring truck heists to steal them.

That context is crucial to understanding why GeForce Now's latest offering—a tier where players can pay $100 per six months to play games on an RTX 3080 rig in the cloud—is such a big deal. Cloud gaming comes with a lot of shortcomings. Gamers need to have decently strong internet connections and can afford to download huge amounts of data. Even in the best cases they have to accept the occasional streaming hiccups. Normally these might add up to dealbreakers but we're not living in normal times.

Work It

Photograph: NVIDIA

First of all: It works! And pretty well! That's a massive compliment. It was only a couple years ago it wasn't clear if cloud game streaming would work at all. In retrospect services like OnLive that were ahead of their time had crashed and burned trying to make it work. For all its failures as a platform Stadia at least proved it was possible for the technology to work. But if Stadia was the prototype GeForce Now is ready to ship.

I'm of the opinion that if something only works under ideal circumstances it doesn't actually work very well. That's why in addition to testing GeForce Now over high speed internet connections in the 100s of megabits per second I also tried it out in hotel rooms—very explicitly against the advice of the app's network testing tool at times.

While traveling for a week I brought my M1 MacBook Air to multiple different hotel rooms across the country and tried out GeForce Now on whatever Wi-Fi was available. If it was less than the 50Mbps recommended or sometimes as low as 25Mbps I tried anyway.

In theory being able to take your high-powered AAA games on the go with you—to places where you can't bring a console or worse a massive gaming PC—is one of the better pitches for cloud gaming platforms. And I was pleasantly surprised. On slower connections I encountered the occasional brief lag or graphical hiccup but for the most part I couldn't tell that I wasn't playing a game on my own laptop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2ludGVydmlldy9udmlkaWEtZXhlYy1haS1yaWRlcy1vbi1zeW1iaW90aWMtaGFyZHdhcmUtc29mdHdhcmUtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLzIwMjEvMTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Exec: AI Rides on Symbiotic Hardware-Software Relationship,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/interview/nvidia-exec-ai-rides-on-symbiotic-hardware-software-relationship/2021/11/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2ludGVydmlldy9udmlkaWEtZXhlYy1haS1yaWRlcy1vbi1zeW1iaW90aWMtaGFyZHdhcmUtc29mdHdhcmUtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLzIwMjEvMTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXRhY2VudGVyZHluYW1pY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvbnZpZGlhLXBsYW5zLW1vc3QtZW5lcmd5LWVmZmljaWVudC1zdXBlcmNvbXB1dGVyLWV2ZXItd2lsbC11c2UtaXQtdG8tYnVpbGQtYS1kaWdpdGFsLXR3aW4tb2YtdGhlLWVhcnRoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Nvidia plans ""most energy efficient supercomputer ever"" will use it to build a digital twin of the Earth","The company did not disclose the architecture scale or location of the system - nor did it provide a date for it going live. “It will be incredibly powerful"" CEO Jensen Huang said in a media briefing adding that it would be the most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to climate change.

GPU giant Nvidia has pledged to build an energy-efficient supercomputer to simulate the world.

The company announced the Earth-2 supercomputer at its GTC21 virtual conference. “We will build a digital twin to simulate and predict climate change” Huang said during his keynote.

It will run AI physics defined by the new Nvidia Modulus AI framework and simulated on the Nvidia Omniverse platform he said.

“All the technologies we have invented up to this moment are needed to make Earth-2 possible” he added. “I cannot imagine a greater and more important use.”

Omniverse is the company's branding for 3D simulation design collaboration and digital twins. Given Facebook's recent rebrand as Meta and the rise of the metaverse as an investor-friendly buzzword Omniverse is now being billed as a ""metaverse for engineers.""

The new supercomputer will be ""designed for Omniverse because if you imagine Earth as a physical thing this will be the engine of alternate worlds” Huang told reporters.

He added that the system will be ""the most energy-efficient supercomputer ever created."" Depending on the benchmark used that current title either belongs to the MN-3 - a 1.8 petaflops Japanese supercomputer that tops the Green500 list or the NREL ESIF HPC data center which has a PUE of 1.01.

An Nvidia DGX A100 system is second on the Top500 list while its own in-house DGX SuperPOD is number five.

The company operates the Selene supercomputer in California and recently opened the Cambridge-1 facility at Kao Data's site in Harlow.

The UK supercomputer is available to select DGX customers in the healthcare space a first for a company that has traditionally only used supercomputers for internal use.

Earth-2 will also be made available to unspecified researchers and partners.

It is not clear what resolution the Earth will be simulated at and which parts of the global weather system will be given priority.

Last year we profiled an ambitious European Union effort to build a digital twin of the Earth but found that 'Destination Earth' faced an uphill challenge to simulate something at such a vast and complex scale.

“To have this cohesive digital twin of the Earth I don't see that happening"" Professor Michael Grieves inventor of the first digital twin told DCD. ""I think that is so far out I just can't conceive. I'm not seeing that anytime this millennium.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtYWRtaXRzLXRvLWJlLWNhcHBpbmctZnJhbWUtcmF0ZS1iZWxvdy02MC1mcHMtZm9yLWdlZm9yY2Utbm93LXByaW9yaXR5LW1lbWJlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA admits to be capping frame rate below 60 FPS for GeForce NOW Priority members,"NVIDIA GeForce Now with fewer than 60 FPS in certain games

NVIDIA recently introduced a new tier for its cloud streaming service called ‘RTX 3080’ offering high-end capable Ampere GPU for each user. This tier however has a much higher price tag than the existing premium tier. Meanwhile ‘Priority’ members are noticing their games are not actually rendered at 60 FPS.

NVIDIA GeForce NOW ‘Priority’ tier costs just half of the RTX 3080 service. According to NVIDIA’s own website the cheaper tier offers ‘Premium Rig’ hardware it is limited to (up to) 1080p 60 FPS. Nowhere on the membership page do users learn that some of the most popular AAA titles do not actually support this framerate.

It all started when a Redditor and GeForce NOW member reached out to NVIDIA customer support with a question about why Guardians of the Galaxy (which by the way is NVIDIA title with DLSS) is capped to 50 frames per second through the game menu. This setting could not be modified. An email sent back by the support confirmed that this is intentional and there are in fact other games that are hard-capped to certain FPS such as CyperPunk 2077 with a 45 FPS limit.

NVIDIA Customer Service confirms cap is intentional Source: LizzieLovesDaGlizzy

A few days later NVIDIA published a detailed list of GeForce NOW games with capped frame rate. The company explains that certain games did not work well at 60 FPS with the Priority ‘Premium Rigs’ supposedly because they are not capable of sustaining such a framerate. So instead of upgrading the rigs or simply providing more performance to GN users NVIDIA decided to artificially limit the framerate in games and even gave it a fancy name “Optimal Playable Settings (OSP)”. The OSP can be overridden by users in most of the 1100 games that GeForce NOW supports but there are games that will not allow for such an extravagance.

For our Priority Members the maximum frames rendered per second is generally set to 60 or higher for most of the 1100+ games we’ve onboarded so far. There are some exceptions that we determined do not run well enough at 60 FPS on the GPUs used by Priority members. So the default OPS for these specific graphics-intensive games cannot be overridden. This is to ensure all Priority members are running a consistent high-quality experience. However we do continue to stream these games at 60 FPS.

This of course only applies to the Priority tier of GeForce NOW so RTX 3080 tier members should not really care about those limits. However NVIDIA did not reveal its OPS list for the highest tier so we are not sure if there actually games limited for the RTX 3080 tier as well.

Interestingly the video is still streaming at 60 FPS so for Priority members the 1080p/60FPS claim is still true. Technically speaking though NVIDIA could just as well stream at 4K/120FPS but only the game would still be rendered at a much lower resolution. But this might just show how important is to read all the details and limitations of game streaming services.

NVIDIA GeForce NOW Max FPS Game OPS (Max FPS) Date added Dauntless 55 FPS Jan 2020 Immortals Fenyx Rising 48 FPS November 2020 Cyberpunk 2077 45 FPS December 2020 Assassin’s Creed Odyssey 45 FPS December 2020 Jurassic World Evolution 50 FPS February 2021 Dyson Sphere Program 50 FPS February 2021 Valheim 50 FPS February 2021 Path of Exile 50 FPS March 2021 Outriders 55 FPS March 2021 Kenshi 50 FPS May 2021 Biomutant 50 FPS May 2021 Dying Light 50 FPS June 2021

Despite those limitations GeForce NOW is still an interesting option for many gamers who are simply unable to find a dedicated RTX-enabled graphics card in stock and at a good price. The Priority tier is available at 50 USD per six months while RTX 3080 tier is 100 USD per six months. This particular GPU now goes for around 1500 USD on Newegg which equals 7.5 years of GeForce NOW RTX 3080 subscription.

The downside is that cloud gaming services do not often include all titles (especially true with GN) and it adds latency and complexity to actually launching the game. Users also need uncapped high-speed Internet access. On the plus side the service is available on multiple platforms (PC/Mac/Android/Internet Browsers) which do not require powerful hardware. Not to mention all the power saved by not actually using a 320W GPU.

Duke's Caitlin Cosme connected on a goal on a free kick with 17 seconds left that allowed the Blue Devils to nip the Monarchs 1-0 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. ODU's defense held firm for most of the game and it appeared overtime was imminent but Cosme dashed the Monarchs' hopes.

Goalkeeper Kasey Perry tallied five saves on the night and was a brick wall in net for most of the contest. Cosme's shot was perfectly placed in the top right corner of the goal just out of Perry's reach.

Most of the game was played on Old Dominion's half of the field making the defensive effort all the more impressive. The Monarchs only managed four shots on goal for the contest. ODU was called for 16 fouls compared to six called on Duke including the one that set up the game-winning free kick.

The loss ends an historic campaign for ODU. The Monarchs finished the campaign with a 13-5-1 record and won their first ever Conference USA title. Friday marked their second ever NCAA Tournament appearance and first since 2006.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ybGFuZG9zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9vbGQtZG9taW5pb24tbG9ncy10d28tc2FmZXRpZXMtZW4tcm91dGUtdG8tYS0zMC0xNi13aW4tb3Zlci1mYXUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Dominion logs two safeties en route to a 30-16 win over FAU,"Nick Rice kicked three second-half field goals and Old Dominion scored on two first-half safeties en route to a 30-16 win over Florida Atlantic on Saturday.

But that was child’s play compared to the struggle they had with (checks roster) Taylor Heinicke.

The Washington Football Team was expected to start veteran Alex Smith in the NFC wild-card game in January at Fed Ex Field.

But a lingering calf injury meant Smith was out and the daring pylon-diving quarterback from Old Dominion had his big break.

Heinicke made the most of it passing for 306 yards with one touchdown and an interception. More impressively he extended plays escaped likely sacks and rushed six times for 46 yards and a score.

The Bucs managed to hold on for a 31-23 win but the game wasn’t sealed until Lavonte David’s sack of Heinicke on the final drive.

“Yeah we basically were getting ready for Alex (Smith) and we knew he was going to be sitting in the middle of the pocket” Bucs coach Bruce Arians said. “So there were certain things we were doing and not knowing Taylor (Heinicke) and not knowing he was going to play it was difficult.”

There were several contributing factors to Heinicke’s success. The Bucs hadn’t reached the postseason in 12 years. Even at 7-9 Washington was the NFC East champion.

Much of the Bucs’ defensive game plan and pressure packages were designed for Smith whom they knew would stay in the pocket.

Heinicke’s ability to make throws on the run in the game rivaled Russell Wilson.

“I think when you have the unknown especially in a game like that being the first playoff game for us in a long time and the energy level not knowing how fast he was — you know now” Arians said. “This guy can really go. If you open the middle of that pocket he’s going to take off.

“So yeah that’s a whole different ballgame when you know who you’re dealing with. He can throw that deep ball. He can throw that seven route. He proved he can play.”

Bucs defensive coordinator Todd Bowles said that while Heinicke played well it wasn’t because the Bucs didn’t prepare for him.

“We prepare for everybody and we understand who their backups are and who comes in on the third team” Bowles sad. “If you’re on the roster — as a defensive coordinator or any coordinator — it would be foolish not to know who could or could not come in that ballgame. He just played a good ball game.”

However Heinicke hasn’t been able to lead his team to many points or wins lately. Washington entered the bye week on a four-game losing streak in which they averaged just 13.7 points.

“There’s been a lot of good (with Heinicke) and it hasn’t showed up on the scoreboard especially in the last three weeks” Washington offensive coordinator Scott Turner said. “For the way that we’ve moved the ball we should’ve scored more points — and we very easily could have. I think we’re a lot closer than what it seems to be than when you look at the end results.”

Of course Heinicke isn’t the only player on offense the Bucs must account for. Receiver Terry McLaurin is one of the best in the league and running backs Antonio Gibson and J.D. McKissic create matchup problems for the Bucs.

“My primary concern is they have weapons across the field” Bucs linebacker Lavonte David said. “They have Terry McLaurin — he’s a threat at receiver. Antonio Gibson and (J.D) McKissic. Obviously the quarterback. I remember what he did to us last year. He’s definitely a threat to us.

“At the end of the day as long as we take of what we’re supposed to take care of and execute our thing on defense and play sound and smart football it definitely feels like we have a chance.”

Something few would have given Heinicke against the Bucs 10 months ago.

(ODUSports.com) – Old Dominion continued a dramatic turnaround in its football fortunes and won one of the most unusual games ever played to extend its winning streak to three games.

ODU's defense scored two safeties the most in a Conference USA game since 1996 and the offense exploded in the second half as the Monarchs claimed a 30-16 victory over Florida Atlantic Saturday night at S.B. Ballard Stadium.

In all ODU scored two points on four different plays an achievement that has rarely occurred elsewhere. There were also five fumbles including two lost by ODU in the game's opening minutes.

""It's the most unusual game I've ever been to"" ODU coach Ricky Rahne [odusports.com] said.

""You try and try and try as a coach to put your kids in as many situations as possible to try to replicate game-like scenarios and under no circumstance would I be able to replicate what happened tonight.

""It was wild deal. But they kept responding every time and that shows a tough-minded resilient football team.""

After losing five of its first six games ODU (4-6 3-3 Conference USA) has beaten Louisiana Tech FIU and now FAU (5-5 3-3) in its last three outings. Once last in the C-USA East Division the Monarchs have pulled into a four-way tie for third place with FAU Charlotte and Middle Tennessee all at 3-3 in league games.

The Monarchs could go 6-6 and move as high as second in the standings by winning at Middle Tennessee on Saturday and then at home against Charlotte on Nov. 27.

That would give ODU its first non-losing season since 2016 and also make the Monarchs bowl eligible for the first time since 2016.

Rahne has stressed a ""1-0 mentality"" in which the players focus on tasks each day and the game each week so that they won't get distracted by looking ahead. When asked about a potential bowl bid quarterback Hayden

Wolff said only that the Monarchs want to go 1-0.

Rahne said the joy the players feel in the locker room after winning a game is motivation enough for his Monarchs.

""It feels pretty awesome"" Wolff said.

Added Rahne: ""They're learning that some of the stuff I say while incredibly cliché for them it's what they really believe in. They believe in 1-0 and earning the right to win and believe that practice ultimately allows you to play better and they believe that how you do anything affects everything.

""It's kind of cool because now they repeat them back to me. That's been a really awesome thing to witness to watch the culture that a lot of people including the players worked so hard to build you see it start to show up and coalesce.""

Wolff completed 21-of-33 passes for 289 yards and a touchdown with no interceptions. He threaded the needle on several long passes including a 48-yard pass to Ali Jennings and a 46-yard pass to tight end Donta Anthony.

Running back Blake Watson [odusports.com] rushed 23 times for 163 yards and a touchdown as the Monarch offense rolled to 448 yards. It was Watson's fifth game in a row with more than 100 rushing yards.

ODU's defense held FAU to 308 yards and that occurred in part because the offense was on the field much of the game. The offense had 75 plays to 55 for the D.

ODU scored two safeties in the first half the first when Marcus Haynes [odusports.com] tackled FAU quarterback N'Kosi Perry in the end zone that narrowed an Owls lead to 3-2 with 6:16 left in the first quarter.

The defense gave ODU a 4-3 lead with its second safety minutes later. With FAU facing a second down at its own 1 defensive tackle Sokoya McDuffie [odusports.com] forced Perry to throw a hurried pass out of bounds. Perry was penalized for intentional grounding and ODU was awarded a safety.

""When I looked up at the scoreboard and was the score was 4-3 I said 'are we playing a hockey game?'"" Wolff said.

ODU scored twice more on two-pointers in the second half.

Freshman Jason Henderson [odusports.com] blocked an extra point attempt which was picked up by R'Tarriun Johnson [odusports.com] and returned 80 yards for two points and the Monarchs converted a two-point conversion on the final score. Wolff threw to Jennings at the four and he tossed the ball to a streaking Blake Watson [odusports.com] who bulled his way into the end zone with 2:48 left to build the lead to 30-16.

ODU led at the half 11-3 and drove deep into FAU territory on its first three drives of the second half and each time settled for Nick Rice [odusports.com] field goals of 30 28 and 20 yards. Rice broke his own school record with his 18th field goal of the season.

FAU meanwhile got TDs from Brandon Robinson on a 59-yard pass reception and Johnny Ford on a 2-yard run.

Ford's run narrowed the lead to 20-16.

But then ODU's special teams came up big as Henderson blocked the extra point which was returned by Johnson.

ODU then put it away on a drive keyed by Wolff's 37-yard pass to freshman Jordan Bly [odusports.com]. Two plays later Wolff found Isiah Paige [odusports.com] the freshman from Richmond's Varina High with a 14-yard touchdown pass the first TD of Paige's career.

As the team jogged into the locker room at game's end the remainder of a small but vocal crowd of 13634 stood and cheered and many players raised their helmets in return.

Linebacker Jordan Young [odusports.com] a sixth-year senior had endured 33 losses in 44 ODU games until the latest winning streak began.

""After going through loss after loss you appreciate the wins a lot more"" he said. ""You see all of the happy fans around here the players and coaches all so happy.

""It's an awesome feeling for all of our hard work to be paying off and for the community for everyone at the school to be happy about the team.""

US Trade Representative Katherine Chi Tai will visit Seoul on Thursday according to government officials on Sunday.



It will mark the first time in 10 years for the country’s chief trade negotiator to visit South Korea since Free Trade Agreement talks were held in 2011.



It is expected that Tai will discuss a number of economic and trade issues with South Korean counterparts including the semiconductor supply chain and a digital trade agreement.



Other topics include incentives for South Korea companies investing in the US as well as cooperation to tackle climate crisis.



Her visit comes as South Korean chipmakers such as Samsung Electronics and SK hynix were recently asked by the US Department of Commerce to answer a list of questions.



The questionnaire touched upon sensitive business information including types of technology nodes semiconductor materials and devices. The firms were also asked to reveal their order backlogs and top customers as well as other details of their inventory status.



Though the US has said the move is to help tackle the ongoing semiconductor supply shortage it was met with concerns that providing confidential information could hurt South Korean companies.



Against this backdrop the South Korean trade ministry is expected to discuss strengthening semiconductor cooperation ask the US to not require further information from South Korean chipmakers and keep the information that has been shared confidential.



The South Korean side is also likely to raise the issue of steel tariffs after the US and EU agreed to end a tariff dispute.



Earlier this month Joo Young-joon director general for industry policy at Seoul‘s Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy said the potential increase in the volume of EU steel imports would “inevitably have adverse impacts” on South Korea’s exports.



High-ranking government officials such as Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo will meet with Tai during her visit.



She will first visit Japan on Monday before arriving in Korea later that week. After her visit to Korea the US chief trade negotiator will head to India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2N1cmlvdXMtdGV4YXMvMjAyMS8xMS8xNC93aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXRvLXRoZS1zdXBlcmNvbmR1Y3Rpbmctc3VwZXItY29sbGlkZXItc2l0ZS1uZWFyLXdheGFoYWNoaWUtY3VyaW91cy10ZXhhcy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMv0gGsAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY3VyaW91cy10ZXhhcy8yMDIxLzExLzE0L3doYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQtdG8tdGhlLXN1cGVyY29uZHVjdGluZy1zdXBlci1jb2xsaWRlci1zaXRlLW5lYXItd2F4YWhhY2hpZS1jdXJpb3VzLXRleGFzLWludmVzdGlnYXRlcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happened to the super collider site in Waxahachie?,"Just outside of Waxahachie is the country’s most-ambitious science experiment that never was.

It was called the Superconducting Super Collider and it was going to be a 53-mile underground loop where particles could collide and scientists could study those fragmented pieces to unlock the secrets of matter and discover the origins of the universe.

The Super Collider would have brought billions of dollars and thousands of jobs to the area and it was close to becoming a reality in the 1980s. But after years of missteps the project was shut down and funding was pulled.

What was left of the Super Collider now lies in the form of 14.5 miles of tunnels and the shell of a building that was once filled with many dreams of scientific opportunities.

That’s why a reader asked Curious Texas: What was done with the old Super Collider site near Waxahachie?

The site is now home to Univar Solutions a chemical manufacturing and packaging company. The company in 2012 acquired Waxahachie-based Magnablend which had reopened the site after the destruction of its plant in a 2011 fire.

The warehouses had been vacant for nearly two decades at that point. But how did Texas end up with the site of one of the biggest experiments in the world?

In the 1970s scientists had discussed studying atomic particles and they needed space to make it happen. A years-long nationwide search for the perfect site ended November 1988 near Waxahachie. It became official the following January and by then the town had rented out a space on a billboard off Interstate 35E that read: “Waxahachie Home of the Super Collider.”

Roy Schwitters professor emeritus of physics at the University of Texas at Austin remembers the project well. He was called upon to be the project’s director in 1989 just as the tunnels were being developed.

Schwitters’ expertise is in experimental high-energy physics. He left a professorship at Harvard University to work on the Super Collider and he still believes the project had more physics potential than CERN one of the world’s largest labs for physics research.

“CERN doesn’t have the potential in the same way we had because to get really high energy particles it takes big accelerators” Schwitters said. “And Texas … had a great site and ideal underground conditions and all the things you need to build those accelerators.”

The Super Collider magic came together in a makeshift warehouse-turned-office just south of Dallas Schwitters said. He remembers sitting on boxes with a team eager to make the project come to life.

According to The Dallas Morning News’ archives the lobby of the temporary offices had models that showed what the collider ring would have looked like and posters explained how scientists would collide atoms at almost the speed of light.

Ellis County Judge Todd Little a freshman in high school when the project started said his family owned about 800 acres of land in nearby Red Oak and — ahead of the project’s development — his father sold about 150 lots for homes to be built.

“I remember literally having scientists from other parts of the world that had come into my neighborhood and they were there specifically to work for the Super Collider” Little said.

Little was away at school for some of the construction but when he came home there wasn’t much talk about — so much of the building happened underground and whatever was aboveground was off-limits.

Initial reports estimated that the Super Collider was going to cost about $6 billion of federal money. At the time the potential for discovery was worth the price.

For six days a week crews used boring machines to dig the tunnels in early 1993. Roughly 11 miles — about 20% of the loop — had been carved out by July and the estimated cost ballooned as high as $11 billion.

Univar Solutions warehouses at the former site of the Superconducting Super Collider a project that was shut down in 1993 are seen in November 2021.

Because not much was known about accelerators Schwitters said the project changed in size and scope once construction had started and more money and materials were needed in order to adapt to those changes. The additional building of an office facility also added to the costs he said.

“Our position was if the government wants to build this you don’t want to build a dud that doesn’t work” Schwitters said.

He said a lapse in funding from other countries forced the project to pump the brakes.

According to The News’ archives tensions between Japan and the U.S. over the automobile industry got in the way and Japan’s Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa decided to wait until after the 1992 U.S. presidential election to decide on funding the Super Collider. After the election the Clinton administration did not give as much support to the project.

“That was a huge loss for us” Schwitters said.

After spending nearly $2 billion on the project the U.S. House of Representatives voted to kill the project that summer and it was officially axed by Congress on Oct. 21 1993.

“It was just devastating to the risk-takers who came to build the Super Collider” Schwitters said. “That was … that was really hard.”

Little remembers hearing about the disappointment from people in the community. For people in Ellis County who had been following the project for years and years the experience was traumatic he said especially for those who had worked on the Super Collider.

“A lot of them relocated their families to Waxahachie and once the project was canceled some of them never left — they made Waxahachie home” he said. “But the younger ones that had a career in front of them they left and moved on to the next project.”

In Switzerland CERN’s Large Hadron Collider discovered the Higgs boson or “God particle” in 2012. It was a revolutionary discovery that confirmed scientific theories of how the universe began.

The Super Collider would have accomplished that and more Schwitters said.

After the project was pulled Schwitters held a professorship at UT-Austin. He’s been back to the site a few times but he said he finds it depressing to look at the buildings.

“I’m just not a ‘what might have been’ kind of person; I just don’t want to get hung up there” he said. “On the other hand it was a grand opportunity and all the pieces just weren’t quite able to come to come together unfortunately.”

In the latest Around Town column Palo Alto gets called out in a New York Times video op-ed over its lack of new housing and Bayshore Christian Ministries debuts a new outdoor space in East Palo Alto.

KIND OF BLUE … It’s been eight years since Palo Alto voters rejected Measure D which overturned a zone change that would’ve enabled construction of 60 low-income apartments and 12 single-family homes but the episode continues to shape the city’s image.

An orchard off of Clemo Avenue and Maybell Avenue in Palo Alto was eyed for a housing development. Palo Alto voters overturned the approved project in 2013. Embarcadero Media file photo taken July 15 2013 by Veronica Weber.

The 2013 referendum over the Maybell Avenue development was featured in a New York Times video op-ed released Tuesday. It focused on Democratic strongholds that fail to live up to the party’s egalitarian values.

“Affluent liberals tend to be really good at showing up to the marches and talking about how they like equality” video journalist Johnny Harris says in the documentary. “They’re really good about putting signs in their lawns saying that all are welcome here. But by their actions what they’re actually saying is ‘We believe in these ideals just not in my backyard.'”

The op-ed points out that over the past eight years the San Francisco area added 676000 jobs and only 176000 housing units and singles out Palo Alto for its failure to rezone single-family districts to support higher-density housing projects.

NYT Editorial Board member Binyamin Appelbaum suggested that when it comes to opposing housing projects it’s “always the same song ‘I’m in favor of affordable housing. We need more of it in this county. However I have some concerns about this project.'”

The video then cuts to footage of local residents and Measure D opponents Tim Gray and Bob Moss urging residents to oppose the measure at a town hall meeting. Palo Alto isn’t the only target in the video.

The documentary also takes aim at the liberal bastions of Washington state which is criticized for its regressive tax policies and Illinois where some school districts are gerrymandered to steer money away from poorer communities to the more affluent ones.

FIELD OF HOPE … East Palo Alto may have its own version of a “Field of Dreams” at Bayshore Christian Ministries. After years of planning and work the organization debuted its renovated Field of Hope next to its Beech Street headquarters.

The space features a soccer field fire pit picnic area and garden Executive Director Tiffany Hong said in a press release. Everything came together through community contributions. The designing and planning work was a collaborative effort with students at Oxford Day School which uses space at the ministries’ headquarters and Palo Alto nonprofit Canopy. The students were trained by PlaceWorks an urban planning firm to lead a design charrette as part of their coursework.

With the support of Kaiser Permanente’s CAMPOS grant the organization worked with Canopy to greenify the field with 32 trees and 125 plants.

Professional basketball player Jeremy Lin‘s foundation helped install a half-sized basketball court in the space (not to mention footed a majority of the cost) which was celebrated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in March. “I hope that the court is a source of unification and that you continue to pursue your dreams and enjoy working out and enjoy exercising every day” Lin told Bayshore’s youth in a video.

Over the summer more than $110000 was raised through Bayshore’s capital campaign to complete the Field of Hope.

The outdoor space was recognized by the California Senate through a certificate signed Oct. 10 by state Sen. Josh Becker D-Menlo Park. That same day the organization held a Field of Hope expo attended by more than 230 people according to a press release. “BCM’s Field of Hope is an example of East Palo Alto’s resilience. It’s an oasis” City Council member Antonio Lopez said at the event. “The beauty of this outdoor space offers hope and inspiration to the community.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s Summer of Soul won all six categories in which it was nominated at the 2021 Critics Choice Documentary Awards which were handed out Sunday in Brooklyn.

The film which premiered at this year’s Sundance Film Festival features footage largely forgotten and unseen for 50 years of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival featuring Nina Simone Sly and the Family Stone Stevie Wonder and more.

Among the film’s awards haul was the trophy for best documentary the top award of the night. In his speech Questlove said “This is hands-down the best night of my life.”

Going into the ceremony Questlove’s Summer of Soul was tied for the most nominations with fellow first-time director Jessica Kingdon’s Ascension which went home empty-handed.

Summer of Soul’s sweep began early in the ceremony when it won the first award of the night for best first documentary feature. “I’ve been in this industry for 30-plus years and I always thought celebrating something was a weakness. When my first album came out or when my first book came out or my first day of teaching class I sort of just pushed it to the side like it was nothing. I’ve learned that it’s safe to celebrate an achievement so how ironic that this new journey in my life starts now” Questlove said in his first acceptance speech.

Summer of Soul also was named best archival documentary. Questlove kicked off his second speech with “This isn’t awkward at all.” The film also went on to win best music documentary and best editing the latter of which Questlove presented giving out a little shout of excitement before announcing the winner. Questlove also tied for best director with Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin for The Rescue. The best director award was presented by Dana Delany who called Questlove the MVP of the night.

Before the awards Questlove told The Hollywood Reporter that a win would be a “cherry on top” of the effort that went into the film.

“There’s a lot of hard work that went into this and to see something in fruition after 50 years of a stalled car would be rather sweet” he said.

When asked what he hopes viewers take away from the film his answer was simple: “joy.”

“This is probably definitely one of the happiest documentaries that I’ve ever seen even though I’m a part of it” he said. “To see it is something to behold.”

The Rescue which went into the night with five nominations won two more awards for best cinematography and best score.

A fellow five-time nominee Liz Garbus’ Becoming Cousteau won best science documentary. Edgar Wright’s The Sparks Brothers Todd Haynes’ The Velvet Underground and Leo Scott and Ting Poo’s Val Kilmer exploration Val were each nominated for four awards.

After winning the award for best historical or biographical documentary for Val Poo praised Kilmer for his role in the project.

“I want to thank Val who couldn’t be here with us tonight but it’s because of him and his spirit and just his willingness to share with us his most intimate thoughts and feelings and put it out there for everyone to see that made this film truly special” Poo said.

Val also won for best narration.

Before the awards ceremony Poo told THR of the reaction to the film “The biggest thing for me is that so many people feel they know him now in a way they didn’t before. He’s such an iconic actor but really quite an enigma for many people. He really opened up and let people know what he’s like and who he is and some of his most innermost thoughts and feelings.”

R.J. Cutler whose most recent film is Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry which was up for best music documentary received the D.A. Pennebaker Award from Chris Hegedus the longtime partner of the award’s late namesake.

Onstage Hegedus recalled first encountering Cutler — “a young enthusiastic red-headed freckle-face guy wearing a wrinkled T-shirt shorts and high-top sneakers” — when they worked together with Pennebaker and Wendy Ettinger on the acclaimed 1993 political documentary The War Room which took viewers inside Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign.

Despite long wanting to do a film about someone running for president Hegedus recalled she and Pennebaker told Cutler and Ettinger that they needed money and access something the two young producers secured just a week later.

“Unfortunately the money was just about enough to get us in trouble and the access turned out to be to the staff of the least popular candidate in New York … Bill Clinton” Hegedus said.

Taking the stage to accept his honor Cutler said he and Ettinger had gone out to dinner and celebrated after that initial meeting thinking they were making a movie. All they had to do was get money and access.

Cutler who called Pennebaker his mentor spoke about how the late filmmaker believed documentaries could be as compelling as narrative films.

“Here we are in 2021 and [that] vision has come to pass” he said. “Documentaries are proving to be just as popular with audiences as narrative films and just as impactful on the culture.”

He also shared a sweet surprise revealing that he and his wife just six months ago welcomed their third child “Penny” whom they named in memory of Pennebaker.

The sixth annual awards an offshoot of the Critics Choice Awards were hosted by The Daily Show’s Roy Wood Jr. at BRIC in Brooklyn. The honors recognize the best theatrical TV and digital documentaries.

Wood Jr. who also executive produced nominee The Neutral Ground praised the hard work of the documentary filmmakers in attendance Sunday night calling them “this country’s historians.”

“I think that’s something that I hope you don’t lose sight of” he continued before joking “because when they’re done burning the books they’ll come for the documentaries next. And good luck with that. Good luck destroying documentaries because destroying documentaries means not only that you would have to destroy the video but you also have to destroy the audio. I don’t know if you’ve ever met a sound guy but these are not the type of people you want to fuck with. At minimum you’ve all made wonderful future podcasts. Your stories are safe because that sound man has three knives in his utility belt.”

While the documentary community wasn’t able to gather last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2020’s top winner was Dick Johnson Is Dead with filmmaker Kirsten Johnson also winning best director.

Speaking about the return to in-person events Val‘s Poo told THR “Honestly it’s wonderful. I think you forget because we found so many new ways of meeting with each other but it’s not really until you get in a room with everybody and you get to meet people in person and see people without their masks on. It’s more emotional than you would think. It’s great to be around everybody again.”

Then Durant and Harden — in their first game together in OKC since Harden was traded away in 2012 — gave it to their former team lifting the Nets to a 120-96 laugher before a disappointed crowd of 15080 at Paycom Center on Sunday.

“They’ve been playing well. They’d won four straight prior to this game. We didn’t take them lightly and came out and tried to play very good Brooklyn Nets basketball on both ends of the ball” Harden said. “I think we did that.”

Durant shrugged off a sore shoulder to pour in 33 points to go with eight rebounds while Harden added 16 points and 13 assists.

Thanks to 29 points off the bench from Patty Mills it was a perfect way for the Nets (10-4) to cap a 5-1 road trip one that lifted them into a virtual first-place tie in the East with the Wizards.

“Yeah seeing that tweet before the game it’s crazy how stuff happens. Never thought when James got traded I didn’t know what the future would hold. And for us to come back around on the same team as we got older is pretty sweet” Durant said. “Coming here and [getting] the love that we got from the fans you just know that we put in a lot of work here. We helped build this thing.”

Durant talked about the fans’ love with a straight face. That didn’t sound like love; that sounded more like the other thing.

Asked if he was still shocked at getting booed in OKC after almost a decade — especially considering he was traded away — Harden shrugged off the jeers.

“I don’t know. I don’t really care honestly. I don’t know why. It wasn’t my fault” said Harden who claimed the return held no special meaning. “No I was just trying to come in and win a game. For me it’s been a long time.”

About the only negative for the Nets was an injury to Joe Harris. He checked out with 3:05 left in the first half and never returned ruled out with a sprained left ankle.

But by that time the Nets led 55-43. It never got closer than seven the rest of the night or than eight in the second half. The Nets held OKC at arm’s length to win for the eighth time in their last nine games.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led OKC with 23 points. But the Nets took advantage of the Thunder’s lack of outside shooting holding them to 40 percent overall and 14 of 45 from deep.

With Harris out Mills stepped up and hit 9 of 12 from deep.

The Nets trailed 37-33 after Aleksej Pokusevski’s putback. But they mounted an extended 20-4 run to take command once and for all.

Consecutive 3s from Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge capped the spurt and put the Nets ahead by 12.

When Mills drew a charge on Luguentz Dort (20 points) it sent the defensive-minded guard to the bench with a fourth foul with 2:46 left in the half. That was a boon for Brooklyn with Harden’s three-point play sending the Nets into intermission up 61-48 — their biggest road halftime lead this season.

The Nets just built on it in the third with Durant’s free throws padding the lead to 90-74 going into the fourth where it grew from there. After his league-high seventh 30-point outing — and going 13 of 14 from the foul line — Durant shrugged off his sore shoulder.

“It’s solid. A little sore here and there but I played didn’t get in the way too much. Keep getting treatment and take it a day at a time” Durant said.

“He’s got a little tweak” Nash said “but the ball still goes in the hole so I think he’s hanging in there.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyber scammers have gotten so good at ripping us off in recent months I no longer trust any text call or email message from a company – even when it’s legit. That might sound extreme but I get at least one scam text a handful of calls and nearly a dozen fraudulent emails every day.

I’m far from alone in battling this constant barrage.

Wakely will report to PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta. She was not immediately available for comment.

In the new role Wakely will focus on using customer insights to drive growth. She will also accelerate PepsiCo’s Positive Choices pillar under the PepsiCo Positive (pep+) corporate strategy by evolving the product portfolio to include more plant-based nutritious and sustainable ingredients and products.

And this led to hybrid conflict policies.

One of the best badly kept secrets in Pakistan’s $2 billion media and advertising industry is the open acknowledgment that MNC client requests for category exclusivity requests are to be dealt with by using one holding company over multiple conflict shops which is separate agency brand created so the holding group can serve multiple advertisers in the same category.

This is exactly how WPP recently won the Coca-Cola media review with GroupM in Pakistan taking the multinational beverage corporation under its agency brand called Mediacom. For the media executives unaware of the concept of conflict shops this news came as a shock since the Mindshare media agency under GroupM in Pakistan has been leading media investments for PepsiCo for a number of years.

“We have any and every possible way to ensure that the client confidentiality is maintained at all points of time” said Naveed Asghar CEO of GroupM Pakistan. “Having a separate agency separate teams seperate locarions separate operating models and having rigorous firewalls to ensure absolute confidentiality. For example in most countries we do Unilever and P&G together. In Pakistan we handle competing brands via independent agencies/teams and the testament of that is the fact that we have been successfully working with these clients for decades.” GroupM isn’t alone on this.

Z2C Limited has three of the four largest telecom brands under its portfolio companies: Zong is with Publicis Media affiliate Pak Media Communications (PMC) Mobilink is with Spark affiliate Blitz Advertising and Telenor is with Starcom & MediaVest affiliate Brainchild Communications Pakistan (BCP).

The same group has found a way to serve multiple CPG companies such as P&G Friesland Campina Reckitt Mondelez and now Nestle. Parked with different media agencies across its portfolio companies Z2C Limited justifies these competing category clients by giving each a separate agency agency team business office reporting line and adheres to a range of client-led SOPs around ensuring that data on the activities of one advertiser or brand are not leaked to the account team from the competing category brand.

“The critical feature of hybrid policies is the establishment of distinct organizational units operated separately but in parallel while under common control and/or ownership” wrote Alvin J. Silk the Lincoln Filene professor emeritus at Harvard University in a paper titled Conflict Policy and Advertising Agency–Client Relations. “Competing accounts/clients can then be served by quasi-independent units subject to the protection against security breaches afforded by safeguards that serve as organizational and personnel mobility barriers.”

He said that this flexibility facilitates the selective relaxation of the demands of strict exclusivity and fosters the design of customized conflict policies to address the heterogeneity and dynamics of agency and client interests.

Elephants enter the room

On the one hand most advertisers – be it telco or CPG – will shout from the rooftops that the brands in their portfolio have no equal in the country and are number one which itself makes the insistence for category exclusivity perplexing to begin with. If your brand cannot be beaten due to its customer sentiment customer loyalty and value for money what difference does it make if an agency works on both your supposed star brand and the inferior other as you put it?

That may be the topic for another report about how deep down all advertisers in Pakistan know they are peddling commodities that only sell due to penetration pricing rather than the value-based pricing model commonly associated with actual brand builders such as Apple and Tesla. Back to conflict shops.

The absence of this business strategy is reflected in the 2020 media agency rankings from RECMA where the agency groups that lack a conflict shop are struggling to put it mildly:

OMD affiliated Manhattan shrunk by 48%

Carat affiliated Synergy Dentsu shrunk by 23%

Havas affiliated Media Axis shrunk by 18%

UM affiliated Orient Communications shrunk by 17%

It also doesn’t help that the aforementioned full-service agencies have a track record of working with advertisers that have been suspended by the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) multiple times due to late payments.

Given that advertisers particularly multinationals tend to request documentation from prospective media agencies to prove they have the financial muscle and liquidity to handle their business it is often that poor cash flow clients hurt credibility during these bids.

“Marketers can protect themselves from the impact of conflict by making sure that key competitors those who should not be in the same agency brand are named in their contract” said Nadia Shchipitsyna marketing manager at the ID Comms Group a consulting firm that helps advertisers through the media review process. “The same document should also specify how a company’s data is managed and protected. Marketers should expect agencies to let them know that they are pitching for business that might be of interest.”

She added that it shouldn’t take an article in the trade press – such as Profit being the first to report that Publicis Media won Nestle in Pakistan – for the client to find out. She said that advertisers need to seek reassurance that they still have priority status or else they may want to rethink their relationship.

“Of course advertisers also need to work hard to maintain that priority status” she said. “Even small brands can raise their status at an agency by being good media partners. Building a productive relationship with your media agency is a two-way street and both parties need to work hard to drive business success. Managing conflict well is one key ingredient that both sides increasingly need to get right if they are to have a lasting relationship.”

This is why Adcom Media set up the short-lived digital-first media agency Green Man’s Ark why IG Square has Mesh Media and why IAL Saatchi & Saatchi has a close relationship with Digitz where the companies share the same faces in the board of directors.

The real issue

The scale and reality of conflict are something that all marketers should consider planning ahead to make sure it does not have a negative impact. This is independent of the conflicts created when agencies win the bid for events and then sell sponsorship deals for those events regardless of what the Medialogic data suggests.

“The risks are less about media buying capabilities although all marketers will want to ensure they are paying competitive rates for media particularly compared to competitors in traditional media” said Shchipitsyna. “What really makes a difference when it comes to conflict and will have a dramatic effect on business and the ability to drive growth through media is talent and innovation. Add also today’s big concern and a key driver of potential growth: data.”

As cautioned by Profit – months ahead of the global panic around data depreciation – investments towards first-party data are critical for all advertisers around the world and more so in Pakistan where there is only one second-party data marketplace.

Given that data will be the most important asset an advertiser has the first-party data it does acquire needs to be first housed within a customer data platform (CDP) that only advertisers and dedicated agency teams can access. This approach quells the relatively meaningless concerns around conflict shops placing advertisers back in the driver’s seat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU0NzgwMC90ZXNsYS1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLWV2cy12b2x1bWUtY29uc3RyYWludHMv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9pbnNpZGVldnMuY29tL25ld3MvNTQ3ODAwL3Rlc2xhLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtZXZzLXZvbHVtZS1jb25zdHJhaW50cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk Explains Why Tesla Can't Produce Additional EVs In Volume,"Tesla's CEO Elon Musk was recently asked (via Twitter) about the Tesla Semi which is delayed according to the official announcement but at the same time expected to be delivered to PepsiCo this quarter.

His answer is to not to put too much emphasis on that and that the company can't produce additional vehicles in volume.

It clearly indicates that if there really will be some deliveries of the Tesla Semi those will be small numbers - maybe pre-production or pilot deployment.

""Please don’t read too much into this. As mentioned publicly Tesla is constrained by chip supply short-term & cell supply long-term. Not possible to produce additional vehicles in volume until both constraints are addressed.""

chip supply short-term

cell supply long-term

...and both have to be addressed to produce additional vehicles in volume (think vehicles like the Tesla Semi Tesla Cybertruck Tesla Roadster and any upcoming new 4680-cell-powered EVs).

The chip supply bottleneck will probably ease with each quarter so this problem appears to be smaller.

The second problem however is the one that will remain with us long term - maybe an entire decade and it will limit all-electric car expansion in general (for all or most brands).

That would explain also why Tesla has extended the list of its battery supplier from solely/mainly Panasonic to also LG Chem's LG Energy Solution and CATL as well as has started its own in-house battery cell development (4680-type). The demand is forecasted to be so high that all channels must be utilized and external 4680-type cell suppliers are also welcome (Panasonic expects a contract).

Of course the second reason to include new suppliers is the switch to the affordable LFP-batteries (Panasonic does not offer them while CATL is more than happy to sell them in volume).

There is one more thing... if the cells are not the short-term constraint then it means that there is just enough supply of 1860-type and 2170-type cylindrical cells from Panasonic and 2170-type from LG Energy Solution o match the chip-constrained output probably.",,,,,,

Most children experience only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all when infected with COVID-19. But experts say some have developed severe illness enough to be hospitalized and more than 600 children under the age of 18 have died from the virus according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

13th Saturday November 2021 - 09:11 UTC Full article

Pfizer's vaccine has already been cleared for use on Brazilian patients between the ages of 12 and 15 on June 11

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer Friday filed an application before Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) for its COVID-19 vaccine named Comirnaty to be cleared for use on patients aged 5 to 11 years old.

Pfizer's request states that the dosage of the vaccine will be adjusted and lower than that used for those over 12 years of age and will be distributed in different packages Anvisa said.

The laboratory noted that according to preliminary data two doses of 10 micrograms of the vaccine was shown to be safe and capable of generating a high level of antibodies in this age group.

Anvisa now has 30 days to study the request. Comirnaty is already being applied to children aged 5 to 11 in the United States since November 2 after the approval of health regulators while European authorities are evaluating both Pfizer's and Moderna's drugs for this age group. The Brazilian agency needs to focus on data on safety and adverse events and dose adjustment among other items it was explained.

Pfizer's vaccine has already been cleared for use on Brazilian patients between the ages of 12 and 15 on June 11 and it is available in the country since February 23 for people over 16 years of age.

With 213 million inhabitants Brazil has recorded over 610000 COVID-19 deaths a number surpassed only by the United States. At least 58.1% of Brazil's population has a full vaccination treatment.

Anvisa's directors and officials have received death threats by email due to the possibility that the entity authorizes anticovid vaccines for children from 5 to 11 years and a police enquiry has been launched into the matter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTExLTE1L3BmaXplci1waWxsLWNvdmlkLXRyZWF0bWVudC1wYXhsb3ZpZC1tb3JlLXNob3ctcHJvbWlzZS8xMDA2MTY3MDbSAShodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTAwNjE2NzA2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer's pill is the latest COVID treatment to show promise.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is apparent in Southern California where the combination of dust sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides known as smog has been on the rise over the last two decades. Between 2010 and 2017 Southern California experienced a 10 percent increase in deaths related to smog hitting communities of color across the Southern Los Angeles and Inland Empire regions the hardest.

On Friday however as world leaders gathered in Glasgow Scotland to discuss efforts to curtail climate change a 13-member regulatory board in Southern California approved a major new rule known as Refinery Rule 1109.1 that could dramatically clean the region's air.

Decades in the making the regulations will require 16 facilities including 12 oil refineries located in Los Angeles San Bernardino and Orange Counties to install pollution controls on outdated equipment most notably heater and boiler systems by 2031. The rule was under consideration because the air district had failed to meet federal smog standards and also because the state's environmental justice law AB 617 targeted cleaning up the air in industry-adjacent communities across the state.

Passed in 2017 AB 617 directs local air districts to speed up refinery retrofits to cut pollution and also work with community members to develop emission reduction plans. Local air quality regulators faced pressure to pass the refinery rule under both provisions of AB 617. The rule comported with the law's mandate to hasten refinery upgrades and communities included the passage of the rule as a priority in their emissions reduction plan.

The new pollution control equipment will reduce harmful air pollutants — particularly nitrogen oxides or NOx — by as much as 8 tons every day. The South Coast Air Quality Management District passed the rule unanimously after two hours of public comment and deliberation on Friday morning.

""This is a critical ruling and moment"" said Julia May a senior scientist at the environmental justice group Communities for a Better Environment. ""You can't completely clean these industries up — they're inherently dirty — but in the meantime of a transition away from them this is part of what we can do to require them to not put out these health-harming pollutants into communities.""

While smog levels across the world have been on the decline since the 1970s last year Los Angeles experienced its worst smog levels in nearly 30 years. Air pollution including that from smog damages the lungs and can trigger asthma attacks heart attacks and strokes. In Southern California more people die from air pollution than traffic deaths and crime-related deaths combined. Friday's ruling which requires roughly 300 pieces of equipment including heaters boilers gas turbines and flares — some more than 50 years old — to be upgraded or modified is projected to help prevent nearly 400 premature deaths and more than 6000 asthma attacks in the region over the next 15 years.

It's bound to have a tremendous impact on the roughly 110000 residents of Carson and Wilmington two communities that constitute the ""fossil fuels capital"" of the Western United States. The communities host six of the 16 facilities impacted by the new rule including five major oil refineries and an asphalt plant.

In total the air district estimates that the rule's public health benefits are worth $3.49 billion over the next 15 years due to fewer residents requiring hospitalization and missing work due to sickness. The board also estimates that the rule will prevent 21400 missed work days due to sickness and that it will also lead to the creation of more than 1800 jobs related to construction and monitoring every year for the next 12 years.

According to May these benefits exemplify how the U.S. can transition away from a dependence on dirty energy. ""We can do this in a reasonable way"" she said. ""While we do a just transition away from fossil fuels we can and have to protect the workers and create new jobs while we phase in clean energy.""

Before Friday the rule sat in limbo since at least 2015 due to heavy opposition from affected companies like Chevron Tesoro Marathon and Phillips 66 — and even internal struggles within the air board. In 2015 the air board originally moved to implement a new smog regulation but it was rejected by a few board members including Los Angeles City councilmember Joe Buscaino in favor of a weaker plan put forth by the oil industry. The dissenting members claimed more time was needed to implement the rule which ultimately ended up becoming rule 1109.1.

Buscaino who voted in favor of 1109.1 this time around said on Friday that his decision-making process ""recognized the fact that refineries have employed [his] friends and family — good union-paying jobs."" Buscaino's district includes Wilmington and the Port of Los Angeles.

Over the last six years industry leaders claimed it was a burdensome task to install new equipment. The air district estimates it will cost the 16 facilities around $2 billion in total to comply — much less than the estimated $3.5 billion worth of public health benefits.

Byron Chan a Southern California attorney with the environmental law firm EarthJustice told Grist that the sticker price of compliance reflects historic inaction on the part of industry. ""They've barely done anything for the past 30 years"" he said. ""It's like if you never went to the dentist and the first time you went to the dentist you were 55 and racked up a super expensive charge — but if you had been going to the dentist every six months for your entire life you wouldn't have had to be put in this situation in the first place.""*

Representatives from Phillips 66 an operator of two major refineries in Los Angeles County declined to respond to Grist's request for comment while Marathon Refinery did not respond at all to Grist's request before publication. According to an analysis by Communities for a Better Environment the Marathon Refineries and Phillips 66 refineries located in Carson and Wilmington are among the facilities that will be most impacted by rule 1109.1. In 2016 Marathon reported releasing 1.6 million pounds of NOx and Phillips 66 reported releasing 1.4 million pounds of NOx.

Many local polluters originally favored a pollution regulation that had been in use since 1993. The Regional Clean Air Incentive Market or RECLAIM program mimicked a cap and trade procedure allowing refineries to pay to pollute. Instead of directly ordering every polluter to install specific clean-air technology the program allowed facilities to purchase credits from other cleaner facilities which in turn allowed them to exceed their permitted emissions. Within a few years of its initial implementation it became cheaper to pay for excess pollution than to lower emissions by installing new equipment. In the end air pollution and smog across the Southern California basin ended up increasing with the implementation of RECLAIM.

The new rule replaces the RECLAIM program but some advocates contend that the air district still favored industry over communities. ""Refineries know that if they push even a little bit that the air district will likely make room for whatever they're arguing"" Chan said. ""Where on the other hand communities are never given the benefit of the doubt.""

During the most recent drafting process for the new rule a Grist analysis of meeting recordings found that the air district met with refinery ownership groups and oil lobbyists nearly five times more often than they met with environmental groups. (The air district did not respond to Grist's request for comment in time for publication.)

Utilizing emails released through the California Public Records Act Grist was able to confirm that representatives from Southern California refineries — specifically the Phillips 66 plants located in Carson and Wilmington — were in constant contact with the air board during the drafting of the regulations over the past year. In one email thread a representative from the air district adopted an informal and light-hearted tone with Phillip 66's lead environmental scientist as they talked about potential substitute compliance plans that would allow the refinery more wiggle room to lower its emissions.

The substitute plans discussed in those emails known as ""I-Plan"" ""B-Cap"" and ""B-Plan"" were ultimately included in the passage of refinery rule 1109.1. The ""B-Cap"" plan institutes a ""mass emission cap"" that will allow refineries to trade emissions within their respective facilities rather than just directly meeting the standards for specific pieces of pollution equipment. In other words if a refinery's flaring emissions are lower than the proposed standards they can use that reduction to excuse their excess emissions from for example a boiler or heater system.

In the end however the rule has met acclaim from both community groups and legislators as a step in the right direction. It offers tangible benefits and strong reduction goals on the heels of another major oil regulation that was just passed in the region: Last month California environmental justice groups rejoiced after Governor Gavin Newsom announced a new ruling that would ban the permitting of oil and gas wells within 3200 feet of community sites such as homes schools and hospitals. The new rule came after years of advocacy and a recent Grist analysis showing the troubling prevalence of oil wells — and the pollution they generate — in California's Black Latino and low-income communities particularly across the Southern California Basin.

""It's a tragedy that these wins didn't happen before"" May said. ""But they're big wins and now we'll be fighting for strong implementation.""

In a Facebook post on Saturday Norton alleged political discrimination and called for persons to boycott the money transfer company.

But the News Room understands that MoneyGram was only following guidelines linked to its global and domestic anti-money laundering obligation. It has always been strict in that regard. It is also common for remittance services to monitor the names of politicians especially those who would be on the radar of the United States (U.S) government.

Some persons from the APNU+AFC coalition of which the PNC/R holds the majority representation were known to have been sanctioned by the U.S government and had their visas revoked over alleged attempts to rig the March 2020 elections.

While names were not publicized it is believed that many high-profile APNU+AFC persons are still under sanctions by the U.S and other governments.

It was only on Friday that Norton disclosed that his campaign was being funded by party comrades both in Guyana and abroad.

Speaking about his experience with MoneyGram where it is suspected that funds were being sent to support his campaign Norton said “I had my own experience with political discrimination at MoneyGram this morning.”

He claimed that when he went to a location and gave the cashier the reference number she immediately told him that his transfer needs to be approved by the company’s headquarters.

“She proceeded to tell me this is so because I am a political figure” he claimed.

Norton believes that his “right” was violated. “No business should discriminate against anyone based on political affiliation” he said.

“I wish to call on Guyanese generally to boycott MoneyGram and signal to them that political discrimination will not be tolerated and that there must be consequences for MoneyGram unacceptable and ludicrous behavior” the politician noted.

It is a common practice for agents at MoneyGram to ask persons receiving or sending monies about their association to persons in the government and politics.

According to the Financial Intelligence Unit Guideline No.3 of 2017 Norton seems to fall into the category of a Politically Exposed Person (PEP); this guideline instructs financial institutions to make this determination when conducting transactions.

Politically Exposed Persons are considered as high-risk customers mainly because of their position of influence.

The aim of this guideline is to assist reporting entities in implementing the obligations of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (as amended) as they relate to the establishment and maintenance of business relationships with PEPs.

A Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is an individual who is or has been entrusted with prominent public functions on behalf of a State including a Head of State or of Government Senior Politicians Senior Government Judicial or Military Officials Senior Executives of State-Owned Corporations important political parties officials including family members or close associates of the politically exposed person whether that person is resident in Guyana.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A nondescript penholder and his two phones are the only visible items.

Soon you’re consumed by his striking presence of mind and positivity.

Kimani took over the reins of this family business from his parents 10 years ago. He was 24. For the last decade he has steered Muthokinju through a glorious period marked by intense market penetration digitisation and expansion with 17 branches in Kenya today.

As an only child he is his parents’ only heir. But also the pivot of the empire as his parents prepare to exit the stage. If Kimani is anxious about the responsibility on his shoulders he does not betray it.

He does admit though that maintaining the reputation that his parents built for more than two decades keeps him awake.

“I took over a business that already had a good name. I give credit to my parents for building goodwill. I’ve been able to amplify their values by playing in a bigger space than they did” he says noting that he has taken after his father.

When Kimani took over in 2011 he initially toyed with the idea of having his imprint on the brand. “I’d even considered changing the name Muthokinju for a ‘cooler’ name or an English one.” But “after a conversation with myself’’ he abandoned the idea. After all his parents had successfully built the brand using the name.

Of the lessons from his parents humility and the need for delayed gratification have been his beacon. “You don’t have to get everything at once. It’s important to use your baby steps and to let things come to you at the right time.”

Any business lessons he has had to discover on his own?

“I’m very agile. We’re leaving in a VUCA (volatile uncertain complex and ambiguous) business world that requires us to have strong values. If you threw me anywhere I’d find a way to adapt.’’

When I ask him what he remembers most about his childhood Kimani shifts in his chair and exhales. “We lived on top of our shop” he says with sentimentality adding that he went to boarding school early.

“During holidays I’d spend most of my time at the shop. My dad and I were very close; I went with him wherever he went.”

This experience he notes shaped his work ethic and identity. “The core values of this business are an extension of [my personality]. But I learn a lot from the organisation as well and from the people I work with.”

Kimani has worked for Muthokinju all his professional life with the only other stint being at a hospital “to complement my school fees and pocket money” as a student at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia.

“My time in Australia where I studied business finance allowed me to see possibilities and to believe in my abilities” he recalls.

The privilege of working parents and a good education —he attended Alliance High School —set him on the path of his future career. Does he imagine that his life would have turned out differently had his parents not been businesspeople?

Kimani hesitates and considers for a few moments. “Yes but only slightly” he admits before going on quickly: “I’m very keen on the local and global stock market and how it works. My dream was to become an investment banker.”

This man whose network spans friends from university business colleagues and mentors believes that at 34 he still has the time to pursue a career in stocks.

Successful family businesses

His day starts at 4 am with prayer and reading. By 6 am he is dropping his children at school. Thereafter he heads to the office where the operations logistics and finance directors brief him on the company’s performance in the market. As the face of the business it is his job to engage stakeholders including suppliers.

The member of Young President’s Organisation (YPO) tells me he is reading ‘The Toyota Way’ by Jeffrey Liker a book on principles/behaviours that define the Toyota Motor Corporation’s managerial approach and production system. He says he is reading for inspiration as he looks to revamp the company’s strategy.

“My biggest challenge is to ensure that our systems and processes are lean. Most of my meetings these days are about strategy and minimising.”

About his empty desk Kimani says the company has digitised most of its operations and hopes to go paperless at the turn of the year.

“I get my reports on my phone which allows me to go through them when I wake up.” Opposite his desk is his wife’s. Sarafina Njatha is the company operations director. She like him comes from a business background. I’m curious about what is it like for a couple to work in the same office. He says their conversations he says oscillate between business personal and family.

“When we’re here I’m her boss. She has KPIs (key performance indicators) that she must meet and report to me” he says hysterically.

Though minimally his parents still retain some control over the company which ‘‘creates good synergy in the way we work.’’ His mother is the marketing director while his father chairs the business. “We live close to each other and see each other almost daily. I always seek their wisdom rather than lead the organisation blindly. They’re very proud of me.”

The subject of the family business in Kenya is one that often elicits misery. Many family empires have collapsed as a consequence of the mismanaged transition from parents to their children greed and sibling rivalry. It’s a pitfall Kimani is conscious about and determined to avoid. He tells me the company has already set out measures to safeguard the business –through a family constitution.

“This document will guide how the family engages with the business. We’re intentional in ensuring that we (family members) engage professionally with it’’ he explains. Moreover the document spells out how his parents will exit the business and how they will be taken care of upon retirement.

In the absence of a family constitution most Kenyan family businesses topple over he argues and notes: ‘‘Successful family businesses in the world such as Disney that has had smooth transitions have a document that guides them especially in resolving disputes.’’

He and Sarafina have three children two sons aged seven and five and a daughter two.

Having been introduced to business at nine by his parents he desires to have his children join the company early.

“They come over every weekend and spend a few hours here or go to one of our branches. This drives something into their subconscious and it gives me pride.”

“The family constitution stipulates how they will come on board. We’ve handed the document over to our human resource manager to formalise it’’ he adds.

“Professionalism is what will save African family businesses.”

Before he retires to bed every night one thought is constantly buzzing in his head: driving his parents’ and his legacy.

“I want to continue building a brand that is known for providing affordable building materials.” Kimani says he feels duty-bound to facilitate “Kenyans’ dream of owning a home.”

Every weekend he cycles for up to 70 km with a group of neighbours. He also played squash before Covid-19 struck.

‘‘As I am growing older I want to be more toned and less muscular’’ is his response to whether he works out although ‘‘I lift dumbbells at home .’’",,,,,,,,,,,,

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

Employees said that the company informed them that they will start charging unvaccinated employees $650 a year beginning in January.

The protesters gathered outside of Progressive Saturday holding signs that read ""Our Constitutional Rights Are Essential and ""My Body My Choice"" among other signage.

""I feel that there are limits that corporations should stop with what they're trying to impose on the people"" said one Progressive employee protesting. ""We should not be penalized because we're choosing to have complete autonomy on our bodies.""

A spokesperson for Progressive released the following statement:

""Our priority has been and continues to be our people’s health and safety from shifting to remote work to providing our people with information and resources to stay healthy. We told our employees some time ago that we would add a bi-weekly surcharge for employees who choose to enroll in our medical plans but choose not to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We knew the surcharge wouldn’t be welcome news for some but we feel strongly it’s the right decision for us to help address the financial risks associated with COVID-19 claims while controlling plan premiums for all Progressive employees

We were aware that a protest against the surcharge was being planned. While we don’t know who sponsored the protest or even if it included any of our employees we respect the right to engage in lawful peaceful and respectful protests.""

No one really likes ads but there is one kind of ad that makes me more mad than anything and that is insurance commercials. I understand the irony of me saying insurance commercials are bad when the point of commercials is to get people to talk about your product but insurance commercials are so bad and have been that way for so long I must address them.

The main reason insurance commercials suck is that they are all the same. They all try to use comedy to make insurance seem a lot more exciting than it is and it worked at first. I remember being a kid and thinking these commercials were funny and good but as I got older I realized how formulaic they were and how they are all kind of the same. None of the commercials really stand out which isn’t good from a marketing stance. You want to be able to stand out so when people are researching insurance brands they’ll remember you but when all the commercials are in the same comedic style it won’t do that.

A big part of these commercials is the mascot for the given brand. The one thing I will give props to is how these companies have created an image for their insurance. For Progressive it’s Flo for Geico it’s the gecko and for Liberty Mutual it’s the buddy cop duo with the emu. They have done a good job with branding these but these characters are insufferable and unfunny.

They also frequently overuse these characters so they just kind of get stale and old. Progressive brought in the character of Flo in 2008 and she has been a consistent mascot and in most of the commercials for 13 years. Even in her case there is only so much you can do with a character like that. Flo can still be the mascot of Progressive but they need to start doing some more commercials and marketing campaigns that are different from the ones they’ve done over the past 13 years.

Another personal reason why I don’t like these commercials is how unfunny they are. I know that comedy is subjective but I really don’t see most of Gen Z finding these funny. This is another issue because when you are selling your product with comedy and people don’t find it funny it’s really hard to sell your product.

The final thing I want to talk about is how hard it is to market to Gen Z. Gen Z grew up constantly being surrounded by ads on the internet. I can really only speak from experience but I feel like I am kind of numb to ads at this point and in commercials if you don’t truthfully tell me why I should buy your product there really isn’t a reason for me to do so. I’m not going to buy insurance because a gecko told me to.

I don’t really know how insurance companies can fix their commercials but I do know they need to change. I don’t really know how much further the comedy can go for these companies. It just feels stale and overused.

Now a first-term senator from Arizona she no longer has such qualms.

Once a self-styled “Prada socialist” labeled as “too extreme” by Arizona’s Democratic Party Sinema has found new power as a centrist in a 50-50 Senate where there are no votes to spare forcing President Joe Biden to downsize his agenda and other Democratic ambitions.

Her outsize authority highlights one senator’s ability to exploit her party’s narrow hold on the chamber and bend the will of the majority. That prowess is also a reason that corporate interests eager to influence Democrats’ now-$1.85 trillion package of social and climate initiatives have rushed to provide her financial support.

Throughout months of exhaustive negotiations Sinema has offered only limited explanation for opposing policies Democrats have campaigned on for years angering many of her colleagues.

But her actions also have won her new allies making Sinema a magnet for campaign donations from powerful interests with millions at stake in how the legislation turns out.

Sinema notably opposed two parts of Biden’s initial proposal that have broad public support: an increase in the tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals and an expansive plan that would have substantially reduced the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients.

The concessions she helped win align with the interests of many of her donors who have made Sinema the Senate’s No. 3 recipient of money — nearly $500000 — this year from the pharmaceutical and financial services sectors according to OpenSecrets a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics.

Sinema’s office declined to make her available for an interview. In a statement her office said she has consistently supported “pro-growth economic policies” and “protecting medical innovation.” They disputed the relevance of comments Sinema made early in her political career in a race she lost.

“Senator Sinema makes decisions based on one consideration: what’s best for Arizona” spokesman John LaBombard said.

Yet her embrace of influential donors she once rejected perplexes many in her party.

“It creates the perception of a conflict of interest and perception of industry groups having influence” said Rep. Ro Khanna D-Calif. who was co-chair of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. “How does she explain the role of all of these contributions?”

A former social worker who served on Ralph Nader’s 2000 Green Party presidential campaign Sinema didn’t seek office as a Democrat until after two unsuccessful Arizona bids as a progressive or independent.

After winning a seats in the Arizona House in 2004 her political persona began to shift. Gradually retooling herself as a moderate Sinema rose through the Legislature’s Democratic minority while positioning herself for higher office as the state transitioned from a Republican stronghold to an electoral battleground.

Since her 2012 election to the U.S. House the candidate who once railed against capitalism’s “Almighty Dollar” has welcomed the contributions of industry groups and corporate political action committees. She’s raised at least $3 million from CEOs businesses executives investors lobbyists and finance sector workers campaign finance records show.

Sinema’s swelling campaign account comes as many in her party have refused such contributions denouncing them as evidence of deep-seated corruption in Washington.

While Sinema is hardly alone in raising money from special interests during a major legislative battle what is notable is the scope of Sinema’s fundraising windfall between April and September. Her objections to Biden’s legislation then gave her massive sway over the future of his bill. The roughly $3 million she collected during that period is the best cash haul of her career outside the 2018 election when she was first on the ballot for U.S. Senate.

But there were signs of her gravitating to business interests earlier.

Last year she helped initiate a bipartisan caucus to raise “awareness of the benefits of personalized medicine” a pricey form of precision treatments for diseases that are hard to cure. Her current opposition to tax increases on corporate and high-earners comes after she voted in 2017 against President Donald Trump’s tax cut legislation which lowered the corporate rate to its current 21 percent while also giving a rebate to high earners.

Among the donors:

—Executives and a PAC for the drugmaker Amgen have given at least $21500 in 2021 making Sinema second only to House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California in receiving contributions from the company this year. Almost all of the Amgen donations were clustered in late June when Democrats were pushing legislation that would have curtailed pharmaceutical company earnings by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. Sinema’s opposition was instrumental in leading lawmakers to pursue a scaled-back version that is now advancing in the House. The new plan would allow Medicare to negotiate the price of about 100 drugs within a few years while limiting monthly insulin copayments to $35 for many.

Company CEO Robert Bradway gave Sinema $5000; two company lobbyists gave an additional $3000.

—Sinema has taken in at least $27000 this year from major drugmakers including Takeda GlaxoSmithKline Genentech and Eli Lilly. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America the preeminent trade organization representing drugmakers has been a major source of funding for a group that is running ads praising Sinema as “independent and effective for Arizona” records show.

—Twelve executives for the investment bank Goldman Sachs have donated $37000 to Sinema since May. That includes Goldman President John Waldron who gave a maximum $5800 donation in August. Sinema’s office said that while she doesn’t support raising corporate taxes she does support establishing a corporate minimum tax so that businesses can’t altogether avoid paying their fair share which is now included in Biden’s plan.

—Executives managers and a corporate PAC for Ryan LLC a global tax consulting firm poured over $72000 into Sinema’s campaign account in late August and September. That made Ryan whose employees and PAC had not previously given to Sinema one of her top corporate donors. The Texas-based company advertises itself as “liberating our clients from the burden of being overtaxed.” In August USA Today reported that the company officials are ensnared in an FBI inquiry over whether they pressured the administration of Gov. Doug Ducey R-Ariz. to issue millions of dollars in tax refunds to a Ryan client.

Checks have also come in from Jimmy Haslam III a longtime Republican donor and owner of the Cleveland Browns and his wife Susan who gave $8700 to Sinema in June and September; Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss twins who run a private equity firm and are perhaps best known for successfully suing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg who each gave $5800 apiece in July; and Stanley Hubbard a billionaire Minnesota TV and radio station mogul who has given millions of dollars to GOP causes who donated $2900 in September.

Sinema has drawn the ire of her colleagues in Congress who say she blocked proposals that almost all Democratic lawmakers support.

“It would be a tragedy for us to not fix the unjust corporate tax system so that corporations and individuals pay their fair share” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who played an major role in negotiating the bill.

Sanders focused on Sinema’s support for the priorities of the pharmaceutical industry.

“It is beyond comprehension that there’s any member of the United States Congress who is not prepared to vote to make sure that we lower prescription drug costs” he said last month. He added that he hoped Sinema “does what the people in Arizona want.”

Some longtime Democratic Party financiers have also grown frustrated with her.

“With all the tension in the party people have long memories” said Michael Smith a donor from Los Angeles whose partner James Costos served as President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Spain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc25sLWFkLWF3YXJkcy1mYWNlYm9vay1hbWF6b24tc2tldGNoLTIwMjEtMTHSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3NubC1hZC1hd2FyZHMtZmFjZWJvb2stYW1hem9uLXNrZXRjaC0yMDIxLTExP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: SNL mocks Facebook Amazon ads in awards sketch,"Jonathan Majors and Heidi Gardner play Jake from State Farm and Flo from Progressive Insurance respectively.

NBC/ YouTube



""Saturday Night Live"" tackled the ad industry's jarring commercials that seem unrelated to the product or service they promote.

Cast members parodied ads like a family drama for Facebook Portal and a testimonial about driving for Amazon.

Facebook and Amazon made up over a third of digital ad revenue in 2021 with the latter focusing in on TV's $70 billion ad market.

""Saturday Night Live"" took a swing at ad culture poking fun at some digital advertisers' commercials.

The late night show's November 13 episode included a sketch depicting a fictional advertising award ceremony dubbed the ""Audacity in Advertising Awards.""

Actor Jonathan Majors and cast member Heidi Gardner playing notable ad characters Jake from State Farm insurance and Flo from Progressive insurance respectively hosted the ceremony celebrating the most ""egregious"" ads of the year.

""The commercials that make us buy make us cry make us shout 'How dare you!' at our TVs"" Majors' Jake from State Farm says in the skit.

The sketch includes ""nominees"" based on real commercials.

Gardner's Flo introduces a video call between a father coming out as gay to his son which leans heavily into the melodrama of the moment only to be abruptly undercut as an ad for Facebook Portal. Another ad unceremoniously introduced by Liberty Mutual's emu and Doug played by Alex Moffatt shows a woman's testimonial about her desire to become a firefighter after a tragic fire accident – only to make a complete 180 turning into an ad for Amazon where she commends the ""flexibility"" of going to firefighter school online while driving for Amazon. The ad parallels a popular Amazon video of a man who used Amazon benefits to become registered nurse.

Facebook and Amazon have not yet responded to Insider's request for comment regarding SNL's sketch or its recent approach toward advertising.

According to data from eMarketer Meta (Facebook's parent company) and Amazon comprised over 35% of digital ad revenue share in 2021 with both company's shares expected to grow over the next two years.

Special to The Journal

As good as it felt to be back in the seats at Trinity Repertory Company for the annual retelling of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” there was a hit-or-miss feel to the production highlighting the risk of tinkering too much with a sure thing.

Directed by Joe Wilson Jr. the production is truly joyful and sure to put even the crankiest in the holiday spirit as it traces the experience of miserly Victorian-era money lender Ebenezer Scrooge who is visited by the spirits of Christmas Past Present and Yet to Come. The Christmas Eve time travel transforms Scrooge from grumpy to giving as he recognizes his blessings and the value of helping others.

Wilson who delivered an endearing Scrooge several years ago is a progressive and daring director as reflected in unique moments he tucked into the 90-minute no-intermission show. He is also lively and believes in the power of music which he liberally spreads throughout the production.

But beginning with an opening monologue — inviting people to remember Native American tribes that once populated the state mentioning slave trade connections and urging support for people of color — there is a layer being added to Dickens’ message of humanity and kindness that feels forced.

When the Ghost of Christmas Past escorts Scrooge to Mr. Fezziwig’s business where he apprenticed as a young man for example Christmas Eve festivities are in full swing colorful and fun. Wilson introduces lively dancing and a funky rendition of “My Favorite Things.”

What proves awkward however is an extended segment in which half the actors dance boisterously stomping feet and banging brooms on the wooden stage while the others mill about watching. While wisely advocating diversity in the show Wilson has created a moment that splits the cast along racial lines with actors of color dancing and white actors looking on. It seems divisive instead of inclusive.

The cast smaller than in previous productions because of COVID is headed by Timothy Crowe a Trinity veteran playing Scrooge for the 14th time. The actors prove nimble enough to tackle multiple roles throughout the show although again the results are mixed.

Rodney Witherspoon II the only actor besides Crowe with just one role is an absolute delight as Bob Cratchit. His comic bumbling is well-played and his dancing lends a more modern flair a la Carlton from 1990s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.” He’s a skilled physical actor a trait Wilson taps liberally and successfully.

Yet the same does not apply to Richard Donelly’s Fezziwig. The character is typically loud and jovial but despite a kooky plaid suit there’s little life — or room to add life — to this character.

Elsewhere Madeleine Barker skillfully transforms washer woman Dilber into many laughable moments while Stephen Thorne’s Ghost of Christmas Present — complete with cartoon-like sound effects and zany moves — is a treat. Ricardo Pitts-Wiley is wonderful as Old Joe the pawnbroker buying items picked from Scrooge’s dead body but his portrayal of Jacob Marley Scrooge’s deceased partner is inconsistent. Wilson employs a flashback to Marley’s death at the beginning of the show and Pitts-Wiley is strong but when using a voice adapter later as Marley’s ghost the effect is distracting instead of eerie.

When a company tackles a show like “A Christmas Carol” year after year the imagination of the director is key to success. Wilson is talented but by mixing in too many new elements and messages many of his ideas prove ineffective. Nevertheless audiences are sure to leave lighter and feeling festive because Dickens’ main message shines through.

“A Christmas Carol” is onstage through Jan. 2 at Trinity Repertory Company 201 Washington St. Providence. There is also a streaming option available from Dec. 6 through Jan.16. For more information go to trinityrep.com."

Such projects on large farms are overseen by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Neighbors argue they have no say in the process but a farmer involved in the project said state-regulated measures mitigate smell and environmental concerns and the undertaking has been signed off on in various ways by state county and local authorities.

The manure storage structures are becoming more common on New York state farms as part of an effort to better manage the environmental impact of waste. Large farms can use them to store waste for longer periods of time and avoid having to spread it on fields at times that could lead to harmful nutrient runoff in watersheds.

But they are also causing tensions in areas where residential neighborhoods are nearby. A waste storage structure built in 2018 in Mentz generated similar concerns from nearby residents.

At an Elbridge Town Board meeting Oct. 28 around 30 people were crowded into a room at the town hall. Resident Tim Burns gave a presentation to the board and the crowd holding up a laptop. Burns said he has property that borders the dairy farm now operating as Half Full Dairy but commonly known as the Hourigan dairy on 878 Gorham Road where the manure storage lagoon is being made. Adding that he doesn't live on that adjacent property Burns said at the meeting that he became aware of the lagoon project only about two weeks prior.

Since then he has learned about manure lagoons and various processes involved. Burns said there are no laws saying he had to be directly informed as an adjacent property owner.

Neighbors have pointed out there are residential properties about a third of a mile away from the lagoon site a village subdivision about a half mile away and an elementary school about three quarters of a miles from it.

""There's no oversight from the town. We have no laws here in our town that suggest that they can interfere with what's happening"" Burns said. ""And for what it's worth these are being built because there are laws that have been put in the books that are forcing farmers to do this for a good reason for environmental reasons.""

DEC's involvement



The DEC press office said in an email to The Citizen that public notices are not required for manure storage construction. Under New York's Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations General Permit which the farm in Elbridge holds farms must inform the DEC of construction of new manure storage with a capacity of 1 million gallons or more.

The DEC said the CAFO permit requires that manure storage be designed and certified to meet the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation service standard. The Elbridge project was funded by a state grant administered through the Onondaga County Soil and Water Conservation District. The DEC also noted that the conservation district notified the town of Elbridge in writing that the project would be happening.

Half Full Dairy informed DEC about the project the agency said. As of Nov. 2 the DEC had last inspected the project on Oct. 27 and added that the project was in compliance with regulations.

""The project ... will enable the farm to comply with manure spreading requirements included in the CAFO general permit"" DEC said. ""The structure will allow the farm to store manure and help avoid land application during weather conditions with high runoff risk.""

When construction work is done the project engineer must certify that the storage structure — an earthen lagoon with an impermeable polyethylene membrane liner a concrete bottom and a leak detection system — meets the federal standards.

The DEC also noted that the Onondaga County SWCD reviewed the design and is overseeing project construction. One of the project features for reducing odors is a fill port that allows manure to enter the bottom of the lagoon.

During Burns' presentation at the Elbridge meeting Oct. 28 he pointed out that the state grant process for the project started in 2017 and he was upset about the fact that neighbors didn't have to be informed of this undertaking near his property.

""We're almost four years into this now and I as a neighbor had no clue this was going to happen or we as a community"" Burns said. ""That might be the law but I don't think the law's right.""

He also said taxpayer money is partially paying for the storage facility and ""we don't have an opportunity to know about that four years in advance.""

During the public comment portion of the meeting the board and members of the public discussed the project for about an hour. Town board member Doug Blumer a dairy farmer himself who had to put in a manure storage facility also answered people's questions about these projects.

People in the crowd expressed concerns about not hearing about the project the potential smell how their property values could be impacted how community members could be informed about future projects and more.

The board mentioned during the meeting that a legal notice was published in the Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper in April asking for bidders for constructing the project which was one of the steps the farm's operator and conservation district pointed to when asked about concerns over lack of notice to neighbors.

Jennifer Schrader one of the people who spoke at the meeting and who has property on Gorham Road said after the meeting that she had concerns about the process.

""The fact that an industrial farm that size can just go in and decide that they're going to do this wherever without considering anyone it's not being a good neighbor"" she said.

After the meeting Vern Richardson Elbridge town supervisor said he didn't become aware of the project going up until September.

A ""significant investment""

AJ Wormuth owner of Half Full Dairy spoke about the project with The Citizen earlier this month. Wormuth said the project is taking place on land owned by Hourigan's Dairy Farm but Half Full is leasing the land has the CAFO permit and owns the cows. He noted Gemini Farms the farm listed on the legal notice is the crop entity owned by the Hourigans.

""That's who made the application for the grant but in the interim then we had bought the cows"" after the grant was received Wormuth said.

When asked if anyone from the Hourigan's reached out to neighbors about the project Wormuth said that wasn't required. In terms of concerns about smell he said the storage is a bottom-fill lagoon which he believes should address smell concerns. That said he said it will smell over certain parts of the year ""when we're agitating it when we're spreading"" the manure but added ""it's going on an existing farmstead so we already smell.""

Wormuth said the project was signed off by various authorities. In addition to the April 6 notice in the Syracuse Post-Standard the Elbridge code enforcement officer Howard Tanner signed a document April 12 that describes the storage facility as a ""six-month capacity rectangular earthen manure storage with concrete floor 430' long by 190' wide"" and said the project doesn't require town or county permits.

The process for the storage facility is heavily regulated Wormuth said with farms subject to financial penalties if they don't follow the specifications of the DEC.

""This is only one part of this process but how we manage the nutrients out of this is highly regulated. This will help us do a better job of being able to protect water quality"" he continued.

Wormuth said the state grant for the project is for around $300000.

In response to a FOIL request to the Onondaga conservation district in regards to what notifications the district sent to the town of Elbridge regarding the storage lagoon Mark Burger executive director of the conservation district provided documents that he said shows the farm has informed local officials about the project four different times since April. Those include the legal notice about the project bids the sign-off by Tanner in April another letter from Tanner to the Hourigan farm dated Oct. 18 in which he refers to a conversation they had that day about the project and a letter dated Oct. 28 that Wormuth sent Richardson describing the project and inviting the town board to see it.

Manure storage strategy

Peter Wright an agricultural engineer with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University spoke about the environmental impacts of these sorts of projects in an interview with The Citizen Nov. 9.

Wright who had been an agricultural engineer with the USDA and worked with Pro-Dairy within the Cornell Cooperative Extension said he had spoken with Wormuth because citizens have been upset about the storage facility in recent weeks and he looked it up on Google Earth but that was the extent of his experience with the project. The facility is ""a tool to help the farm recycle the nutrients (in manure) in a more appropriate way"" he said. He noted that more nutrients put out increases the likelihood of such nutrients getting into ""water systems"" so these endeavors help with water quality.

These facilities are not intended to be landfills where manure sits permanently but are meant to have manure available for spreading into crop fields he said. This reduces farms' need for artificial manure.

Wright said these projects also entail a nutrient management plan ""which tells you based on the nutrients that are in the manure how much you can apply to meet the crop needs without over-applying (manure).""

In addition to the regulations for the facilities and the nutrient management plan Wright said there is an operation and maintenance requirement. If factors such as management and upkeep are not held to DEC standards farms would be in violation of their permits.

As a downside to such projects these facilities in warmer temperatures can create greenhouse gases adding to global warming Wright said.

Overall Wright believes the DEC's regulations are adequate.

(TN Tribune) — U-Haul® will soon serve customers with a new 200-room self-storage facility by renovating the former WASCO masonry warehouse at 1031 Whites Creek Pike in Nashville.

U-Haul Moving & Storage of East Nashville will serve as a replacement to the Company’s store at 241 N. 1st St. that was destroyed by the tornado of March 2020. That store had been operating out of a construction trailer until a new location could be acquired.

There will soon be a temporary showroom at 1031 Whites Creek Pike offering U-Haul trucks trailers and moving supplies. U-Haul is scheduled to take ownership of the 1.83-acre property on Dec 15.

“We have been proudly serving this community for more than 40 years and we’re excited for the chance to do that on Whites Creek Pike” said Jeff Porter U-Haul Company of North Nashville president.

“When Nashville flooded in 2010 we had eight feet of water in our facility. But we reopened in a matter of weeks. In 2020 when the tornado destroyed our store and we were left with a pile of debris we were back open within two weeks. We have to be resilient because we’re in the business of providing essential services and helping our neighbors. I’m excited for that continue at our new East Nashville location.”

While U-Haul Moving & Storage of East Nashville is being renovated other U-Haul stores and neighborhood dealers in the region are available to serve customers. U-Haul Moving & Storage of Nashville at 506 Fesslers Lane is open 7 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday-Thursday and Saturday; 7 a.m.-8 p.m. Friday; and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday.

Once renovations are completed the new store will offer indoor climate-controlled self-storage rooms for rent; a full line of boxes and moving supplies; U-Box® portable storage containers; towing accessories and professional hitch installation; and green programs like Take A Box Leave a Box and a U-Haul Reuse Center – a redistribution area where gently used household items can be donated to neighbors in the community.

“This warehouse dates back to 1986 and is only a mile from our previous store” Porter added. “U-Haul understands that reusing old buildings has a positive impact on the community and is better for the environment. We’re doing our part to alleviate unnecessary waste that is commonly seen with demolition and construction.”

Acquisition of the property was driven by U-Haul Corporate Sustainability initiatives: U-Haul supports infill developments to help local communities lower their carbon footprint. The adaptive reuse of existing buildings reduces the amount of energy and resources required for new-building materials and helps cities reduce their unwanted inventory of unused buildings.

Once U-Haul of East Nashville is fully operational Porter expects to employ at least eight Team Members. U-Haul will seek to hire locally to support job growth within the Nashville community. U-Haul honored as a “Best for Vets 2020” leading veteran-friendly employer by

But unlike most cloud software startups it got there without taking on the bonkers levels of venture capital that has become commonplace in the industry. By the closing bell on Friday Backblaze was trading at $22.04 a share giving it a market cap of $645.18 million.

Between its founding in 2007 and 2020 San Mateo California-based Backblaze raised less than $3 million in outside equity followed by $10 million in convertible notes in August. And regulatory filings show that last year Backblaze booked a net loss of $6.6 million on revenues of $53.78 million — nothing to sneeze at but it only represents a small piece of a market worth tens of billions.

So what's the motivation for Backblaze going public now? ""We're actually hoping this shows that it is possible for companies to successfully become public companies without having to wait as long as some companies are feeling they need to wait today"" Gleb Budman CEO and co-founder of Backblaze told Insider.

For comparison DigitalOcean which offers cloud storage competitive to Backblaze's B2 offering raised $456.4 million before going public earlier this year. Another competitor in the backup and storage space considering an IPO Veeam was funded to the tune of $500 million. And they each far surpassed Backblaze in revenue reporting $318 million and $1 billion last year respectively.

From B2 to IPO

Backblaze sells itself as the affordable cloud storage alternative. Its B2 storage service is comparable to that of cloud giants but is much cheaper. According to Backblaze's website B2 costs $0.005 per gigabyte of storage each month compared to $0.021 with AWS $0.017 with Azure and $0.020 with Google Cloud.

Now fourteen years after its founding Backblaze believes its established the product and cultural foundation to go public partially because of B2. Revenue for the service grew 65% year over year bringing in $14.2 million for the company in 2020.

Backblaze however isn't alone in IPOing with limited funding and revenue. Spanx though in another industry went public just last month without taking a dime in outside funding. And 16 companies valued at $1 billion or more have gone or are expected to go public in 2021 despite having zero revenue marking an all-time high since the dot-com boom. On the flip side other companies like Uber and WeWork which have each raised billions only to struggle to find business models and turn profits have shown that VC dollars don't guarantee a road to success.

Backblaze intentionally sought to avoid VC funding even though it took some over the years according to Budman. The decision was partially a cultural one as Budman thought employees would be more motivated to focus on efficiency and the product. It's hard to do so ""when you're sitting on a large pile of cash on day one"" he said.

Besides making a statement an IPO provides the opportunity to raise additional funds and invest in the company's products and go-to market strategy. But Budman said he hopes going public ""both means a lot and very little"" to its employees. Backblaze offers stock options to all of its 228 full-time employees according to Budman but the company intends to keep the cultural status quo it built.

""What this doesn't change is that we're committed to having a great culture. And what it does is hopefully provide us more opportunity to bring more people in to work with us"" Budman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXJtb250cHVibGljLm9yZy9zaG93L2FsbC10aGluZ3MtZ2FyZGVuaW5nLzIwMjEtMTEtMTQvZGlnLWN1cmUtYW5kLXN0b3JlLXN0ZXAtYnktc3RlcC10aXBzLWZvci1vdmVyLXdpbnRlcmluZy15b3VyLWRhaGxpYS1jYW5uYS1hbmQtZ2xhZGlvbHVzLWJ1bGJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dig cure and store. Step-by-step tips for over-wintering your dahlia canna and gladiolus bulbs,"Statewide gardens have encountered a killing freeze. As you're prepping your gardens and raised beds to overwinter the freeze can serve as a reminder to dig up your flowering bulbs!

Digging curing and storing them now ensures they'll flower for you again next year.

Canna lilies gladiolus and dahlias are subtropical bulbs which means they won't survive the Vermont winter if left in the ground.

Dahlias are the more common bulb that folks in the region plant and grow so we'll learn how to store those bulbs over the winter.

Once frost has killed the dahlia plants in your garden cut the stems off right at ground level then carefully dig up the whole clump of roots and bulbs.

Next wash the bulbs off a bit then find a location with cool temperatures some shade and good airflow where you can place the bulbs so they can hang out for about a week. Leaving them out for a bit helps to toughen up the tubers so they can make it through the winter.

You can divide up the dahlia bulbs now which takes some care or wait till spring to divide them. In spring the eyes that grow off the tubers are easier to see and therefore separating the bulbs then will also be easier.

For now once your dahlia bulbs have rested for about a week in a cool place find some plastic buckets and place dahlia bulbs in the bottom with moistened material on top.

That material can be moistened woodchips bark mulch peat moss or sawdust. Once covered in the buckets leave the bulbs in a cool basement (around 45 degrees) in the dark and leave them for the winter.

Check on the bulbs periodically throughout the winter and note if they begin to dry out and shrivel. If they do mist them a bit with water. Conversely if they are too wet and begin rotting let them dry out.

In spring pull the bulbs from the bucket notice the eyes that have grown on the tubers then divide them plant them and share them with others.

Is it too late to start a home compost operation in November? Should I keep taking my compost to the transfer station and just wait till spring? And I put in some blueberry bushes in October it was warm and they seemed to do well. What can I do to make sure they have a successful winter? - Matt in Winooski

This is a great time to start a compost pile. Choose a box or a tumbler and put down some hardware mesh underneath it. This will help keep mice and rats from getting into your compost. And then start putting your food scraps in there.

The other composting habit to start this time of year is to drop in a handful of organic material each time you put food scraps in.

You can start a stockpile of such materials as hay straw chopped leaves or grass clippings specifically for this purpose.

Then each time you go out to drop food scraps into the compost bin add a handful of this organic material. This ensures your compost doesn't get all slimy and messy.

The compost pile won't decompose much this time of year but it will in the spring. And you'll be keeping all of that material from the landfill.

And about the blueberry bush. If it's a new blueberry bush add some bark mulch around it. And wrap the blueberry bush with some hardware cloth or wire mesh. Rabbits and mice love the young blueberry bush stems and this can help keep the plant intact.

Are there perennials I should not cut back either because it helps the plant by not cutting or or because it provides food for birds and other creatures? I'm thinking about my hydrangea crown thistle yarrow peony and raspberries. - Lesli in Burlington

If you want to be very ecologically minded the new information advises not cutting back any of these perennials in the fall.

The reasoning behind it is this: a lot of beneficial insects are overwintering in the stems and in the debris around these perennials.

Instead once we've got a string of 50-degree days again in spring cut those perennials back and you won't have harmed any of those beneficial insects.

If you do want to clean the perennials up a bit now and prep them to overwinter simply chop them a bit and leave the organic materials on the ground this fall but the later you do this the better.

Next week we'll be talking about feeding the birds and keeping squirrels out of your bird feeders!

This chip will likely be the preferred choice for many 2022 Android flagships. The GPU of Qualcomm Snapdragon 898 is Adreno 730. According to @IceUniverse the GPU performance of Qualcomm Snapdragon 898 is too strong. He claims that the performance and energy efficiency of this chip far exceed expectations.

The GPU level of Qualcomm Snapdragon has always been top of the Android camp. At the start of the 5G era Qualcomm switched to the Andreno 6 series GPU. Currently the strongest Andreano GPU is the Andreno 660 on the Snapdragon 888. The newly upgraded Adreno 660 GPU has a performance increase of up to 35%. This can provide a variable resolution rendering function comparable to that of a PC. It also comes with a 40% reduction in rendering pixels and a 30% increase in game performance. This is not very common for a smartphone GPU.

Today Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 898 integrates Adreno 730 GPU. It is expected that the performance will be greatly improved. Furthermore the game performance is bound to be more eye-catching.

Snapdragon 898 GPU running score lags behind Exynos 2200 & Bionic A15

Recent information shows the GPU running scores of the Snapdragon 898 on GFXBench. The scores of the GPU include 158.4FPS in the Manhattan 3.1 scene 112.7FPS in the Aztec ruins (Normal) and 43.1FPS in the Aztec ruins (High).

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

From the latest exposure the GPU of the Snapdragon 898 is not as good as Apple A15 and Samsung Exynos 2200 engineering models. The Adreno GPU thermal management stability is better and the continuous performance output is better than the first two that is the frequency reduction under high load is not serious. The Exynos 2200 has shrunk by about 25% the Apple A15 has shrunk by 35% and the Snapdragon 898 is currently 20%.

Snapdragon 898 beats Bionic A14 & SD888

Back to the peak performance take Manhattan 3.1 as an example. Apple A14 currently ranks first with 137FPS while Snapdragon 888 only has 117FPS. In other words the initial running score of the Snapdragon 898 GPU suppresses the Bionic A14. Relative to the previous Snapdragon 888 it has an increase of over 35%. In the Aztec Ruins (Normal) Snapdragon 898 is 15% higher than Bionic A14 and 35% higher than Snapdragon 888.

In the GFXBench platform test the average frame rate of the Manhattan 3.1 project for Exynos 2200 GPU is 170.7 fps. Furthermore in the Aztec Ruins test project Exynos 2200 scores were significantly higher than the Bionic A14 processor. This means the chip will have a GPU performance that is comparable to the Bionic A15 and Snapdragon 898. This will be a great feat for Samsung. In time past Samsung’s flagship chip is usually miles behind the competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc25hcGRyYWdvbi12cy1leHlub3MtdnMtbWVkaWF0ZWstdnMtdGVuc29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapdragon vs. Exynos vs. MediaTek vs. Tensor: Does It Matter What Chip Your Phone Has?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vc25hcGRyYWdvbi12cy1leHlub3MtdnMtbWVkaWF0ZWstdnMtdGVuc29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxtYXJ0aW1lcy5uZXQvbmV3cy9zdG9yeS8yMDIxLTExLTEzL2phY29icy1mYW1pbHktdG8tZ2l2ZS1sYS1qb2xsYXMtc2Fsay1pbnN0aXR1dGUtYS1oaXN0b3JpYy0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1naWZ0LWZvci1uZXctc2NpZW5jZS1jZW50ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacobs family to give La Jolla's Salk Institute a historic $100 million gift for new science center,"Irwin Jacobs founding chairman of Qualcomm and his wife Joan are pictured at their home in 2019.

Local philanthropists Irwin and Joan Jacobs whose gifts have profoundly influenced health science and the arts across San Diego County for decades are giving the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla up to $100 million to help build a major science and technology center.

The gift is the largest in the institute’s history and represents the focal point of a $500 million fundraising campaign to expand the campus and deepen research in areas such as cancer plant biology aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

The institute was founded by Dr. Jonas Salk who developed the first successful vaccine to fight polio in the 1950s. It specializes in basic science but has begun to do more to help translate its findings into therapeutic drugs and to work on practical ways to fight climate change such as developing plants that absorb greater amounts of carbon dioxide.

As part of the change the institute has been investing heavily in computational biology a field in which the ever-growing ability to analyze massive data sets enabled scientists to quickly determine the genetic makeup of the various strains of the COVID-19 coronavirus.

The Jacobs gift is timely “because the faculty are working together on larger problems with deep implications” said Salk President Fred “Rusty” Gage who shook science in the 1990s when he discovered that adult humans can generate new brain cells.

His finding helped deepen scientific understanding of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.

The $100 million gift from the Jacobses represents the latest in a long list of donations.

Complete specific figures aren’t available but the couple have now donated upward of $700 million in San Diego County.

They made a splash in 2002 when they donated $100 million to help the San Diego Symphony which was experiencing serious financial problems.

The following year they gave UC San Diego $110 million to support its engineering school helping make it one of the largest programs of its kind in the western United States. Their total contributions to the campus exceed $300 million and helped create Jacobs Medical Center a key piece of UC San Diego Health.

The Jacobses also have a close relationship with the Salk Institute where Irwin 88 has served on the board of trustees since 2004. He became chairman two years later and helped the institute deal with financial challenges during his decade-long tenure. He’s still on the board.

“Joan and I continue to expand our family tradition of supporting effective nonprofit institutions with the potential to positively impact many lives” Irwin Jacobs who co-founded San Diego chipmaker Qualcomm said in a statement.

“We focus on projects that have well-defined goals and good leadership and Salk is exemplary in both ways” he added. “We strongly advocate expanded philanthropy in support of basic science and engineering.”

Under the terms of the new donation the Jacobses will donate $1 for every $2 raised by Salk during a period that will end June 30. The couple will donate up to $100 million.

The institute’s overall fundraising campaign needs to raise at least $250 million to build the Center for Science and Technology a 100000-square-foot building that will be along North Torrey Pines Road on the eastern edge of the Salk campus. Construction could begin late next fall.

An additional $250 million is being sought for a variety of scientific endeavors and to increase the number of active faculty members from 50 to 55.

The Salk Institute has issued conceptual drawings of the new science and technology building. But the project likely is to be watched closely by the architectural community to see if there are significant deviations from the overall look of the institute whose seaside laboratory buildings and travertine marble courtyard are considered to be a masterpiece in design.

Gage said the new center will be composed of teak steel and concrete just like the original buildings and will feature lab space offices and breezy meeting areas.

The center “builds on the legacy of Jonas Salk and will advance scientific discovery at Salk for decades to come” Gage said.

Much is at stake according to Salk plant biologist Joanne Chory who is working on ways to get plants to sequester greater amounts of carbon.

“We’re facing big complex problems because there are so many people living on Earth” Chory said. “Science is going to have to solve them or humans will not inhabit the Earth anymore.” ◆",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbXMtc25hcGRyYWdvbi1kZXZlbG9wZXIta2l0LWZvci0yMTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm's Snapdragon Developer Kit lets you test Windows on ARM apps for $219,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbXMtc25hcGRyYWdvbi1kZXZlbG9wZXIta2l0LWZvci0yMTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8veGlhb21pcGxhbmV0cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsLXZlcnNpb25zLW9mLXRoZS1uZXctcmVkbWktbm90ZS0xMS1zZXJpZXMtaGF2ZS1jb21lLXdpdGgtc25hcGRyYWdvbi1wcm9jZXNzb3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global versions of the new series Redmi Note 11 are expected to come with Snapdragon processors,"Spoločnosť Redmi just recently showed a new series of smartphones Redmi Note 11 for the Chinese market. How did we they informed you these smartphones should also come to the global market. But not in the form they were originally introduced.

In the global market under the leadership of Qualcomm

Original models Redmi Note 11 Pro and Pro+ were introduced in China with MediaTek Dimensity 810 and 920 processors. However due to the global pandemic manufacturers have been struggling for a shortage of chips for a long time.

Xiaomi currently has only a small reserve of MediaTek processors and also needs them to meet demand in its home China. She therefore decided on an alternative.

According to information released by Vietnamese leakster chunvn8888 Xiaomi has decided to deploy Qualcomm processor smartphones in the global market which will be the performance equivalent of MediaTek.

We currently don't know why Redmi decided to change their mind this quickly. Our guess is because of short amount of Dimensity chip stocked in Xiaomi's factory (told ya 2 weeks ago) so Redmi decided to use Snapdragon instead and delay the release https://t.co/SHITT73Atv - Fuck NNN Imma get the vaccine soon (@ chunvn8888) November 11 2021

Series of smartphones Redmi Note 11 reaps success in the homeland. 500 units were sold in the first hour. Also because of this Xiaomi cannot afford to distribute the same smartphones to the global market.

So what Redmi deploy processors?

If we were looking for a Snapdragon alternative to MediaTek processors it would be the cheapest Redmi Notes 11 5G could have a Snapdragon 695 the Note 11 Pro model would be equipped with a Snapdragon 778G Plus processor and the Pro+ variant with a Snapdragon 860 / 870. We wonder what the company Redmi he invents.

The information that the smartphone was also confirmed Redmi Note 11 5G will come to the Indian market under the name Redmi Note 11T 5G. Which is exactly the same model just with a different name.

With the arrival of the series Redmi Note 11 to the global market is therefore not expected until sometime in the first quarter of 2022. We reckoned that Redmi he will want to make it to the Christmas market but the shortage of semiconductors prevents him from doing so.

Since then the journey has seen 19 teams play in multiple home stadiums. Four teams have had two home cities. One home city has had two teams.

In 1992 words were written about Atlanta's $214 million ""world-class state-of-the-art"" Georgia Dome. Twenty-five years later the so-called dump was blown up and new words were written about Atlanta's $1.6 billion ""world-class state-of-the-art"" Mercedes Benz Stadium. Looking forward to what 2042 brings to Atlanta.

SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles will become the 57th NFL venue along this path when the Vikings visit the Chargers on Sunday.

They say the price tag on SoFi is ""about $5 billion."" Or roughly $4.993 billion more than the place where Belichick got the first of his 285 regular-season wins.

After Lexi Thompson’s winning putt skirted the edge it was back to the 18th tee for Sei Young Kim Lydia Ko Rolex Rankings world No. 1 Nelly Korda and Lexi setting the stage for a battle of epic proportions.

Though Korda ended up lifting the trophy after burying a 22ft birdie putt for the win it’s hard to ignore just how good Ko has played of late. It was just seven days ago that the 24-year-old won the Aramco Saudi Ladies International by five shots. Before that it was a T-3 for the Kiwi at the BMW Ladies Championship. Her T-2 finish at the Pelican Women’s Championship rounds out a stellar month of golf for Ko and sets her up nicely ahead of the CME Group Tour Championship.

“I played really solid this week” she said after rounds of 67-66-64-66. “I think my ball-striking overall was really good. I felt like I left a lot of putts out there. But this is a really tricky golf course especially on the greens. I feel like a lot of the distance putts that normally you would think are pretty good birdie range you're looking at it double looking at it again and again. It's hard. You've got three- four-footers and playing like a cup of break and still misses low. Overall I played solid. Hopefully I will be able to keep the positives from this week going into next week. Hope for a few more putts to drop.”

As Ko looks ahead to Tiburón Golf Club her confidence can’t help but be bolstered by her performances over the last couple of weeks. Sitting at third in the Race to the CME Globe the New Zealander has as good a chance as anyone to take home the title maybe even more so after the tear she’s been on as of late.

“Tiburon I think is a golf course where you can go low but at the same time it can get away from you as well” Ko said of next week’s event. “The weather looked pretty similar to this week so that's nice there is not a huge change in temperature. Other than that just going to enjoy it and see what the week ahead is going to be like. Tiburon there are some holes that you need to be pretty accurate off the tee. Then the greens are pretty big. Probably the most similarity is just the grass being Bermuda the run-off areas. In the past I felt like your short game needed to be really on at Tiburon so hopefully that will be the case for next week. I think when you kind of get into tournament mode the week goes by pretty quick. It's only four more competitive rounds until the season is over. Hopefully I'll be able to finish off in a solid way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZwdW5raHEuY29tL2xwZ2EtdG91ci9hcnRpY2xlcy90aG9tcHNvbi1hbmQta3VwY2hvLXNoYXJlLWxlYWQtaW4tZmxvcmlkYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thompson and Kupcho share lead in Florida,"Lexi Thompson acknowledges the crowd on the 18th

Jennifer Kupcho shares the lead

This slow play drives you mad!

Lexi Thompson headed back to the clubhouse at Pelican Golf Club with friend Angel Yin’s arm around her shoulders the two laughing and sharing stories from their second round of the Pelican Women’s Championship presented by Konica Minolta and Raymond James. It was that type of afternoon where smiles won the day for Thompson who shares the 36-hole lead with Jennifer Kupcho at eleven-under par.“I think overall just going out there and enjoying myself making sure I stay in the moment committing to my golf shots” Thompson said after a six-under 64 on Friday.“I have been working extremely hard on and off the course. Working with Martin Hall quite a bit putting the work to the test and believing in it.”Kupcho fired a bogey-free 64 as a part of the morning wave and is now unblemished over her last 28 holes. It is the second time in her career—and this season—that Kupcho has held or shared the lead through two rounds most recently at the Drive On Championship presented by Volvik in March.The Wake Forest University alumna pointed to the fact she has kept her mind off golf when not in the midst of a tournament and reminiscing on the Solheim Cup as reasons for her success in Belleair Fla.“I think I’ve been distracted from golf ever since Solheim [Cup] moving into a house and trying to plan a wedding” said Kupcho. “It was probably my best ball-striking week [at Solheim Cup] that I’ve ever had in my life so definitely gave me confidence.“On the flight here I was bored and started looking through photographs. Of course [Solheim Cup] was probably the nearest memory recently. Brings back good memories.”Rounding out the final grouping of the third round off No. 1 tee at 11:15 a.m. ET tomorrow is Wei-Ling Hsu a Rolex First-Time Winner at the Pure Silk Championship presented by Visit Williamsburg. She discussed her game especially the irons relative to her victory in May and a new club in the arsenal.“These two days I have really hit my irons so well it was so solid. Every ball just right at the pin. I feel it’s even better [than my win]” said Hsu who is one shot back of the lead at -10 following a bogey-free 64. “Especially my drives are really good this week. I took out the TaylorMade SIM and now [playing] with a PING G425. Hit some bombs from the tee to give me shorter irons like 8- 9-iron into the green.”Leona Maguire (68) the 18-hole leader joins Hsu in a share of third while five players sit in a tie for fifth at nine-under overall. Among that group is Mi Hyang Lee (62) who matched the tournament scoring record on Friday that was set by Maguire yesterday.Tampa resident Brittany Altomare (69) finds herself in a tie for 29th at -4 and St. Petersburg native Brittany Lincicome shot even-par 70 for a share of 46th at two-under.

Patrick Mahomes KC’s $500-million man hasn’t had his troops clicking all season. They aren’t playing like the team that has reached the last two Super Bowls nor are they putting up Fantasy Football-like numbers. Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy was candid when asked what he thought the team’s issues were.

Eric Bieniemy has been highly regarded as a head coaching hopeful

The success of the Chiefs’ offense the last two seasons vaulted Bieniemy to the top of the list of head coaching candidates yet he’s never been named one. While his team prepped for last year’s Super Bowl against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Bieniemy was pressed on why he believed he’s been overlooked as a head coach.

“The only thing I can do is be my most authentic self that’s who I am OK? I can only be me” Bieniemy said per The Sporting News. “Some team has to want me. On top of that there has to be some kind of collaboration making sure the chemistry is a fit. So for whatever reason that chemistry has not been a fit there has not been that opportunity to connect. But that’s OK.”

Bieniemy has always had the backing of his players and coaches.

“(Bieniemy’s) track record speaks for itself” Mahomes said. “The type of man he is the way he can control and be a leader of the locker room and the way that he coaches and schemes he brings to us. If he doesn’t (get a position as a head coach) people are crazy.”

Chiefs head coach Andy Reid feels the same way.

“I did have the opportunity to talk to a lot of either owners or general managers that worked to interview him presidents and so on” Reid said during Super Bowl week. “So I’ll be curious to hear their comments about how he did or why he wasn’t picked.”

In recent years the Chiefs could put up points in the blink of an eye. Loaded with offensive weapons including tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Tyreek Hill to complement Mahomes putting up points was never an issue. This year it’s a problem.

Entering Week 10 the Chiefs are 5-4 and are only the seventh-highest-scoring team in the AFC. Their point differential this year is minus-6. Bieniemy believes the Chiefs are their own worst enemy.

“We just need to keep playing” he said according to ArrowheadPride.com. “I know that sounds just like coaching talk. We just need to continue to play. And on top of that we just need to continue to execute. For whatever reason we’re having a breakdown here and there – and it’s not just one particular position.

“It can be a penalty or it can be a lack of route depth. It can be a poor decision made by the quarterback as far as reads are concerned. It can be a bad read by the running back. So we’re all in this together. When it’s all said and done — like I tell our guys each and every week — ‘Let’s line up and play against the opponent.’

“Because the Chiefs right now are kicking the Chiefs’ ass. Let’s go out and play against the opponent give ourselves an opportunity and then let’s see what happens.”

Bieniemy isn’t blaming Patrick Mahomes for the offensive woes

According to Bieniemy the Chiefs’ struggles go well beyond Mahomes. Although the quarterback hasn’t put up Mahomes-like numbers so far this year things can’t be pinned solely on him. He doesn’t believe Mahomes is pressing and trying to do too much on his own.

“I think that goes around the whole entire offense” Bieniemy said. “When you feel that you’re not executing everybody wants to try and do something a little bit extra to try and make something happen. That’s not how it works. Yes I do want them straining to finish. But I don’t need them trying to be Superman. I don’t need them trying to be any hero.

“Just go out and be who you are. Do your job and execute with great attention to details. And if each and every individual can do that we’re giving ourselves a chance to have a chance.”

Bieniemy also said he doesn’t see any lack of confidence with his players.

“I have not seen any lack of confidence” he said. “And one thing that we know is that these are the highs and lows that you go through throughout the season. One thing we always want our guys to do is remain confident to remain strong and always understand that — regardless of what took place — the only thing that matters is how you play the next play.”

The Chiefs are still dangerous. They still have the weapons and things could get ugly for the rest of the AFC when everything starts clicking in Kansas City.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxwZ2EuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9wYXR0eS10YXZhdGFuYWtpdC10cnlpbmctdG8ta2VlcC1pdC1saWdodC13aGlsZS1pbi1jb250ZW50aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patty Tavatanakit Trying to Keep it Light While in Contention,"Rarely do you get a second chance to make a first impression. But Patty Tavatanakit a member of the 2020 rookie class that got another shot at their fledgling season is doing just that. Last year was tough for the former UCLA Bruin with seven missed cuts and just a single top-10 finish. But she’s entirely flipped the script in 2021 nabbing her first LPGA Tour victory and major title at the Chevron Championship in April and carding nine top-10 finishes so far this season. Following the BMW Championship Tavatanakit locked up the Louise Suggs Rolex Rookie of the Year award beating out Solheim Cup hero Leona Maguire for the title.

At this week’s Pelican Women’s Championship presented by Konica Minolta and Raymond James the 22-year-old Thai continues to prove she belongs shooting a third-round 64 to sit three back after Saturday.

“I started off really strong” she said of her third-round effort. “Made some putts. Hit a bunch of good shots. Putts dropped and just got my momentum going there. I'm pretty comfortable with my stroke and where I started. I have been giving it really good reads and it's one of those weeks where you can just read the greens.”

Heading into Sunday at Pelican Golf Club with more stellar golf from the world’s best on tap Patty is primed to once again make her presence felt not to be counted out at 13 under. While she’s had her mind on lighter fare this week and is much more concerned with getting to the end of the season than winning you can be sure that if blood hits the water Tavatanakit will be ready to strike adding to her impressive 2021 campaign. Though she’s exceeded all her plans in a short period of time a win is a win and would add an exclamation point to the Rookie of the Year honor.

“It's just my first year. I got Rookie of the Year. I don't want to put myself in a stressful situation. I just want to go out there and enjoy. It's been light and I want to keep it light. I don't want to think about winning tomorrow because if it were to be mine it will be mine tomorrow if I can hole putts hit good shots and execute. If not I'll just go out there and just finish another round and be one step closer to the off-season. I'm a little bit comfortable out here not worrying too much about making cuts or making money. I do know that I have the potential to be out there and to be great out here.

“But to succeed this fast this is not even what I can see myself in a couple of years down the road. It's been a blast to have the opportunity to be in contention just keep playing well.”"

Back in April we reported that Colorful is reviving its sub-brand known as ColorFire after the company quietly introduced its first NVIDIA GTX 16 models. Nearly half a year later the company finally launches RTX 30 graphics cards as well.

Some of our readers may still remember ColorFire as a brand associated with Radeon graphics cards and there is nothing wrong with this fact except the manufacturer did actually ax the series after it decided to focus on GeForce cards exclusively. But Colorful was not yet ready to completely abandon the brand. Eventually the company introduced NVIDIA Turing cards with the ColorFire logo and now launches NVIDIA Ampere cards with the same stickers it does not seem however that ColorFire will make a return with AMD RDNA2 GPUs any time soon.

ColorFire RTX 30 cards are based on RTX 3060 series: RTX 3060 12GB and RTX 3060 Ti 8GB specifically. They will be available with two cooling options either with a pink dual-fan (Vitality series) cooler or a triple-fan solution in mint (Cool Mint series). The 3060 Ti and non-Ti share the same cooling design as GA106 and GA104 GPUs are pin-compatible hence the manufacturer did not need to make special customizations for each card.

As per ColorFire’s website these cards are supposed to be factory-overclocked (labeled as OC) but neither is listed with non-reference clocks. We believe this is simply a mistake as the company often launches OC and non-OC models separately. Either way there is nothing particularly interesting about these cards except for their color: everything bar the black PCB is either pink or blue. The bad (or depending on your taste – good) news is that the ColorFire Vitality and Cool Mint series will not be sold outside China.

VideoCardz discovered that the brand has recently launched custom variants of the GeForce RTX 3060 and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti under the brand's Vitality and Cool Mint series.

Consumers that want a compact graphics card will probably like the Vitality models that feature a dual-fan cooler. Those who have the luxury of more case room may opt for the Cool Mint versions with a more robust triple-fan cooling systsem. While the graphics cards lack the glitz they do come with unique colors such as pastel pink or mint.

Colorful utilizes the same design for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards regardless of the series. Both the Vitality and Cool Mint series come with a matching backplate with a bit of marketing.

The graphics cards from the Vitality and Cool Mint lineup are based on Nvidia's Lite Hash Rate (LHR) silicon that comes with a limiter for Ethereum mining. The GeForce RTX 3060 LHR and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti LHR from Colorful are based on the GA106-302 and GA104-202 dies.

Colorful's Ampere graphics cards adhere to the reference specifications from Nvidia. The GeForce RTX 3060 LHR 12GB Vitality L and GeForce RTX 3060 LHR 12GB Cool Mint sport a 1320 MHz base clock and 1777 MHz boost clock. On the contrary the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti LHR 8GB Vitality and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti LHR 8GB Cool Mint have a 1410 MHz base clock and 1665 MHz boost clock.

The pricing and availability for the Vitality and Cool Mint series are unknown.

They have filed a lawsuit against Mr. Wright in Florida to prove the collective is behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto that allegedly has access to the bitcoins in question now worth north of US$60 billion.

Thanks to the Ira Kleiman vs. Craig Wright civil trial currently underway in Florida we may finally learn who created the most popular cryptocurrency protocol. A person (or several people) dubbed Satoshi Nakamoto has long been named the inventor of Bitcoin. The problem is that nobody knows who exactly is hiding under the Satoshi pseudonym; as anything crypto-related the topic has been rife with speculation and plot twists. Filed by the heirs of one deceased David Kleiman who they claim aided in inventing the Bitcoin protocol with the defendant Craig Wright the lawsuit aims to prove that Satoshi Nakamoto is a collective of Mr. Kleiman and Mr. Wright.

On Oct. 31 2008 somebody using that name sent a nine-page paper to a group of cryptographers explaining a system of “electronic cash” that allowed people to exchange value without the need for a bank or other party. A few months later the bitcoin network went live and Nakamoto collected one million bitcoins in its first year. It was earlier in 2008 that the family of Mr. Kleiman claims his business partner Mr. Wright asked for Mr. Kleiman’s help in what would become that nine-page paper. They collaborated on the white paper and launched bitcoin together the suit alleges.

That million of bitcoins is worth more than US$60 billion at the current price of the cryptocurrency explaining the ""Bitcoin Trial of the Century"" moniker. The descendants of Mr. Kleiman argue that they are entitled to half of what has now become one of the most significant private fortunes yet Mr. Wright has been claiming he is the sole inventor of Bitcoin for a while. Some crypto analysts believe it was Mr. Kleiman who possessed the technical knowledge to invent the Bitcoin ledger; others argue that Mr. Wright an Australian programmer living in London has been perfectly capable of doing it all by himself.

Depending on whether someone gets forced to prove access to Satoshi Nakamoto's account by the court proceedings the lawsuit may finally settle the pressing question and confirm for us mere spectators who created Bitcoin.

Several were already having attendance and financial difficulties before the pandemic struck in early 2020.

A study released by Lifeway Research of 34 Protestant denominations and groups across the U.S. revealed that 4500 churches closed in 2019 — the year before the coronavirus spread globally.

In Bartholomew County one of the latest houses of worship to announce an upcoming closing is the 114-year-old Grammer Presbyterian Church 5333 S. County Road 1000E.

When the Rev. Amy Artis began preaching at the Rockcreek Township church in June 2019 the services were attracting eight to 10 congregation members each week she said.

“With that few it is hard to sustain a church” Artis said. “The congregation has talked about closing it for years but it wasn’t an easy decision.”

Choices became clearer after one of the church’s most prominent members Martha Ann Jaquess died on Nov. 25 2000 Artis said. Another prominent leader had to give up his responsibilities after he was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia she added.

“We did the best we could” Artis said. “But I think that not being able to meet together to be involved in a mission together and to not be in fellowship together has really hurt a lot of churches.”

One effort to hold the church together involved staging parking lot services with the services broadcast through an FM radio station the pastor said.

But after the church reopened to conventional services earlier this year Artis said the congregation had dwindled down to about three. She added the vote to close the church was taken in September.

So the Grammer Presbyterian Church — organized by the town’s women and the former Donaldson Presbyterian Church on Jan. 11 1907 — will conduct its final service on Sunday at 10:45 a.m.

“You wonder and ask yourself what you could have done differently” said church elder Doug Denny. “In our monetary donations you give what you can and you try to be faithful in that. But you are still limited by the financial obligations you have in your home life.”

In regard to why so many small churches are closing Artis said there isn’t just one reason. For example she recalled when there were both local schools and churches in small towns which gave rural residents a sense of community.

“When the local schools closed or consolidated that became the downfall of small rural communities” Artis said. “No longer was there a basis for a loyalty to the community.”

Another problem was that more families became willing to drive several miles to a church that they felt best suited their needs instead of staying with the church near home that depended on their local support Artis said.

Lifestyles have also changed the minister said. For example there’s shorter-attention spans brought on many causes that include on-demand programs satellite channels 24-hour sports channels and podcasts. As a result many people expect to be entertained when they come to church Artis said.

“I think a lot of people are looking for a lot of bells and whistles” Denny said. “They want the ‘Church Spectacular’.”

From the minister’s perspective church services are intended to make congregation members think about how biblical teachings apply to them here and now so they can become a living witness for Christ and God in their communities.

Denny said that when he began attending Grammer Presbyterian regularly about 35 years ago he heard a message every Sunday that touched his life in some way.

“I really can’t explain it but it was always about something that had either just occurred in my life or was about to occur” he said.

Artis also expressed regret that politics has become intertwined with religion which has often been described as a source of division among many people.

But one of the most significant reasons for declining congregations is the failure of churches to meet real-life needs in their communities. At the Scipio United Presbyterian Church where Artis also delivers sermons she has seen the small congregation help an individual family with little income at Christmas and Easter assist seniors at Jennings County High Schools during the pandemic provide for elderly shut-ins collect Christmas gifts for children and raise an average of $1000 a month to finance projects in their community.

“While we’re not growing in numbers (at Scipio Presbyterian) we are growing in understanding of what it means to be a church” she said.

Although nobody likes to see a house of worship close churches have life cycles like everything else Artis said. And sometime those life cycles result in churches reinventing themselves.

The same study that counted 4500 church closings also found 3000 new congregations were created the same year.

“But that word ‘change’ is not one humans like to hear” the pastor said. “I’ve told many churches: You can either be an instigator of the change a responder of the change or an ignorer of the change. But change is going to happen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ja2VuemllYmFubmVyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL3JlZGlzdHJpY3RpbmctYXBwcm92ZWQtYnktY291bnR5LDExNzUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Redistricting Approved by County,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://www.mckenziebanner.com/stories/redistricting-approved-by-county,11752 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ja2VuemllYmFubmVyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL3JlZGlzdHJpY3RpbmctYXBwcm92ZWQtYnktY291bnR5LDExNzUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pdGNoZWxscmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGhlb2RvcmUtaG9mZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Theodore Hofer,"Theodore J Hofer 95 of Bridgewater passed away Wednesday at the Tieszen Memorial Home in Marion.

It is also a sign of Poland’s support for building a sovereign open and stable Belarusian state guided by democratic principles. This year’s Festival had a special meaning. It was held against the backdrop of public protests which swept Belarus after the 2020 presidential election and amid an escalating border conflict between Poland and Belarus.

The three-day event attracted both cinema lovers and all those interested in Belarus. The programme featured among others Andrei Kutsila’s When Flowers Are Not Silent a film awarded at the IDFA festival in 2018. It tells the story of Belarusian women and their families who take part in the protests. Dzmitry Dziadok one of the greatest hopes of the Belarusian New Wave showed two short movies: Honest Look and Dima. Also presented was the film Belarus. The Beginning which depicts Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya’s road into politics.

Performances by NAKA and the Free Choir were the highlight of the Festival. NAKA has for several years been the leading group of the Belarusian independent stage. It was founded by Anastasia Shpakouskaya an actress of the National Drama Theater in Minsk. The artist performed her works in a duet with Alexey Vorsoba one of Belarus’s most talented accordionist. The Free Choir is a cultural phenomenon born during the protests of 2020. Performing Belarusian songs and hymns the Choir quickly fell in disfavour with the regime which banned it and arrested some of its members. Forced to leave its country the Choir found home in Warsaw where it continues to perform and support the Belarusian cause.

BULBAMOVIE is the Warsaw-based Belarusian Film Festival which was set up in 2011 after the violently suppressed protest in the wake of the 2010 election. Apart from promoting Belarusian cinematography its goal is to support young Belarusian filmmakers who cannot present their works in Belarus.

After the official part the artistic program was presented - a Polish musician Zbigniew Irzeński who lives in Cyprus played patriotic songs on the accordion and the local folk group ""Ktima"" performed traditional Cypriot dances. The guests could also visit the exhibition ""Fathers of Independence"" prepared by the Institute of National Remembrance. An important element of the ceremony was the presentation of the ""Bene Merito"" honorary distinction to the Mayor of Paphos Mr Phedon Phedonos in recognition of his contribution to the development of Polish-Cypriot relations. On behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs distinction was presented by the Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to the Republic of Cyprus Mrs Irena Lichnerowicz-Augustyn.

Paphos situated in the south-western part of Cyprus plays a special role in the Polish-Cypriot relations due to the continuous lasting more than half of the century presence of Polish archaeological missions in this area. The Polish scientists had a significant contribution that Paphos was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Their excavations not only provided us with a knowledge about ancient culture art and history of Cyprus and the entire Mediterranean world but also had positive impact on the development of the city constituting one of the greatest tourist attractions of the Island. Also Polish tourists arriving numerously to Paphos every year have a chance to find out its beauty and uniqueness.

Thank you again for accepting our invitation and being with us to celebrate together the Polish Independence Day!"

RHI,Robert Half,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJtdXNlbnRyeW1lZGlhLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY29sb25pYWxzLWZhbGwtYXQtbW9ubW91dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawks Soar Over Colonials 44-7,"WEST LONG BRANCH N.J.– In the penultimate football game of the season the Robert Morris Colonials (3-6 2-4 Big South) were defeated by former NEC and current Big South rival the Monmouth Hawks (7-3 6-0) by the score of 44-7.

The Colonials started the game on defense and forced a three-and-out on the initial drive emphatically.

Nevertheless when the Robert Morris offense got a hold of the ball rushes from Alijah Jackson and reception by D’Andre Hicks led to an 18-yard George Martin touchdown pass to Demonte Martin. After a Bisceglia PAT the Colonials took an early 7-0 lead.

After the kickoff led to a touchback Monmouth regained possession. On the first play of the drive Hawks’ running back Jaden Shirden weaved in-between Colonials defenders for a 75-yard touchdown run. After a successful Monmouth PAT by Nick Null Monmouth tied the game 7-7.

Even though Martin completed a beautiful first-play screen pass to Alijah Jackson for the first down the Colonials’ offense stalled out and they were forced to punt.

Michael Benson’s punt pinned the Monmouth Hawks within their red zone. The Monmouth offense seamlessly copied the Colonials’ prior offensive drive. After one first down the RMU defense shut down the Hawks’ offense capping it off with a Ricardo Watson sack on third down.

After a Hawks punt and an offensive three-and-out for RMU the Monmouth offense was marching down the field on their next possession. A pass from Monmouth’s Tony Muskett was completed to Ezrah Archie for a gain of 35 yards which sparked the Hawks’ drive.

A few plays later Muskett lobbed another beautiful pass to Zach Tredway for a 19-yard touchdown reception. After another successful Null PAT Monmouth took a 14-7 lead over the Colonials.

At the start of the second quarter the Monmouth offense marched their way down the field with runs from Owen Wright and dual-threat QB Tony Muskett. After a nearly seven-minute drive by the Hawks’ offense Muskett completed a 9-yard pass to Gene Scott for the Monmouth touchdown to put the Hawks up 21-7 over the Colonials.

After the Hawks’ kickoff the Colonials’ offense looked to regain the magic of their first drive but unfortunately reckless penalties negated all of RMU’s offense leading to another punt by the Colonials.

After the punt the Monmouth Hawks’ offense continued to have their way with the Colonials’ defense as a methodical drive was capped off by a 30-yard sideline completion by Tony Muskett to Ezrah Archie for another Hawks’ touchdown. The Hawks took a commanding 28-7 lead with three minutes left in the half.

The Hawks’ offense did not ease up on the RMU defense before halftime following the Colonials’ third three-and-out of the half. Two big rushes from Owen Wright and a 49-yard completion from Muskett to Lonnie Moore IV led to yet another Monmouth score; a 14-yard touchdown pass from Muskett to Terrance Greene Jr. gave the Hawks a 35-7 lead with just over 90 seconds remaining.

Shortly thereafter with less than one minute left in the half George Martin threw an interception to Monmouth cornerback Mike Reid.

On the succeeding Monmouth drive and following sacks from Supilani Mailei and Ricardo Watson Monmouth killed the remaining time on the clock. This allowed for Nick Null to attempt and make a field goal to give Monmouth a 38-7 lead headed into halftime.

Due to the nearly one-hour long halftime the third and fourth quarters were shortened into 12-minute quarters instead of the usual 15-minute quarters with no media timeouts.

Following a long halftime break due to lightning in the area Robert Morris was set to receive after winning the opening coin toss and deferring to the second half. However it wouldn’t go their way as the Monmouth defense forced their fourth three-and-out of the game.

A Colonials punt gave the Hawks offense their first possession of the second half; Robert Morris’ defense stopped the Hawks’ first-half momentum causing fourth down. Even with the fourth down Monmouth decided to go for it on fourth but the Colonials defense forced a turnover on downs.

The Colonials’ offense marched on the field in need of points but the Hawks’ defense held it down and forced a turnover on downs against RMU. The end of the third quarter held the same score; Monmouth led Robert Morris 38-7.

At the start of the fourth quarter the Monmouth offense attempted to run out as much clock as possible by continuously running the ball. However the Colonials defense struggled to contain the Hawks’ run game as the Monmouth offense drove down the field.

Rushes from Jaden Shirden and Owen Wright allowed Monmouth to kill nearly the entirety of the fourth quarter. With 21 seconds left Austin Castorina added insult to injury as he rushed for a 5-yard touchdown extending Monmouth’s lead to 44-7.

After the ensuing kickoff the Colonials offense handed the ball off to Alijah Jackson to run out the remaining time. The final score was Monmouth 44- RMU 7.

The win over the Colonials gives Monmouth an 11-10 series lead between the former NEC and current Big South rivals.

Next weekend the Colonials will close out their season at Joe Walton Stadium when they host the Campbell Camels (3-7 2-4).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xNC93aGF0LWRvZXMtYnVybm91dC1mZWVsLWxpa2Utc3ltcHRvbXMtd29yay1zdHJlc3MtZ3JlYXQtcmVzaWduYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burnout at work: The 5 most common warning signs,"Ruth Pearce spent months in a windowless room working 60 to 80 hours a week with late night and early-morning meetings to finish a global financial project with too few resources. Over the course of three years the North Carolina project manager seldom ventured outside stopped exercising ate on the run and at night was left with such little energy that she’d drink to relieve stress and watch TV. When a colleague hung a picture of a beautiful beach on the office wall and her husband begged her to quit she knew she had officially hit burnout. “I had no energy” she said. “It was killing me.”

Five years later Pearce counsels other people facing chronic work stress as a professional coach at Project Motivator and consistently tells people to listen to themselves before crashing and burning. “I didn’t see the early signs of burnout until the words ‘project manager’ turned my stomach. It took six months before I could do any kind of work again” she said. “I should have seen the signs and spoken up earlier.”

If you feel like you’re banging your head against a wall at work you’re not alone. The pandemic has ushered in a whole new level of exhaustion among today’s workers. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic nearly 70% of workers who transitioned to remote work said they worked weekends last year—with 45% working more during the week than they did before according to a 2020 survey of 2800 workers by Los Angeles-based staffing firm Robert Half. More parents juggle childcare responsibilities too. In response millions of people have quit their jobs in what’s been dubbed the Great Resignation. That has contributed to a labor shortage of 11 million jobs which has left the workers who remain juggling even more work especially in industries like hospitality and retail. Burnout is on the rise: More than half of workers say they’re experiencing burnout up from 43% last year and 80% of them say the pandemic has taken a toll according to a 2021 survey by job site Indeed.

“Not only does ignoring this pervasive and rapidly evolving problem claim too many financial costs but the human costs are simply unacceptable” says Jennifer Moss author of the forthcoming book The Burnout Epidemic. If the burnout gets bad enough people may quit their jobs or leave work for long periods of time or they may need pharmacological treatments or cognitive therapy. In some cases hitting that place can be catastrophic in terms of workplace violence suicide or fatal workplace errors especially in the medical profession. Moss said while recognizing the symptoms is key it’s vital for the culture of an organization and leadership to create true change to avoid employee burnout.

So how do you recognize when chronic stress will make you hit a wall?

1. You feel disconnected from your job and other interests.

Count how many times each week you’re asking yourself after endless Zoom meetings ‘Why am I even doing this?” If you’re someone who is typically engaged or enthusiastic about work and more and more you’re not and or if you’re suddenly disengaged and it lasts for a week to 10 days then pay close attention says Pearce. That emotional distance from your job may be misdiagnosed as lack of productivity but it’s a sign of stress. You may also feel isolated or lose interest in activities outside of work. “It’s that feeling like everyone else is firing on all cylinders and you’re stuck in quicksand” Pearce said.

2. You stopped your routines.

Perhaps you once stuck to a healthy daily routine whether it was a 10-minute meditation eating a healthy diet or exercising every morning—but now because of work you don’t. The long hours may have at first appeared to be acute or short-term but now as the pandemic stretches on people have grown more accustomed to working 12-hour days in pajamas and answering emails before putting their kids to bed said Moss. As boundaries between home and work blend people don’t always know how to stop working. For some the thoughts and worries about work begin to interrupt their sleep too. Sticking to a healthy routine said Moss is critical to preventing burnout.

3. You’ve become far more cynical and hopeless.

If you get to a place where you feel as if there is nothing you can do to make your job better and that it’s never going to change that’s a big warning sign said Moss. You may be consumed with what is wrong with your career whether it’s your colleagues your boss the workload or how work is being done said Pearce. You may be more irritable and short-tempered with colleagues friends or family. “I myself became obsessed about annoying things at work instead of focusing on what I could do differently” said Pearce. “I felt stuck.”

4. You’ve got brain fog.

That dull fuzzy feeling in your head? It’s a symptom of chronic stress which leads to burnout. You may be making errors forgetting words missing appointments or taking longer to get back to colleagues or clients. It may feel like a herculean challenge just to make simple decisions and your house may feel messier than normal. “Feeling muddled: that’s the number one trigger for me. It’s when I’m not paying attention when I’m driving or I’m losing my keys” says Rick Grimaldi a workplace attorney at Fisher & Phillips in Philadelphia and author of Flex: A Leader’s Guide to Staying Nimble and Managing Transformative Change in the American Workplace.

5. You’re physically and emotionally exhausted.

Chronic stress leads to burnout and for some there is an end point—where they are so physically and emotionally exhausted to the point they can’t continue. If you find yourself feeling physically exhausted at the end of the day and this occurs two to three times a week or more that’s a red flag. “It’s that feeling like you’re walking through cement to get out of bed and to the shower and to work” said Moss.

Identifying chronic stress and addressing it before burnout is vital—to both employees and employers. If you’re seeing signs of stress talk to your employer about managing your calendar to ensure you’re taking breaks refueling your body and mind and setting clear boundaries between work and personal life. You may even take a step away from your job for a while to recharge. If your employer is not responsive or not showing signs of change said Moss then changing jobs may be the best option.

And after the ordeal they found human feces on a rug and vomit on some of the football jerseys in the locker room.

Details on the incident come a day after school officials confirmed Famularo 26 will not be coaching the Blue Bishops’ annual Thanksgiving Day game against Neptune.

Asbury Park school district spokeswoman Chanta Jackson declined to comment on Famularo’s employment status as of Friday nor if any other staff members were suspended on pay. Jackson said Robert Ward will take over for the team’s game against the Neptune Scarlet Fliers following the incident.

When police responded to the school’s stadium Saturday on a report of trespassing at about 2:21 a.m. they found an open gate authorities said in the report provided to NJ Advance Media following an Open Public Records Act request. Famularo who was known by both police officers according to the report was then seen sitting by the main entrance to the locker room.

Shining his flashlight at Famularo the coach “stood up and walked toward (the officers) while holding what appeared to be a jersey covering the lower part of his body” police said. One officer said he “observed (Famularo) wearing a shirt and not wearing any pants.”

According to the report Famularo told police he was locked out of his vehicle. Officers who placed Famularo in the back seat of the patrol car since he was half-naked did not call the fire department to unlock the vehicle since they pulled the registration back to Famularo’s girlfriend police said.

After Famularo’s girlfriend arrived a woman walked out from the direction of the stadium saying she had the coach’s facility keys cell phone jacket and car keys. Famularo confirmed the woman was with him the report said.

Famularo ultimately left the stadium with his girlfriend police officials said.

After police gained access to the locker room — with help from another football coach who was called to the stadium — they found “human feces on one of the rugs” and “vomit on some of the football jerseys (and other clothing which appeared to belong to Famularo)” the report said. No other people were found by police on the premises the report indicated.

Additional details on the incident were not available. Famularo did not immediately respond to phone calls for comment Friday.

Mike Casey Asbury Park Police Department spokesman previously said that Famularo was not arrested and an investigation was not launched into the trespassing incident.

According to the Asbury Park Press which first reported the incident Famularo coached Asbury Park High School against Penns Grove in the state playoffs on Saturday at noon just hours after the incident — which top school administration were not aware of at the time.

Famularo graduated from Asbury Park High School in 2013. He was appointed as head high school football coach in July 2020 after taking over for Tim Fosque who led the Blue Bishops the previous five seasons. According to the state pension database his annual salary to coach the team is $18900. A school official did not clarify if he held any other positions with the district.

His suspension comes amid an investigation into Wall High School also in Monmouth County over hazing and sexual assault allegations.

The folks at XFM radio – now re-branded to just the crisp Radio X – couldn’t believe their luck when they stumbled across records of a conversation between legendary musicians Robert Smith and David Bowie. The conversation is believed to have been held in their studio around the end of 1995. Perhaps the inspiration behind their re-branding was the proverbial X in the sand – or filing cabinet – in which this treasure resided. Smith and Bowie who are both renowned and some could argue both built their careers from bold eccentricities in their music not only speak trivially about the weather or if they prefer red or white wine. Instead the duo took the opportunity to see how the other half live as they interview each other. The result in this extract is a full-fat chat about albums and the UK.

Immediately Smith and Bowie (which sounds like a formulaic ITV detective drama) discuss life in England. Smith who establishes himself as the more sentimental persona in the conversation says that he “couldn’t imagine life outside of England because of family”. Bowie responds in admittance to not living in England properly since 1974. However he continues he has suddenly found himself as the head of a family of four “from nothing it’s a new beginning”. Bowie recognises a more “domestic need” to return to England to “find his roots again”. There must be something about the UK that screams family life. He does nonetheless also state that the atmosphere in the country is enthralling again ensuring that it’s a “very exciting experience whenever I return to London”.

Smith retreats at the prospect of London preferring a comparatively rural residence in Sussex. After living in London for some time throughout the 1980s he can no longer stand returning to the capital. The ever-inquisitive Bowie proposes boredom or overfamiliarity as the reason behind Smith’s reluctance but Smith instead points to the distinction between London and England. “We [The Cure] all live in different parts and we visit each other so we get to see more of England rather than just London. Travelling up to London today I had forgotten how awful it was”.

Bowie who had grown up in the suburbs of London identified with Smith’s observations. “I think it’s the greyness of it all” Bowie says before adding: “It was a man-made Orwellian society cast in stone. I think all my generation just wanted to escape.” In this comment Bowie may have self-analytically encapsulated his reasons for becoming Ziggy Stardust the man from space. His desire to escape the dystopian suburbs blended with his unfettered imagination which led him to look to the great beyond.

Despite finding comfort outside of London with “people that chat at traffic lights” Smith concedes that he is not welcomed with open arms in the Sussex community. “I’m not accepted at all but I don’t mind that. I see it as a plus side” he says. “In London it would be easy for me to go and socialise whereas where I am I retain anonymity.” The goth deity remains true to his half-human half-arachnid character. “The locals haven’t taken me into their hearts. I’d be horrified if they had” he adds. Surprising to think that Robert Smith nipping in an off-license to get milk or strolling on the local beach would be greeted with anything other than abundant joy.

In a discussion of albums Bowie once again embodies the role of the interviewer. He asks “Do you write with an audience in mind or are you writing to satisfy your own need?” This momentarily stumps Smith whose first response is: “Crumbs I’ll have to think about this while I’m talking.” Eventually he goes on to state “I probably seriously redefined who I was writing to which leads on to yes I did at some point accept that I was writing with other people in mind. I don’t think early on… I don’t think one ever believes that one is ever going to be heard by enough people for it to really matter.” Smith baffles with how humble he comes across it’s difficult to believe that he would ever and still have anxiety about the size of his audience. Not that any normal human being can accurately foreshadow their own success not even the Starman. An incentive for any budding musician.

The conversation continues for over an hour with both Smith and Bowie lending their rare insights to one another and the world. What is most startling here is how two characters that spent most of their careers and lives transcending the confines in which most “normal” people operate are the same as everybody else beneath the surface. Anxieties of success and integration a desire to be loved by their audience and an ever-burning longing to escape."

Maxx right now,"New York CNN Business —

Bummer for bargain hunters: It may be harder to snag designer clothes at T.J. Maxx Burlington and Ross.

These discount chains thrive when there is a glut of clothing in the market. They can scoop in and buy premium apparel and shoe brands’ excess inventory for cheap — and then sell it to customers at bargain prices. The problem right now: There’s very little unsold clothing sitting around.

Supply chains are choked off and brands don’t have as much if any extra stuff to dump. And since inventories are lean and customer demand is red hot brands don’t have as great a need to discount merchandise — they can easily sell items at full price.

Under Armour (UA) Ralph Lauren (RL) Carter’s (CRI) and Steve Madden (SHOO) are among the brands that have said in recent weeks they’re retreating from discount chains sometimes called “off-price” stores. Levi’s (LEVI) is also walking away from discount stores.

Even before the pandemic these brands were trying to move away from off-price companies because they are the least profitable outlets for brands. Offering too many products at a discount also dilutes brands’ image and erodes their pricing power over customers. These brands want to sell their stuff through their stores websites premium wholesale partners or their factory stores which are all more profitable.

“Off-price is a last resort” said Susan Anderson a retail analyst at B. Riley Securities. She said discount stores could suffer in the long term if brands keep their inventories tighter.

Clothing and footwear brands have increased their efforts during the pandemic to pull away from discount stores. They’re able to pull it off right now because of the huge imbalance between supply and demand.

“We have reduced the amount that we’re selling to the third-party off-price channel” Under Armour chief financial officer David Bergman said on an earnings call this month. “Those partners would like more product.”

When Under Armour does sell to discount chains they are “going to pay a little bit more to us” because Under Armour has less product to ship Bergman said.

Carter’s is shipping fewer of its baby items to TJ Maxx (TJX) Marshalls Burlington (BURL) and Ross (ROST) this year. Compared with 2019 Carter’s has reduced its sales to off-price stores by nearly 50% CEO Michael Casey said on an earnings call last month.

Instead of delivering to discount chains Carter’s will rely on its own stores and website when it has excess inventory to unload – or it will hold onto products and selling them during a different season a spokesperson said in an email. Carter’s is also cutting back on the number of different products it sells overall leaving less room for off-price stores to pounce.

Ralph Lauren has “significantly reduced” the amount of inventory it’s sending to discount chains including T.J. Maxx a spokesperson said in an email. In particular Ralph Lauren has pulled back on the amount of products it makes specifically for T.J. Maxx.

Steve Madden is also dialing back on unloading inventory to off-price stores because it has to allocate its limited supply of goods.

“Our first priority is always feeding full-price channels” CEO Edward Rosenfeld said on an earnings call this month.

T.J. Maxx says not to worry: Stores will be “frequently updated with new and on-trend items” and customers will be able to find a strong selection of gifts and home decor during the holiday season from its “ever-changing mix of merchandise” a spokesperson for the company said in an email. Burlington declined to comment. Ross Stores did not respond to requests for comment.

Still “quantities of seasonal goods look lower than normal” at off-price chains particularly at Ross and Burlington UBS retail analyst Jay Sole said in a November 8 research note. Top brands’ sportswear was less available than usual he noted.

Off-price chains’ stocks have trailed the S&P 500’s retail index which has increased 18% in 2021. TJ Maxx parent TJX’s stock is flat this year Burlington has inched up 2% and Ross has declined 6%

Goods are scarcer at some companies’ own outlet stores such as outdoor equipment retailer REI.

REI is seeing strong demand for outdoor goods so there’s “very little product leftover” to sell at its outlet stores Ben Johns REI’s general merchandising manager for action sports told CNN Business.

Historically half of REI’s cycling business — bikes helmets apparel parts and maintenance products for cycling car racks — come from full-price sales. This year that’s climbed above 90%.

Johns said: “What we have we just simply sell full price.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndydHYuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ya2luZy1mb3IteW91L3NldmVyYWwtYnJhbmRzLXJldHJlYXQtZnJvbS1kaXNjb3VudC1zdG9yZXMtbGlrZS10LWotbWF4eC1idXJsaW5ndG9uLXJvc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Several brands retreat from discount stores like T.J.

The problem continues to be the global supply chain issue and right now very little unsold clothing is sitting around.

Discount chains like T.J. Maxx Burlington and Ross often carry an excess amount of premium apparel and shoes for lower prices.

But now brands like Under Armour Ralph Lauren and Steve Madden saying they're stepping away from those discount chains.

MIAMI Nov. 14 2021 – It’s official: Royal Caribbean International celebrated its newest game-changing ship Odyssey of the Seas during the ship’s naming ceremony in Fort Lauderdale Florida on Saturday Nov. 13. The Caribbean-inspired occasion culminated in the moment Odyssey’s Godmother and the first Bahamian paratriathlete to compete in the Paralympic Games qualifiers Erin Brown bestowed a blessing of safekeeping on the ship and all those who sail on it for decades to come.

Brown was joined on board by Royal Caribbean Group Chairman and CEO Richard Fain and Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley. The occasion also marked a historic moment for the decades-long Godmother tradition as Brown becomes the cruise line’s first Bahamian Godmother.

“Today we get to show the world what imagination and determination look like when they come together” said Fain. “All of what our teams have done over the past 20 months has led us to this moment when we can finally show the innovation and beauty of Odyssey of the Seas.”

A 17-year change agent for those living with disabilities in The Bahamas Brown is a mother and cancer survivor. The life-long athlete was diagnosed with stage 4 osteosarcoma – bone cancer – in 2004. It was more than a year later after receiving treatment when Brown made the decision to amputate her leg above the knee. Having watched her own mother battle lupus linked to cancer for five years Odyssey’s Godmother was determined to come back stronger than ever for herself her family and others who could be inspired to fight. Brown went on to become the first Bahamian paratriathlete to train in the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Training Center in Colorado Springs and compete in a Paralympic Games qualifier. In addition to her athletic achievements Brown is a longtime advocate for those living with disabilities and works at the University of The Bahamas as the compliance officer and counselor championing the increase of access and opportunities for students living with disabilities.

“It’s our honor to welcome Erin as our first Bahamian Godmother” said Bayley. “She is an incredible individual who pushes to change the status quo making her the perfect choice for a ship as innovative as Odyssey of the Seas. It’s also fitting because The Bahamas has been our great partner and neighbor since Royal Caribbean first set sail to the islands more than 50 years ago.”

Royal Caribbean cruises have visited The Bahamas and the Caribbean for 52 years and counting. Year after year guests of all ages can set sail to explore the regions’ stunning destinations. In June The Bahamas was where Royal Caribbean’s first cruise back in the western hemisphere set sail after more than a 15-month pause.

On full display during the official naming ceremony was Odyssey itself. The first Quantum Ultra Class ship in North America features a combination of new thrilling experiences and signature adventures guests know and love. Highlights include a vibrant resort-style pool deck inspired by the Caribbean the new Giovanni’s Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar Teppanyaki the restaurant serving up Far East flavors and making its North America debut; and one-of-a-kind entertainment that pushes the bounds of imagination in the high-tech venue Two70 and the Royal Theater.

“I am immensely grateful to have been selected as Godmother to Odyssey of the Seas” said Brown. “As a proud Bahamian it is an honor to also represent The Bahamas and share my story with so many others. My experiences have empowered me to reinvent myself and transform my life and I’m committed to helping ensure others can do the same.”

This winter and early 2022 Odyssey is welcoming families and travelers of all ages on 6-night and 8-night cruises to the eastern western and southern Caribbean as well as the cruise line’s private island destination Perfect Day at CocoCay. In April 2022 the new innovative ship will head to its summer home in Rome to sail along the sun-soaked shores of the Mediterranean.

Odyssey of the Seas Naming Ceremony

In what is one of the most inspiring naming ceremonies in recent times Odyssey of the Seas was finally christened during an event on the ship.

Erin Brown became the first Bahamian godmother to a Royal Caribbean ship and she blessed the vessel. Brown is the first Bahamian paratriathlete to compete in the Paralympic Games qualifiers a mother of two and a cancer survivor an inspiration to all.

You can watch some highlights of the Odyssey of the Seas naming ceremony in the video below:

“I am immensely grateful to have been selected as Godmother to Odyssey of the Seas” said Brown. “As a proud Bahamian it is an honor to also represent The Bahamas and share my story with so many others. My experiences have empowered me to reinvent myself and transform my life and I’m committed to helping ensure others can do the same.”

Also attending the ceremony was Royal Caribbean Group CEO Richard Fain who will step down in early 2022 after 33 years in the position. Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley was also in attendance.

“Today we get to show the world what imagination and determination look like when they come together” said Fain. “All of what our teams have done over the past 20 months has led us to this moment when we can finally show the innovation and beauty of Odyssey of the Seas.”

It’s also fitting because The Bahamas has been our great partner and neighbor since Royal Caribbean first set sail to the islands more than 50 years ago.”

What’s next for Odyssey of the Seas?

The Quantum-Ultra class cruise ship has waited long enough to finally benamed after several delays including the cancellation of its season from Isreal earlier in 2021. Even though the vessel already started sailing from Fort Lauderdale with guests on July 31 2021 the ship official commences her inaugural season after being named.

Through the remainder of 2021 and early 2022 the new Royal Caribbean cruise ship is sailing six-night and eright-night voyages to the eastern western and southern Caribbean. The ship will also be calling at the cruise line’s private island of Perfect Day at CocoCay in the Bahamas.

In April 2022 Odyssey of the Seas will spend the 2022 summer season sailing from Rome on Mediterranean itineraries.

The new ship is 167704 gross tons with a guest capacity of 4198 at double occupancy and 1663 international crew members. There’s a total of 15 passenger decks and 2105 staterooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xMy93aGF0LWV4cGVjdC1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW5zLW5ldy12aXJ0dWFsLXNhZmV0eS1kcmlsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to expect with Royal Caribbean's new virtual safety drill,"One big change that Royal Caribbean has implemented this year is Muster 2.0. Otherwise known as eMuster this is a streamlined and digital upgrade to the traditional muster drill.

The muster drill is a mandatory safety briefing during which passengers learn where to go and what to do in case of an emergency onboard. The drill must be completed by all passengers on the first day of a cruise before the ship can depart.

Prior to the cruise shutdown the muster drill was an activity many passengers disliked. Passengers had to gather at their muster station at the same time as everyone else in their group. This often led to large crowds and a lot of waiting around outside in uncomfortable temperatures.

Muster 2.0 is a new and improved hybrid model completed partly on the Royal Caribbean app (or stateroom television) and partly in-person at your designated assembly station. It is a quick flexible and stress-free experience.

If you haven’t been on a cruise yet this year it’s important to know when and how to complete the new emuster drill. After all you don’t want to be that one passenger who is delaying the ship’s departure!

Here’s what you can expect when doing the emuster drill on your next cruise.

What to do first: Download the Royal Caribbean App

The first step to completing Muster 2.0 is to make sure you have the Royal Caribbean app downloaded on your smartphone. Royal Caribbean’s app is free and is available on both iOS and Android devices.

After the app is downloaded login to your Royal Caribbean account. You should see your next sailing appear on the app. Once on the main page select the safety button in the bottom left corner. This will take you to the page where you can begin the emuster drill.

No smartphone?

If you do not have a smartphone you can complete all necessary Muster 2.0 steps on the television in your stateroom once you get onboard.

Keep in mind that you could download the Royal Caribbean app on a tablet as well.

Muster 2.0 Steps

On the safety page within the app you will see three steps that you must complete. Next to each step you will see a box that says “incomplete”. As you complete each step each box will change from “incomplete” to “complete”.

Step one: Watch the short safety video

The first step on the emuster drill is to watch a short animated safety video demonstrating how to properly put on a lifejacket. At the end you click on a checkbox next to your name to confirm that you have watched the video.

Step two: Listen to the emergency horn

If there is an emergency onboard you will hear a very loud high-pitched beeping sound. The emergency horn on Royal Caribbean ships consists of seven short beeping noises followed by one long noise. It is important to know what the horn sounds like so that you are aware of an emergency should the horn blast through the cruise ship’s speakers.

To complete this step simply press the blue play button in the “Emergency horn” box. Make sure your phone’s audio levels aren’t up all the way as the emergency horn can be quite loud.

Step three: Locate and visit your assembly station

Step three of the emuster drill differs from the first two steps in that it requires going to your assembly station onboard the ship.

After you’ve listened to the emergency horn scroll down to the box that says “Visit Assembly Station” and click “Find on deck”. A deck plan of the ship will pop up showing you exactly where your assembly station is located.

With your phone in hand (or SeaPass card if you do not have a smartphone) go to your assembly station. If you need help locating your assembly station simply ask one of the crew members.

Once you arrive at the assembly station a crew member will give you a very brief safety demonstration. After this is done they will scan your SeaPass indicating that you have completed the emuster drill.

It’s a good idea to double check that all steps on the app’s safety page have been marked as complete. Once you see a green “complete” box next to each step you have successfully completed the emuster drill.

How to do Muster 2.0 with children

Children also have to complete the emuster drill although the process is a little different for them. When an adult in the cabin watches the safety video and listens to the emergency horn the children in that cabin are automatically considered to have completed those steps too.

Children must also accompany the adults in their cabin to the assembly station to have their SeaPass cards scanned indicating that they have completed the emuster drill.

Royal Caribbean also has a safety section for children located at the bottom of the safety page on the app or on the stateroom television. It is called “Learn about safety with Lulu & Mika” and goes over the safety information in a fun cartoon-style video.

The video is not mandatory to watch but may be helpful to give children a better idea of what to expect in an emergency situation.

When to do the Muster 2.0

In the weeks leading up to your cruise you may be eager to get everything done ahead of time. You can watch the safety video and listen to the emergency horn at any time on the app but unless you see the “Incomplete” box next to each step the muster drill has not officially opened for your sailing yet.

You will receive a notification on your phone when you can start working on the steps of the emuster drill. If you don’t receive a notification simply check the day before your sailing to see if the emuster drill is available.

A good idea is to complete the first two steps of the emuster drill the night before your cruise so that all you have to do once onboard is go to your assembly station. You can even choose to do this immediately after boarding so that you are done with the emuster drill within the first few minutes of being on the ship.

Whatever you do don’t forget to do the emuster drill! Some passengers may be so excited to explore the ship or grab a drink by the pool that they completely forget about it. The ship will not leave port until all passengers have completed every step.

Royal Caribbean is constantly working to improve the cruise experience for its guests and Muster 2.0 is no exception. What used to be an experience many passengers disliked doing on the first day of a cruise is now an easy straightforward process that will allow your vacation to begin without any hassle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydXplbHkuY29tL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jaHJpc3RlbnMtb2R5c3NleS1vZi10aGUtc2Vhcy1maXJzdC1xdWFudHVtLXVsdHJhLWNsYXNzLXNoaXAtaW4tbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean Christens Odyssey of the Seas First Quantum-Ultra Class Ship in North America,"On Saturday Royal Caribbean took a moment to celebrate not just a return to cruising but the arrival of its newest ship — Odyssey of the Seas. While Odyssey of the Seas has already been sailing from Fort Lauderdale starting this summer the ship had yet to be officially christened… until now.

The ship is taking a pause from its regular schedule to take a two-day “inaugural” cruise which Cruzely is attending. While these trips normally take place before a new ship begins sailing its normal routes in this case Odyssey has taken a journey that befits her name pushing the ceremony until now.

It took three-and-a-half years to design and build the ship which just so happened to be completed in the middle of the pause in cruising. The ship had then planned to sail from Israel beginning in May 2021. That country was among the first to roll out vaccines on a large scale making it an ideal place to start sailing. However as with many things in the past two years the plans had to be adjusted.

Instead Odyssey of the Seas became one of the first Royal Caribbean ships to offer trips in the United States following the pause making its debut in July sailing from Fort Lauderdale (Port Everglades).

While schedules may have been adjusted the tradition of naming the ship was simply delayed — not forgotten.

The belated event featured speeches from Royal Caribbean International CEO Michael Bayley who at one point became emotional recollecting all the cruise line has been through to finally see Odyssey of the Seas sailing. Royal Caribbean Group CEO Richard Fain — soon to retire from his role after more than three decades — also presented at the ceremony.

As Godmother of Odyssey of the Seas Royal Caribbean tapped Erin Brown an inspiring Bahamian paratriathlete. Brown a former college athlete lost a leg to bone cancer yet went on to compete internationally.

“From the moment we heard Erin’s story how her courage and determination inspired others and led to a more inclusive consciousness about succeeding with disabilities we were moved and knew she was a natural choice for Godmother of our newest ship Odyssey of the Seas” said Bayley recently about the decision to ask Brown to serve as Godmother.

Following the ceremonial breaking of the champagne bottle (this time done via button that sent the bottle sliding down a cable to break on the ship’s hull) the ceremony wrapped up with celebratory fireworks in Port Everglades.

A New Addition to the Quantum-Ultra Class With Lots to Offer

While the christening of any new ship is exciting the welcome of Odyssey of the Seas carries special interest. It is the first Quantum-Ultra class ship to homeport in North America. At nearly 168000 gross tons and a 4200 passenger capacity at double occupancy it isn’t Royal Caribbean’s largest ship. However the vessel has a number of features that make it stand out.

At the back of the ship is the SeaPlex a massive indoor sport and game area. Here there is a massive sports court that doubles as the bumper car arena. Circling the upper level of the SeaPlex is Playmakers Sports Bar and the ship’s arcade.

Head outside and you’ll see the Ripcord by iFly (skydiving) along with other favorites like the Sky Pad Flowrider and the North Star — a capsule that lifts up over the ship — providing stunning views. Of course there are also multiple pool areas including Splashaway Bay for smaller kids.

Inside there are more than 15 places to eat including El Loco Fresh Giovanni’s Italian Kitchen and Wonderland. Other staples include the Solarium Bionic Bar Boleros and more.

Perhaps most stunning is a performance venue — Two70. The unique theater sitting at the back of the ship features an innovative stage and wraparound background that blends video with the performers.

A performance called The Book takes full advantage of the space with aerialists and dancers coming from the ceiling and the floors along with wild projections displaying on the massive screens. Having seen plenty of performances on cruise ships it’s something we can safely say we’ve never seen anything like before.

In other words instead of just another ship Royal Caribbean continues to push new and interesting aboard Odyssey.

With the arrival and christening of Odyssey of the Seas it marks another milestone in the “return to normal” in cruising. And with the innovations we’ve seen thus far while aboard Odyssey it shows that not only is Royal Caribbean looking to just get back to sailing but they aim to be better than ever.

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero.

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

An offer for Packers fans For the best local Wisconsin news sports entertainment and culture coverage subscribe to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. $1 for 6 months

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wilkinsburg annexation failure reflects merger hurdles for Pa.'s 2560 municipalities,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/local/regional/wilkinsburg-annexation-failure-reflects-merger-hurdles-for-pa-s-2560-municipalities/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL21lZGlhL3N0YW5kdXAtY29taWMtcnV0aGxlc3NseS1tb2Nrcy1iaWRlbi1zdGFmZmVyLWF1ZGllbmNlLXMtc2hvdy1qb2LSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYS9zdGFuZHVwLWNvbWljLXJ1dGhsZXNzbHktbW9ja3MtYmlkZW4tc3RhZmZlci1hdWRpZW5jZS1zLXNob3ctam9iLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stand-up comic ruthlessly mocks Biden staffer in audience: 'What a s--- show of a job you have',"During a recent stand-up show a comedian roasted an audience member who reported working for the Biden administration.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you.

She and her team are the driving force behind the program. The immediate past winner Steve MacDonald hired me to provide cybersecurity compliance services for his then small company – myMatrixx – A-LIGN was much smaller at that time.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Remember back in 2018 when gas prices were at record levels and we started seeing gas surcharges pop up?

Well are you ready for supply chain surcharges?

Sherwin Williams has instituted a 4% surcharge citing increased costs.

Construction company owner Brennan Dougherty said he only noticed the extra cost when he looked at his receipt after buying paint.

""Wow they're just flat out busting it out on the receipt 4%"" said Dougherty. ""Obviously if it was a bigger job it affects you a lot more. But 4% on a million dollar job is $40000.""

Experts say we can expect to see supply chain disruption until at least early next year so other companies may soon do the same.

""Who pays for that? The customer? Do we take it out of our percentage?"" Dougherty asked. ""It's hard to say. That wasn't there when we bid the job.""

ST. PETERSBURG Fla. — The global supply chain is still recovering from interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Shortages coupled with increasing demand are driving prices up on many goods.

But are some companies passing on rising costs to consumers through additional fees?

Several people on social media are posting pictures of their receipts specifically from Sherwin-Williams showing they were charged a “supply chain surcharge.”

THE QUESTION

Are companies adding surcharges on some goods and services due to ongoing supply chain issues?

THE SOURCES

Seckin Ozkul  director Supply Chain Innovation Lab at the University of South Florida

 director Supply Chain Innovation Lab at the University of South Florida Sherwin-Williams

FedEx

Harley-Davidson via MarketScreener

THE ANSWER

Yes companies like Sherwin-Williams are tacking on surcharges due to ongoing supply chain issues.

WHAT WE FOUND

The CEO of Sherwin-Williams the largest paint company in the U.S. warned investors in September the company was dealing with rising manufacturing costs due to waning availability of raw materials.

""The persistent and industry-wide raw material availability constraints and pricing inflation we have previously reported have worsened” Sherwin-Williams Chief Executive John Morikis said.

“We do not expect to see improved supply or lower raw material pricing in our fourth quarter as anticipated.”

A photo of a notice purportedly posted at the entrance of a Sherwin-Williams store says the surcharge is “due to increased costs associated with transportation freight and labor.”

A statement from the company confirms this “We have announced a 4 percent surcharge in The Americas Group effective September 20 through the end of the year.”

Seckin Ozkul the director of the University of South Florida’s Supply Chain Innovation Lab says what’s happening to the supply chain now started during the pandemic.

“We’ve never had such a big disruption before to our supply chain such as the pandemic” he said.

Quick drastic changes in demand over the past two years have had ripple effects up the supply chain. Those ripple effects according to Ozkul only get more dramatic the higher you go on the chain — known as the “bullwhip effect.”

It’s why we’re seeing backlogged shipping ports Ozkul explains. It’s a lot of the goods that had been held up now finally ready all at once with nowhere to go.

Not being able to get the products to store shelves in a timely manner is partly what’s driving up costs and some companies are passing the increase onto you. But it’s likely temporary he said.

“The surcharge is just another way of saying we are incurring additional costs and somebody needs to pay for it sorry we’re not going to pay for it” Ozkul said.

Ozkul says surcharges are not a new concept. When jet fuel costs go up airlines frequently pass those costs onto customers in the form of a fuel surcharge.

Other companies are doing it too. Harley-Davidson said squeezed inventory and higher raw material costs drove the company to increase surcharge pricing in the United States to offset costs.

Consumers are also doling out more for certain FedEx shipments. The carrier added a fuel surcharge which went into effect on certain deliveries at the start of November.

So why not just increase the price?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXBsZXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS8yMDIxLzExLzEzL2NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1iZWdpbnMtc3RvY2tzLWV4Y2l0aW5nLW5ldy1taXhlZC11c2UtcHJvamVjdC1lc3Rlcm8vNjM1MjE0ODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Construction begins at Stock's exciting new mixed-use project in Estero,"B-Squared Advertising

Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson’s announcement last week that it would split its operations into two entities — one focusing on pharma/medical devices and one focusing on consumer products — represents a strategic nod to the fact that the direct-to-consumer (D2C) market is a niche that deserves focus all its own.

The firm is spinning off its household products operations a move slated to take place through the next 18 months to 24 months that will create two distinct publicly traded companies. It’s a way for Wall Street and investors in general to place their bets on separate business lines momentum and profits.

“Following a comprehensive review the board and management team believe that the planned separation of the consumer health business is the best way to accelerate our efforts to serve patients consumers and healthcare professionals create opportunities for our talented global team drive profitable growth and — most importantly — improve healthcare outcomes for people around the world” outgoing CEO Alex Gorsky said in the announcement detailing the move.

Spinoff Still Unnamed

The as-yet-unnamed consumer spinoff will house brands that collectively will generate as much as $15 billion in revenues this year. There are four $1 billion “megabrands” (as measured in annual revenues) and 20 brands with $150 million in annual sales.

In the announcement detailing the spinoff those brands include Neutrogena Aveeno and Band-Aid among others. And although these brands represent a minority of consolidated top line the digital shift that is currently underway may pique investor interest in the consumer-facing offerings.

J&J’s consumer brands brought in $14.1 billion of sales last year generating about 17.1% of total revenue. Of those sales it generated roughly a third from over-the-counter medicines a third from skin health and beauty brands and the rest from oral care baby care women’s health and other products. J&J said it expects consumer sales to hit $15 billion this year.

Investor materials released in tandem with the announcement show that the new consumer health company would be 35% tied to over-the-counter and self-care products 33% tied to essential health and specialty products and 32% tied to skin health and beauty products. Those key categories are growing in the mid-single digit to high-single digit percentage point growth rates compounded annually.

In the latest quarter the company noted that worldwide consumer health sales of $3.7 billion increased 4.1% with growth of 4.5% in the U.S. and growth of 3.7% outside of the U.S.

Management noted on the conference call late last month to discuss results that the company is above pre-pandemic levels. When compared to 2019 levels the consumer health business grew by 8% in in the latest quarter.

The latest quarters’ commentary also underscored that there has been “strong performance” in Aveeno and Neutrogena facial moisturizing and body care driven per management discussion by the recovery from the pandemic and eCommerce growth.

When the unit is fully spun off investors and Wall Street will be able to assign a multiple to the consumer business on its own. As economies reopen and pre-pandemic routines become normal again eCommerce may underpin and even accelerate top line growth.",,,,,,,,,

Arkansas (7-3 3-3 SEC) held on in a close contest to beat LSU (4-6 2-5 SEC) and improve its bowl prospects.

GOING BOWLING:How Arkansas coach Sam Pittman made Larry the bowling ball a locker room hit

More:Sam Pittman: Arkansas football coach through the years

There were turnovers a fake field goal and many failed third-down conversions. Here are five key takeaways from Arkansas' tight road victory.

Defense keeps it close

Arkansas' half of the offensive stat sheet wouldn't exactly indicate a winner. It was the defense that kept the Razorbacks alive as the offense stalled time and again in the first half before it got going in the third quarter. As Arkansas went three-and-out six times on offense the defense forced three three-and-outs against LSU.

The defense recovered a fumbled snap on a botched play from the wildcat formation in the first half and picked off Garrett Nussmeier in the second half but the offense couldn't turn either opportunity into points. Arkansas' half of the stat sheet wasn't pretty but thanks to the defense neither was LSU's.

Slow start

Arkansas had trouble moving the ball in the first half. The Razorbacks had six first downs in the first 30 minutes of play and four of those came late in the second quarter. They converted 1 of 8 third downs in the same period.

Several times on third down Arkansas opted for short or lateral passes twice passing for minus-3 yards on third down. Its longest ball of the first half was KJ Jefferson's first throw an 18-yard reception by Blake Kern. Jefferson threw for just 34 yards in the half and the Razorbacks averaged 3.3 yards per play.

The running game wasn't much stronger with Arkansas' SEC-leading rushing attack collecting 80 yards excluding sacks in the first half.

Penalty woes continue

In its close win over Mississippi State the prior week Arkansas was called for 11 penalties for 84 yards. Coach Sam Pittman emphasized the need to clean up penalties especially pre-snap flags but the penalty issues came up once again in Death Valley.

In the first quarter alone Arkansas was penalized five times for 30 yards including an offside and a false start. LSU on the other hand had one penalty for 10 yards in the same period.

At the start of the second half Treylon Burks picked up a 19-yard gain that was cut to 11 after a holding call Arkansas' sixth penalty of the game.

And on a huge fourth-and-1 late in the fourth quarter Arkansas was called for an illegal formation to make it fourth-and-6. The Razorbacks punted.

Nussmeier gets the ball for LSU

LSU coach Ed Orgeron said before the game that both Max Johnson and Garrett Nussmeier would see snaps at quarterback for the Tigers. Johnson started as he has all season but on LSU's third drive freshman Nussmeier took over. He remained in the game from then on including in overtime and threw for 179 yards on 31 attempts. He completed 58% of his passes and threw two interceptions.

CEBU Philippines — Actress-singer Nadine Lustre once again made rounds online as she shared on Instagram a stolen video of rumored boyfriend Christophe Bariou.

In her Instagram story Nadine appeared to be in a video call with Bariou. She simply wrote a black heart emoji on it.

Photos of Lustre and Bariou started to surface online last year.

However Lustre has yet to confirm or deny her relationship with the Filipino-French businessman.

Recently Bariou is spotted together with Lustre and her parents in Siargao.

Lustre’s father Ulysses Lustre shared some photos on Facebook which appeared to be Bariou sharing meals with them.

Previously Lustre was in a relationship with James Reid which lasted over three years. They announced their breakup last January 2020. /rcg

Katzen built his own electric car and it's not what many people would expect when they lay eyes on an EV.

""It was originally a Mitsubishi Mighty Max 1988"" he said while standing in front of the old boxy two-door truck ""I call it the original Tesla.""

To go along with the battery-laden electric truck Katzen has installed solar panels on his home to help protect the environment and generate zero-emission energy.

Katzen called for people to generate zero emissions to help avoid the worst effects of climate change.

""We have to Hybridize if not go totally 100% electric and as quickly as possible"" he said.

NV Energy Southern Nevada's largest energy producer and distributor shares Katzen's view on harmful gas emissions.

The company is attempting to be carbon neutral by 2050.

""We have a goal to be 100% renewables in our future and we are moving toward that goal"" said Adam Grant with NV Energy Demand Side Management.

The changes set to come are happening at the same time Nevada is experiencing a population boom.

Every new person that moves to Southern Nevada every new home that's built brings new demand to the power grid that has already expanded to support hundreds of thousands of new residents in the last decade.

Jennifer Schuricht NV Energy spokesperson said the company is ready to build infrastructure to meet the demand.

MORE FROM THIS SERIES:



""We have been powering the growth of Southern Nevada for over 100 years"" she said ""so keeping up with the growth is nothing new to us.""

The largest infrastructure project in the pipelines for NV Energy is called Greenlink Nevada.

The project would give NV Energy access to new green energy production by building two high-capacity transmission lines one between Las Vegas and Yerington Nevada and the other between Yerington and Ely to complete a statewide triangle with Nevada's only large transmission line running between Las Vegas and Ely.

MORE FROM THIS SERIES:



""Greenlink is going to unlock these renewable energy zones in our state. Solar Geothermal places that have never been able to be developed.""

Before Greenlink if someone attempted to build a power plant in the geothermal energy-rich regions in Northern Nevada there would be no way to move the power to population centers.

On top of allowing the generation of new electricity Schuricht said the Greenlink lines would be able to pull power from other green sources outside of Nevada in times of high demand.

""It's allowing us to tap into resources across the West"" she said ""hydropower in the Northwest wind power in the midwest.""

Schuricht said fears that the investment needed to build out new infrastructure would lead to increased bills were likely unfounded pointing to NV Energy's ability to phase out the use of coal power completely in Southern Nevada over the last decade while customer bills shrunk.

Maybe that's why they've been so successful.

It's not as if Ann Fahy-Gust and Tessa Leung don't know beer. They do. Fahy-Gust was America's first female brewmaster holding high-level jobs with Coors and Guinness and later running the largest brewery in England. Leung has years of experience in the hospitality business including running a Rochester restaurant and brewpub.

But they had a vision of doing things their way a vision that includes carving out an identity for beer brewed in southern Minnesota much as brewers like Bent Paddle and Castle Danger have done in Minnesota's Arrowhead region.

It also includes making beer accessible to people who may not have much exposure to craft beer. Their brewpub in this city about 20 miles northwest of Rochester gives a clue to where they're coming from. It's cozy and comfortable more like a living room than the cold industrial settings found in so many breweries' on-site pubs.

And they're putting a little sizzle in their marketing with the shorthand version of their name ""SxSE.""

""We're sexy"" they blurt out laughing.

In little more than a year the brewery has landed more than 80 accounts with bars restaurants and liquor stores in southern Minnesota winning over customers one at a time by making personal connections. They're already expanding the operation with construction underway on a new brewing facility that will triple their capacity to about 3000 31-gallon barrels a year.

The brewery produces virtually no waste they said. Organic waste goes to a farmer for livestock feed and water is reclaimed for various uses around the facility. The amount of water entering the septic system from the brewery Fahy-Gust said is about the same amount produced by a typical four-bedroom home.

The pair have chosen to act as their own distributors rather than signing up with a wholesaler.

""We chose that because we can be responsive and not get lost in the shuffle because there are so many beers"" said Leung who acts as the brewery's one-woman sales force calling on outlets in roughly a 50-mile radius of Pine Island. And their customers appreciate the attention Fahy-Gust said.

""They want someone to actually come talk to them about craft beer"" she said rather than just getting ""whatever they have on the [distributor's] truck.""

While Leung is on the road Fahy-Gust is back at the brewery cooking up the company's six signature beers which are complemented by various seasonal and special brews throughout the year.

They landed in Pine Island they said because the city of about 3500 residents wanted them.

""It's very forward-looking"" Leung said. ""They wanted us as a destination."" The city helped them find their location along U.S. Hwy. 52 and created a tax-increment-financing district for them. With one full-time and 14 part-time employees Leung said the brewery has already exceeded the number of jobs it promised to create.

Being women in the beer business has been a challenge both said.

""Even with the pedigree I have I hear 'Well she doesn't really understand it' "" Fahy-Gust said. But they're appreciative that so many local businesses have been willing to give them a chance.

""This is my calling in life"" Leung said.

Southwest canceled more than 2000 flights around Columbus Day weekend disruptions the air carrier said cost it $75 million. American Airlines  which is also offering flight attendants and other crews extra pay for holiday shifts struggled with mass flight cancellations late last month and in early November as well.

Flight attendants pilots and other operations employees could receive up to 120000 Rapid Rewards points valued at more than $1400. Flight attendants are eligible for working 36 days between Nov. 15 and Jan. 14 while cabin crews who work 28 days over that period could get 60000 points the note stated. Southwest said that the number of qualifying shifts or days varies by work group.

The number of no-shows or unreachable flight attendants has been elevated recently Southwest's vice president of Sonya Lacore vice president of inflight operations said in her note to cabin crews which was reviewed by CNBC. Sick calls have surged as well when the company has lifted emergency policies that required flight attendants to show a doctor's note if calling out ill. For example Lacore said when the airline last lifted those procedures on Nov. 9 sick calls went from 20 an hour to 90 an hour for two hours in a row.

""We have a great opportunity here to uphold that commitment to them and you in the midst of what has been a difficult time for us all"" wrote Lacore. ""Our first step in addressing this and actively working to protect the operation was to reduce the schedule and we believe this incentive program will take us another step in the right direction.""

The airline is also offering as much as triple pay to ground operations employees for working Thanksgiving and Christmas and double pay for overtime shifts between Nov. 17 through Nov. 30 and Dec. 17 through Jan. 3 up from time-and-a-half pay.

Airlines had offered staff early retirement packages and leaves of absence to cut their labor bills during the pandemic but found themselves short-staffed when demand bounced back this year. Flight attendants have been returning from leave to American and were recalled earlier by Southwest while those airlines and others are also aggressively hiring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc3lyYWlycG9ydC5vcmcvMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtZGFpbHktZmxpZ2h0cy1hdC1zeXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Launches Daily Flights at SYR,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3NvdXRod2VzdC1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LWhvc3BpdGFsaXplZC1hZnRlci1iZWluZy1hc3NhdWx0ZWQtYnktcGFzc2VuZ2Vy0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvc291dGh3ZXN0LWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnQtaG9zcGl0YWxpemVkLWFmdGVyLWJlaW5nLWFzc2F1bHRlZC1ieS1wYXNzZW5nZXIuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest employee hospitalized after alleged assault by passenger,"An employee for Southwest Airlines was hospitalized Saturday after she was allegedly assaulted by a passenger boarding a flight to New York City from Dallas Love Field.

According to the Dallas Police Department 32-year-old Arielle Jean Jackson boarded the New York-bound flight about 12:40 p.m. and soon after began a “verbal altercation” with a flight attendant at the back of the plane.

The flight attendant asked Jackson to exit the plane and as she was leaving she struck an airline operations agent with a closed fist on the head police said. Officers took Jackson into custody and charged her with aggravated assault Juan Fernandez a Dallas police spokesman said Sunday.

It was unclear whether Jackson had retained a defense lawyer.

The operations agent was taken to a hospital where she was in stable condition and recovering from multiple injuries Chris Mainz a Southwest spokesperson said Sunday in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Southwest Airlines maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding any type of harassment or assault and fully supports our Employee as we cooperate with local authorities regarding this unacceptable incident” the statement said.

During the pandemic there has been a sharp increase in disruptive or violent incidents onboard planes — many involving hostile passengers protesting mask mandates prompting airlines and government agencies to institute harsher policies including higher fines and reporting the most serious cases to the FBI for potential prosecution.

The Federal Aviation Administration reported 5114 incidents of unruly passengers across all airlines as of November this year 3710 of which were related to mask-wearing. From the total number of incidents the FAA initiated 973 investigations a sixfold increase from last year. One hundred of the reports involved physical assault.

The spike in disturbances that began at the end of last year as travel resumed to pre-pandemic levels led the FAA to initiate a “zero tolerance policy” against passengers disrupting flights with threatening and in many cases violent behavior.

Before the policy that began in January unruly passengers could receive a warning for their misconduct. They could also be hit with a civil penalty of up to $25000 per incident. Now all incidents are subject to a fine of up to $37000 for each federal violation.

Last week the FAA announced $225287 in civil penalties against 10 airline passengers for alleged unruly behavior including onboard three Southwest flights.

One of the incidents involved a man on a flight in May from New York City to Chicago who refused to remain seated during descent and instead left his seat and tried to enter the cockpit. To ensure he remained seated during landing flight attendants sat him on the floor at the back of the plane and tried to hold him down but the man began punching one of them.

The man was arrested at the arrival gate and fined $26787 according to an FAA news release.

This month the FAA announced it had referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution in hopes of curbing the uptick in violent behavior on planes this year.

“Let this serve both as a warning and a deterrent: If you disrupt a flight you risk not just fines from the FAA but federal criminal prosecution as well” FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson said in a news release.

Given the growing number of cases that involve physical assault flight attendant associations have repeatedly urged federal authorities airlines and airports to ramp up efforts to hold disruptive passengers accountable and to create a centralized list of violators who would be denied permission to fly on all airlines.

Currently there is no such list but individual companies have the right to keep internal lists of people banned from boarding their planes.

“If a passenger physically assaults crewmembers or other passengers on one airline they pose a risk to passengers and crew at every airline. They should be banned from flying on all airlines. Period” Sara Nelson president of AFA-CWA International said in a recent statement.

Coffee giant Starbucks is testing Perfect Day’s fungi-based dairy-identical milk in select Seattle locations the company announced earlier this week.

Perfect Day the Bay Area food-tech startup has been on a roll. The brand which is now valued at more than $1.6 billion recently raised $350 million in its efforts to remove cows from the dairy industry without losing the dairy.

Now it’s vying for a place in the coffee market with the Starbucks two-store trial.

How it works

Perfect Day makes dairy milk by creating the same proteins found in milk through a novel fermented microbiota. It works with fungi strains that are engineered to produce casein and whey—two dairy proteins. The genetically engineered fungi are coded with bovine DNA that creates whey protein. They’re then fed sugars to produce the dairy proteins that are then dried into a powder that can be used to make milk-based products including milk cheese and ice cream.

While the product is technically vegan as no animals were used to create it it is not dairy-free and may not be safe for people with dairy allergies or sensitivities.

Its animal-free dairy stars in a new cake mix from offshoot Brave Robot. And the brand also recently announced it saved one million miles of emissions after selling its one-millionth pint of Brave Robot ice cream.

But its latest partnership could help move it more into the emerging dairy alternative market and help accelerate adjacent categories like other bio-fermented foods as well as cell-based and cultivated meat and seafood.

Starbucks’ sustainability

The move comes as Starbucks has been making efforts to green up its menus adding dairy-free milk options and vegan menu items.

It recently began serving Oatly oat milk after many of its competitors had added it. Blue Bottle Coffee is now making oat milk the default in select California locations. Oat milk is so popular right now even McDonald’s is getting in on the action. It recently added oat milk to its McCafe stores in Australia.

Both Starbucks and McDonald’s recently committed $10 million to the Closed Loop Partners’ Next Gen Consortium—work aimed at greening foodservice packaging and making it more accessible—as part of their ongoing sustainability efforts.

“Starbucks’ work with the NextGen Consortium has been an important part of our ongoing efforts to reduce single-use cup waste part of our larger goal to reduce waste sent to landfills by 50 percent by 2030” Michael Kobori Chief Sustainability Officer at Starbucks said in a statement. “There has never been a more critical time for industry collaboration to shift away from single-use packaging promote reusability and champion recyclability. We are thrilled to continue our work with the NextGen Consortium to drive sustainable solutions for our planet.”

Perfect Day’s milk is currently available at two Seattle locations for a limited time.

The coffee chain announced it was teaming up with the Becks County native to celebrate the launch of the re-recorded version of ""Red (Taylor's Version)"" with a Red-themed beverage.

The drink ""Taylor's Version"" is a Grande Caramel Nonfat Latte which is Swift's favorite drink.

Customers can order the drink on the app or in stores simply by saying ""Taylor's Version."" Starbucks will also be playing ""Red (Taylor's Version)"" in stores across the country.

The coffee chain tweeted earlier this week ""It's Red Season"" which caused some fans to suspect that a collaboration was brewing.

Swift herself posted an ode to autumn on her Instagram a few weeks ago which featured a Starbucks cup.

The re-recorded album has 30 songs that were made for the original album and it includes collaborations with Ed Sheeran Phoebe Bridgers and Chris Stapleton.

The original album came out in 2012 and spent seven weeks atop the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was certified seven times platinum in the U.S.

The new drink which debuts in stores today marks a milestone for Starbucks: It’s the first-ever non-dairy holiday drink. And yup Starbucks says it’s inspired by the beloved holiday treat the sugar cookie.

People are already buzzing about the new drink on social media:

Here’s what you need to know about the new iced sugar cookie almond milk latte plus how it fares in the nutrition department.

What’s in the iced sugar cookie almond milk latte?

The iced sugar cookie almond milk latte has a base of Starbucks Blonde Espresso and almond milk. That’s combined with sugar cookie flavored syrup and topped off with festive red and green cookie sprinkles according to Starbucks. While it’s designed to be served over ice you can have it hot instead—your choice.

Iced sugar cookie almond milk latte nutrition

The iced sugar cookie almond milk latte comes in the usual range of Starbucks sizes. But this is what you can expect if you have a grande iced version:

Calories: 150

Calories from fat: 30

Total fat: 3.5 g

Saturated fat: 0 g

Cholesterol: 0 mg

Sodium: 115 mg

Total carbohydrates: 29 g

Dietary fiber: 1 g

Sugar: 25 g

Protein: 2 g

Caffeine: 170 mg



Is the iced sugar cookie almond milk latte healthy?

It’s important to point out upfront that Starbucks never claimed this is a health drink. But if you’re curious dietitians have some thoughts.

“It’s important to remember that this is a treat” says Jessica Cording M.S. R.D. author of The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress & Anxiety. “But no one is eating sugar cookie anything and expecting it to be a health-promoting product.”

Cording points out that the iced sugar cookie almond milk latte is “lower in sugar than a lot of other Starbucks seasonal beverages” but she notes that 25 grams of sugar is still a lot. “That’s about six teaspoons—it’s not nothing” she says.

Keri Gans R.D. author of The Small Change Diet agrees. “I wouldn’t call this a healthy drink since it doesn’t provide any real nutritional benefits especially with 25 grams of sugar” she says. “But compared to other Starbucks holiday drinks it definitely is one of the better choices with fewer calories and sugar.”

Almond milk has a health halo around it but Cording notes that it tends to be low in protein and fat. “Because of that your body is going to burn through that sugar super quick” she says. “You could have a blood sugar spike and crash.”

So what’s the healthiest way to enjoy the iced sugar cookie almond milk latte?

Technically you’re fine to have it as-is. “For those looking to have a taste of the holidays while not breaking the caloric bank this is a good option” says Gina Keatley a C.D.N. practicing in New York City. “Still a dessert beverage this drink can be consumed as designed all by yourself—no need to share with only 150 calories.”

Cording recommends just looking at this as a treat. But if you want to try to make it healthier she suggests asking for just one pump of the flavored syrup downgrading to a tall and asking your barista to make it with dairy milk for a little protein to temper out all that sugar.

Overall though experts say you’re just fine to enjoy this drink the way Starbucks intended.

Latkes are the most quintessential Hanukkah food especially in the U.S. But a potato coffee doesn’t sound too tasty so we’re going to focus on the toppings for this one. Since Starbucks already invented an Apple Crisp Macchiato for this fall — it launched in time for Rosh Hashanah — we figured we’d use the new apple drizzle again for an applesauce-themed drink.

But to add that Hanukkah flair to the preexisting Apple Crisp Macchiato — now rebranded as the Applesauce Macchiato — we’re adding a whipped cream topping to represent the sour cream side of the great sour cream-applesauce debate and caramel brûlée bits on top just to nod at the textures of a crispy latke.

“Tut Classit” Sufganiyot Frap

Sufganiyot the filled donuts traditionally eaten for Hanukkah can come in all kinds of flavors; anything you can make in cream or jam form could go inside a donut. But at least according to iconic Israeli bakery chain Roladin — which is particularly famous for its sufganiyot — strawberry jam is the classic flavor. Since strawberry and coffee isn’t exactly a classic flavor pairing we’d make this one a strawberry frappuccino with a few pumps of the Starbucks sugar cookie syrup and real strawberries sprinkled with praline topping.

But we can’t stop there — Roladin is known for their over-the-top donuts during Hanukkah topped with sumptuous piles of whipped cream or fancy sprinkles and paired with lavish extras like syringes of syrup to inject into your pastry before consumption. So the Sufganiyot Frap would be topped with a decadent swirl of whipped cream and garnished with a “chaser” as Roladin calls its syringes to inject a bit of white chocolate into the drink before your first sip. (If your local Starbucks doesn’t have a syringe which they won’t you can have them do it as a drizzle.)

Miracle of the oil coffee

Butter coffee has a devoted following especially among people on a keto diet. Theoretically it might be good for you — something about lots of fat keeping you full longer without carbs. Hanukkah involves lots of carbs but it is the holiday of oil so we took advice from some keto blogs to get you the fattiest coffee possible to symbolize the miracle of the holiday.

You can’t add butter or MCT oil at Starbucks but you can add heavy cream so it’s not too far off — plus whipped cream for extra fat and festivity — to an Americano. To up your carb count for symbolic necessity you should add some java chips and a few pumps of whatever syrup you want.

Gelt Hot Chocolate

Hot chocolate is already pretty gelt-themed — chocolate is chocolate after all — but to add a thematic gambling element to it we’re taking inspiration from TikToker Anna X Sitar who has found fame by asking her Starbucks baristas to make her drinks that represent an emotion or event. So ask your barista to add whatever makes them think of miracles or war or maybe flames — be creative. Or if you’re feeling especially bold just ask them to add something Jewish. You might get something great or gross or even antisemitic.

Workers in three more stores in upstate New York have filed petitions to hold union elections as well

Workers at three Starbucks stores in New York might be the first in the US to vote to unionize at the coffee shop giant. The three stores in the Buffalo city area filed for union elections back in August and announced the formation of Starbucks Workers United or SWU. Since then workers say the company has sent high-level management to the stores to monitor and intimidate them under the guise of helping them serve customers and clean up.

Last week the workers filed a charge against the company with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accusing it of “engaging in a campaign of threats intimidation surveillance solicitation of grievances and the closing of facilities.” The SWU also says that the company transferred in and hired more employees to dilute support for the union.

That weekend the company closed all its stores in the Buffalo-area for a meeting with billionaire Howard Schultz the former CEO of the company and its largest shareholder. At the meeting Schultz invoked the stories of sharing among concentration camp inmates to make a point about Starbucks stretching its resources to care for workers. This comparison was criticized for its comparison of a multi-billion dollar company’s provision of benefits to the deeds of those who underwent severe torture. This comes after weeks of “captive audience” meetings which are mandatory meetings where the management gives anti-union talks and presentations.

But the intimidation hasn’t scared more workers from making moves to vote on a union. On November 9 three more stores in upstate New York filed petitions with the NLRB to hold union elections. This comes after the company petitioned to have all the estimated 20 individual stores in the Buffalo area vote on unionizing in one single election a set-up that usually tilts the results in favor of the company.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Vice “We routinely create the space and forums for open and honest conversation as it relates to establishing and maintaining a great work environment.”

Public documents on the National Labor Relations Board show that Starbucks is being represented by the nation’s largest union-busting firm Littler Mendelson.

Workers have seen an outpouring of solidarity from elected officials and customers alike. Customers have been showing their support by making orders with their names endorsed with “union yes.”

Starbucks owns 9000 stores across the US. The company reported a record $8.1 billion profit in the quarter ending October 3.

Steelmakers in the country have reportedly raised prices of benchmark hot-rolled coil by up to ₹3500 a tonne on the back of rising input costs due to soaring coal prices. ""Steel prices follow global trends and now stay at a higher level. If compared to international markets our prices are still low. It is a deregulated sector and market dynamics has an influence on it"" Steel Ministry additional secretary Rasika Chaube said while addressing a programme organised by CII.

Tata Steel in its guidance indicated that prices of the metal in India will be higher by about ₹2500 per tonne in the current quarter as compared to last year and in Europe it will be about 25 to 30 pounds per tonne higher.

With increasing coal prices and high cost of raw material it is difficult to sell steel at current prices a company official said. However some analysts said steel prices may see corrections in the near term with easing iron-ore prices.

Chaube said the Centre envisioned the transformation of eastern India as a potential integrated steel hub through Mission Purvoday. ""East is foreseen to contribute 80-90 million tonne in the estimated 250 million tonne production by 2030"" Chaube said.

The government intends to eliminate bottlenecks in the process of expediting investments through the creation of land banks ensuring availability of iron ores at competitive prices and providing statutory clearances on time the official said. Mission Purvoday is also intended towards establishment of ancillary downstream clusters and value-added products.

""The government has identified 11 zones along with nine clusters for the purpose and is all set to launch its pilot steel cluster in Kalinganagar Odisha"" Chaube said. She said the government is also focusing on using inland waterways in a big way to decongest ports of eastern India.

The ASUS management solution is built upon the ASPEED AST2600 BMC running MegaRAC SP-X. ASUS claims this is faster to boot but we did not time it. The AST2600 is a jump in Arm compute resources so that would make sense.

ASUS calls this solution the ASMB10-iKVM which has its IPMI WebGUI and Redfish management for the platform. The last EPYC GPU server we looked at from ASUS the ESC4000A-E10 was still using ASMB9 and the AST2500 so this is an upgrade to a newer faster BMC.

Some of the unique features come down to what is included. For example ASUS allows remote BIOS and firmware updates via this web GUI as standard. Supermicro charges extra for the BIOS update feature.

Another nice example is that we get the HTML5 iKVM functionality included with the solution. There are serial-over-LAN and Java iKVM options too. Companies like Dell EMC HPE and Lenovo charge extra for this functionality and sometimes quite a bit extra.

ASUS supports Redfish APIs for management as well. Something that we do not get is full BIOS control in the web GUI as we get in some solutions such as iDRAC iLO and XClarity. For GPU servers where one may need to set features like the above 4G encoding setting with certain configurations this is a handy feature to have.

Another small feature that is different from ASUS is the IPMI Hardware Monitor or IPMI HWM. While one can pull hardware monitoring data from the IPMI interface and some from the BIOS ASUS has a small app to do this from the BIOS.

We like ASUS’s approach overall to management. It aligns with many industry standards and also has some nice customizations.

Some organizations prefer more vendor-centric solutions but ASUS is designing its management platform to be more of what we would consider an industry-standard solution that does not push vendor lock-in.

Next let us discuss performance.

ASUS ESC8000A-E11 Performance

We are actually reviewing a few GPU servers at the moment but the key to this class of systems is cooling. GPUs and CPUs tend to perform similarly in systems when they are properly cooled but this server we were able to use both AMD EPYC 7763 280W TDP parts the top-end of the specs for the CPU as well as 300W NVIDIA A40 GPUs the top end PCIe cards in terms of TDP.

First we wanted to validate that the CPU cooling was sufficient so we used two 64 core parts at different TDP levels.

Here is what we saw with the AMD EPYC 7713 and AMD EPYC 7763 64-core CPUs compared to our non-GPU server data:

Overall this was very close. We will note that the AMD EPYC 7763 was around 1% slower than our baseline 2U non-GPU server figures. Since that is still within the test variation it seems reasonable but it does indicate that this is closer to the limit of the solution’s cooling capability.

Next we put the NVIDIA A40’s through our AI/ deep learning benchmarks to see how they would perform.

You are going to see the baseline system very soon on STH but overall the cooling seems to have held up well in this configuration.

Since we know people love these screenshots although the maximum power consumption we saw was in the 296-300W range the idle of each GPU was only 22-31W and the idle temperatures were very cool.

Here is the topology map. We can see the power of AMD EPYC PCIe Gen4 connectivity here.

Overall performance was solid for a system in this class.

Next let us get to power consumption and then to the STH Server Spider and our final words.",,,,,,,,,,,,

TMUS,T-Mobile US,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlib3VsZXZhcmQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvdC1tb2JpbGUtZGF0YS1icmVhY2gtdGltZWxpbmUtYW5hbHlzaXMtYW5kLWxlc3NvbnMtbGVhcm5lZC_SAWVodHRwczovL3NlY3VyaXR5Ym91bGV2YXJkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExL3QtbW9iaWxlLWRhdGEtYnJlYWNoLXRpbWVsaW5lLWFuYWx5c2lzLWFuZC1sZXNzb25zLWxlYXJuZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile Data Breach: Timeline Analysis and Lessons Learned,"T-Mobile Data Breach

On Monday August 16 T-Mobile issued a public statement stating that unauthorized access to some of their user data had occurred. In the days that followed it would be uncovered that more than 50 million individual user records may have been exposed. Personally Identifiable information such as names addresses phone numbers and social security information was available for sale in the underground forums for as little as six bitcoins or roughly $270000.

Just how did this all happen and what could T-Mobile have done differently? The answer is a surprisingly simple one – as we’ll see in this blog very basic security practices should have been in place to prevent this breach from ever occurring

In this blog we’ll review how this all took place and what they could have done differently to stop this attack. We’ll start by drawing out a timeline of the events as they took place and see how a 21-year-old American in Turkey took down a multibillion-dollar company by not following basic security practices.

Timeline

August 15 2021 –

The news of a potentially massive data breach was first reported by Motherboard on August 15. A user on a Tor underground forum was attempting to sell 30 million SSN’s and driver licenses for six bitcoins. When the motherboard private messaged the user directly they confirmed this data came from “T-Mobile USA. Full customer info”

While we don’t know how long they had access to the T-Mobile data the seller confirmed their access was already blocked: “I think they already found out because we lost access to the backdoored servers.”

August 16 2021-

On August 16 Jeremy Kirk on Twitter provided proof from the attacker that a misconfigured GPRS gateway allowed them to compromise the internal system. Apparently the gateway was used for testing but left exposed to the public internet. From there the attacker was easily able to pivot to the internal network by brute-forcing and credential stuffing SSH servers. Eventually he made his way into an Oracle Database server that stored the customer data

T-Mobile is no stranger to high-profile breaches but this paints a bleak picture even for them. Not only did they leave a public-facing gateway misconfigured and open for intrusion but once inside they appeared to not have basic security measures in place like rate limits on SSH attempts. Limiting SSH failed attempts which is considered a basic security practice would have stopped this breach in its tracks and proper logging would have notified the security team of failed attempts.

Once inside The Oracle server the attacker was able to exfiltrate large amounts of data until it was eventually noticed by T-Mobile and access shut down. In total over 106 GB of customer data was exfiltrated by the attacker.

The same day on August 16 T-Mobile issued a public statement stating that they were working “around the clock to investigate claims being made that T-Mobile data may have been illegally accessed.”

August 17 2021-

The following day T-Mobile confirmed that nearly 50 million current and former users might have been impacted by the breach and the data may have included customers’ first and last names date of birth SSN and driver’s license/ID information. They also advised that any current T-Mobile customer should proactively change their account pin number.

August 20 2021

The days that would follow would not bode well for T-Mobile. An additional 6M+ current or former customers would also be impacted with additional user data such as IMEI and IMSI information potentially collected as well.

August 26 2021.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal a 21-year-old American living in Turkey named John Simms claimed to be behind the breach. According to the report the attacker had access to T-Mobile’s server since July before his access was cut off. He said “I was panicking because I had access to something big. Their security is awful.”

August 26 lawsuits

A pair of lawsuits also ensued claiming T-Mobile had “failed to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect its customers.”

August 27

In an official statement from T-Mobile the CEO Mike Sievert essentially confirms what John Simms previously said by stating the attacker “used brute force attacks and other methods to make their way into other IT servers that included customer data.”

What could they have done differently?

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this breach is that basic security controls that would have prevented this were not in place.

For starters a gateway used for testing should not have had any access to internal resources. This is where the concept of segmentation and security policies comes into play especially on devices used for testing.

Once inside the attacker used brute-forcing and SSH credential stuffing to log into the Oracle DB with the customer information. As part of any good password policies rate limits should be put in place. After a limited number of bad attempts the attacker should have been locked out and notifications to the security team should have gone off.

Once inside the Oracle DB the attacker was allowed to exfiltrate over 106 GB of user data undetected. This is where proper detection and response protocols should have been in place to notice the large amount of data being transferred from a critical system.

Post Mortem / Ramification

While T-Mobile is offering two years of identity protection for impacted users it doesn’t even begin to address the fallout that could result from this massive data breach. All in all the user data collected from the breach includes:

Customer Name

Address

Social Security Numbers

DOB

Phone numbers

Account pins used to access the account

IMEI and IMSI

With this kind of information for anyone to purchase impacted users are at high risk of identity theft.

Unfortunately the risk doesn’t stop. Michael Krebs from KrebsonSecurity has an article on the “Lifecycle of a Data Breach.” The article reviews how information from past data breaches is typically used and recycled by attackers over time. Particularly T-Mobile users are likely to be targeted by specific phishing messages account takeovers and SIM swaps.

In fact according to Business insider users are already receiving phishing text messages on their T-Mobile phones.

Phishing attacks will likely leverage the public attention of the data breach to send affected users targeted emails. Now armed with your personal information attackers could easily craft a phishing email text message or phone call to make it appear even more legitimate.

SIM swaps are particularly scary because attackers now have names and phone numbers of more than $50 million users. With so many account services offering SMS-based password resets an attacker could easily reset an online password to their device using a SIM swap. High-profile users should be on particularly high alert for this kind of attack now that their phone numbers are exposed to the world.

T-Mobile is suggesting that all users reset their account passwords in an attempt to thwart account takeovers. However most services also use the last four digits of a user’s social security number as a passcode or backup verification method. An attacker possessing your name SSN and DOB has what they need to take over your account. This should serve as a warning to not just reset your T-Mobile passcode but also your passcode to other services you use and make sure the provider does not bypass that passcode with information the attacker may already possess.

IndexBox has just published a new report: ‘U.S. – Wireless Phones – Market Analysis Forecast Size Trends And Insights‘. Here is a summary of the report’s key findings.

In the first seven months of 2021 American mobile phone imports reached $29B which was +21% higher than the figures of the same period of 2020. The U.S. constitutes the world’s leading importer of mobile phones. Last year American imports dropped by -9.5% y-o-y to $49.5B. China remains the largest exporter of mobile phones to the U.S. supplying 79% of American imports in value terms. In the first half of 2021 Chinese exports to America grew by +45% to $20.5B compared to $14.1B recorded in the same period of 2020. The average mobile phone import price rose by +3.9% to $273 per unit in 2020.

American Wireless Phone Imports

In the first seven months of 2021 the U.S. imported wireless phones worth $29B against $24B in the same period of the last year. America leads in global imports of wireless phones with a 17%-share of the total volume.

American mobile phone imports saw a significant drop in the previous year declining from $54.7B in 2019 to $49.5B (IndexBox estimates) in 2020. In physical terms imports of wireless phones into the U.S. shrank to 181M units declining by -12.9% against 2019 figures.

In value terms China ($39.1B) constituted the largest supplier of mobile phone to the U.S. comprising 79% of total imports in 2020. Viet Nam ($8.1B) occupied the second position in the ranking with a 16% share of total imports. It was followed by South Korea with a 2.7% share. In the first half of 2021 Chinese wireless phone exports to the U.S. grew to $20.5B against $14.1B recorded in the same period of 2020.

In physical terms China (134M units) constituted the largest mobile phone supplier to the U.S. with a 74% share of total imports in 2020. Moreover mobile phone imports from China exceeded the figures recorded by the second-largest supplier Viet Nam (37M units) fourfold. The third position in this ranking was occupied by India (3.6M units) with a 2% share.

In 2020 the average mobile phone import price amounted to $273 per unit growing by +3.9% against the previous year. There were significant differences in the average prices amongst the major supplying countries. In 2020 the country with the highest price was South Korea ($488 per unit) while the price for India ($127 per unit) was amongst the lowest. In 2020 the most notable rate of growth in terms of prices was attained by India while the prices for the other major suppliers experienced mixed trend patterns.

The round was led by and  included new participation from and  and propels Socure’s valuation to $4.5 billion.

That story can be found here.

Johnny Ayers Founder and CEO of Socure

Q: Can you explain Socure and the services you offer?

A: We are hired today to answer two questions: ‘Is Joe a real person and is this Joe?’ That is an internet-wide problem and obviously a massive problem as it relates to fintechs that are trying to verify and file underbanked credit-invisible people.

It is really easy to commit fraud on the internet and so we have spent the better part of the last decade building a full end-to-end suite of services that look at every dimension of Joe’s identity. Name email phone address date of birth social IP velocity device behavioral physical documents pictures and liveness all in a single solution.

So we have 12 products today. We’re really the only pure play identity verification provider at this point. We’re the most highly valued private identity verification provider in the world.

Our customers look at us as a single solution versus patchworking and frankensteining all these different companies together. We enable them to verify the largest number of good identities with the least amount of fraud and solve for false positives and false negatives on each side.

These issues aren’t unique to FinTech and financial services although we do have four of the top five banks 12 of the top 15 issuers and most major fintechs use us. I think we have like 300 fintechs. We do Know Your Customer (KYC) fraud anti-money laundering (AML) and document authentication for every new account that is opened.

We also have the largest gaming providers the largest crypto exchanges the largest Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) providers the largest HR payroll companies three letter agencies state agencies and a bunch of the largest telehealth providers. And so it really kind of spans all of the different high-value high transaction volume highly regulated spaces where it’s really really important that you don’t get identification wrong.

Q: What has been the biggest driving factor when it comes to securing these big names and marketing to those that need your services?

A: I think that the biggest success that we’ve had is because the problem is very quantifiable … you can literally prove the value. We can prove that we can verify 10-15% more people then your whole prior stack combined. And if each customer is worth $300 times that by 10% times our 12 apps is your business case.

It’s been very quantifiable in building the business. I think that’s a huge value or we just say we’ll prove it. We’re the best we know we’re the best and we’ll prove are the best with your own data and your own labels and working with your data science or engineering teams to do so.

I think there’s also been a lot of persistence and grit from our team. Risk and compliance folks aren’t always the fastest moving nor should they be. And it’s just taken a tremendous amount of work to build the reputation that we have; as it relates to security as it relates to model governance as it relates to our ability to pass audits with  the  and the .

There’s a level of maturity that a startup just doesn’t have. It takes time to build up this muscle and so I think the success we’ve had really has been a combination of performance innovation and creativity in problem solving that our teams bring.

Q: As a follow up fintechs want to be fast and nimble. How do you balance being fast for fintech partners but also doing everything right to manage banks on the other side?

A: The nice thing is the solutions we’ve built can be scaled to end. I could have 10000 customers on the same solution: a  or or . They buy the same thing from us. So the speed is really in them making the change the speed is not on our side per se. This speed is their ability to test new solutions get them through their procurement engine get them on their roadmap get them live.

I think one of the benefits that fast-moving companies have is just size right? When you have one owner of risk one owner of compliance and one owner of acquisition you can move a lot faster than a company that has 300000 employees.

A company like Socure just couldn’t have existed 10 years ago in this venture-backed model because there just weren’t enough companies moving fast enough. And now 2/3 of our customers aren’t 15 years old. The pace in which they move and the scale that they’re moving is what enables us to post the growth numbers that you’re seeing. 226% customer growth 500% year-over-year bookings we’re at triple digit run-rate from a bookings perspective. It’s pretty massive growth that you just wouldn’t see with more established legacy institutions.

Q: You just raised a $450 million Series E. How do you plan on using that to further Socure’s goals?

A: Stating the obvious we’re very excited to announce the round. It’s obviously establishing us as the most valued identity verification company in the private markets which is pretty amazing from two of the best investors in the world in Accel and T. Rowe Price.

I think the first thing I’ll kind of break it into two tracks. One on the product perspective we will be the first to verify 100% of good identities and completely eliminate identity fraud. That is what we are heads down on we will be the first to solve that. That is a internet-wide societal problem that exists for every enterprise across the web. You’re even seeing   now doing identity verification. and their blue checkboxes tons of identity verifications. You’re really seeing this touch every part of the web.

The second on the product innovation line is: as we solve this identity-proofing problem and are the tip of the spear to verify ‘this is Joe’ we can then move into continuous authentication. When we are the establisher of identity we can move into authentication persistent identifier credentialing and enabling our customers to re-authenticate and re-verify their consumer over the lifecycle of their consumer. So we have like one big investment track there.

The second big product innovation track that we’re accelerating is we have this amazing network of nearly 1000 customers of the large guys the large growth guys and everyone else across the market. They’re coming to us saying ‘Hey Socure you’re solving this identity problem for me. Now can you solve this first-party problem this payment risk movement problem?’

Since we already have this network effect we have their data we have the piping built it becomes really easy to just add additional columns to the type of data that we’re sharing. And so this network becomes really really really valuable. We’ve built the largest identity graph in the space. We have our 8 billion rows of identity data almost a billion rows of known outcomes. We know that this is Joe so we can start to look at ‘Do I actually want to do business with Joe?’ or ‘Does Joe bounce checks is he disputing transactions? Does Joe have 25 shutdown accounts across this ecosystem?’

There becomes a lot more information that is really valuable in protecting the financial services ecosystem. Our customers are asking us to build a next iteration and then on the go-to-market track as you think about being the first to be able to verify every identity on the internet. How quickly can you bring that into telehealth and e-commerce marketplaces cannabis alcohol grocery delivery online gaming state agencies and federal agencies?

There’s this amazing societal benefit of what we’re working on. You can verify a larger number of people get them access to services based off socio-economic gender and ethnicity and then stop bad actors from stealing people’s money our government’s money. And so it’s a really fun problem.

We always viewed financial services as being the bedrock the foundation that we would initially build our business off of. It’s the highest regulated and the most secure. If we could establish trust with 12 of the top 15 banks and soon I’m sure we’ll have 15 of the top 15; if we can establish trust there you can move into these all these other verticals that obviously rely on the safety and stability of financial services.

Q: What are important indicators when it comes to deciding if someone will be financially responsible with loans and services?

A: One of the initial challenges that we’re seeing in digital banking is that you have repeat bad actors that are bouncing from fintech to fintech to finTech. Making false disputes and then the accounts being shut down but they’re just taking $1000 each.

We see this as being an enormous problem in digital banking. Banks want to know where the funding sources coming from because a lot of folks want to offer real time funds availability money before they get paid right money before the ACH clears. This is a place where banks are taking pretty material losses where they just want to know ‘Has Joe had a Bank of America account for 15 years and is it in good standing?’

And so it’s kind of like that query into a large network that our customers are saying ‘You’re solving this identity problem for me here’s the next problem. We want you guys to solve and build this as like kind of an overlay to your identity graph.’

Q: Accel and T. Rowe Price led this funding round. Why were they the right choices when it came to leading the round?

A: Accel lead our series D and I had spent a lot of time for both that round and this round researching funds partners investment strategies where they are in the life cycle of their fund who is really helpful to the partnership and passive capital versus active capital. It’s kind of all this pre-work that I like to do. And just across the board I think Accel is viewed as best-in-class growth equity investors.

When we looked at capital markets groups at the biggest banks you can probably guess who all of them had really marked Tiger and T. Rowe as best-in-class crossover investors. All of them had said look ‘If you’re designing an optimal round and can have a hedge fund and a mutual fund these are two of the best that exists in the world.’ We wanted to raise the round so that we could really accelerate a number of these exciting strategic opportunities to service more of our customers and new markets.

We also wanted to find partners that were going to be capital partners for the next 10+ years. And from from my research I found that Andrew from T. Rowe and John from Tiger had really tremendous reputation in the market. Their funds and their teams had tremendous reputations and we felt that they would be great partners as we make this eventual transition from private to public markets.

We were very fortunate with our growth numbers with the customers that we have the benefit of serving every day. We’re picking between A and A+ investors so we’re very fortunate in that regard.

Q: As you continue to scale and get bigger I just want to ask where you’re looking for talent and where you think the best places to find talent are?

A: I’d say far and wide. We’ve been very fortunate to build an amazingly diverse and talented team. We continue to look through academia we continue to look through blogs through referrals through prior teammates through new vendors. We’re really kind of looking looking across the map and it’s a big part of this race as you can imagine. We want to be a place for people that are excited and interested in solving this problem and complimentary problems where this is a place where they want to come work for the next 10 years.

We are hiring about 100 people in Q4. We’re going to grow from like 150 to 500 this year and are looking to grow from 500 to 1000 next year. We are casting the net wide retained search recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) contingency search. We have an amazing group of internal recruiters we have referrals for our existing employees we pay referrals for non-employees.

We want to find the most amazing people that we can no matter where they come from. This is a place where they can come do their best work and shine and hopefully shine for a long time as we build a huge time-standing company.

Q: I wanted to ask you about predictive DocV. I’ve been seeing a lot of innovation and news around that and when it comes to machine learning. What are the challenges when it comes to document automation and risk?

A: We build machine learning models. That’s what we do. We have 75 data scientists some of the best PhDs in math and physics that we can find. Our predictive document verification solution utilizes the industry’s only patent-pending classification models that pull from computer vision algorithms pulls from various dimensions across identity. Phone ownership device liveness and facial recognition looking at very specific things across every point not just the document.

This is allowing us to derive very specific fine-tuned patterns that allow us to deliver the most accurate authentication and classification document verification solution in the market. Most solutions are either using people for 40% to 60% of all verifications which obviously does not scale at the speed of the Internet. They’re using very heuristic-based models.

We believe that because Socure has built out every dimension of a consumer’s identity in a single service we are uniquely positioned to have this enormous device graph enormous phone ownership graph enormous predictability as it relates to the pie that’s on the document in a way that this is a precision recall problem.

The ability to verify is an age old problem. Is this passport or driver’s license real? At the same time fraudsters are building tools on their own. They’re getting very sophisticated in terms of beating spoofing masks and deep fakes getting very good at beating the system. And there’s varying levels of document authentication. There’s OCR there’s basic pattern recognition there’s full authentication and then you get into likeness. And one to five in terms of pad testing. All these are variations that I think are most people don’t fully understand and appreciate as it relates to ‘How do you really solve this problem more accurately than anyone else?’

Q: KYC and AML are some of the most important focuses for fintechs and financial institutions moving forward. What do you think are the biggest challenges facing the industry at large and where are things moving forward as far as innovation?

A: We’re very heads down focused on being the first to verify 100% of good identities. That today is an unsolved problem. When you think about the Venmo Cash Apps and Chimes of the world [they] are looking to bring services to everyone. KYC/AML is an enormous problem that sits across really everyone you cover.

The second is as data breaches continue to grow more data becomes available and attacks are getting more and more sophisticated. As folks provide real-time funds availability and real-time money the target on their back becomes very big because it’s very lucrative to steal the correct amount of money. That’s available across the web and I think there’s this near-term enterprise problem in probably three to five years.

When this is like fully solved and broadly deployed across the internet and we believe we’re going to technically solve it in the next couple of months how long does it take the adoption cycle across all enterprises to pick the market leader and get it fully deployed across the web? I think that’ll take a couple of years. Then how do we solve this in ecosystems?

How can a trusted Identity be ported across different enterprises different application and ecosystems? Eventually can Joe actually own his identity at scale and utilize it as an assertion as you go to different sites with something that’s tokenized on your device? Our work is to solve this at the enterprise level solve it in an ecosystem of enterprises and then take it to the consumer in a way where this is a fully solved problem and we can give the consumer control.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On November 11 according to the folks over at the GTA modding site LibertyCity Take-Two contacted them and used DMCA strikes to remove three different GTA-related mods. The three removed mods are listed below:

GTA Advance PC Port Beta 2

The Lost and Damned Unlocked for GTA 4

GTA IV EFLC The Lost And Damned (65%)

GTA Advance PC Port is a fan-developed project attempting to port the game into the GTA 3 engine. Developed by Digital Eclipse GTA Advance was only released on the GameBoy Advance in 2004.

The Lost and Damned Unlocked for GTA IV is a mod released in 2009 which lets players swap out the star of GTA IV Niko Bellic with the protagonist of the Lost and Damned DLC biker Johnny Klebitz. It also included some new biker outfits and icons.

Finally GTA IV EEFLC (65%) isn’t even a mod! It’s just a save file for the game that lets players start from 65% completion. Yes Take-Two used a DMCA strike against a save file for a game released over a decade ago.

These are just the latest in a growing number of GTA mods Take-Two has gone after and removed using legal DMCA notices. Over the last year the company has been on a takedown spree like a GTA character on a rampage. It has also sued fan devs over source code projects and led to some old mods like GTA Underground shutting down over fears of more legal and financial trouble.

The last time these kinds of mod takedowns happened they mostly targeted classic PS2-era GTA games like Vice City. Not long after and following Kotaku’s own report in August Rockstar confirmed remastered versions of all three classic PS2 GTA games were to be released this year. Those games have since released earlier this week to mostly negative reactions with fans sharing numerous bugs and graphical glitches on Twitter and Reddit.

Because of what happened last time some are speculating that these takedowns are evidence that a GTA IV remaster might be coming sometime in the future. According to sources who have spoken to Kotaku in the past about Rockstar’s future remasters GTA IV as well as Red Dead Redemption remasters are possible. Though plans can and do change and with the recent backlash facing the GTA remasters Rockstar might be more hesitant to greenlight future re-releases.

Regardless of if these takedowns are evidence of a future GTA IV remaster or not it still is a frustrating situation for modders and community devs who have spent decades improving porting and maintaining the classic GTA games allowing fans to play them years after Rockstar had moved on. Kotaku spoke to some modders who seemed fed up with Rockstar and many more have moved on to other games from other companies worried about the potential legal pitfalls for continuing to mod Grand Theft Auto titles.

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick may have revealed why GTA 6 is taking so long to release as fans continue to wait for the highly-anticipated title.

Grand Theft Auto fans around the world are still awaiting the follow-up to Rockstar Games’ incredibly successful GTA 5 but the release of GTA 6 continues to evade them.

Depending on who you believe the highly-anticipated title is either close to completion or stuck in “development hell” with a reveal not getting any closer.

Some past rumors have suggested that while Rockstar worked on Red Dead Redemption 2 following GTA 5 they may have had work ongoing for GTA 6 at the same time. Though Take-Two may have dispelled that noting they do plan to “rest” titles at times to build up anticipation.

Rockstar Games There have been plenty of rumors about GTA 6 but nothing official yet.

Speaking at the Jefferies Virtual Global Interactive Entertainment Conference Take-Two’s Strauss Zelnick noted that he believes titles like GTA can have James Bond-like longevity where they never really go out of fashion and always have hype.

He also shed some light on the fact that some games are purposefully delayed to build anticipation. “It’s also about being willing to rest a title so you have a sense that ‘wow this is a rare event.’ I’ve always said that annualizing non-sports titles runs the risk of burning out the intellectual property even if it’s good” he said according to TweakTown.

“We take the time to make something we think is incredibly phenomenal and we also rest titles intentionally so there’s pent-up demand for that title so it’s a special event. I go to see a Bond film because there isn’t another one in two months. I’m going to see every Bond film and if it’s bad I’m going to be really upset – it’ll be like a personal affront because I believe that IP is great. And that’s the compact that Rockstar has with its consumers.”

The webpage described the content as: “The GTA Advance PC Port Beta 2 is a fan-remake of GTA Advance for GTA 3. The original 2D-game was developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Rockstar Games in 2004. The game was released only for the Game Boy Advance.

“The Lost and Damned Unlocked mod for GTA 4 was uploaded in 2009. It swapped Niko with biker Johnny Klebitz the protagonist of the The Lost and Damned episode. The mod included its outfits bikes and weapon icons.

“The GTA IV EFLC The Lost And Damned is simply a save game file with 65% of the story completed. It’s not even a mod” the post added.

Take-Two have previously gone after mods connected to GTA 3 GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas shortly before the GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition was announced. This leads some to expect a remaster of GTA 4 to be announced soon.

However the recent remaster has received a lot of player criticism. The new title has been review bombed on Metacritic and users are demanding refunds. The games scored 0.6 out of ten on PC 0.5 on Xbox Series X 1.0 on PS5 and 0.6 on Nintendo Switch all as of November 14.

The Ceres Rail Company's steam train has laid dormant since March 2020.

It resumes service on 28 November travelling from Cape Town to Elgin.

The Class 19 D steam locomotive or ""a Dolly"" as it's affectionally known departs from Cape Town's foreshore at 07:45.

And arrives at the Elgin Railway Market which once was an old apple warehouse around 4 hours later.

The Ceres Rail Company's iconic steam train will resume its travels between Cape Town and Elgin on 28 November after being halted since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Ceres Railway track which carried its first steam locomotive through the fertile Elgin Valley in 1912 has fallen silent for the past 20 months. Prior to the pandemic the vintage steam train provided a regular weekend escape back in time departing from Dockrail Road in Cape Town and chugging its way to the Elgin Railway Market.

The trip takes about four hours with the train winding its way up Sir Lowry's Pass before descending into Grabouw and the valley below best known for its green tapestry of apple and pear orchards.

After a prolonged absence the Ceres Rail Company is hosting a grand reopening of the route on the last Sunday of November. It's a special opportunity for media and invited guests to experience the rail and market. Thereafter regular trips will resume every Saturday and Sunday.

Passengers aboard the Class 19 D steam locomotive – affectionately known as ""a Dolly"" – will have around three hours to explore the Elgin Railway Market. Originally an old apple warehouse built along the tracks in the 1940s the present-day market has a steampunk aesthetic with copper fixtures ornate balustrades and old brick walls.

The market hosts a variety of food stalls and retail booths selling jewellery genuine leather goods and even bespoke braai tools. There's a bar that serves local wines beer and cider and a wine shop stocked with Elgin and Bot River wines.

The Ceres Rail Company offers five different types of tickets for the return ride from Cape Town to Elgin.

Day Seating in restaurant-type booth costs R625 per person.

Bar Lounge Seating only available to passengers of the age of 18 costs R625 per person.

Family Coupe suited for a maximum of three adults or two adults with two children offers privacy and costs R1500 per unit.

The Family Compartment suited for a maximum of six adults or four adults with two children costs R2900 per unit.

The Observation Car described as ""best seat in the house"" is suitable for large groups of up to 28 people with air-conditioning optional private bar optional exclusive catering and all-round views costs R850 per person (groups of 15 – 28).

The steam train has a fully licensed bar on board and serves a variety of snacks and refreshments.

The train departs from Harbour Bridge Hotel on Dockrail Road at the Foreshore in Cape Town at 07:45 and arrives at the Elgin Railway Market at 11:30. The trains begins its return journey to Cape Town at 14:15 and arrives back between 17:30 and 18:15.

The offshore wind farm is the first commercial one to operate in South Korea. (Korea South-East Power Co.) An aerial view of wind turbines off west coast of Jeju Island under Tamra Offshore Wind Power which has a combined 30-megawatt in power capacity.

South Korea is in need of more aggressive investment in renewable energy sector in order to achieve its offshore wind capacity goal by 2030 and address the country’s geographical weaknesses in wind energy a report showed Sunday.



Korea was ranked 21st in terms of attractiveness of renewable energy investment and deployment opportunities in a report that announces the top 40 countries in the assessment according to London-based consulting firm Ernst & Young.



Korea has slid down the rankings from 13th in November 2020 to 17th in May 2021 although Asia’s fourth-largest economy improved its score to 57.6 points in EY’s Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index the highest yet. The index assesses a country‘s technology capacity to take advantage of renewable energy resources -- ranging from wind to solar biomass geothermal and hydrogen -- with the United States topping the list at 72.8 points followed by China on 70.7 points.



“South Korea looks set to struggle to meet its ambitious renewable energy target of 12-gigawatts of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030 without significant investment and buy-in from heavy industry leaders” the report read.



“Fixed-bottom offshore wind appears unsuitable so Seoul must bank on the development of floating offshore technology.”



This contrasts with EY’s assessment on the Korean offshore wind market a year prior which noted that Korea‘s offshore wind sector is “proving highly attractive” following Seoul’s announcement of its Green New Deal policy to reach 20 percent of generation from renewable sources by 2030.



Korea’s Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index has been weighed down by delays in ongoing offshore wind projects caused by slow approval processes a lack of financial support and resistance from local residents according to EY’s Korean arm Ernst & Young Han Young.



Moreover the volatility in power supply that arises from an increase in renewable power generation is posing a challenge to Korea’s current power grid infrastructure.



“(Korea) must boost investment in power grid infrastructure by around 50 percent over the next 10 years in order to achieve sustainability in line with the net-zero gas emission goal” said Kim Bum-choong partner at Ernst & Young Han Young who leads its Energy & Infrastructure sector.



Korea had installed 1.6 gigawatts of onshore and offshore wind capacity as of 2020 according to data by the Korea Wind Energy Industry Association. Offshore wind accounted for just 8.7 percent of that.



Korea saw its first commercial offshore wind farm in November 2017 located off west coast of Jeju Island.



Neighboring Japan is faring better. Japan which has maintained eighth spot in the Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index over the past 18 months is building its first offshore wind foundation plant to develop a local supply base in targeting expansion of offshore wind capacity.

Read our previous Succession recap here.

A Waystar shareholders’ meeting took center stage in an especially tense installment of Succession this week with the Roy family’s control of the company hanging in the balance.

A grumpy Logan arrives for the meeting walking with a cane and protestors have gathered outside with the news calling the impending vote “too close to call.” Logan thinks Sandy and Stewy want too much and is willing to take it to a vote — but it doesn’t look good. (“Tomorrow we’re all gonna apply for jobs at the same branch of Target” Roman quips.) Logan’s waiting to hear from the President who’s getting hammered by ATN while Shiv rushes around in a panic and Connor sees the chaos as an opportunity to squeeze out some concessions for himself. You know typical Roy family stuff.

Kendall meets with Stewy and warns him that Logan is dead-set on taking this to a vote so Stewy calls Gerri and offers to meet. Everyone on the Roy side celebrates… except for Logan. “What do they know that we don’t know?” he wonders. (This is why he’s the big boss folks.) They meet with Sandy — who’s in poor health and unable to speak in a wheelchair — and Stewy along with Sandy’s daughter Sandi who speaks on her dad’s behalf. Stewy thinks they can make a deal but they want the ability to veto any Roy as CEO. Shiv and Roman naturally bristle at this but Sandi insists it’s a dealbreaker: “It would be a shame if you destroyed all this hard work over a detail.” Meanwhile Connor is trying to weasel a company role for himself in Europe out of Logan and Roman isn’t happy that Gerri seemed open to the idea of keeping all Roys out of the CEO chair. (Do we sense a lovers’ quarrel brewing?)

Greg arrives at Kendall’s war room and apologizes for defecting to Logan’s side and Kendall says he understands… but he adds “I may have to burn you.” Meaning he may have to throw Greg under the bus to keep the investigation going. When Greg reminds him that he said he’d never burn him Kendall tells him “A lot of s–t gets said… You’ll probably be fine.” (Well that’s reassuring.) Plus Greg’s grandfather Ewan is angry that he went back to Waystar and is changing his will to give all his money to Greenpeace. (Greg: “Even my part?” Ewan: “That was the first part.”) So yeah not a great week for Greg the Egg so far.

While Frank takes the stage at the shareholders’ meeting and stalls for time Shiv is confident they can reach a deal after they iron out a few details. Logan doesn’t like the sound of the deal — but he’s also asking random people in the room what they think which is a bit worrying. And when Sandi wants to take away the Roy family’s private jets as part of the deal Logan says “F—k ’em” so Shiv tells her the deal is off and the vote is back on. (“I just do what my dad tells me” Shiv says which is giving us big Season 2 Kendall flashbacks.) But the clock is ticking and Tom warns Shiv: Logan is completely out of it and talking gibberish. His assistant Kerry says he has a UTI and if he doesn’t take his medication he gets loopy. (“Reagan had one and he nearly nuked Belgium” Connor notes.)

Now they’re not sure whether they can trust what Logan is saying… and he’s busy looking for an invisible cat under his chair. Just then Kendall barges in and wants to know why they torpedoed the deal ordering them to fix it before storming off. While Gerri gets roped into replacing Frank and stalling for more time on stage a doctor gives Logan a fast-acting medication via injection Roman takes an angry call from the President (“I will certainly let him know that you are upset”) and Shiv takes it upon herself to strike a deal with Sandi.

They meet one-on-one in private and Shiv agrees to get rid of the jets and even sweetens the deal by offering Sandi a seat on the board for herself — as long as Shiv gets one for herself too. The President tells Roman he’s not running for reelection thanks to Logan’s harassment campaign (Connor’s ears perk up at this) and Shiv reports back that they’ve struck a deal. They all celebrate and Tom sweeps Shiv up in a passionate embrace… and announces he wants to impregnate her before he goes to prison. Karl tells the shareholders a settlement has been reached and no vote will be needed — and he’s interrupted by Kendall who rushes the stage to read the names of the victims of “crimes that took place on our watch” and announces he’s starting a foundation in their honor. (This is met with confused scattered applause.)

A now-coherent Logan won’t be happy though until he sees the fine print of the deal. Shiv reminds him that he was out of it but he insists “I’d have figured it out.” And when she tries to hand him a flute of Champagne to celebrate he pushes it away and spills it barking at her: “Stop buzzing in my f–king ear.” (Ouch.) A hurt Shiv retreats as Logan gives Roman a congratulatory pat on the back. Kendall gets a message that Logan wants to meet with him but when he arrives for the meeting he’s informed that Logan already left. He tries to call his father but Logan sees the number and hands his phone to Kerry asking her to block his number… “permanently.”

Raymarine has announced another successful trading year reporting a sustained increase in product sales since Q2 2020.

The company’s acquisition by the global technology giant Teledyne in May 2021 has reinforced Raymarine’s position as one of the world’s leading marine electronics brands. Six months after the acquisition Raymarine engineers have been able to further explore technologies within the wider group and have been able to develop a roadmap which sees these opportunities realized with future product introductions.

With a solid and stable corporate ownership structure in place and a robust strategy for innovation and growth its senior management team has been restructured to manage the additional resources and oversee execution effectively. The brand will focus considerable efforts on scaling up processes while retaining and attracting the best talent for the organization.

The demonstration of corporate confidence and investment is reflected in the recent selection of two new senior managers at Raymarine’s head office in Fareham Hampshire. The company has appointed Peter Ingram as its VP of Marketing and Michelle Hildyard as its VP of Product Management and Business Development.

Formerly Interim General Manager and Vice President of Finance at Raymarine Ingram brings 14 years of experience in the Maritime industry to the table in advancing the brand’s global strategic marketing activity. Michelle Hildyard meanwhile leverages her considerable experience from her previous role as Vice President of Customer Service and 17 years in the Maritime industry to direct and maintain the constant product innovation for which the company is renowned.

In addition the brand is actively recruiting in engineering product management sales and marketing in line with its ambitious innovation and growth plans.

“This is a very exciting time for the company” says Gregoire Outters Raymarine Vice-President & General Manager. “As well as congratulating Peter and Michelle for their new senior management roles we’re looking forward to welcoming new recruits who will undoubtedly bring fresh insights to our operations. I am looking forward to seeing the new products in the market and implementing our growth plan to ultimately see the technologies out on the water.“",,,,,,,,,

A recent perusal of Tesla's website showed the base Model Y Long Range now starting at $60190. This version has 318 miles of range dual-motor all-wheel drive and can do 0-60 mph in 4.8 seconds per Tesla. The Model Y Performance—the only other trim level available—starts at $65190. It's rated 303 miles of range but can do 0-60 mph in a claimed 3.5 seconds.

2021 Tesla Model Y

With the absence of a Model Y Standard Range that makes the base price of the Model Y $17000 more than earlier this year when the Standard Range variant was still available. Tesla just raised the base price of the Model Y by $2000 in early October. This latest increase done in the shadow of an expected EV tax credit revamp that would once again make some Tesla vehicles eligible raises the price by another $4000.

For reference the original base price of the 2012 Model S was $57400 (plus destination). By later in 2012 the 2013 model was bumped up to $59900. Today's version of the Model S has far more standard range standard all-wheel drive more sophisticated tech and a $96190 base price.

Production simplification for Model Y vs. Model 3 - from Tesla Q1 2020 report

Tesla is preparing to begin Model Y production at its new Texas factory. Cars built in Texas will have higher-density 4680 battery cells plus new body-structure production methods. The larger 4680 cells may also be what finally gets the long-delayed Tesla Semi into production. Tesla has said its modest ramp-up of those cells so far could allow for some deliveries before the end of the year.

Tesla has also indicated that Model 3 and Model Y vehicles with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells—a chemistry currently used only in China—are likely for the United States market as well. Perhaps that will bring the Model Y back into the realm of affordability for more families.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xNC9pbnZlc3RpbmcvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXdlYWx0aC10YXhwYXllci1zdXBwb3J0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzExLzE0L2ludmVzdGluZy9lbG9uLW11c2std2VhbHRoLXRheHBheWVyLXN1cHBvcnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's how Elon Musk's fortune has benefited from taxpayer help,"New York CNN Business —

Elon Musk can thank investors for his staggering net worth of nearly $300 billion. But taxpayers played a crucial role as well.

Just how much — or how little — Musk pays in taxes has gotten a lot of attention lately and even prompted his Twitter poll last weekend that preceded his decision to sell $6.9 billion worth of Tesla stock. There have been calls in Congress for a billionaires’ tax that would require at least some minimal payment from wealthy individuals like Musk who often have little in the way of taxable income. Musk has attacked that idea on Twitter.

But just how much of his wealth is due to the government support his companies receive is not an easy question to answer. By some measures little of his wealth is thanks to taxpayers. And in some ways virtually all of it is.

Musk’s wealth is based on the value of his companies including Tesla (TSLA) which is only the sixth US company in history to be worth more than $1 trillion and SpaceX believed to be the nation’s most valuable privately-held enterprise with an estimated value of more than $100 billion.

But those valuations are based mostly on investors’ belief in their future sales and profits not the relatively modest financial results those companies have shown to date. Tesla sales and earnings for example represent a fraction of other long-established automakers.

Tesla saw global sales of 627000 vehicles in the first nine months of this year and net income of $3.2 billion both records for the company. But global sales at Toyota were 10 times greater and its net revenue was 2.3 trillion yen or $20.3 billion more than six times Tesla’s.

Even so Tesla shares more than triple the value of Toyota’s market cap. And Toyota is the world’s second most valuable automaker. Tesla’s market cap is roughly equal to that of the 12 largest automakers in the world combined.

Without taxpayer support however neither Tesla nor SpaceX would have survived this long and investors never would have had the chance to make massive bets on both companies.

Don’t take our word for it. Ask Musk himself.

Billions from regulatory credits

In a tweet last year Musk admitted that Tesla nearly was forced to file for bankruptcy as recently at 2019. The stock price that seems unstoppable today had been floundering among investor’s justified concern that the company was facing a cash crunch as it had difficulty ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan.

“Closest we got [to bankruptcy] was about a month ago” he said in that 2020 tweet. “The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production & logistics hell.”

What Musk didn’t say was that one of the keys that kept the company alive was the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers.

Environmental regulations require companies that are not meeting emission standards to pay fines or buy credits generated by companies that comply with the rules. And no one had more of those credits to sell than all-electric Tesla.

Between 2008 and the first half of 2019 sales of regulatory credits generated more than $2 billion that was crucial to the company’s survival. And the increased car sales ever since have resulted in additional credits that Tesla sold for another $3 billion since June of 2019.

That allowed the company to show profits sooner than it would have without the credits lifting the value of the stock. In fact it wasn’t until the second quarter this year that Tesla reported more in net income than it got from regulatory credit sales.

“It was really US taxpayers that helped get him through his roughest time” said Dan Ives tech analyst with Wedbush Securities who is a bull on Tesla shares — today. In 2019 he was still skeptical as the company struggled.

“If it didn’t have regulatory credits Tesla would not be the brand it is around the globe and Musk wouldn’t be the richest person in the world” Ives said.

Other billions for Tesla

That wasn’t the only government assistance for Tesla. In January 2010 the company received a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy months before its initial public offering when it was still in need of cash. It was able to pay the loan back early but only through proceeds from an additional sale of stock in 2013.

The company also has benefited from the substantial tax credits car buyers receive when they buy a Tesla or other plug-in vehicles. Those tax dollars went to the buyers and not directly to the company but the incentive allowed Tesla to charge more for its cars than it otherwise could. In fact when the $7500 federal tax credit on Tesla purchases was halved to $3750 in early 2019 Tesla responded by cutting the price of its cars by $2000 to remain competitive.

Tesla buyers received total federal tax credits worth an estimated $3.4 billion before the perk disappeared entirely at the end of 2019. Even if that only allowed Tesla to raise prices by half that amount that’s another $1.7 billion in federal help on top of the $5 billion it has received— so far — from regulatory credit sales.

NASA saves SpaceX

And then there’s SpaceX which is a smaller but still significant source of Musk’s wealth. The taxpayer support for this venture is even more clear since it comes in the form of direct government contracts that are worth billions.

According to Sam.gov the government database that tracks federal spending Space X has signed contracts worth nearly $10 billion. None was more crucial than the one the company received just before Christmas in 2008 when Space X and Musk were both virtually out of cash.

That contract to fly 12 supply missions to the International Space Station was worth $1.6 billion. The deal was crucial because it allowed the company to complete work on its Falcon 9 rocket its main workhorse as well as the Dragon capsule that would carry supplies and eventually crew said Casey Dreier senior space policy advisory for the Planetary Society a public interest group advocating space flight.

“They were right on the edge of insolvency” Dreier said. “Elon has pointed out at that moment they were on the edge and that helped to save the company.”

Dreier said the ISS and other contracts have worked out well for NASA too allowing the agency to use SpaceX rather than relying on the Russians to transport US astronauts.

SpaceX has since gotten numerous additional government contracts from NASA the military and other US government agencies. It won a $3 billion contract to develop the next vehicle to carry astronauts to the surface of the moon. And Dreier said SpaceX and other NASA contractors also benefit from the agency’s in-kind support including access to NASA employees and expertise.

On Reddit and Twitter posts started coming in Friday about new Tesla deliveries with parts missing in the electric vehicles. One person posted about their 2022 Model 3 with missing USB-C ports in the front center console. A photo showed the empty slots in the console. Usually that's where you can plug in a charging cord. The wireless phone charging unit also wasn't working because of what turned out to be missing parts.

Another person with a new Model Y noticed the same problem with holes where the connectors were supposed to be.

A representative at the Tesla Service Center in San Francisco told Mashable that supply chain issues and a chip shortage are slowing down deliveries. Therefore some cars are arriving with some non-crucial components missing. But the rep — who it should be noted can only speak for the SF service center — said affected owners will be notified once the parts are ready. At that point owners will be advised to bring the car in for service to fill in any um gaps. The rep said some parts are already being shipped and should be available for installation in the coming weeks.

For Jon Nguyen in Orange County California he almost overlooked the fact that his new Model Y was missing charging ports and connections. In a phone call with Mashable he said he went to his local Tesla center on Wednesday to pick up the new electric SUV.

He was checking that everything worked when he put his iPhone 13 Pro on the charging pad in the center console. When it wouldn't charge no matter how he placed it on the mat he asked to try the charging pad on a nearby woman's Model 3 (she was also picking up her EV that day). It worked in her vehicle.

So Nguyen said he went back and told the service rep about the charging issue. She first suggested a problem with the iPhone but then posited an issue with the charging pad. It wasn't until she got a phone call from Tesla corporate that it was clear what was going on: Nguyen's car hadn't come with certain parts installed.

The Tesla owner's manual for the Model 3 and Y lists two front USB-C ports along with two in the back. ""I look and sure enough there's nothing there just two little holes"" Nguyen said.

It's unclear if any drivers are told up front that their vehicle won't have all features at delivery. But like Nguyen new owners should check all the parts of the car and see if anything is missing.

He was told to schedule a mobile service appointment through the Tesla app. When the parts are ready Tesla added they'd come and install those. He said they told him to wait two weeks but he's expecting a longer delay. For those with missing parts be sure to file a service request immediately so there's a record on your account.

We reached out to Tesla for more on the missing USB-C ports but haven't heard back yet.

Other carmakers are also struggling to offer all the usual features because of the chip shortage. General Motors has pulled heated seats while BMW has had to cut touchscreens in some of its cars."

3. Raghu reads in his spare time

Another activity that Raghu enjoys when he is not busy attending to his work responsibilities is readers. He reads so much that he is referred to as an encyclopedia. From the information that he has shared about his interests and hobbies we are confident in assuming that he is a well-rounded guy who takes the time for things that are important to him. He stops to enjoy the little things in life when he's not attending to business.

4. Raghu has worked as a consultant

Before he turned his interest to executive leadership and entrepreneurship Raghu was a consultant. He worked for a company called Feedback Ventures. He spent three years in the position but he knew in his heart that the job was not where he was supposed to be or long. He had a longing to be an entrepreneur and to run his enterprise. He left the position to follow his dreams.

5. Raghunandan G was educated in India

After leaving Feedback Ventures Raghu began a new chapter in his professional life. He founded a company called Serendipity Infolabs Pvt. Ltd in November of 2010. He served as the founder and director of the company for four years and 6 months leaving in April of 2015.

8. Raghu is a whiz at multitasking

He served as founder and director of the company until April of 2015 leaving after 4 years and 4 months. He was successful in running two companies at the same time which is evidence that tells us he is a master of multitasking. He also has a strong work ethic and is willing to jump in and do the tasks required to make a business successful.

9. He is also the founder and owner of Zolve

Raghunandan G is not only the chief executive officer of Zolve he is also the founder and owner of the company. He works full-time at the company since its launch in 2020. Zolve is a brand new enterprise that has only been in operation for 11 months as of October of 2021. Zolve is the first cross-border neo-bank in the world. His purpose for creating Zolve is to make global financial products accessible to everyone in the world. The company is currently functional in two countries but Raghu has plans to increase that number to 20 shortly. Zolve offers an operational bank account along with a credit card with a high spending limit. He is helping to bring the world of digital finance to a larger segment of the population through Zolve. So far the company is doing very well and it's on a positive forward trajectory.

10. Raghunandan G is a serial entrepreneur

When reviewing Raghu's career history we see an impressive pattern. He is a serial entrepreneur who has founded multiple organizations running some of them simultaneously. He also founded a company called Startups in May of 2015. His role in the company is Start-up Enthusiast. He is presently involved with the company and has been active in helping himself and others in the field of entrepreneurship. Raghu has invested in a total of 18 startup companies to help them become established and prosperous also getting in on the ground floor of these exciting new business ventures as an investor with a stake in their success.

This story is updated to remove the inaccurate information.

DUBAI United Arab Emirates — The Royal Thai Air Force has awarded a $143 million contract to Textron Aviation for eight Beechcraft AT-6 Wolverine aircraft ground support equipment spare parts training and other equipment.

Thailand’s deal with the American company on the first day of the Dubai Airshow makes it the first international customer of the light attack aircraft. Under the contract work will take place at the company’s Wichita Kansas facility.

Thomas Hammoor president and CEO of Textron Aviation Defense said in a statement that the Royal Thai Air Force selected the Beechcraft AT-6 to conduct a broad array of missions in support of border security as well as anti-smuggling counternarcotics and anti-human trafficking operations.

“The RTAF is a key U.S. security ally and operator of one of the most advanced air forces in Asia Pacific. Its extensive market research and stringent procurement process sought the alignment of best cost schedule and performance to replace its existing fleet of aging Aero L-39 Albatros aircraft and advance the capabilities of its fleet with the latest technology” he added.

The contract for the AT-6 — designated the Beechcraft AT-6TH in Thailand — supports the country’s modernization priorities and the mutual defense cooperation agreement between the U.S. and Thailand a company statement said. The American firm also said the contract contributes to the growth of Thailand’s aerospace industry as detailed in the 10-year Royal Thai Air Force Purchase and Development (P&D) Plan and aligns with the country’s so-called S-Curve 11 strategy — a program partly meant to back the domestic defense industry.

The AT-6 is on display at the Dubai Airshow where its pilot told Defense News that the aircraft flew from the United States to the United Arab Emirates passing through 11 countries to refuel for a total of 33 flying hours.

“AT-6 will take part in the continued light-attack experiment which facilitates working with other nations to highlight the interoperability through a capability to network communications — the AERONet” Fouad Kasri Textron Aviation Defense’s regional sales vice president for the Middle East and North Africa told Defense News referring to the U.S. Air Force-designed data link meant to provide battlefield situational awareness. “Other countries are looking for exporting [the] AeroNet to get a 360-[degree] view of the battlespace and to increase the interoperability between nations.”

Textron Aviation Defense training of Thai maintenance professionals will begin in Thailand in 2023 according to a company statement with pilot training to begin in Wichita in 2024. The AT-6 are to join the Royal Thai fleet in 2024 the statement said.

In October 2019 the U.S. State Department gave the green light to Tunisia to enter talks with Textron for its trainer and light-attack aircraft requirements. And in December 2020 Textron Aviation delivered an AT-6 Wolverine to the U.S. Air Force; the second aircraft is expected to arrive next month.

Textron Aviation Defense LLC announced on Nov. 14 2021 a contract for eight Beechcraft AT-6 Wolverine aircraft ground support equipment spare parts training and other equipment with the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF). The $143 million contract will provide an Integrated System in support of the 41st Wing light attack operations at Chiang Mai Air Base.

As we reported last year the conclusion of the Light Attack Experiment (LAE) resulted in orders for only a couple each of Sierra Nevada/Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucanos and Textron Aviation Defense’s Beechcraft AT-6 Wolverines. However we noticed “the USAF decision to be the launch customer of the AT-6E clears the path for foreign adoption of the platform through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program as well as via Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). In any case the AT-6E’s successful completion of both Light Attack Experiment (LAE) Phases I & II — including a Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP) and austere field landing demonstrations – makes it a compelling addition to the export market.”

The contract signed today establishes Thailand as the international launch customer for the USAF’s latest light attack aircraft the AT-6E.

The USAF previously adopted two AT-6E aircraft (the first received in February 2021) to support low cost communication and data sharing architecture among allies and partners through a program called the Airborne Extensible Relay Over the Horizon Network (AEROnet). The AT-6 continues under evaluation in the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) “Armed Overwatch” initiative. The Royal Thai Air Force aircraft will be designated the Beechcraft AT-6TH.

“We are honored the Royal Thai Air Force has competitively selected the Beechcraft AT-6 to conduct a broad array of missions in support of its border security and its anti-smuggling counter-narcotics and anti-human trafficking operations” Textron Aviation Defense LLC President and CEO Thomas Hammoor commented.

The eight-unit order along with ground support equipment spare parts training and other equipment will support the 41st Wing light attack operations at Chiang Mai Air Base.

The purchase will allow RTAF to replace its existing fleet of aging Aero L-39 Albatros aircraft from 2024 when the first AT-6 is scheduled to join the Royal Thai fleet. The US Air Force received its first Wolverine in February this year.

The Beechcraft AT-6 Wolverine turboprop is designed and manufactured by Textron Aviation Defense at the company’s Wichita Kansas facilities.

“We are honored the Royal Thai Air Force has competitively selected the Beechcraft AT-6 to conduct a broad array of missions in support of its border security and its anti-smuggling counter-narcotics and anti-human trafficking operations” said Thomas Hammoor president and chief executive officer of Textron Aviation Defense LLC.

The contract for the AT-6 — designated the Beechcraft AT-6TH in Thailand — is the country’s second with Textron. In September 2020 Thailand signed a $162 million contract with Textron Aviation Defense for the delivery of 12 Beechcraft T-6C Texan II aircraft as part of an integrated training solution.

Both purchases align with the Thai government’s S-Curve 11 strategy — a program that pioneers development of the Thai domestic defense industry cultivates diversity and supports involvement across foreign and Thai companies.

Textron will start delivering training to RTAF maintenance professionals for the AT-6TH in Thailand in 2023 while pilot training is set to begin in Wichita in 2024."

Part of a $192.5 million co-investment with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services the building will help address a critical need for laboratory pipette tips according to a release from the Orange County government.

“The new manufacturing facility will help the U.S. meet future demand surges for vital laboratory products while bringing more high-quality jobs to North Carolina” said Mark Stevenson the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific. “With its strategic geographic location and proximity to a diverse talent base Mebane is an ideal location for this new facility.”

According to Orange County officials Thermo Fisher’s facility will be approximately 375000 square feet and will be in the new Buckhorn Industrial Park which is located on the corner of Buckhorn Road and West Ten Road. The space is part of Orange County’s Buckhorn Economic Development District.

The Mebane location will be the eighth in North Carolina for Thermo Fisher. The company presently employs around 4000 people in places like Durham Raleigh Asheville Greenville and High Point. According to Thermo Fisher the new site is expected to create between 150 and 200 new jobs in manufacturing engineering and business operations.

That area of Orange County is no stranger to manufacturing workspace and welcoming in nationwide companies. The medical supply distributor Medline Industries is close to finishing a multi-million dollar distribution center near Mebane while the Swiss technology firm ABB Inc. has operated a manufacturing center in the region for years.



“Orange County strives to encourage and support economic development in our county and we particularly welcome businesses that offer 21st-century jobs with good salaries and career opportunities for our residents” said Renee Price Chair of the Orange County Board of Commissioners. “We are pleased to welcome Thermo Fisher Scientific to the community and look forward to seeing this project come to fruition.”

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper also shared his thoughts in Friday’s release pointing to Thermo Fisher’s success in the state as an example of this project’s potential.

“Thermo Fisher continues to expand its footprint in North Carolina” said Cooper “reinforcing our state’s global reputation as a prime location for life sciences companies. This new investment in Mebane and Orange County proves once again that North Carolina’s biotechnology sector is thriving in every corner of our state.”

The release from the Orange County government did not include a timeline for the project. To read the full release visit the county government’s website.

Four KRAS mutant CRC cell lines (HCT116 DLD-1 LOVO and SW480) were treated in indicated concentration of RSL3 alone or in combination with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) for 24 h. (Fig. S1). We found that combination treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab enhanced the death of HCT116 and DLD-1 cells compared with RSL3 alone. In subsequent experiments HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were chosen and treated with RSL3 (1 μM) cetuximab (100 μg/ml) for 24 h. We found that treatment with cetuximab enhanced the cytotoxic effect of RSL3 in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells (Fig. 1A B).

Fig. 1: Cetuximab enhances the cytotoxic effect of RSL3 on KRAS mutant CRC cells. A HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with RSL3 (1 μM) cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or their combination for 24 h. The inhibitory effects were determined by the CCK-8 assay. B Cell morphology changes were observed by inverted light microscopy. Scale bar 100 μm. C The colony formation with the indicated treatment was performed (left panel) and a histogram of colony numbers is shown (right panel). **P < 0.01. Full size image

We next investigated whether cetuximab enhances antiproliferative effects on RSL3-treated HCT116 and DLD-1 cells and the colony formation assay was performed. Compared with RSL3 or cetuximab alone combination treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab significantly suppressed proliferation (Fig. 1C). All these results suggest that cetuximab enhances the cytotoxic effect of RSL3 on KRAS mutant CRC cell lines by significantly inhibiting cell viability and inhibiting cell proliferation.

Cetuximab enhances RSL3-induced ferroptosis in KRAS mutant CRC cells

RSL3 is a potent ferroptosis activator [20]. To investigate whether ferroptosis was further promoted by treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab two indicators of ferroptosis i.e. lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were assessed in KRAS mutant HCT116 and DLD-1 cells. Then C11‐BODIPY581/591 a lipid peroxidation probe was applied to measure the level of intracellular lipid ROS. Consistent with our expectation following co-treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab lipid ROS accumulation was remarkably increased (Fig. 2A). Moreover MDA levels were remarkably increased after co-treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Intriguingly treatment with cetuximab did not affect lipid ROS accumulation or MDA levels in either HCT116 or DLD-1 cell lines but enhanced the RSL3-induced increases in lipid ROS levels and MDA levels. These results indicate that ferroptosis might be promoted after co-treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab in KRAS mutant CRC cell lines. Ferroptosis is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation [9]. Thus intracellular iron levels were determined in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells by using a Fe2+ iron probe known as FerroOrange. The cells co-treated with RSL3 and cetuximab emitted much stronger orange fluorescence compared with treated with RSL3 alone (Fig. 2C).

Fig. 2: Cetuximab treatment enhances RSL3-induced ferroptosis in KRAS mutant CRC cells. A HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with RSL3 (1 μM) cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or their combination for 24 h. The cellular lipid ROS level was analyzed by a flow cytometer. B HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with RSL3 (1 μM) cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or their combination for 24 h. Intracellular MDA levels were measured by an MDA Assay Kit. C HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with RSL3 (1 μM) cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or their combination for 24 h. Chelatable iron levels were determined using FerroOrange. Scale bar 50 μm. D HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or RSL3 (1 μM) in the absence or presence of Fer-1 (1 μM) for 24 h and cell viability was evaluated by the CCK-8 assay. E HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or RSL3 (1 μM) in combination with Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) necrostatin-1 (10 μM) or 3-MA (60 μM) for 24 h and cell viability was assessed by the CCK-8 assay. **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05; NS: no significance. Full size image

Moreover treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab increased the inhibition of HCT116 and DLD-1 cell growth and this effect was reversed by the ferroptosis rescue agent Fer-1 (Fig. 2D) but not by the rescue agent of apoptosis (Z-VAD-FMK) necroptosis (necrostatin-1) or autophagy (3-MA) (Fig. 2E). Collectively these findings strongly suggest that cetuximab enhances RSL3-induced ferroptosis in KRAS mutant CRC cell lines.

Combination treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab inhibits Nrf2/HO-1 axis in KRAS mutant CRC cells

Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) is a master regulator in cellular responding to oxidative stress. Following oxidative stress Keap1 is dissociated from Nrf2 leading to Nrf2 accumulation nuclear translocation and activate the transcription of target gene including HO-1 [21]. Our study found that following treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab increasing Keap1 expression and inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1 signalling as shown by western blot analysis (Fig. 3A).

Fig. 3: Combination treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab inhibits Nrf2/HO-1 axis in KRAS mutant CRC cells. A The protein levels of Keap1 Nrf2 and HO-1 in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were measured by western blotting after treatment with RSL3 (1 μM) cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or their combination for 24 h. B Knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA reduced the expression of Nrf2 and the protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 after treatment with RSL3 (1 μM) for 24 h. C siRNA-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 increased the sensitivity of HCT116 and DLD-1 cells to RSL3. D–F The levels of MDA lipid ROS and intracellular iron were measured in Nrf2-silenced HCT116 and DLD-1 cells pretreated with or without RSL3 (1 μM). Scale bar 100 μm. **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05. Full size image

To evaluate the effects of the expression of Nrf2 on KRAS mutant CRC cells treated with cetuximab and RSL3 we designed two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting Nrf2. In HCT116 and DLD-1 cells siRNA transfection for 48 h period reduced the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream target HO-1. Compared with the RSL3 group the Nrf2 and HO-1 level in the RSL3-treated transfected groups was reduced (Fig. 3B). Transfection of an siRNA targeting Nrf2 increased the sensitivity of HCT116 and DLD-1 cells to RSL3 (Fig. 3C).

We sought to further confirm whether knockdown of Nrf2 can cause lipid oxidation and we measured the levels of MDA and intracellular ROS in Nrf2-siRNA-transfected HCT116 and DLD-1 cells. As expected knockdown of Nrf2 enhanced RSL3-induced MDA levels (Fig. 3D). Then we used flow cytometry to analyze the intracellular lipid ROS level and the results demonstrated that knockdown of Nrf2 promoted RSL3-induced oxidation of lipids in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells (Fig. 3E). Additionally the results showed that knockdown of Nrf2 enhanced RSL3-induced intracellular iron accumulation (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that combination treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab inhibits Nrf2/HO-1 signalling in KRAS mutant CRC cells.

Cetuximab activates p38 MAPK and regulates the Nrf2/HO-1 axis

p38 MAPK has been reported to regulate antioxidant enzymes expression including Nrf2 and HO-1 [22]. To investigate the role of p38 MAPK in the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 we evaluated the effect of cetuximab and SB202190 (specific inhibitors of p38) on p38 activity in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells. The protein level of p38 in cetuximab- or SB202190-treated cells was not different from that in control. The levels of p-p38 were significantly enhanced by cetuximab treatment but this effect was abolished when co-treatment with cetuximab and SB202190 (Fig. 4A). We then investigated whether inhibition of p38 expression can affect cetuximab-induced inhibition of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. Western blot analysis demonstrated that treatment with cetuximab decreased the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 and SB202190 reduced cetuximab-mediated inhibition of Nrf2 and HO-1 (Fig. 4A). Moreover the death of HCT116 and DLD-1 cells induced by treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab was partly rescued by SB202190 (Fig. 4B). To further verify if Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is involved in which cetuximab sensitizes cells to RSL3 HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were transient transfected with Nrf2 or HO-1 expressing vectors. As shown in Fig. 4C D overexpression of Nrf2 restored the combination treatment with cetuximab and RSL3-induced inhibition of HO-1 expression and cell growth in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells. Also overexpression of HO-1 reversed the growth inhibition induced by cetuximab and RSL3 combination treatment in CRC cells (Fig. 4E F). In addition activation of Nrf2 by t-BHQ treatment or activation of HO-1 by hemin treatment partly reversed the growth inhibition of HCT116 and DLD-1 cells induced by RSL3 and cetuximab treatment (Fig. 4G H). In addition knockdown of Keap1 significantly restored theNrf2 and HO-1 and reduced the cytotoxicity induced by co-treatment cetuximab and RSL3 in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells (Fig. S2). These results demonstrate that p38 MAPK participates in the regulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and that cetuximab can inhibit the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway via p38 MAPK activation.

A Western blot analysis of p-p38 total p38 Nrf2 and HO-1 expression levels in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells incubated with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) SB202190 (1 μM) or cetuximab in combination with SB202190 for 24 h. B HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or RSL3 (1 μM) in the absence or presence of SB202190 (1 μM) for 24 h and cell viability was assessed by the CCK-8 assay. C The protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells or Nrf2 overexpressed HCT116 and DLD-1 cells treated with RSL3 (1 μM) combination with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) for 24 h. D HCT116 and DLD-1 cells with overexpression Nrf2 were treated with or without RSL3 (1 μM) combination with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assays.

F HCT116 and DLD-1 cells with overexpression HO-1 were treated with or without RSL3 (1 μM) combination with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assays. G–H HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with cetuximab (100 μg/ml) or RSL3 (1 μM) with or without t-BHQ (20 μM) or hemin (20 μM) for 24 h and cell viability was assessed by the CCK-8 assay. **P < 0.01.

Cetuximab enhances RSL3-induced ferroptosis by suppressing the Nrf2/HO-1 axis in KRAS mutant CRC cells in a xenograft nude mouse model

To further explored whether cetuximab promotes RSL3-induced ferroptosis in vivo a DLD-1 xenograft nude mouse model was established. A schematic of tumour inoculation and systemic injection is shown in Fig. 5A. All the mice survived well after cell implantation or were treated with vehicle RSL3 cetuximab or RSL3 in combination with cetuximab. Following treatment for 17 days the size of the tumour gradually increased in the control and cetuximab treatment group. However administration of RSL3 alone and treatment with both agents led to a decrease in tumour size and the in the both agents’ administration group exhibited the greatest reduction in tumours size (Fig. 5B C) and tumour volume (Fig. 5D). Body weight and daily food intake did not change significantly in the control or treatment groups (Fig. 5E). We then tested whether combinatory treatment with cetuximab and RSL3 can regulate lipid peroxidation in vivo. Strikingly MDA concentration levels were significantly enhanced in the combined group (Fig. 5F).

Next we measured Nrf2 HO-1 and Keap1 protein levels. The western blotting date showed that the relative levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 were decreased and that keap1 expressed was relatively increased after co-treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab as was observed in vitro (Fig. 6A). Then we measured the ki67 Keap1 Nrf2 and HO-1 expression by immunohistochemical staining. Consistent with the western blotting results the immunohistochemical analysis showed that low expression of Ki67 Nrf2 and HO-1 and high expression of keap1 were found after co-treatment with RSL3 and cetuximab (Fig. 6B). Taken together these in vivo results further support the in vitro evidence that cetuximab enhances RSL3-induced ferroptosis by suppressing Nrf2/HO-1 activation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxMzg5LTAyMS0wMDM2MC050gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evolution of HER2-positive mammary carcinoma: HER2 loss reveals claudin-low traits in cancer progression ...,"Mice

FVBhuHER2-transgenic mice [19] obtained from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco CA USA) were bred in our animal facility and genetically screened as previously reported [20]. BALB/c Rag2-/-;Il2Rg-/- mice [21] were used as an immunodeficient model that lacked B T and NK immune components. Non-transgenic FVB female mice (FVB/NCrl) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Calco Como Italy). Blinding to assess the outcome of in vivo experiments was not done. For drug treatments animals from each litter were allocated random to the different treatments. Five mice were enrolled in each test group in order to have an 80% chance of showing with a 5% significance a 65% of success in the experimental group.

All animal procedures were performed in accordance with European directive 2010/63/UE and Italian Law (DL26/2014); experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (“Comitato per il Benessere Animale”) of the University of Bologna and by the Italian Ministry of Health with letter 688/2015.

Cell lines

MamBo cell lines were established from mammary tumors of FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice. Tumors were minced and set in culture with an appropriate medium as previously described [22]. Cell lines were stabilized and cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific Monza Italy) that was supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS Thermo Fisher Scientific) 30 µg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Corning Life Sciences Glendale AZ USA) and 0.5% v/v MITO Serum Extender (Corning). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humified 5% CO 2 atmosphere.

Tumorigenicity and metastatic ability of MamBo cell lines

To evaluate the tumorigenicity of the MamBo cell lines FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (12–20-week-old) received the injection of 106 cells into the mammary fat pad (m.f.p.) (MamBo89HER2stable cell line n = 8 MamBo43HER2labile cell line n = 3 MamBo38HER2loss cell line n = 5). Animals were inspected weekly to follow tumor development which was measured with a caliper. Tumor volume was calculated as π/12*(√ab)3 where a = maximal tumor diameter and b=maximal tumor diameter perpendicular to a. Mice were sacrificed before tumors reached 2.5 cm3 or 10% of mouse weight. At necropsy tumors were harvested and disaggregated with trypsin-0.05% EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for cytofluorimetric analysis.

Experimental metastatic potential was assessed in FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (8–17-week-old) via the injection of 105 cells into a caudal vein (n = 5). The general health status of the mice was checked weekly and the mice were either euthanized as previously described either at any sign of lung metastasis or 18 weeks after cell injection. Lungs were stained with ink fixed in Fekete’s solution and metastases were counted under a stereoscope.

To evaluate the dose-dependent tumor growth of MamBo43HER2labile cells in immunocompetent mice different doses of cells (106 107 and 2 × 107) were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into FVBhuHER2 virgin female 11-week-old mice. MamBo43HER2labile cells (105 cells) were also s.c. injected into Rag2-/-;Il2Rg-/- immunodeficient female 8-week-old mice (n = 3) compared to FVBhuHER2 virgin female 14-week-old mice (n = 3) to inspect the contribution of adaptive immunity to HER2 loss.

Cytofluorimetric analysis

Harvested cells and tumor samples which had previously been dissociated to yield single-cell suspensions were analyzed by immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis as previously described [22]. The antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence included: rat anti-mouse CD16-CD32 antibody Fc block (clone 2.4G2; diluted 1:100; BD Pharmingen CA USA); mouse anti-human HER2 (MGR2 diluted 1:100 Alexis Biochemical Enzo Life Sciences Lansen Swisse) and also kindly provided by Dr. Elda Tagliabue (IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori Milan Italy); rat anti-mouse CD140b (PDGFR-B) (APB5 diluted 1:100; BioLegend CA USA). Anti-mouse IgGAF488 (diluted 1:100; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anti-rat IgGFITC (diluted 1:40; KPL) were used as secondary antibodies. Direct immunofluorescence made use of: anti-human HER2PE (clone Neu 24.7 diluted 1:20 BD Pharmigen); anti-mouse CD24AF488 (clone M1/69; diluted 1:10; BioLegend); anti-mouse-CD44PE (clone IM7; diluted 1:10 BioLegend); anti-mouse Sca1PE (clone E13-161.7 1:100 dilution; BioLegend); and anti-mouse CD29PE (clone HMβ1-1; diluted 1:10; BioLegend). Data were acquired using CyFlow Space (Sysmex Partec Germany) and analyzed using FCSExpress (De Novo Software Glendale CA USA).

Mammosphere formation assay

The ability of MamBo cell lines to form mammospheres in vitro was assessed using the MammoCult Human Medium Kit (STEMCELL Technologies Vancouver Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (n = 4). Briefly 4 × 104 cells were seeded in 4 ml complete MammoCult medium without serum in 6 well UltraLow Adherence plates. Mammospheres that were bigger than 60 µm were counted on day 7. The same protocol was employed to evaluate the ability of MamBo38HER2loss to form mammospheres in a medium that contained sunitinib 5 µM (vehicle and sunitinib n = 4; two tests with untreated cells were also run in parallel).

Induction of HER2 loss in vitro and in vivo and trastuzumab treatment

MamBo43HER2labile cells were kept in culture with trastuzumab (Herceptin Roche) 120 h to evaluate the short-term growth inhibition and level of HER2 expression. A long-term culture 2 months was performed in the presence of 30 μg/ml trastuzumab. Cells were counted weekly and seeded at a concentration of either 1.6 × 105 cells/cm2 (high density also referred to as MamBo43HER2labile TRT cells) or 4 × 104 cells/cm2 (low density). In parallel cells were harvested for molecular analysis cytofluorimetric analysis of HER2 and stemness-marker expression. A third culture without trastuzumab was performed by seeding MamBo43HER2labile cells at a lower density (104 cells/cm2). Cells were split and harvested for cytofluorimetric analysis twice a week.

MamBo43HER2labile cells (106 cells) were s.c. injected into FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (13–16-week-old) that were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either saline (vehicle n = 5) or trastuzumab 4 mg/kg twice a week starting from day 3 after cell injection (n = 5 a censored mouse at 2 weeks from cell injection was not included in tumor growth analysis).

Sensitivity to demethylating agent

MamBo38HER2loss cells were seeded at 8 × 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h of seeding cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO 0.02%) 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Merck Life Science Milano Italy) 0.5 μM or 5 μM. Treatment was renewed after 72 h. Cells were harvested after 48 72 and 144 h of treatment (from the first treatment) and counted. HER2 expression was determined by cytofluorimetric analysis.

Sensitivity to sunitinib in vitro and in vivo

Sensitivity to sunitinib (sunitinib malate LC Laboratories MA USA) was determined using the WST-1 reagent (Merck) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on MamBo38HER2loss cells seeded at 3.125 × 103 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates (Corning Life Sciences) and treated with sunitinib 0.1 0.5 1 5 and 10 µM. Drug sensitivity was evaluated 72 h after treatment.

Sunitinib sensitivity in MamBo38HER2loss cells (0.5 × 103 cells/cm2) was also evaluated under 3D non-adherent conditions as previously described [22]. Colonies were counted after 14 days.

The migratory ability of MamBo38HER2loss cells in the presence of sunitinib was evaluated in a wound-healing test. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates in complete medium and allowed to sit until confluence. The cell monolayer was scratched with a pipette tip 200 μl the medium was changed with or without sunitinib 5 µM and wound width was measured at times 0 and 24 h after scratching (untreated n = 8 vehicle n = 6 sunitinib 5 µM n = 8). Migratory ability was calculated as width (24 h)/width(t0)*100. FVBhuHER2 virgin female mice (8–16-week-old) that harbored tumors that were induced by the s.c. injection of MamBo43HER2labile cells (106 cells) were treated daily with sunitinib 60 mg/kg per os by gavage starting from 3 days after cell injection (n = 5 a censored mouse at 1 week from cell injection was not included in tumor growth analysis). Animals in the vehicle group received Methylcellulose 0.5%+Tween80 0.4% (all from Merck) (n = 5). FVB virgin female 8-week-old mice that harbored tumors that were induced by the s.c. injection of MamBo38HER2loss cells (2.5 × 104 cells) were treated daily with sunitinib 60 mg/kg per os by gavage starting from 1 day after cell injection (n = 5). Animals in the vehicle group received Methylcellulose 0.5%+Tween80 0.4% (n = 5).

RNA-sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using Trizol Reagent (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq libraries were generated using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. High-throughput sequencing was carried out on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) using 75 nucleotides in single-end mode. Reads were analyzed on a SeqBox [23]. The generation of Demultiplexing (bcl2fastq Illumina tool version 2.17.1.14-2) counts using STAR (version 2.5) /RSEM (version 1.3.0) and differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 (version 1.14.1 adjusted P-value < 0.1 and |log2 fold change | ≥1) were all performed within the SeqBox framework [23]. Two distinct analyses were performed on differentially expressed genes. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the EnrichR web tool (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) and protein-protein interactions were detected using the STRING database (www.string-db.org).

In the HER2-positive vs HER2-negative comparison we also included samples from MamBo89HER2stable cells and MamBo38HER2loss cells that were treated long-term with trastuzumab for either 30 days (then w/o 30 days) or 60 days both maintaining the initial shape HER2 expression level and stemness profile of correspondent untreated cells. In detail the HER2-positive samples included MamBo89HER2stable parental cells trastuzumab-treated MamBo89HER2stable cells a HER2-positive MamBo89HER2stable clone and MamBo43HER2labile cells. HER2-negative samples included MamBo38HER2loss parental cells trastuzumab-treated MamBo38HER2loss cells and high density seeding MamBo43HER2labile trastuzumab-treated (TRT) cells (30 days then w/o 30 days or 60 days) having lost HER2 expression. The comparison of HER2 stable vs HER2 labile cells only included MamBo89HER2stable parental cell line and its HER2-positive clone and MamBo43HER2labile cells. For each sample were tested three replicates at least (except for MamBo38HER2loss trastuzumab-treated cells since the analysis included only two samples).

IL6 production

Supernatants were collected from cells that were seeded 8 × 104 cells/cm2 in medium that contained either sunitinib 5 µM (LC Laboratories MA USA) or DMSO 0.05% (here referred as vehicle) (Merck) or no drug. mIL6 production was analyzed using mouse IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems Minneapolis MN USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of each sample was calculated by interpolating values on a standard curve. A stable IL6 producer mouse mammary cancer cell line (TS/A-IL6) was used as positive control of IL6 production [24].

Real-Time PCR

RNA was extracted quantified and reverse transcribed as previously reported [25]. cDNA was amplified using Sso Advanced SyBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories CA USA) reagents. Reactions were performed in a Thermal Cycler CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Analyses were performed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 Software and relative quantification was calculated as ΔCt= Ct gene -Ct housekeeping . We used the following Bio-Rad assays: Cdh1 (qMmuCID0006332); Col3a1 (qMmuCID0006332); Col5a2 (qMmuCID0011413); Dsp (qMmuCID0019458); Fgfbp1 (qMmuCID0007813); Igfbp4 (qMmuCID0006155); Il1rn (qMmuCID0009153); Mmp2 (qMmuCID00021124); Ocln (qMmuCID0005446); Pdgfrb (qMmuCID0025167); Sparc (qMmuCID0023536); Vcan (qMmuCID0005235); Snai1 (qMmuCID0024342); Zeb1 (qMmuCID0009095); Zeb2 (qMmuCED0046769); Twist1 (qMmuCED0004065); and Ltbp1 (qMmuCED0045004). Custom HER2 primers were also used [26]. Mouse TBP ([27] or Bio-Rad assay qMmuCID0040542) was used as housekeeping gene.

DNA was extracted using a PureLink Genomic DNA Mini kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HER2 copy number was detected by Real-Time PCR using HER2 qHsaCEP0052301 assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and was normalized over human/mouse Ptger2 [28]. Amplification was performed using Sso Advanced Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The copy number of the human and murine cell lines was inferred by considering that MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 harbor 2 copies of HER2 in the genome. Human cell-line culture conditions have previously been reported [29].

Western blot analysis

Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed as reported previously [20]. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-HER2 (clone 3B5 diluted 1:1000 Calbiochem Merck) anti-pNeu (Tyr 1248) (diluted 1:1000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA) anti-Stat3 (clone 124H6 diluted 1:1000 Cell Signaling Danvers MA) anti-pStat3 (clone D3A7 diluted 1:2000 Cell Signaling) anti-Actin (diluted 1:1000 Merck). Membranes were either incubated with polyclonal horse-radish-peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (diluted 1:3000 Bio-Rad Laboratories) or anti-mouse IgG antibody (diluted 1:1000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein presence was detected by chemiluminescent reaction (Bio-Rad Laboratories) before film exposure.

Statistical analysis

Experimental in vitro conditions analyzed with statistical measures were repeated two times at least. The number of samples was reported in the Materials and Methods and/or in the Figure Legend. Statistical analyses were performed through Prism 5 software (GraphPad software La Jolla CA USA). The two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test or t test with Welch’s correction were performed according to assumptions of the tests and the variance between the compared groups. The used test was reported in Figure Legend. All values are depicted as the mean and SEM.",,,

Maxx right now,"New York CNN Business —

Bummer for bargain hunters: It may be harder to snag designer clothes at T.J. Maxx Burlington and Ross.

These discount chains thrive when there is a glut of clothing in the market. They can scoop in and buy premium apparel and shoe brands’ excess inventory for cheap — and then sell it to customers at bargain prices. The problem right now: There’s very little unsold clothing sitting around.

Supply chains are choked off and brands don’t have as much if any extra stuff to dump. And since inventories are lean and customer demand is red hot brands don’t have as great a need to discount merchandise — they can easily sell items at full price.

Under Armour (UA) Ralph Lauren (RL) Carter’s (CRI) and Steve Madden (SHOO) are among the brands that have said in recent weeks they’re retreating from discount chains sometimes called “off-price” stores. Levi’s (LEVI) is also walking away from discount stores.

Even before the pandemic these brands were trying to move away from off-price companies because they are the least profitable outlets for brands. Offering too many products at a discount also dilutes brands’ image and erodes their pricing power over customers. These brands want to sell their stuff through their stores websites premium wholesale partners or their factory stores which are all more profitable.

“Off-price is a last resort” said Susan Anderson a retail analyst at B. Riley Securities. She said discount stores could suffer in the long term if brands keep their inventories tighter.

Clothing and footwear brands have increased their efforts during the pandemic to pull away from discount stores. They’re able to pull it off right now because of the huge imbalance between supply and demand.

“We have reduced the amount that we’re selling to the third-party off-price channel” Under Armour chief financial officer David Bergman said on an earnings call this month. “Those partners would like more product.”

When Under Armour does sell to discount chains they are “going to pay a little bit more to us” because Under Armour has less product to ship Bergman said.

Carter’s is shipping fewer of its baby items to TJ Maxx (TJX) Marshalls Burlington (BURL) and Ross (ROST) this year. Compared with 2019 Carter’s has reduced its sales to off-price stores by nearly 50% CEO Michael Casey said on an earnings call last month.

Instead of delivering to discount chains Carter’s will rely on its own stores and website when it has excess inventory to unload – or it will hold onto products and selling them during a different season a spokesperson said in an email. Carter’s is also cutting back on the number of different products it sells overall leaving less room for off-price stores to pounce.

Ralph Lauren has “significantly reduced” the amount of inventory it’s sending to discount chains including T.J. Maxx a spokesperson said in an email. In particular Ralph Lauren has pulled back on the amount of products it makes specifically for T.J. Maxx.

Steve Madden is also dialing back on unloading inventory to off-price stores because it has to allocate its limited supply of goods.

“Our first priority is always feeding full-price channels” CEO Edward Rosenfeld said on an earnings call this month.

T.J. Maxx says not to worry: Stores will be “frequently updated with new and on-trend items” and customers will be able to find a strong selection of gifts and home decor during the holiday season from its “ever-changing mix of merchandise” a spokesperson for the company said in an email. Burlington declined to comment. Ross Stores did not respond to requests for comment.

Still “quantities of seasonal goods look lower than normal” at off-price chains particularly at Ross and Burlington UBS retail analyst Jay Sole said in a November 8 research note. Top brands’ sportswear was less available than usual he noted.

Off-price chains’ stocks have trailed the S&P 500’s retail index which has increased 18% in 2021. TJ Maxx parent TJX’s stock is flat this year Burlington has inched up 2% and Ross has declined 6%

Goods are scarcer at some companies’ own outlet stores such as outdoor equipment retailer REI.

REI is seeing strong demand for outdoor goods so there’s “very little product leftover” to sell at its outlet stores Ben Johns REI’s general merchandising manager for action sports told CNN Business.

Historically half of REI’s cycling business — bikes helmets apparel parts and maintenance products for cycling car racks — come from full-price sales. This year that’s climbed above 90%.

Johns said: “What we have we just simply sell full price.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdmUzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzE0L2Rlc2lnbmVyLWJyYW5kcy1leHBlY3RlZC1sZWF2ZS1kaXNjb3VudC1zdG9yZXMtZHVlLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1pc3N1ZXMv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2F2ZTMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTQvZGVzaWduZXItYnJhbmRzLWV4cGVjdGVkLWxlYXZlLWRpc2NvdW50LXN0b3Jlcy1kdWUtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWlzc3Vlcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Designer brands expected to leave discount stores due to supply chain issues,"LOUISVILLE Ky. (WAVE) - Global supply chain issues are affecting designer brands like Under Armour Ralph Lauren and more leaving bargain hunters at a loss.

The companies said they are stepping away from those discount chains like T.J. Maxx Burlington and Ross who carry the excess of premium apparel and shoes for lower prices.

According to some designer brands discounts stores are the least profitable outlet and they dilute their image. These brands were already moving away from the chains before the pandemic.

T.J. Maxx said not to worry stores will be “frequently updated with new and on-trend items.”

GRAY Ga. — A Tractor Supply hardware store is headed to Gray.

A company spokesman and the Jones County zoning office confirmed Friday that Tractor Supply plans to build a store on the Gray Highway near Highway 18 West.

Site work is already underway at the lot between West Clinton Tire and Jalapenos restaurant on the 4100 block of Gray Highway. It’s about a mile and a half from the town’s only current hardware Ace of Gray.

Company spokesman Darias Collins said they plan to open sometime in 2022 but did not supply any further details.

Tractor Supply sells pet supplies fencing clothing lawn and garden supplies and more.

The company already has stores in Macon Milledgeville Forsyth Byron Dublin and Sandersville.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdHYvYTM4MjEwNDE0L3llbGxvd3N0b25lLXJlY2FwLXNlYXNvbi1mb3VyLWVwaXNvZGUtdGhyZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yellowstone Episode 3 Recap - What Happened In Yellowstone Season 4 Episode 3?,"If I were to ever be faced with any of the following threats—all of which appear in Yellowstone's third episode somehow—I'm not sure which I would fear most:

Being banished to a hell ranch in Texas called 6666

Being passed off to John Dutton to be tortured

Facing off with Beth Dutton in a Tractor Supply getting my phone smashed and having her threaten my life

You may be tempted to pick door number three but if this series has routinely shown us anything it's that if you run afoul of Beth Dutton you'll pay for it for eternity. (Also your own personal eternity may be quite short if you catch my drift.) Episode Three picks up with the Duttons going on a revenge tour killing a whole crew of rabble rousers that tried to destroy them at the end of last season. And considering the PR nightmare that is being a Dutton this is terrible news for almost everyone in Montana.

But let's get into the specifics of what's happened this episode—who got shot shipped off or shook down in a co-op.

The Dutton's Revenge

As noted the Duttons are out for blood. John is leading the charge with Kayce and Rip at the ready to kick ass and take names. In fact if you've crossed them and you're not already dead in a ditch you just might wish you could schedule that death and get it over with with the way things are looking.

Of course that comes with recoil as well. Monica and Tate stay locked up in a room; hell Tate stays under the bed and Kayce cannot put together why. Do they not want to fight evil like he does? No they're mostly coming down off that traumatic home invasion resulting in their school-aged child shooting a man. No big deal. But Kayce can only operate off of what he knows. (Read: revenge.)

We see the most senior Dutton working with the Broken Rock reservation to ""handle"" the man who orchestrated the hit job on he and his family. John takes the man responsible for ""staffing"" the assassination and tortures him within an inch of his life pulling out all the information he can before he shoots and kills the guy.

More to come on this Dutton x Tarantino film crossover.

Beth and Rip and Carter and Karen

Beth is so excited to play family with Rip and Carter. Rip is still being hard on Carter ensuring that he earns his keep on the Dutton ranch but Beth wants to give him the best life she can. She steals him away from Rip-duty and takes him to town to get a pair of boots and a hat. Rip protests saying she'll only make him a ""pet"" but Beth protests back in her cute way and says ""Fuck you."" She adds that she'll see him when she's home and that she loves him but ""fuck you."" Aspirational.

Beth comes to realize that Rip's not all that wrong though when Carter tries to swindle her into buying him boots a hat jeans and a dress shirt. Beth tells him to put it back and when he doesn't listen she begins to rip the shirt off of Carter. A woman—let's call her Karen—appears and says it's child abuse and begins to film the situation which is when Beth shows her what real child abuse is grabbing her phone throwing it down on the ground stomping on it and then threatening assault.

In the car ride back Beth explains to Carter there are only four ways to get rich explaining he's not born into it nor smart enough to steal it so he has to go with the third option: work hard. When Carter asks what option four is Beth says plainly ""You suck a dick like you lost your keys in it."" Whoever is writing lines for Beth should win a Pulitzer.

Jimmy's Long Walk Home

Poor Jimmy. This week we find out that he's being carted off to the infamous ""Four Sixes"" ranch or for those paying attention to Yellowstone news: 6666. Why is that formatting important? Because that's the title of the upcoming Yellowstone spinoff set in Texas. So it seems at least for the time being that Jimmy will lead that spinoff. His sendoff from the Dutton ranch is bleak. He's leaving things on terrible terms with Mia who believes that Jimmy never considered her ""an option"" in his complicated post-injury life.

But this isn't the end for Jimmy. John made it clear that he can return to Yellowstone when he's ready. When is that? When Jimmy decides he's ready. Until then you'll see our guy down in Texas... if he survives it.

By Kevin Deutsch

Jaclyn Milian the Heron Heights Elementary School third-grader who competed in the national finals of Major League Baseball’s Pitch Hit & Run competition is now an MLB record-holder.

The Parkland nine-year-old broke the record for the longest hit in her age division during the Nov. 1 contest.

The previous hit-distance record for the competition’s seven and eight-year-old softball division was 126 feet.

Milian struck a ball 139 feet.

The pitch hit and run final was held during the Major League Baseball World Series at Truist Park home of the Atlanta Braves who won the series against the Houston Astros to become world champions.

To earn a spot in Atlanta Milian bested scores of competitors in her age division during four rounds of local competition plus the high-profile regional contest at loanDepot Park home of the Miami Marlins.

The water authority has organized a growing grassroots campaign Save CWA to fight the private takeover until the very end. The group has handed out more than 7500 yard signs. Its petition demanding a ratepayer referendum before the sale of CWA had garnered roughly 7700 signatures as of Nov. 13.

“Privatization is almost never a good idea. It’s bad for the ratepayers and the community. CWA does not need or want to be sold” said Catherine Miller an organizer for Save CWA.

The group argues an Aqua takeover will have grave consequences saying that water bills will be higher that public access to the CWA-owned Octoraro Reservoir in Lancaster County — a free recreational hub — will be lost and that the more than 2000 acres of green space CWA owns in Delaware Chester and Lancaster counties could be sold to developers.

“Why are we abdicating control of a vital resource such as water to a private company that’s gonna make money off you?” Miller asked.

Franklin CEO of Aqua PA’s parent promises that the reservoir will remain intact.

“You’re hearing from me directly — the chairman of the company — that we will preserve that reservoir in perpetuity in its current form without developing any land around without fencing it in a way that would preclude people from using it and we would allow the continued recreation on the reservoir essentially status quo moving forward” Franklin said.

He also said that the CWA is employing scare tactics and that ratepayers have nothing to worry about.

“The truth of the situation is the mayor and City Council along with the company have worked to set up a structure where a lot of the proceeds would go into an account completely segregated single-purpose use of the funds and we will use it to offset rates. And that single use would then keep rates steady for at least a period of 10 years” Franklin said.

Miller doesn’t buy Franklin’s promises pointing to Aqua’s closure of the once-popular Springton Reservoir in Delaware County for security reasons. She also said rate freezes are a pipe dream.

CWA admits its rates will go up 5% in 2022. And the skepticism directed toward Aqua is not unfounded. ​​The company filed a rate case petition with the state Public Utility Commission in August seeking to increase water bills for all its customers by 17% and wastewater bills by 33%.

Aqua cited the recovery of $1.1 billion it has spent in “infrastructure repairs and improvements” throughout the state since its last rate increase in 2019 as the reason for the dramatic rate hike.

“The shareholders have no money at risk and their money is at risk if Aqua does a bad job in running the day-to-day operations. But with the PUC they’re allowing them to raise rates whenever they want to. They have really minimal risk and they don’t use their own money. Here’s the problem — the people who pay for these acquisitions are the ratepayers and they don’t have a seat at the table” Catania said.

The customer base is becoming increasingly upset. But Franklin thinks the Save CWA effort is artificial.

“This has been generated by massive legal fees and public relations fees of a very small group of people and it is agitating in communities surrounding it. And that’s what this is all about” Franklin said.

A fight that’s been brewing for years

In 2017 Aqua made an unsolicited $320 million offer to CWA to purchase it. The nine-member water authority board — consisting of three Chester City Council appointees three Delaware County Council appointees and three appointees named by the Chester County Commissioners — unanimously rejected the offer citing no benefit to ratepayers.

In a strategic move to block Aqua and help Chester with its financial woes CWA proposed a $60 million bailout of the city in exchange for placing the authority in a trust. As a corporate water customer of CWA Aqua sued in 2019.

In February 2020 in what water authority solicitor Catania described as a request for proposals the city of Chester received two bids for CWA from Aqua and Pennsylvania American Water Co. (Separately CWA had proposed a public-private partnership with the city and some restructuring.)

Since then the issue has been tied up in court. Through it all CWA has maintained that it is not owned by the city and that it is not in financial distress. Initially a trial court issued a favorable ruling for the water authority. But the most recent court action saw Commonwealth Court rule in a “very limited” majority decision that the city of Chester possessed “the general authority to obtain the assets of an authority that it created” thus clearing a path for the city to re-engage with Aqua.

In his dissent Commonwealth Court Judge Michael Wojcik wrote that he believed the sale to be a “foregone conclusion.”

“It is patently unconscionable to permit the city to pay off its own municipal debt by selling the authority’s assets that were paid for by its ratepayers the vast majority of whom reside in the counties and elsewhere. In fact the General Assembly granted the counties ‘seats at the table’ to prevent the city from looting the authority and using the sale of the authority’s assets as its own municipal piggy bank” Wojcik wrote.

Although CWA hopes to see the matter decided by the state Supreme Court it could very well be resolved by the Chester receiver.

A city in dire fiscal straits

Chester is in trouble. In an interview Mayor Thaddeus Kirkland said that accepting “the most appealing” offer — Aqua’s — was the best way out of it.

“We have to find a way of making sure that the citizens of Chester have an opportunity to stand on their own financially. This could possibly be that opportunity” Kirkland said.

He writes off public disapproval of his actions and those of the City Council as the result of a lack of factual information.

“There has been a lot of talk around the possibility of Aqua raising their rates … We would never ever leave our residents or anyone else in that manner exposed to such a rate increase” Kirkland said.

He acknowledged that the $12 million on the table a sort of signing bonus is enticing.

“And that $12 million basically is nonrefundable. Win or lose in court the city of Chester would be able to receive that $12 million” Kirkland said.

He told WHYY News that he is open to public meetings with Aqua ratepayers and even CWA so that everyone understands one another. But that’s contingent on the city not sinking in the near future.

The predominantly Black city has a population of about 30000 people. However it was once a hub for manufacturing with a population more than double what it is now.

Both Chester and the local Chester Upland School District have been in a long economic freefall. Since 1995 Chester has been under the state’s financial oversight. In 2020 the situation took a dramatic turn when Gov. Tom Wolf issued a “declaration of fiscal emergency” for Chester.

With that step Chester became just the second municipality in the state’s history (Harrisburg was the first) to be placed under receivership.

Receiver Michael Doweary arguably has one of the toughest jobs in the state. He said the situation is far worse than can be imagined: Chester is on “the brink of insolvency” and there is no playbook.

“Pensions in the city of Chester are the worst-funded plans in the entire commonwealth maybe the country. To have a police pension plan that is 3% funded that if nothing else is done the benefits the money in the reserves would run out in the next five months — that’s unheard of” Doweary said. “Desperate times call for desperate measures.”

Vijay Kapoor chief of staff to Doweary said past decisions have come back to haunt them.

“There were benefit changes over a decade ago that actually enhanced the police pension benefits that allows certain police officers to retire with a $100000-a-year pension. And under commonwealth law it’s very difficult for the receiver to be able to change those” Kapoor said.

It shouldn’t be lost on everybody that righting the ship for a city that has lost most of its population is a tall order Kapoor said.

Like Mayor Kirkland Doweary sees CWA as a golden ticket to recovery.

“To be financially viable Chester needs a big influx of money and the only asset that the city has that would even come close to generating that amount of money is the water system” he said.

But Doweary said he has not made up his mind nor does he have a timetable for a decision. Both Doweary and Kapoor said there is a possibility the water authority can remain in public hands.

“The receiver is absolutely open to keeping the system in public hands. The receiver had an independent analysis that was done on the water system about a year ago that valued the system and looked at the variety of bids… There was also the potential of… using a public-private partnership as a model of keeping it in public hands and the receiver is open to seeing whether or not that might prove useful” Kapoor said.

Doweary said the public should be patient.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM0MTA2LWdlb3JnaWEtcG9ydC1waW5zLWhvcGVzLW9uLXJhaWwtdG8tbW92ZS04MDAwMC1jb250YWluZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia Port Pins Hopes on Rail to Move 80000 Containers,"At the Port of Savannah one of the busiest U.S. trade gateways containers are stacked up like colorful children’s building blocks stretching as far as the eye can see.

A surge of imports driven by strong consumer demand — coupled with a shortage of truckers and a lack of warehouse space — has left 80000 containers lingering at the 1400-acre port on the eastern shore of Georgia in recent weeks. An average of 30 ships have been anchored off the coast waiting for days to come ashore and unload their cargo.

On Friday Georgia Governor Brian Kemp surrounded by port workers in bright orange vests and state dignitaries in suits announced the completion of a new rail system and a $8-million plan to open temporary container yards around the region. The two moves “are important to resolve the supply chain issues for Georgia and the nation” Kemp said.

As the port’s nine new rail tracks have come on line over the past few weeks — part of what the state calls the Mason Mega Rail yard — containers have started to move at a quicker pace according to Georgia Port Authority Executive Director Griff Lynch.

The GPA has seen a 60% reduction in the amount of time that containers sit at the terminal since the start of September. The improved cargo flow has created additional space at the terminal and reduced the number of ships waiting at anchor by 40% Lynch said. On Friday there were 20 ships idling at least 15 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean.

The port authority’s new rail yard which cost $230 million and has been under construction for four years allows the port to operate as many as six 10000-foot trains at one time. Each train measures nearly two miles in length at full capacity and can carry about 350 containers.

Facing a truck driver shortage Georgia officials have been contacting large retailers and urging them to move their goods from the port by train instead of by truck. “We’re telling them ‘wherever you can do so start converting to rail’” said GPA spokesman Robert Morris.

The governor also announced that the state had reached agreements to transport containers to three new temporary container yards around the state beginning as soon as Monday creating more room at the port terminal and moving the goods closer to their final destinations.

Employees at the Savannah port have been working around-the-clock. The facility is spending 30% more than had been budgeted on wages and benefits after adding new workers and extending overtime pay according to Joel Wooten chairman of the port authority’s board.

The port authority said that in October it had handled more than 500000 so-called TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units a record number. “The last six months have been very challenging” Wooten said. “We’ve all been working shoulder-to-shoulder day and night.”",,,,,,

The fast charging network intends to increase its utilization through attracting more high-volume ridshare drivers through discounts and benefits.

The number of rideshare vehicles on the road is estimated at nearly one million which is a noticeable pool of potential customers especially since the electrification of the rideshare business progresses.

According to EVgo's survey rideshare drivers often charge multiple times per day:

about 47% of drivers drive more than 800 miles each week

about 34% of drivers drive 400 to 800 miles each week

about 19% of drivers drive less than 400 miles each week

Those drivers rely heavily on public fast charging and require chargers conveniently located in high ridership urban areas.

According to the press release the expanded EVgo Discount Program (see details here) with Uber will offer two tariffs for Uber drivers:

Uber Pro status: access to EVgo’s member rates without any monthly fees or session fees

access to EVgo’s member rates without any monthly fees or session fees Uber Pro Gold Platinum or Diamond status: access to EVgo’s Plus rates without any monthly fees or session fees

""As part of the expanded EVgo Discount Program with Uber drivers are granted access to discounted EVgo accounts and pricing based on their Uber Pro status. Drivers using Uber -- regardless of status– will continue to be able to access EVgo’s member rates without any monthly fees. Drivers with Uber Pro Gold Platinum or Diamond status will unlock even lower EVgo Plus rates saving up to 30% on charging costs over EVgo’s standard Pay As You Go rates.* *Actual savings subject to time of day location geography and length of charging session""

Uber and EVgo - example prices (click here to enlarge):

See EVgo Discount Program with Uber.

Uber which intends to become a fully zero-emission platform by 2030 in the U.S. adds its own incentives to convince drivers to use electric vehicles.

""In addition to new charging discounts EV drivers can also earn more per trip from Uber including a dollar more per trip incentive for fully electric drivers on any product plus $0.50 more when completing Uber Green trips. Uber Green is the most widely available low- or no-emission on-demand ride product in the world now available in 100 urban areas across 2 continents. By selecting Uber Green riders can support current drivers who use sustainable modes of transportation as well as Uber’s Green Future Program which utilizes Uber Green fees and proceeds to help hundreds of thousands of rideshare drivers transition to electric vehicles by 2025.""

Uber is expected to get up to 50000 Tesla cars from Hertz at discounted rates of $334 per week including insurance and maintenance (with an option for 100000 more).

EVgo says that it has prepared nearly 600 integrated Tesla connectors (most likely through the use of an integrated Tesla-CHAdeMO adapter) at EVgo stations across the U.S. for Tesla drivers.

Adam Gromis Head of Sustainability Policy at Uber said:

“Helping drivers go electric remains one of the most important things we can do as a company. The enhanced incentives from EVgo’s program help drivers save money and take another step towards transforming Uber into a zero emissions platform.”

Cathy Zoi CEO at EVgo said:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLTU5MjY3NTky0gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtNTkyNjc1OTIuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bolt: Ride-hailing app to let London drivers set their own fares,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91ay1uZXdzLzIwMjEvbm92LzEzL3RheGktdGF4aS13aHktaXRzLXN1ZGRlbmx5LWdldHRpbmctc28taGFyZC10by1maW5kLWEtY2Fi0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VrLW5ld3MvMjAyMS9ub3YvMTMvdGF4aS10YXhpLXdoeS1pdHMtc3VkZGVubHktZ2V0dGluZy1zby1oYXJkLXRvLWZpbmQtYS1jYWI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taxi? Taxi? Why it’s suddenly getting so hard to find a cab,"For people crowding back into restaurants stumbling out of reopened clubs or heading again to airports life is getting back to normal. At least that is until they pick up their phone for a taxi or search a ride-hailing app in vain. Where have all the cab drivers gone?

“It’s horrendous” says Steve Farrier owner of Alpha Cars in Havant Hampshire. “You can’t get drivers for love or money. You don’t get a break.” He turns the automated booking service off at weekends “or we couldn’t meet the demand”.

For most of 2020 and 2021 it was customers that were missing as Covid killed the cab trade. Now firms small and large from Alpha to Uber lack drivers at a time when business could boom again.

Many cab drivers who left – for sectors such as retail which have staff shortages of their own – have little desire to return. Others face long waits for paperwork and tests. And those who stayed can choose the jobs they take leaving the less lucrative pick-ups stranded.

If a taxi is a luxury for some it remains a lifeline in rural areas without public transport for shift workers those with disabilities and people out late – particularly women whose safety has again been put squarely in focus this year.

“In Manchester which has a good night-time economy it’s a real problem” says Derek Brocklehurst manager of Cresta Cars one of the city’s largest private hire firms. After more than 40 years in business he says: “We feel embarrassed unable to fulfil our customers’ requirements with people having to wait one or two hours.” Some drivers only want to work days since the pandemic he says: “They’ve taken on different jobs their work-life has changed and they are spending more time with their families.”

To apply to be a driver with record checks and medicals can cost nearly £600 and take months. Some authorities such as Manchester require geographical route tests which catch many out and Brocklehurst argues are unnecessary: “Uber operate from Liverpool Wolverhampton rock up with satnavs and there is no issue with that. There’s a big disparity between all the councils.”

Similar frustrations are felt across the industry. Claire Reynolds runs a small chauffeur service NTD from Leighton Buzzard for pre-booked journeys such as airport transfers. Regardless new drivers have to wait months to take the same Bedfordshire route test as taxis on ranks. “It’s going to be a six-month process to get a new driver which is incredible” Reynolds says. “People want to work but we’re held up by bureaucracy.”

Steve Wright chair of the Licensed Private Hire Car Association (LPHCA) is scathing: “The barriers to entry are ridiculous.” As well as tardy councils the DVLA and overstretched health services have been accused of being slow with licences and medicals.

The Department for Transport says licensed vehicle numbers in England decreased 16% in the year to June and licensed drivers by 6%. But the LPHCA says many more are not working: it estimates only 160000 of the nearly 300000 pre-Covid cab drivers are active.

The Local Government Association says councils try to support the taxi trade by “taking a flexible and pragmatic approach [but] need to ensure that important safeguards that protect the public are maintained”.

Meanwhile the biggest player in the market Uber raised its rates in London last week – base fares up 10% airport transfers up 25% – to try to lure 20000 more drivers. Uber admits its users have experienced ever more cancelled trips as well as surge pricing when too many passengers chase the few cars available.

Steve McNamara general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association representing black-cab drivers has long argued Uber’s cheap fares were never sustainable. London taxi driver numbers have also fallen by about 5%; but a bigger issue is the lack of actual vehicles he says. Expensive to own and insure and with older diesels falling foul of clean-air rules some 5000 black cabs were handed back sold or scrapped as the city emptied last year and only 13500 remain: “You can’t rent a cab anywhere at the moment.”

He points out that there is no shortage of aspiring Tube drivers – “the worst job in the world but well paid”. Unions concur. As Nader Awaad chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the IWGB union puts it: “There is not a driver shortage. There is a pay shortage.”

The IWGB says drivers for Uber Bolt and others are refusing jobs because costs have risen not least fuel and pay has been cut by fixed fares. Uber says hourly rates can be £20-£30 – but during rides not in the time spent driving to pick up a customer.

Minicab drivers who switched to fixed employment with supermarkets have seen better McNamara says: “They get tea breaks holidays national insurance someone supplying the vehicle. And they’re not grovelling to some drunk at three in the morning to get their star rating. Why come back to Uber?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXhpLXBvaW50LmNvLnVrL3Bvc3Qvc2hvcnRhZ2VzLXViZXItZHJpdmVycy1hcmUtYWNjZXB0aW5nLWZld2VyLWpvYnMtYXMtaXQtbWFrZXMtbm8tZmluYW5jaWFsLXNlbnNlLXNheXMtdXBoZC11bmlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SHORTAGES: Uber drivers are accepting fewer jobs as it makes no financial sense says UPHD union,"







Private hire drivers are accepting fewer rides offered by ride-hailing firm Uber because it makes no financial sense for drivers to work them says union representatives.





The global ride-hailing operator claims mass departures from the industry have resulted in a driver shortage on the Uber platform. However drivers from the United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD) branch of the IWGB highlight the decline in pay per mile as the real reason for increased waiting times and the shortage of rides available.

Representatives said the impact of this has been made worse by recent fuel spikes and a host of other issues relating to unfair pay. The UPHD say drivers are not paid for the drive to pick up customers and can be offered trips 20 miles from their location.





Fixed-rate fares which are calculated on the basis of the shortest distance from pickup to drop off are also impacting drivers according to the Union. The fixed-rates introduced in late 2020 are said to not account for diversions unexpected route changes or traffic congestion which all come at the driver’s expense.





Increasingly Uber has turned to ‘surge’ pricing to deal with the increase in drivers rejecting rides targeting local areas with higher demand and enticing drivers to travel to these areas to get the higher fares.

Nader Awaad Chair of the UPHD (IWGB) said : “There is not a driver shortage. There is a pay shortage. We are ready to work but Uber is making it impossible for us because the pay has become so low. After costs and the drive to pick-up customers we do not have enough money to live. We should not be forced to volunteer for a multi-billion dollar company.





“These pay cuts mean that our right to pensions and holiday pay confirmed by the Supreme Court is coming out of our pockets instead of Uber’s.





“Surge pricing is not the answer. We want all rides to be valued fairly so that we have enough money to pay our costs and live. Until app operators deal with the root of the problem and pay us fairly customers are going to be left waiting in the rain.”

The Mumbai-based startup is a logistics marketplace that allows businesses to book vehicles on demand for completing intra-city logistics needs. At present Porter works with ecommerce FMCG SMEs traders 3PLs courier and cargo companies. It has disrupted various domains of logistics by launching an on-demand marketplace for LCVs and bikes — Porter for Enterprise and Packers and Movers.

The journey

Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug the founders were inspired by the ‘Uber for X’ concept seven years ago to serve consumers with on-demand services.





The co-founders studied the business model of Uber and similar companies which were aggregating existing supply chains and matching it to demand in a much more efficient and effortless way by using technology. The trio did ground research on logistics in Mumbai and found a huge market gap in the last-mile delivery space.

While speaking to YourStory Pranav recalls that in 2014 the intra-logistics industry was a highly fragmented market with glaring gaps in demand and supply poor matchmaking and low asset utilisation.





“With the existing challenges the industry also lacked an ecosystem for smooth functioning of the entire logistics cycle. It was clear to us that only a tech intervention can fix the gaps. Hence Porter was started to turn these challenges into opportunities and to leverage the promising intra-city logistics market in India” he adds.





The industry had other challenges as well. Co-founder Uttam says when they started Porter they realised there were bigger complications on the partner side.





“We also unearthed some uncomfortable social stigmas especially the ones related to the pain points about owning an LCV (Light Commercial Vehicle). It was this knowledge that changed the way we decided to solve the problem” he adds.





Echoing the same Vikas says that based on all these factors the trio took a deep-dive to understand the partner problems and then created a marketplace that would create an efficient and reliable ecosystem in the industry.

“While the business and its stakeholders must create an effective economic cycle the larger purpose for Porter over the years has been to create a social impact that positively changes the lives of every stakeholder in this journey” he adds.

He says that the spirit and dedication to disrupt the industry and create a social impact became their turning point.

The constant evolution

However the eureka moment or turning point according to Pranav was evolving the startup into a tech-enabled marketplace and creating an ecosystem in this space from being just an on-demand marketplace connecting customers to drivers and improving both their visibility and efficiency.





“It is rare for startups to see their original thesis playing out” says Pranav. “We were quick to realise that the major disruption in the industry was on the supply side and we need to shift our focus towards addressing those problems thereby creating a strong impact on the demand side. This resulted in creating a virtuous cycle with strong network effects. The ecosystem paved the way for increased vehicle utilisation better SLA (service-level agreement) and higher-income for its driver-partners. From the smallest to the biggest intervention every step in our journey has been built around the ecosystem with great focus on our supply side” he explains.

According to the team the drivers earn 30 percent more and customers save 20 percent on logistics costs and have a better experience with lower wait times and higher availability.

Porter is also one of the only logistics models that is 100 percent asset-light and has a negative working capital cycle as per the founders.





The startup which was started with two vehicles in August 2014 is now present in over 13 cities across India with more than 50 lakh customers and over two lakh owner-drivers on board.





Porter also claims to have consistently achieved triple-digit annual growth since its launch and has been growing faster with scale as network effects play out."

Why Trust Us?

Jennifer Garner's dedication to skincare extends far beyond her own complexion. The mom of three is passionate about teaching her kids a proper routine—even her nine-year-old son Sam—which is why every bathroom in their house is stocked with a crucial product: cleanser.



The 49-year-old and Neutrogena partner keeps the brand's staple at the ready at all times recently telling People that it's an “absolute must-do” that she “can't live without.”

“It's in every bathroom for me and for my kids” she said. “I will stand next to my son because I monitor his toothbrushing. And when he is done... I will cup water in my hands and give him water. And then while I'm doing that I get his face and I get some daily cleanser because you have to wash your face before bed. You have to get into that habit.”

The cleanser is also perfect for Garner's teen and pre-teen daughters—Violet 15 and Seraphina 12—who are in the midst of establishing their own regimens. “I don't care if he's 9 and he's never heard of a pimple” she said of Sam. “I don't care you have to do it.”

The best-selling cleanser is great for all skin types—especially sensitive skin. It's oil-free soap-free hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic and washes away impurities without stripping the skin of its moisture. Really you can't go wrong with it.

Garner herself has kept a Neutrogena-centered skincare routine for decades all the while using the gentle wash. Some of her more recent favorites from the brand are the (which she told People ""gives the skin a real youthful vibrancy"") and the .

“You’ve got to find a way to introduce your retinol products” the 13 Going on 30 star previously told Prevention . “That’s tricky for women because it can make you peel it can make you red.” Thankfully the Power Serum is gentle yet effective.

Most importantly Garner and her kids never skimp on sunscreen. She swears by . “People say to me 'My gosh I have the hardest time my kid does not want to put on sunscreen.' But you just can't let that be an option” she previously told People. “There's every kind of delivery system that you could possibly want now. So they get to pick if they want a lotion a spray a stick ... they know I will take them out and spray them down. You can't give in.”

If you buy through our links we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.

Let's get right to it: Are toners really necessary for people with dry skin? Face toners often get a bad rap when it comes to dry skin. Those with oily or combination skin may already use a toner as an essential part of their skincare routine since traditional alcohol-based toners have historically been designed with acne-prone and oily skin in mind. But times are changing and the toner world has expanded to include options for all skin types — including dry.

""Historically toners were used to augment the effects of face cleanser but today I view them as an additional way to add dilute active ingredients to the skin and to prep for the next steps of the skincare regimen"" explains Michelle Henry M.D. founder of Skin & Aesthetic Surgery of Manhattan in New York City.

What to look for (and avoid) in a good toner for dry skin

When shopping for the best toners for dry skin she suggests looking for mositurizing humectant and hydrating ingredients on product labels including:

Glycerin

Aloe vera

Hyaluronic acid

Rosewater

""Toners are a great way to add extra hydration to your skin"" she adds — just don't forget to lock in those super-hydrating ingredients by applying a good moisturizer afterwards. But it's not just about the ingredients in the toner; it's also important to make sure that certain ingredients are left out. ""You want to avoid any harsh highly acidic ingredients including those that are in toners for oily skin"" Dr. Henry says. Steer clear of the following ingredients if you have dry skin she advises as they can dehydrate your complexion:

Alcohol

Salicylic acid

Benzoyl peroxide

Synthetic fragrances

The effectiveness of these measures has been challenged but for now airlines have few other options to show passengers they’re trying to make a start on lowering carbon output.Lufthansa is considering everything from marking seats green to creating digital badges that can be shown on a phone.“We do think the eco-conscious traveller wants people to know that they’re an eco-conscious traveller” chief customer officer Christina Foerster said in an interview. “It needs to be chic to show off you’re flying green.”Airlines face a challenge in shifting onto travellers a bigger share of the potential $2tn industrywide cost of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Lufthansa and other carriers already offer customers ways to pay extra for emissions but just 1% pitch in.Increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels is likely to raise airline ticket prices United Airlines Holdings Inc chief executive officer Scott Kirby said at the COP26 climate conference.“That’s the way it should be” Kirby said. “Ticket prices should be a little higher to offset the impact on the environment.” While the fuel should eventually become cheaper in the medium-term the cost will be high he said.Corporations cut back on flying during the coronavirus crisis eating into the highest-margin premium seats sold by airlines. Environmentalists argue that continuing to fly less is the best way for the industry to lower carbon emissions until new planes using technologies like battery or hydrogen power come into service.“Technology takes 10-plus years to scale up” Andrew Murphy aviation director for campaigners Transport & Environment said on a panel at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow this week. “The problem is we don’t have 10 years. So the most effective way to reduce emissions from aviation is to fly less.”Airlines have resisted calls to scale back. The industry’s initial approach to lowering emissions was to introduce a carbon-offset programme that’s been criticised for not being rigorous enough to make an impact.Companies are also pledging to increase the use of SAFs a substitute for the kerosene powering today’s jet engines. But limited supply and high cost are obstacles to wider adoption.Paying for SAF a focal point for aviation net-zero goals trumpeted at COP26 would add measurably to costs.,,,,,,

We live in a wild new era where small deliveries can touch down within minutes of being ordered traveling across town at high speeds. At this point the only hold-up is red tape. The service is very popular in the few places where drone deliveries are permitted– including the Australian city of Logan Queensland.

Wing Drone Delivery Service

Alphabet’s Wing spinoff has already made as many as 50000 deliveries in Logan since it launched activities in 2019 via its app and service making the Australian city the world’s drone delivery capital.

Wing has flown out sushi rolls BBQ chickens snack packs coffees hardware items and an array of other small packages on demand. So far eleven local businesses are acting as suppliers. According to Wing demand for the ultra-fast drone delivery service is growing dramatically wherever it’s available. The company claims that deliveries grew by 500% from 2019 to 2020 and that in the second quarter of 2021 it made more deliveries than in all of 2020.

Wing uses autonomous lift-and-cruise style electric multi-copter drones that weigh 10.6 lb (4.8 kg) and can carry 3.3 lb (1.5 kg). The 4.3 ft (1.3 m) long drone has 12 vertical lift propellers and two forward propellers with a 5-ft (1.5-m) wingspan. In addition top speeds reach 64.9 mph (104.4 km/h) and round-trip distances up to 12 miles (20 km). Furthermore there are several batteries and navigation systems “for the sake of redundancy.”

Small packages are loaded and attached to ropes. The drones fly autonomously using onboard cameras sensors and Wing’s air traffic control systems. Once they reach their destination they hover at an altitude of 23 ft (7 m) and lower the package down on its tether. When the box comes to the ground it’s unclipped then the rope retracts and the drone flies away.

Wing had Virginia Tech research how people feel about drone deliveries and found that between 23% to 50% of people support the idea in areas that don’t offer the service while roughly 90% support it in places where it’s established and available.

People who were not impressed with drone deliveries complained about the noise. Eight months ago a resident living under a Wing flight path commented in a Reddit thread: “I’m getting buzzed by these things 5-10 times an hour every hour of every day of my life. The soundtrack of my existence is now these drones just whizzing past my place and they’re really not very high up either.”

However Wing addressed this issue in May reducing the noise of the drones by roughly 50%. And sure enough the same Reddit user updated the thread five months ago stating that “the traffic has actually backed off a bit. I don’t know if it’s related to flight paths or their promo weekends are no longer happening but my neighbor and I were speaking over the fence when one of the quieter ones flew past and to their credit it was significantly better.”

One thing is sure drone deliveries are part of the urban life future and can make many things better. For example they’ll get items to your door faster than ever before cheaper and without adding more traffic to the roads or burning fossil fuel. On that note they’ll also be safer for city residents on the streets because they won’t cause any road crashes.

Wing plans to continue expanding its services first focusing on small cities with populations under 500K where local aviation authorities permit them to operate. Eventually autonomous deliveries will likely be fully certified nationwide as technologies continue to advance and engineers improve drones to become even more precise efficient and less disruptive.

Watch Wing make deliveries in the short video below.

A2Z RDSX Cargo-Dropping Delivery Drone

Last year California-based A2Z Drone Delivery unveiled its Rapid Delivery System 1 (RDS1) letting third-party delivery drones drop packages to customers on a long rope. Now the technology has been incorporated into a custom-designed multicopter drone.

The initial RDS1 kit consists of a motorized reel of Kevlar cord at the end of which has an elastic fabric black pouch that can hold a payload weighing up to 2 kg (4.4 lb).

Once the drone reaches its location it hovers at an altitude of 46 m (150 ft) and releases the brake on the reel causing the pouch to freefall through the air. Before that pouch hits the ground the brake is reapplied slowing it to a stop. This function is possible thanks to a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor built into the drone which measures precisely how far the aircraft is from the ground.

The pouch is then reeled back up to the drone once the customer retrieves their package. The system has several advantages including keeping the aircraft’s noise and dangerous spinning propellers away from the public and making drone deliveries more efficient since they don’t have to waste time and energy maneuvering up and down or around obstacles.

The original RDS1 was designed to be installed on a DJI Matrice 600 Pro hexacopter but now the system is integrated into A2Z’s new RDSX octocopter. However it still works on the same principles; the only difference is that the drone has two reel/cargo box units making two 2 kg deliveries (or one delivery of two pouches) per mission.

According to the company the RDSX has a battery range of approximately 9 miles (15 km) when carrying two loads or 18 mi (30 km) if carrying one. Two sets of batteries are included (8 in total) which can be quickly swapped out at the base station. When the drone is not in use its propeller arms can be folded in turning it into a 2.6 by 4.3 ft- wide cube (0.8 m-tall by 1.3 m).

If the copter experiences a power failure or gets into a risky situation it can deploy a safety parachute and jettison its payload. Finally while the RDSX can autonomously make deliveries dual cameras enable remotely located operators to fly it manually. In addition they can also take manual control of the cargo box drops if needed.

Watch the RDSX in action in the video below.

Wingcopter Drone Delivery Service

In March 2020 German drone maker Wingcopter and United Parcel Service (UPS) partnered to deliver its packages to remote locations that would otherwise be very difficult. UPS Flight Forward (UPSFF) was the first company approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the first to fly commercial drone deliveries outside the visual line of sight.

Wingcopter was used in Vanuatu to deliver vaccines for children in remote parts of the island that would typically take more than 6 hours to walk. In other beyond visual line of sight (BVLOD) flights Wingcopter has also delivered insulin across the North Sea to an Irish Island. The drone’s ability to lower the packages down without needing a landing spot gives them even more range.

In addition to using drones to deliver medical supplies to hospitals and medical facilities UPSFF also plans to deliver retail prescriptions and medical products in residential settings.

On April 27 2021 Wingcopter launched a new generation model its flagship eVTOL fixed-wing delivery drone – the Wingcopter 198. And now the transport drone pioneer has partnered with Air Methods to form a healthcare-specific drone delivery network across the US.

This new Air Methods/Wingcopter drone delivery network called Spright will improve access to urgently needed medical supplies for healthcare workers and the communities they serve. To make this possible Air Methods will deploy fleets of Wingcopter 198.

Air Methods founded in 1980 currently has more than 300 bases across 48 states in the US. In addition it has a fleet of 450 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft making roughly 100000 deliveries of medical supplies and equipment annually to hospitals and residents predominantly in rural areas.

Wingcopter’s 25.5 x 77.9 x 59.8 in (65 x 198 x 152 cm) flagship eight-rotor delivery drone can ascend vertically like a helicopter and then transition to fixed-wing horizontal flight once flying. It can deliver up to three separate packages to multiple destinations with a total weight of 5 kg (11 lb) during a single flight. Each parcel is lowered by its own winch from hovered flight mode.

Tom Plümmer the co-founder and CEO of Wingcopter explained:

We are thrilled to team up with Air Methods to create a life-saving drone delivery network throughout the United States. Our technology has been used globally to effectively deliver medical supplies for example insulin in Ireland children’s vaccines in Vanuatu emergency medication in Malawi and just recently blood samples in Germany. Our vision to ‘save and improve lives’ resonates perfectly with Air Methods’ legacy of providing life-saving care combined with Spright’s ambition to improve the quality of healthcare across the US by deploying fleets of Wingcopters and we are excited about scaling this together.

Spright will initially launch as a pilot trial in Kansas this (Northern Hemisphere) fall with partners Hutchinson Regional Medical Systems. Assuming the proof of concept proves successful a nationwide network of rapid drone delivery of medical supplies will be rolled out using Air Methods’ existing bases.

Besides making deliveries more convenient drones also make inspections safer quicker easier and cheaper. For example drones inspect live powerlines railway tracks and subway tunnels which are dangerous challenging and expensive procedures when humans perform the task.",,,,,,,,,,,,
URI,United Rentals,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzEzLzMtc3RvY2tzLXRoYXQtY291bGQtd2luLWJpZy11bmRlci1iaWRlbnMtaW5mcmFzdHJ1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks That Could Win Big Under Biden's Infrastructure Bill,"These stocks should benefit as the infrastructure bill becomes law.

After lots of debate and delay the infrastructure bill is on its way to President Joe Biden who will sign it into law. The $1 trillion spending package will provide funding for roads bridges ports rail water the electric grid broadband internet and so much more. It should provide a significant long-term boost to the U.S. economy.

The spending package should also boost the fortunes of companies focused on infrastructure. Three infrastructure stocks that these Fool.com contributors see as big beneficiaries are Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF -0.74%) Xcel Energy (XEL 0.40%) and United Rentals (URI 1.29%). Here's why they could be long-term winners as the U.S. makes a major investment to upgrade its aging infrastructure.

Leveraged to increased demand

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Cleveland-Cliffs): Over the past couple of years Cleveland-Cliffs has turned itself from a steel industry supplier into an integrated steelmaker that also sells key competitors iron ore pellets and other steelmaking inputs. Its core steelmaking assets are largely blast furnaces which create primary steel from iron ore. This is a capital-intensive process that requires high utilization rates in order to turn a profit. But if the infrastructure bill heats up demand that shouldn't be a big issue. Notably when operating at high rates blast furnaces are often more profitable than the electric arc mini-mills that underpin competitors like Nucor.

At the same time as its mills are doing well Cleveland-Cliffs could also be benefiting from increased demand for its steelmaking ingredients. Basically Cleveland-Cliffs wins and wins again as its customers which are also its steelmaking peers benefit. It is thus heavily leveraged to the elevated steel demand likely to come from increased infrastructure spending.

To be fair this isn't exactly news to Wall Street. Cleveland-Cliffs' stock is the best-performing North American steel mill over the past year. However thanks to the mergers used to create it the steelmaker also has the most leverage with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.3 times twice as high as the next competitor. But a good industry upturn can help generate the cash it needs to deal with its relatively weak balance sheet. And even if the stock doesn't continue to outdistance its peers it will have the opportunity to strengthen its industry position just the same.

Aligning its investment plan with the infrastructure bill

Matt DiLallo (Xcel Energy): The infrastructure package includes significant funding for the energy transition to cleaner alternatives. For example it features $7.5 billion for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and another $65 billion to improve the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid. The bill will also boost lower-carbon fuel sources like green hydrogen.

That aligns perfectly with Xcel Energy's investment plan. The utility has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is investing billions of dollars to achieve that bold goal.

In addition to investing heavily in renewable energy Xcel Energy is spending billions of dollars on upgrading its transmission system. It's also building EV infrastructure including installing charging stations in major transportation corridors and underserved communities. It sees the potential to invest $750 million on EV charging infrastructure in the 2022 to 2026 time frame and upward of an additional $1.7 billion in the back half of the decade. Meanwhile it sees significant potential in hydrogen. The company said it could invest up to $4 billion over the coming decade on hydrogen-related projects to blend that emissions-free fuel into its natural gas system.

The infrastructure bill should enhance Xcel's ability to make these investments. The company could tap into government-funded programs from the infrastructure bill to support its spending plans. That could enable it to achieve its decarbonization efforts while creating significant value for shareholders by growing its earnings and dividend.

Winning even before infrastructure spending kicks off

Neha Chamaria (United Rentals): Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill proposes huge investments into building roads bridges airports ports and clean energy. United Rentals' huge rental fleet serves all of these industries and more. In fact construction is at the core of United Rentals' business with its general rentals segment offering construction and industrial equipment and its trench power and fluid solutions segment offering specialty construction products and services.

As federal spending on infrastructure picks up so should demand for heavy machinery like the ones United Rentals rents out. In fact the company is already witnessing higher demand even before federal spending kicks off: In October while announcing its third-quarter numbers United Rentals raised the upper end of its 2021 revenue outlook to between $9.6 billion and $9.75 billion and expects to generate cash from operations worth $3.55 billion at the midpoint versus its earlier projection of $3.45 billion. Growth of 22% in its third-quarter rental revenue encouraged United Rentals to upgrade its outlook.

As the largest equipment rentals company in North America with 13% market share with a fleet of nearly 770000 machines presence in 49 states in the U.S. a highly diversified customer base and an acquisitive growth strategy to expand its footprint United Rentals looks well positioned to win as infrastructure spending in the U.S. gathers steam.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lola Ronning (center) alternates as the titular little redheaded girl. Photo by Glen Stubbe Photography.

Doors are open again at The Children’s Theatre Company in Minneapolis Minnesota. After many long months of morphing content online and adapting classes the UnitedHealth Group Stage is again alive with the sounds of…tomorrow?



Yes “Tomorrow” – the infamously upbeat solo delivered by the American musical theatre’s most famous redhead role: Annie Warbucks. Just as the source comic strip Little Orphan Annie debuted in 1924 in the aftermath of the 1918-1920 flu pandemic CTC is returning from the present pandemic with a revival of the musical Annie.



2021-2022 is a conservative season for most large theatre companies as they try to woo audiences back to live entertainment after 20 months of mostly streamed content. This fall theatre marquees are advertising classics all around the Twin Cities: Fiddler on the Roof at the Ordway Oklahoma! at the Orpheum and (of course) A Christmas Carol at the Guthrie. Thus it’s little surprise to see CTC joining the club with a perennial favorite like Annie.

Many fans of the newspaper comic and its compilations best remember Little Orphan Annie for its Great Depression-era incarnation in part because these strips were reprinted in U.S. newspapers from 1974-1979. The reprinting of Little Orphan Annie‘s classic strips in the 1970s was a response to several artists’ unsuccessful attempts to assume the mantle of strip creator Harold Gray after he passed away in 1968. This retro move kindled something of a revival: previously slacking newspaper syndication increased and a new generation of readers became acquainted with the comic’s golden years.

In this resyndicated run of strips Gray did not pull many punches. Far from living the high life Daddy Warbucks is financially ruined by the Depression forced to take menial work. Then tragedy tears Daddy and Annie apart as World War 2 looms on the horizon and eventually drafts its characters into all sorts of wartime actions. This is heavy stuff but relatable for many old fans during the depression and for many new ones during the economic unrest leading into the 1979 energy crisis.

Around the same time that the resyndication began a writer for The New Yorker named Thomas Meehan was approached by composer-lyricist Charles Strouse of Bye Bye Birdie fame. Strouse had a question: was Meehan interested in collaborating on a musical? Only after the latter said “yes” did Strouse reveal the sort of musical that he wanted them to write: an adaptation of Little Orphan Annie. Although Meehan had grown up reading the strip he almost dismissed the idea offhand as impossible to adapt – but Strouse was persistent.

Eventually Meehan decided that the way forward was to look past Little Orphan Annie‘s brush with verismo during the Great Depression. Instead the musical draws its inspiration from the comic’s early years in which the titular orphan Annie is plucked from an orphanage and adopted by the wealthy Daddy Warbucks. Naturally it’s not an entirely smooth path but it ends well and as neatly wrapped as one of the 1920s storylines.

The path forward now clear the pair teamed up with Martin Chamin – an original Broadway cast member of West Side Story-turned-lyricist and director. Four years later Annie was opening at the Goodspeed Opera House. The next year it opened on Broadway eventually racked up 2377 performances. With an accessible score and multiple roles for child actors it became a community educational and regional theatre with an estimated 700-900 productions in the United States per pre-pandemic year. It’s a pretty safe bet for a post-pandemic return to the UnitedHealth Group Stage.

And what about that writer from The New Yorker? Meehan went on to collaborate on the screenplay for Spaceballs wrote the libretto for the musical Hairspray worked on the stage version of The Producers and co-wrote Elf the Musical‘s book among others – but it all started with a little red-haired orphan girl.

The proposed contract the first for fast-food workers in the nation now goes to union members for a vote.

What ultimately tipped the scales after three years of bargaining according to the union: Burgerville agreed to reinstate a credit card tipping system.

The company had removed the system over concerns that employees not customers were filling out the tip amount as most purchases moved from dining rooms to drive-thrus.

“The intention was to build a system that’s resilient and secure. And we have it. It’s there” says Hillary Barbour Burgerville’s director of strategic initiatives. “Any customer would want to make sure they had control over whether they tipped or not. When dining rooms were open they could see it and do it. The drive-thru is a little clunkier. We got some new PIN pads that made it more secure.”

A union spokesman Mark Medina puts it more bluntly: “The tips were apparently so good that the company didn’t believe workers weren’t just stealing.”

Medina tells WW that when the new tipping system was tried out again at the Oregon Convention Center location this year the average hourly wage came out to $22 to $25 compared with the beginning wage of $14.25.

“We can live with the situation of wages right now as long as we can build a floor for workers in regards to everything else” Medina says.

Other provisions that would be codified under the contract would change how paid vacation works and also offer workers a three-month schedule instead of the standard three-week schedule.

Medina says the company pledged during bargaining to reopen the Burgerville location in Lents sometime this winter.

That location at Southeast 92nd Avenue and Powell Boulevard was shut down in August after Burgerville headquarters said its workers were reporting increased crime and vandalism around the shop. A company spokesperson told WW at the time: “The environment around the restaurant has deteriorated seriously. Police are now being called daily. Burgerville employees have found weapons drug paraphernalia and human waste on the property.”

Barbour says reopening the Lents location is “not part of the agreement” but adds the company is looking to reopen all of its closed shops. “We’re working on hiring and reopening all of those locations before the end of the year including Lents but that is not related to the contract or the agreement.”

The union said the closure came as a complete shock at the time. Three months later Medina says he still hasn’t gotten answers about why the location closed its doors.

A fairly large homeless camp pitched tents alongside the Lents location and when Burgerville shut its doors in August campers told WW they worried it was an effort to put pressure on the city to sweep the camp.

“Customers who were using the drive-thru would complain about the unsightly camp nearby” Medina says.

Barbour says the property has been monitored since its closure: “We are fencing off the area that’s Burgerville property to make that more secure. We’re continuing to have private security monitor the property we’re working on de-escalation training for our employees we’re continuing to clean up that area. We had to relocate some campers who were on Burgerviile property.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaHVtYW4tcmVzb3VyY2VzLWhlYWx0aC5iaW9tZWRjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4xMTg2L3MxMjk2MC0wMjEtMDA2ODEtMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do health policies address the availability accessibility acceptability and quality of human resources for health ...,"Framework for policy content analysis

We created a three-tiered framework with dimensions strategies and actions for assessing HRH strengthening (Fig. 1). The first level is based on four HRH–AAAQ dimensions proposed by the WHO—Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA) [10]. GHWA is a partnership of global stakeholders administered by WHO dedicated to mitigating the HRH crisis. The ‘No Health Without a Workforce’ report [10] defines availability as the sufficient supply and stock of HRH corresponding to the health needs of the population; accessibility as the equitable spatial temporal organizational and financial access to HRH; acceptability as the characteristics of HRH to meet the expectations of patients in terms of its profile sex and age composition its skills mix and cultural awareness; and quality as the competencies skills knowledge and behavior of the health worker as assessed according to professional norms and as perceived by users [11].

Strategies/actions highlighted in green apply to more than one dimension. Shared dimension(s) are mentioned at the end of the highlighted strategies/actions as abbreviation(s) in the superscript. Av availability As accessibility Ap acceptability Q quality Full size image

We conceptualized the second (strategies) and third (actions) levels of the framework under the dimensions. We define strategies as the broad approaches that can be used independently or in combination to improve a dimension. We define actions under strategies as directly implementable measures to produce the desired improvement. For example to improve the HRH availability one strategy is increasing production that can be achieved by applying either one or all of the three actions—increasing the number of training institutes increasing the intake capacity of existing institutes and creating new cadres (e.g. rural-specific doctors). Certain strategies and actions can improve more than one dimension e.g. creation and deployment of HRH closer to community can enhance acceptability as well as accessibility introduction of new cadres for underserved areas can enhance both accessibility and acceptability. Such multidimensional strategies and actions are highlighted in Fig. 1. Based on an iterative scoping review of the literature [121314] (Additional file 1. a) relevant strategies and actions that could improve corresponding dimensions were added to the framework. The proposed framework has 4 dimensions 21 strategies and 24 actions (Fig. 1).

Data sources and variables

We used the National Health Portal of India [15] to obtain policies and committee reports. The National Health Portal is set up by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) India to serve as a single point of access for consolidated healthcare-related information for citizens. We obtained NHPI—1983 2002 and 2017 reports from the Portal’s ‘Policy’ section to extract cadrewise HRH-related recommendations. We obtained the Health Survey & Development (Bhore) Committee (1946) [16] and High-level Expert Group (HLEG) (2011) [17] reports from the ‘Committees and Commissions’ section of the Portal. We calculated two cadrewise requirement thresholds HRH per 100000 population—R-1 and R-2 using Bhore and HLEG reports respectively. The requirement threshold values are given in Table 1 and the calculation details are presented in the Additional file 1. b. We chose the Bhore Committee and HLEG reports as the former present the first HRH requirement thresholds for Independent India while the latter presents the most recent. The Bhore Committee set an ambitious target for the then India which would have brought India closer to UHC much earlier. The HLEG presents a recently relevant and realistic target-setting considering the existing HRH shortage and global development calls.

Table 1 Cadrewise requirement thresholds from Bhore Committee and High-level Expert Group (HLEG) per 100000 Full size table

Data on HRH cadre numbers were taken from the Census of India and National Sample Survey (NSS). We included allopathic doctors (referred to as doctors in the rest of the paper) Ayurveda Yoga and Naturopathy Unani Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) practitioners nurses auxiliary nurse-midwives (ANMs) dentists and pharmacists. The National Occupational Classification (NOC) [18] codes were used to classify self-reported occupations from the Census and NSS (Additional file 2: Table S1). NOC-1968 was used for analyzing 1981 data and NOC-2004 for 2001 and 2011 data. We extracted the absolute number of male and female personnel of each cadre for rural urban and total groups at the national level from the Census of India [19] for census years immediately before each NHPI release ie. 1981 [20] 2001 [21] and 2011 [22] (Additional file 2: Table S2). The absolute numbers were used to get cadrewise present HRH densities (P) per 100000 for 1981 2001 2011 using the respective census populations (Additional file 1.b). NSS ‘Employment and Unemployment’ rounds [23] were used to extract the qualified HRH data. These surveys are nationally representative multistage stratified cluster sample surveys that collect self-reported information on employment level of education among other attributes. Similar to previous studies [7 24] we compared the educational achievements of self-reported health workers in the 38th (January to December 1983) [25] 61st (July 2004–June 2005) [26] and 68th (July 2011–June 2012) [27] NSS rounds with the required qualifications recommended by registration institutes and councils for each cadre e.g. Medical Council of India for allopathic doctors Indian Nursing Council for nurses and ANMs etc. (Additional file 2: Table S3). The proportions of qualified HRH obtained from NSS 38th 61st and 68th rounds of NSS were applied to the 1981 2001 and 2011 census absolute HRH values respectively to get the qualified HRH relative to the overall HRH as a proxy of HRH quality (see ahead). Although the census years 1981 and 2001 do not perfectly match the 38th (1983) and 61st (2004–05) NSS rounds by the calendar year the calculation of qualified HRH using the above method is valid assuming that the proportions would not change in small periods of 2–4 years.

Indices for dimensional HRH deficits

The WHO–GHWA report [10] has suggested a few matrices for measuring AAAQ—the density of skilled health professionals per 10000 population for availability; the geographic (rural–urban) distribution of physicians for accessibility; the nurses to doctors ratio as well as the proportion of female physicians for acceptability; and investigation into the existence of mechanisms to accredit regulate and license HRH for quality. In line with the report we measure AAAQ deficits by formulating four indices. Availability deficit (AvD) measures the deficit in the total stock of HRH accessibility deficit (AsD) measures the maldistribution of rural HRH against their urban presence acceptability deficit (ApD) measures the skew in cadre-mix and imbalance of female personnel relative to males within an HRH cadre (sex-mix) and quality deficit (QD) measures the deficit of qualified HRH.

AvD measures the deficit of available HRH against the contextually relevant requirement thresholds.

$${\mathrm{AvD}}_{\mathrm{cadre}} =1-\left(\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}}}{{R}_{\mathrm{cadre}}}\right)$$ (1)

AvD cadre = availability deficit for a cadre P cadre = national density of available personnel for the cadre R cadre = requirement threshold for the cadre.

Cadrewise AvDs were calculated using available density (P) for 3 years 1981 2001 and 2011 and the two requirement thresholds R-1 (Bhore) and R-2 (HLEG). Thus six AvD values were calculated for each cadre. Theoretically AvD can be positive negative or zero. When the density of available HRH is equal to the requirement threshold AvD = zero depicting no deficit or surplus. When the density of available HRH is less than the requirement threshold AvD is positive depicting a deficit that needs attention. When the available HRH exceeds the requirement threshold AvD is negative representing a surplus.

AsD measures the deficit of HRH present in rural areas relative to their urban counterparts.

$${\mathrm{AsD}}_{\mathrm{cadre}}=1- \left(\frac{\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{Cadre}\_\mathrm{rural}}}{{R}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{rural}}}}{\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{urban}}}{{R}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{urban}}}}\right)=1- \left(\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{rural}}}{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{urban}}}\right)$$ (2)

Here R cadre_rural = R cadre_urban  AsD cadre = accessibility deficit of a cadre P cadre_rural = density of available personnel for the given cadre in rural areas P cadre_urban = density of available personnel for the given cadre in urban areas R cadre_rural = requirement threshold for the cadre at the rural level R cadre_urban = requirement threshold for the cadre at the urban level. Here we assumed that R-1 and R-2 for a given cadre to be the same for urban rural and total (national) groups i.e. R national = R rural = R urban . This makes AsD independent of the requirement thresholds. Therefore three AsD values for each cadre were calculated for corresponding to 3 years (1981 2001 and 2011). Theoretically AsD can be positive negative or zero. AsD becomes zero when the densities of available HRH in rural and urban areas are equal i.e. equal accessibility in urban and rural areas. Positive AsD depicts a greater relative concentration of HRH in urban areas making rural access concerning. AsD is negative when rural HRH density surpasses its urban counterpart.

We present two ApD indices. First ApD cadre_mix measures the deficit of nursing and supporting cadres relative to doctors. Here ANMs and nurses together constitute nursing cadres while pharmacists and nursing cadres together form supporting cadres. GHWA explains—“the communities accept new intermediary professions such as medical assistants surgery technicians auxiliary nurses and lay health workers when some conditions are met” [10]. With this rationale the report uses—cadre-mix of nurses and physicians as a proxy for acceptability and measures the nurses to physicians ratio to calculate the same. Along these lines we have measured ApD cadre-mix using the relative availability of supporting cadres (i.e. available density of supporting cadres /requirement threshold of supporting cadre) and the relative availability of doctors (i.e. available density of doctors/required density of doctors).

$${\mathrm{ApD}}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{mix}}=1-\left(\frac{\frac{{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}}}}{{R}_{\mathrm{cadre}}}}{\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{doctor}}}{{R}_{\mathrm{doctor}}}}\right)$$ (3)

Here cadres are supporting and nursing cadres ApD cadre_mix = acceptability deficit of a cadre group P cadre = national density of available cadre groups P doctor = national density of doctors R cadre = requirement threshold for the cadre groups R doctor = REQUIREMENT threshold for doctors. Here cadre groups refer to nursing and supporting cadres. ApD cadre_mix was calculated for the nursing and supporting cadres for 3 years 1981 2001 and 2011 using both R-1 and R-2. Six ApD cadre_mix values were calculated for two cadre groups. Theoretically ApD cadre_mix can be positive negative or zero. When the relative availability of doctors is equal to the relative availability of the considered cadre group (nursing or supporting cadres) ApD cadre_mix is zero depicting acceptable cadre composition in the workforce. When the relative availability of cadre groups is smaller or greater than that of doctors ApD cadre_mix is positive or negative respectively denoting suboptimal acceptability that needs intervention. It is desirable to have ApD cadre_mix value in the proximity of zero to ensure balanced cadre-mix and acceptability.

Second we considered the within-cadre sex composition as a proxy for acceptability. The WHO–GHWA report proposes same-sex provider as one of the characteristics of acceptable HRH especially in populations where being served by someone of the other sex is not culturally acceptable [10]. ApD sex_mix measures the imbalance of female personnel relative to males for a cadre.

$${\mathrm{ApD}}_{\mathrm{sex}\_\mathrm{mix}} =1-\left(\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{female}}}{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{male}}}\right)$$ (4)

ApD sex_mix = Acceptability deficit of a cadre P cadre_female = national density of available females of an HRH cadre P cadre_male = national density of available males of the same cadre.

ApD sex_mix is independent of requirement thresholds and depends only on the densities of available female and male personnel of an HRH cadre. Therefore three ApD sex_mix values for the years 1981 2001 and 2011 were calculated for each cadre except ANMs who are supposed to be female health workers. Theoretically ApD sex_mix can be negative positive or zero. When female and male densities of cadre are equal ApD sex_mix is zero showing a sex-balanced acceptable workforce. Positive and negative ApD sex_mix values denote skew towards males and females respectively. ApD sex_mix closer to zero is favorable for an acceptable workforce.

QD measures the deficit of qualified HRH relative to the total HRH i.e. qualified and unqualified. Here qualified HRH are those possessing educational qualifications proposed by the registration body or council for the cadre as given in Additional file 2: Table S3.

$${\mathrm{QD}}_{\mathrm{cadre}}=1-\left(\frac{\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{qualified}}}{{R}_{\mathrm{cadre}\_\mathrm{qualified}}}}{\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}}}{{R}_{\mathrm{cadre}}}}\right)=1-\left(\frac{{P}_{\mathrm{Cadre}\_\mathrm{qualified}}}{{P}_{\mathrm{cadre}}}\right)$$

Here R cadre_qualified = R cadre  QD cadre = quality deficit for a cadre P cadre_qualified = national density of qualified personnel in a given cadre P cadre = national density (qualified and unqualified) of the cadre R cadre_qualified = requirement threshold for qualified HRH in the cadre R cadre = requirement threshold for total HRH in the cadre.

We assume that the requirement thresholds are equal for qualified and total HRH. Hence QD here is independent of requirement thresholds and is determined by the proportion of qualified HRH relative to total HRH. For each cadre three QD values were calculated for 3 years (1981 2001 and 2011). QD can range from 0 to 1. When all available personnel belonging to an HRH cadre are qualified QD becomes zero depicting the desired scenario of high HRH quality. The worst-case scenario with no qualified personnel is depicted by QD = 1. Since total HRH cannot be less than qualified HRH QD cannot be negative.

Data analysis

Analysis 1: We screened all NHPI reports for HRH-related recommendations to evaluate the incorporation of AAAQ dimensions and investigate the focussed cadres. Each recommendation was coded according to—addressed dimensions targeted cadres recommended strategies and suggested/employed actions (Additional file 2: Tables 4a b c). Dimension strategy and action targeted by a policy recommendation were identified using the proposed framework (Fig. 1). Strategies and actions enlisted in the framework but not mentioned for any cadre in an NHPI for a given dimension were noted as ‘Strategy/Action not used’ (Table 2). Recommendations not specific to any cadres were coded as ‘non-cadre-specific’. Cadres apart from the six mentioned above were grouped as ‘Other’. For each NHPI report we recorded the total number of dimensionwise and cadrewise recommendations independently and further cross-tabulated them. The policy focus was determined by the number of mentions. Variations in the total number of mentions across NHPIs were noted to determine changing focus. This approach has been previously used in various policy-content analyses [28 29] that investigate policy focus or issue prioritization including the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery [30].

Analysis 2: We calculated cadrewise AAAQ deficit indices for pre-NHPI census years (1981 2001 2011). For each year we obtained two AvD and ApD values (using R-1 and R-2) and one AsD and QD value (as they are independent of R) for each cadre. Index values were categorized as critical (1 to 0.75) high (0.74 to 0.50) moderate (0.49 to 0.25) and low (0.24 to 0) deficit. The surplus was categorized as low (− 0.01 to − 0.24) moderate (− 0.25 to − 0.49) high − 0.50 to − 0.74) and extreme (< − 0.75). We conducted two sub-analyses:

(a) We looked at the time trends in the AAAQ deficits from 1981 to 2011. For each dimension we evaluated longitudinal change in deficit indices values for each cadre between 1981 and 2011 by measuring percent change using the following equation.

$$\mathrm{Percentage change in }D= \left(\frac{{D}_{2011}-{D}_{1981}}{{D}_{1981}}\right)X 100$$ (6)

D = deficit index i.e. AvD AsD ApD or QD. D 2011 = deficit index for 2011 D 1981 = deficit index for 1981.

For availability and acceptability since two sets of cadrewise deficit indices were calculated for each year (using R1 and R2) time trends were observed separately for indices based on each requirement threshold.

(b) To look into the statuses of availability accessibility acceptability and quality of the cadres before each NHPI we conducted retrospective situational analyses using the deficit index values of pre-NHPI census years. It was essential to use the deficit indices based on then-existing (relevant) requirement thresholds. R-1 (Bhore requirement thresholds—1946) is relevant for NHPI-1983 and NHPI-2002 and R-2 (HLEG requirement thresholds—2011) is relevant for NHPI-2017. AvD and ApD calculated using P-1981 (present HRH density for 1981) and P-2001 against R-1 were used for situational analysis for NHPI-1983 and 2002 respectively while AvD and ApD calculated using P-2011 and R-2 were used for NHPI-2017. Considerations for requirement thresholds were not needed for situational analyses of AsD and QD as these indices are independent of thresholds.

Analysis 3: To investigate policy match or mismatch i.e. whether NHPI recommendations targeted the deficient HRH dimensions and cadres we compared focused cadres (i.e. most mentioned cadres) for a given dimension in all NHPIs with cadres’ deficit/surplus categories (low moderate high critical) for preceding census years. For instance we looked at if cadres with high deficits had more focus in the NHPI recommendations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXNhLmZtL2FydHMtc3BvcnRzLWN1bHR1cmUvMjAyMS0xMS0xMy9waXR0c2J1cmdoLWFydGlzdHMtc3BlYWstYWJvdXQtbG9zcy1zdGVyZW90eXBlcy1hbmQtc3RpZ21hLWR1ZS10by1tZW50YWwtaWxsbmVzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pittsburgh artists speak about loss stereotypes and stigma due to mental illness,"Editor's note: This story contains references to suicide.

In her acclaimed 2018 stand-up special Nanette Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby recounts how a man came up to her after a show to comment on her revealing that she took antidepressants.

“He said ‘You shouldn’t take medication because you’re an artist. It’s important that you feel’” she says. He then went on to say that if painter Vincent van Gogh had taken medication the world wouldn’t have his famous work “The Sunflowers.”

Gadsby who studied art history is quick to explain that not only did van Gogh self-medicate with alcohol but took prescribed medication a derivative of the foxglove plant that intensified how he saw the yellow hues in “The Sunflowers.” She mentions that he also painted portraits of psychiatrists who were in fact treating and medicating him.

“So perhaps we have “The Sunflowers” precisely because van Gogh medicated” she concludes to a laughing and applauding crowd.

This bit speaks to a stigma that has long plagued the arts community where the stereotype of the “tortured artist” who must suffer for their art can affect how creative types are perceived and lead to consequences for those struggling with mental illness. This is compounded in the U.S. by a system that due to economic conditions and employment status leaves many working artists without health care therapy and other resources needed to access treatment or crisis help.

Pittsburgh is not exempt from this issue which has become apparent in the number of local artists who have died by suicide or mental health-related reasons in recent years. This has been magnified by the pandemic breaking down a sense of community or financial security for many of these individuals.

For Brett Yasko experience with the issue goes back even before the pandemic during his friendship with John Riegert a Pittsburgh artist who died by suicide in November 2018. Before his death Yasko created a 2016 exhibition that made Riegert who struggled with bipolar disorder and depression and had previously attempted suicide the subject of over 250 portraits by other artists.

In a tragic turn one of the participating artists died by suicide in August.

Though it’s impossible to calculate the percentage of artists lost to mental health-related deaths the issue has become dire enough that Pittsburgh filmmaker and musician Julie Sokolow decided to try and do something about it. Sokolow who documented Yasko’s Riegert exhibition with her film The John Show has been an advocate for increased health care access to working artists. From 2012 to 2014 she produced Healthy Artists a series of short profiles showing how uninsured or underinsured Pittsburgh artists survived without health care.

After seeing the devastating impact of COVID-19 she decided to pursue a degree at the University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work where she is currently training to become a mental health therapist.

“I definitely felt more called to it because of the pandemic and the rising rates of depression and anxiety and substance abuse” she says. “It's a crisis.”

She agrees that artists compared to those working in other fields are potentially more vulnerable due to a number of factors. For one she says audiences may equate an artist’s visibility with success without understanding the nuances and difficulties of the industry.

“I think the general public in a lot of cases will look at an artist’s show or music concert or film screening and assume that that person is highly successful because they put on a well attended show or they were in the newspaper and they'll assume that that person is supported and making good money and it's just not the case” she says adding that band members may have to split $20 between each other after playing a gig.

She says artists often face a lot of stressors from having to cobble together a livelihood.

“Artists tend to have precarious situations as far as piecing together several jobs for income and needing to take an adjunct teaching gig here some freelance opportunities there that can lead to feeling pretty unsupported” she says. “A lot of other folks might get to work a full-time job that has health benefits. And I think a lot of artists are deprived of that opportunity to feel supported in that way.”

Yasko and Sokolow also believe that due to their profession artists tend to be more isolated as they often lack the office environment and other communal aspects that come with more mainstream 9-to-5 type jobs. Yasko says that as an instructor at the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University he saw the toll isolation took on young arts students forced to participate in classes over Zoom and how the statewide shutdown which saw the closing of nonessential businesses like galleries and other arts venues put artists in a tough position.

“All the places that were a way for them to show what they were working on all of that just went away so fast like almost overnight” he says. “In perfect times the idea that you've got to come up with stuff that you're going to then put into a gallery and then you're going to hope for a reaction from someone to me that's stressful enough. But then for that to just all go away literally within a week for a long period of time? It just goes without saying that that was a huge huge thing.”

Studies trying to correlate mental health and artistic talent have only solidified harmful stereotypes. In 2015 major news outlets reported that a study from deCODE a genetics company based in Reykjavik Iceland argued that those with a higher genetic risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were more likely to pursue creative professions. Detractors were quick to point out however that the research behind the study was too narrow and flawed to draw any real conclusions.

In a 2019 article for Psychology Today author Ewan Morrison examined how conflating creativity with mental illness could lead to artists depending on producing art as a treatment or refusing to medicate themselves for fear that it will affect their ability to create.

Even when artists do pursue treatment Sokolow says the process of obtaining and sustaining it can be difficult. Yasko speaks to this saying that while Riegert was able to obtain disability support and medication and went to therapy multiple times a week he also felt that assistance could be stripped from him at any point.

“His disability was always tenuous” says Yasko. “He had to sort of reapply for it and it was a long process and he sort of had to fight for it in order to have money to eat and everything like that. … It's funny because he was always taken care of but I think that was a burden on him of worrying that there would be a day where it wouldn’t be taken care of. He talked about that a lot.”

Sokolow believes that addressing this would mean switching to a universal health care model but until then she points to some services in Pittsburgh that could help. This includes the Duquesne University Psychology Clinic which she says is available to uninsured and underinsured patients at a sliding scale UPMC’s resolve Crisis Services hotline and walk-in center and Center for Victims.

Yasko believes part of the resolution lies in eliminating the stigma of mental illness not only for artists but for people in general. He also thinks artists living with mental illness should be recognized for contributing whether through their art or through work they do in their community.

“A lot of people maybe take that for granted about just how much energy it takes if you are struggling to make it through the day and then on top of that you're doing amazing things” he says. “So I just thought they should be applauded and that should be appreciated.”

If you or a loved one are in need of immediate support help is available 24/7 at the National Suicide Prevention hotline: 800-273-8255.

An insurance company has backed plans for a major shake-up of the healthcare system.

Peter Lozier the chief executive of Argus Americas said the company shared the Government’s “vision to provide access to quality affordable healthcare to every Bermuda resident”.

Mr Lozier was speaking after the Government signalled it would “accelerate” plans to move to a new integrated healthcare model in the new Parliamentary session.

The speech said: “The Government’s recent expansions to the prescription drug benefit for persons on HIP and FutureCare as well as the support to uninsured pregnant women has come at a cost and without the opportunity to address the systemic reform so desperately needed and promised in this government’s election platform.”

The Government added that it would merge administration of its healthcare plans to reduce costs.

Mr Lozier said: “We fully support the Government’s overall aim which includes an integrated healthcare model and a national digital health plan.

Our philosophies align in that we share a vision to provide access to quality affordable healthcare to every Bermuda resident.

“As private insurers we all have a role to play in supporting solutions that better balance affordability and quality of care.

“To that end we are continuously promoting chronic disease prevention care management and healthier lifestyles.”

He added: “We strongly believe in the people and spirit of Bermuda and have been investing in local healthcare to support our community as demonstrated by the acquisition of our medical practices.

“We are committed to sustainable positive change and demonstrable improvements to efficiency and outcomes by working in partnership with our government and all stakeholders.

“Quality healthcare is for everyone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9jZW50cmUtcmVsZWFzZXMtZ3JhbnQtb2YtcnMtOC00NTMtOTItY3ItdG8tMTktc3RhdGVzLXRvLWVuaGFuY2UtaGVhbHRoLXN5c3RlbXMtMTE2MzY3ODM1NzAwODYuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9jZW50cmUtcmVsZWFzZXMtZ3JhbnQtb2YtcnMtOC00NTMtOTItY3ItdG8tMTktc3RhdGVzLXRvLWVuaGFuY2UtaGVhbHRoLXN5c3RlbXMvYW1wLTExNjM2NzgzNTcwMDg2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Centre releases grant of ₹8453.92 cr to 19 states to enhance health systems | Mint,"The Central government has released an amount of ₹8453.92 crore as a health sector grant for rural and urban local bodies of 19 states to strengthen health systems and plug critical gaps in the health care system at the primary health care level informed the Ministry of Finance on Saturday.

The Department of Expenditure Ministry of Finance has released the grant as per the recommendations of the Fifteenth Finance Commission.

The Fifteenth Finance Commission (FC-XV) in its report for the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26 has recommended a total grant of ₹427911 crore to local governments.

The 19 states are Andhra Pradesh ( ₹488.1527 cr) Arunachal Pradesh ( ₹46.944 cr) Assam ( ₹272.2509 cr) Bihar ( ₹1116.3054 cr) Chhattisgarh ( ₹338.7944 cr) Himachal Pradesh ( ₹98.0099 cr) Jharkhand ( ₹444.3983 cr) Karnataka ( ₹551.53) Madhya Pradesh ( ₹922.7992) Maharashtra ( ₹778.0069 cr) Manipur ( ₹42.8771) Mizoram ( ₹31.19 cr) Odisha ( ₹461.7673 cr) Punjab ( ₹399.6558 cr) Rajasthan ( ₹656.171 cr) Sikkim ( ₹20.978 cr) Tamil Nadu ( ₹805.928 cr) Uttarakhand ( ₹150.0965 cr) and West Bengal ( ₹828.0694 cr).

""The grants recommended by the Commission inter-alia include health grants of ₹70051 crore. Out of this amount ₹43928 crore have been recommended for Rural Local Bodies and ₹26123 crore for Urban Local Bodies"" said the Finance Ministry.

The Commission has also identified interventions that will directly lead to strengthening the primary health infrastructure and facilities in both rural and urban areas and has earmarked grants for each intervention.

The ministry earmarked grants of ₹16377 crore for support for diagnostic infrastructure to the primary healthcare facilities in rural areas ₹5279 crore for block-level public health units in rural areas ₹7167 crore for the construction of buildings of building-less Sub centres PHCs CHCs in rural areas and ₹15105 crore for the conversion of rural PHCs and sub-centres into health and wellness centre.

Also ₹2095 crore has been granted for the support for diagnostic infrastructure to the primary healthcare facilities in urban areas and ₹24028 crore urban health and wellness centres (HWCs).

""Health grants recommended to be released in the financial year 2021-22 is ₹13192 crore of which ₹8273 crore is for rural and ₹4919 crore is for urban local bodies"" the Ministry said.

It also said that the rural and urban local bodies can play a key role in the delivery of primary health care services especially at the 'cutting edge' level and help in achieving the objective of Universal Health Care.

""Strengthening the local governments in terms of resources health infrastructure and capacity building can enable them to play a catalytic role in epidemics and pandemics too"" the ministry added.

It further said that involving Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local government as supervising agencies in these primary health care institutions would strengthen the overall primary health care system and involvement of local governments would also make the health system accountable to the people.

The ministry further added that the health grants to the remaining nine states will be released after their proposals are received from the respective states through the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Anyone with an interest in philanthropy or connected in some way to the hundreds of area nonprofit beneficiaries over the last quarter century will want to read The Kronkosky Foundation Story: Creating Profound Good through Community Philanthropy (Trinity University Press 2021) authored by longtime foundation executive Ingrid Friese Petty.

I remember the day in 1998 when I heard the news of the charitable foundation’s creation from Kenny Wilson then market president of NCNB/Nations Bank (now Bank of America) which managed the Kronkosky family’s trust; Palmer Moe a retired senior executive at Valero; and Allan Patterson the family’s attorney.

“Ever hear of the Kronkoskys?” Moe asked as the four of us met for lunch at Club Giraud. When I responded with a blank look he added “I know hardly anyone knew them or knows the name now. You won’t forget their name once we tell you their story.”

The Kronkosky Charitable Foundation was initially funded with $295 million following Albert Kronkosky Jr.’s death in 1997. An additional $75 million was added when his wife Bessie Mae died in 2010. Overnight the gift changed the face of philanthropy in San Antonio and the surrounding communities. Today the foundation has assets totaling $475 million.

Since the 1990s family foundations launched by Clear Channel founder Lowry Mays and wife Peggy Pitman Mays by Valero Energy and NuStar Energy founder William “Bill’ Greehey and by Harvey Najim founder of Sirius Computer Solutions have expanded the local philanthropic realm with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets serving San Antonio area nonprofits.

Few people knew much about the Kronkoskys. The couple guarded their privacy among a tight coterie of friends and associates. They never had children. They avoided politics and high-profile social events making charitable gifts anonymously while they were alive. They lived simply and never conveyed any public demonstrations of their accumulated wealth.

The family’s story begins in New Braunfels where the first Kronkoskys settled in 1850 and then moved to San Antonio in 1885.

Those who did know the Kronkoskys believed their wealth was derived from the success of the Gebhardt Chili Powder Company founded in New Braunfels by Albert Kronkosky Sr.’s brother-in-law William Gebhardt.

“That was true but only partly so” Petty writes in her account.

Albert Sr. was the businessman in the family and took control of the company. Albert Jr. eventually took over from his father and eventually sold Gebhardt to Chicago-based Beatrice Foods in 1960.

Albert Sr. founded the San Antonio Drug Company also passed down to Albert Jr. and later sold to a larger company for stock. But the family’s real wealth Petty writes stemmed from holding stock in Merck & Co. Albert Sr. was friends with George Merck and one of the original investors in his company. The family continued to accumulate stock in Merck as it grew into one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. When George Merck died in 1957 Albert Sr. was Merck’s single largest shareholder.

A great fortune built by one generation and nurtured by the next generation became the Kronkosky Charitable Foundation.

News of the new foundation was made public shortly after our background lunch that day in 1998 along with the detailed stipulations dictated by Albert and Bessie Mae of what organizations and charities in four counties qualified for grants.

Moe would go on to serve as the foundation’s first managing partner for 17 years before handing the reins in 2014 to San Antonio attorney Tullos Wells who still serves in that position. Wilson eventually retired from the bank and went on to serve as CEO of the Haven for Hope for five years until stepping down earlier this year.

The Kronkosky Charitable Foundation changed the philanthropy landscape in San Antonio and the counties of Bexar Bandera Comal and Kendall.

“They made what was then — and remains today — the largest single most profound philanthropic gift to the greater San Antonio area by establishing in perpetuity the Albert and Bessie Mae Kronkosky Charitable Foundation” wrote Wells in his Introduction to the book.

As of 2020 the foundation had distributed $309.1 million to 435 different nonprofit organizations in Bexar and the surrounding counties. Designed to operate in perpetuity the foundation continues to distribute millions in grants annually.

The principals behind the creation and management of the foundation the book author and Tom Payton head of Trinity University Press gathered Wednesday evening at the Southwest School of Art for a book launch party attended by philanthropists and nonprofit leaders. I was unable to attend the event but was honored to write the book’s foreword and to help Wells and Petty edit the manuscript.

TU Press’ Maverick Book Club will stage a free virtual event Tuesday Nov. 16 at 6 p.m.— featuring Wells Petty and San Antonio Food Bank CEO Eric Cooper — that I will moderate. Click on the link to register. One question I will be sure to ask: How can nonprofit leaders apply for Kronkosky funding?

If that’s the question you want answered please join us. The Kronkosky Foundation has made San Antonio and the surrounding counties a better world for hundreds of thousands of people in need. That work will continue for the next 25 years and beyond.

The Greehey Family Foundation the Mays Family Foundation and Harvey Najim are financial supporters of the San Antonio Report. For a full list of business and nonprofit members click here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

El día de ayer a través de sus redes sociales la Embajada de México en Francia lamentó la subasta de bienes culturales mexicanos al interior del país francés. Esto después de que se llevara a cabo la venta ilícita de piezas prehispánicas a pesar de los esfuerzos del Gobierno Mexicano por frenarla.

“Estas prácticas no solo lucran con el patrimonio histórico sino que ocasionan la devastación de la historia y la identidad de los países por ello expresamos nuestro enérgico rechazo a este tipo de prácticas. A pesar de que las subastas realizadas en general cumplen con la legislación local vigente y no es posible detenerlas México reitera: Nuestro patrimonio no se vende “ compartió en redes la embajadora de México en Francia Blanca Jiménez.

El pasado martes se llevó a cabo una subasta en París Francia donde se comercializaron piezas pertenecientes a la época prehispánica al igual que restos arqueológicos de las culturas que se establecieron en la época precolombina.La subasta cerró con una ganancia de 797634 euros es decir 18 millones 730 mil pesos mexicanos.

Dicha subasta que llevaba por nombre Arqueología Arte de Oriente y Arte Precolombino fue realizada por La casa de subastas Artcurial a pesar de que la Secretaría de Cultura de México emitiera comunicados el pasado 26 de octubre y 8 de noviembre exhortando a detener el evento y reflexionar sobre los valores históricos de las piezas puestas en subasta.

Por su parte la titular de la Secretaría de Cultura Alejandra Frausto comunicó en sus redes sociales la ilegalidad de la venta de estas piezas al fomentar y contribuir el tráfico ilícito y a la delincuencia transnacional organizada.

La secretaria también apeló a la razón ética para suspender dicho evento recordando que la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación la Ciencia y la Cultura (UNESCO) tiene un acuerdo desde 1970 en el que se insta a los países miembros a adoptar medidas para prevenir la compra y transportación de bienes exportados de manera ilícita esto a través de la Convención de París.

‘’La @cultura_mx se manifiesta en contra de la subasta de 72 piezas arqueológicas pertenecientes al patrimonio de México programada para el 10 de noviembre por la casa de subastas Christie’s en París Francia. La venta del patrimonio cultural es un delito. #MiPatrimonioNoSeVende’' se lee en el mensaje de Frausto.

Asimismo el Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) emitió un dictamen en el cual se identificaron que de las 87 piezas arqueológicas ofertadas 72 constituyen bienes prehispánicos que forman parte del patrimonio cultural de México.

A pesar de la contienda por evitar la venta de dichas piezas el pasado 10 de noviembre se llevó a cabo la subasta ofertando piezas olmecas mayas aztecas e incas entre otras. La venta de las piezas se colocó en precios de entre 500 a 692000 euros.

La casa de subastas Christie’s no se ha pronunciado ante los comunicados y pronunciamientos que la Secretaría de Cultura y la Embajada de México en Francia han hecho no obstante la Secretaría de Cultura informó que iniciarán los procedimientos judiciales correspondientes ante las autoridades francesas para recuperar las piezas.

Algunas de las obras vendidas el martes se ofrecieron por precios que fueron desde los 200 hasta los 20000 euros como una escultura de serpiente de la cultura Azteca fechada entre el 1400 y el 1521 d.C. que se vendió por 20 mil 800 euros (24 mil 090 dólares).

Entre algunas de las piezas listadas se encontró un Hacha Maya perteneciente a los años 550-950 a.C vendida en 692000 euros dos Cabezas Mayas de los años 550-950 a.C una ofertada en 112500 euros y otra en 20000 y una máscara Teotihuacana de 450-650

a.C vendida en 15000 euros.

El sector de bebidas alcohólicas arrastra una contracción de sus ventas desde hace casi dos décadas sostiene la Asociación de Industriales Licoreros del Ecuador (Adile).

Según esta organización en 2004 se vendieron 176 millones de litros de bebidas alcohólicas mientras que en 2020 las ventas fueron 78 millones de litros. Eso equivale a una caída de 56% en 16 años.

En 2017 hubo una ligera recuperación de las ventas gracias a la firma del acuerdo con la Unión Europea que permitió reducir los precios de las bebidas que se importan desde ese bloque económico explica Nixon Vergara presidente de Adile.

Al igual que los licores las ventas de cerveza se han contraído 39%. En el caso de la cerveza la baja se registra desde 2015.

Espacio para la informalidad

Según los representantes de la industria de bebidas alcohólicas la baja de las ventas del mercado formal se debe a una serie de factores entre ellos:

Aumento de impuestos.

Ley seca durante la pandemia.

Disminución de ventas por cierre de bares discotecas restaurantes y hoteles.

La contracción de las ventas no significan una caída del consumo que se mantiene y que se ha redirigido al mercado informal es decir contrabando falsificación y adulteración explica Vergara.

""El comercio informal de licores va ganando terreno"" dice Antonio Cobo representante del sector de bebidas alcohólicas.

""Según Euromonitor en Ecuador más del 20% de las ventas de licores es informal"". Antonio Cobo

La migración del consumo hacia el mercado informal se debe en parte a la ""falta de control de entidades como el Servicio de Rentas Internas (SRI) y la Agencia Nacional de Regulación Control y Vigilancia Sanitaria (Arcsa)"" sostiene Vergara.

Según los representantes de la industria si se controla el mercado informal el Estado podría recaudar USD 144 millones.

Aumento del ICE

En ese contexto el sector se muestra preocupado por el proyecto de Ley Orgánica de Desarrollo Económico y Sostenibilidad Fiscal que propone un incremento del Impuesto a los Consumos Especiales (ICE) en bebidas alcohólicas.

La propuesta del Ejecutivo plantea que el precio del litro de alcohol puro para bebidas y productos farmacéuticos pase de USD 718 a USD 10 es decir un incremento del impuesto de 39%.

Según la Adile la medida derivaría en una contracción de las ventas de 21% frente a niveles prepandemia es decir 2019.

Si se analiza por tipo de bebida el aumento del ICE al alcohol puro significaría los siguientes aumentos de precios:

Vino con 12% de volumen de alcohol: 11%

Whisky con 49% de volumen de alcohol:12%

Aguardiente con 35% de volumen de alcohol: 21%

Según los profesionales de la salud las bebidas alcohólicas sí deben estar gravadas con ICE aunque la medida debería aplicarse en función del grado alcohólico de cada una.

El médico Esteban Ortiz experto en salud pública considera que los recursos que se recauden por tributos a las bebidas alcohólicas se deberían destinar a afrontar los efectos de su consumo excesivo como accidentes de tránsito y violencia además de controlar el mercado informal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbHNvbGRlaGVybW9zaWxsby5jb20ubXgvZG9ibGUtdmlhL3Vzby1zdS1leHBlcmllbmNpYS1lbi12ZW50YXMtcGFyYS1lbXByZW5kZXItdW4tbnVldm8tbmVnb2Npby1hci1wZXJmdW1lcy03NDc1NzcwLmh0bWzSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxzb2xkZWhlcm1vc2lsbG8uY29tLm14L2RvYmxlLXZpYS91c28tc3UtZXhwZXJpZW5jaWEtZW4tdmVudGFzLXBhcmEtZW1wcmVuZGVyLXVuLW51ZXZvLW5lZ29jaW8tYXItcGVyZnVtZXMtNzQ3NTc3MC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Usó su experiencia en ventas para emprender un nuevo negocio: AR Perfumes,"A principios de 2020 Rosalinda Leal y su madre estaba pensando en emprender un negocio juntas algo que las ayudara a obtener un ingreso extra a la par de poder asociarse y crear un negocio familiar pero la pandemia frenó sus planes al menos durante ese año.

La joven hermosillense compartió que la idea original era vender ropa sin embargo las restricciones sanitarias hicieron que dicho mercado resultara complejo. No fue sino hasta principios de 2021 cuando retomando el tema del emprendimiento decidieron que podían vender perfumes.

“La idea surgió porque mi esposo es comprador compulsivo de perfumes entonces le dije a mi mamá debe haber personas que también suelen coleccionar perfumes” contó.

De esta manera en marzo del presente año comenzaron con el negocio desde casa apoyándose en las redes sociales aunque la mayoría han sido clientes que Rosalinda ya tenía pues desde los 18 años se dedica al comercio y las ventas.

“Fíjate que sí nos han servido (las redes) pero realmente tengo muchos años dedicándome a las ventas y me manejo con mi cartera de clientes. Decidimos echar mano de las redes sociales básicamente con el objetivo de incrementar nuestro mercado y darnos a conocer más” añadió.

Otras alternativa para ventas

Rosalinda explicó que todos son perfumes originales que se adquieren en Estados Unidos tanto para dama como para caballero y niños siendo estos últimos los que más se consumieron cuando iniciaron el negocio.

“Inicialmente lo que fue un boom son los perfumes para niños se vendieron muchísimo entre marzo y abril por el Día del Niño; en mayo y junio fueron los de dama y caballero con los festejos del Día de las Madres y el Día del Padre. Ahora esperamos que diciembre sea un buen mes también para las ventas” detalló.

Han tenido una buena recepción por parte de la gente aseguró llegando a vender entre 10 y 15 perfumes por mes. Gracias a ello recientemente decidieron rentar un espacio en una concept store donde pueden ofrecer los perfumes al público de una manera más directa.

De igual forma apuntó que los años que tiene de experiencia en el sector comercial le han servido para entender a sus clientes y adaptarse a las necesidades que puedan tener a la hora de adquirir un producto suyo.

“Yo la verdad me baso en lo que los clientes digan porque me gusta tenerlos contentos. Llevo muchos años dedicándome a las ventas y pues ya le entiendo. Por ello manejo entrega a domicilio o que los recojan en mi casa. También estamos en la concept store y seguimos buscando más opciones para diversificarnos” expuso.

Apoyarse en familia

Para Rosalinda ha sido muy grato el poder emprender un negocio con su mamá ya que esto las ha ayudado a sentir un apoyo mutuo y a plantearse metas a mediano y largo plazo que esperan poder cristalizar como el hecho de tener varios puntos de venta en la ciudad.

“Sí hemos platicado mi mamá y yo acerca de poner algún tipo de isla en un centro comercial o algo así pero queremos primero afianzar el negocio y quizá el próximo año ya tener un lugar fijo. Tenemos la idea también de poder entrar en otro concept store y así seguir creciendo” contó.

Conforme han avanzado los meses destacó también han tenido la oportunidad de incluir a un par de personas más como vendedores quienes han ayudado a mejorar las ventas y también se benefician del negocio.

Por último Rosalinda aconsejó a quienes están pensando en emprender algún negocio para que no tengan miedo y dejen las dudas de lado.

“Que siempre sigan su instinto y que se avienten porque la gran mayoría de las veces cuando le pierdes el miedo y te avientas las cosas funcionan. Obstáculos siempre vamos a tener pero si aprendemos a perder el miedo las cosas comienzan a funcionar” expresó.

El sector del transporte es responsable de alrededor del 20% de las emisiones de efecto invernadero mundiales. La mayoría de ese porcentaje se corresponden con el tráfico por carretera.

Las emisiones del sector transporte se han duplicado con creces desde 1970 y cerca del 80% del aumento se debe al tránsito de vehículos y camiones. El Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente (PNUMA) calcula que ese importante sector a escala mundial depende casi por completo de los combustibles fósiles.

Pero esto podría cambiar en los próximos decenios. La alianza fue suscrita por más de 100 entidades entre gobiernos fabricantes regiones y propietarios de flotas. En los 31 países firmantes no figuran los tres mayores mercados: Estados Unidos China y Japón. Ni tampoco países como España Alemania o Francia parecían interesados en adherirse.

Se espera que en las próximas horas se sumen más países a la lista inicial que incluye a India Canadá Chile Nueva Zelanda Polonia y Reino Unido. Además de estos 31 países se han adicionado 38 autoridades regionales como las ciudades de Sao Paulo o Seúl. Y 11 fabricantes de vehículos 27 propietarios de flotas y empresas de movilidad compartida como Uber.

Al menos trece países se han comprometido también a acabar con la venta de vehículos pesados que utilizan combustibles fósiles para 2040.

El objetivo es «lograr normalizar los vehículos con cero emisiones garantizando que sean accesibles baratos y sostenibles en todas las regiones en 2030» dijo la presidencia británica de la cumbre climática.

Los coches de combustión tienen sus años contados

La alianza alcanzada para decir adiós a los coches de combustión a partir de 2035 y dar la bienvenida en forma masiva a los autos eléctricos incluye a varios renombrados fabricantes.

Entre las firmas que sí han rubricado el pacto -que juntos suponen casi un cuarto de las ventas a nivel global- figuran grandes compañías como General Motors Ford Mercedes Benz o Volvo. Con antelación habían anunciado compromisos para interrumpir la fabricación de coches con motores de combustión interna. También BYD Co Ltd de China y Jaguar Land Rover una unidad de Tata Motors Ltd. de India. En cambio Toyota Volkswagen y Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi no estaban en la lista.

El presidente de BMW Oliver Zipse salió al paso a las críticas. Advirtió DW que fijar una fecha para el fin de los automóviles de gasolina y diésel podría ser incluso contraproducente. «Creemos que esto sería perjudicial para el clima. Las cosas no se han meditado aquí hasta el final» dijo.

It's #TransportDay at #COP26 and we need a radical shift in how we consider personal mobility.



First things first – auto manufacturers need to immediately commit to phasing out production of petrol and diesel vehicles if we are to stay below 1.5C.https://t.co/5VHoH78xNb — Greenpeace International (@Greenpeace) November 10 2021

Toyota también defendió su decisión de no participar de la target=»_blank» rel=»noreferrer noopener»>alianza alegando que su modelo de negocios actual hace «difícil» ese compromiso. Kohei Yoshida un responsable de la división de vehículos eléctricos de la firma japonesa explicó a la AFP que había «muchas maneras de «enfocar la neutralidad carbono» más allá del pacto.

Para el director ejecutivo de Greenpeace Alemania Martin Kaiser es sin embargo «gravemente preocupante» que los principales países y fabricantes no hayan firmado el pacto. «Para acabar con el combustible fósil tenemos que cortar con nuestra dependencia. Eso significa abandonar los motores de combustión en favor de coches eléctricos. Y crear redes de transporte público limpio lo antes posible» indicó.

Ayuda a los países en desarrollo

La iniciativa además de poner fecha al fin de las ventas de los coches de combustión incluye respaldar a los países en desarrollo en esta transición.

Se prevé que 90% del aumento futuro en las flotas de autos se produzca en países de ingresos bajos y medios. Muchos carecen de las regulaciones e incentivos necesarios para promover vehículos de emisión cero.

La alianza busca apoyar a naciones de ingresos bajos y medios en el desarrollo de hojas de ruta y objetivos nacionales. Marcos de políticas modelos comerciales y esquemas de financiamiento para la transición de sus sectores de transporte hacia el uso de los vehículos eléctricos.

“Un mundo en el que se agregarán mil millones de vehículos adicionales para 2050 simplemente no es compatible con las limitaciones del aumento de la temperatura global a 15˚C. Las emisiones del sector del transporte deben caer rápidamente. Para que esto suceda tenemos que hacer la transición hacia una movilidad sostenible limpia y eficiente” dijo la directora del Pnuma Inger Andersen.

Se espera que las emisiones relacionadas con el transporte contribuyan con un tercio de las emisiones relacionadas con la energía para 2050. El transporte ha estado en el foco de la COP26 tras el llamado del primer ministro del Reino Unido Boris Johnson a actuar en las áreas de «carbón automóviles dinero en efectivo y árboles».

Carlos Manuel Rodríguez señaló que “el cambio a la movilidad de cero emisiones será uno de los cambios definitorios del siglo XXI. Como lo fue la introducción del motor de combustión interna en el siglo XX” adicionó el director ejecutivo y presidente del Fondo para el Medio Ambiente Mundial.

Según el IPCC todos los vehículos nuevos en el mundo deben tener cero emisiones para 2035. Y así cumplir con los objetivos climáticos de París.

The US ISP hasn't provided any reason for taking this action so in response MangaDex has been working on a solution. Over the past few months the team has developed a workaround and while it may not last forever the site is accessible to all once again.

It is extremely common for internet service providers to prevent their customers from accessing pirate sites. Often they are required to do so by after being ordered by a court but in the United States this is almost unknown.

That’s why in the summer it was a surprise to see reports flooding in from Verizon customers alleging they could no longer access a number of pirate sites including MangaDex NYAA and Kemono.party.

These sites have a few things in common. They all operate in the manga niche they all have issues with copyright holders and they all use (or have used) DDoS-Guard a Russian CDN provider that’s considered a safe haven for pirate sites.

That raised the question of whether the nature of the sites themselves was behind Verizon’s decision to block (or more accurately null-route) or whether the use of DDoS-Guard was the key factor.

Verizon Fails to Unblock MangaDex

With Verizon failing to fix or even acknowledge the issues subscribers of the ISP have not been able to access MangaDex by ordinary means. VPNs still worked of course but as the image of MangaDex’s network map shows when Verizon interferes with user connections to DDoS-Guard (the straight line pointing down from ‘Users’) none of the infrastructure behind it can be accessed.

Of course MangaDex could’ve told Verizon subscribers to use a VPN or even cast them aside completely. However that clearly isn’t the platform’s style. Finding some way to bypass Verizon’s blocking appears to have become a challenge so over the past several months the team has been working on it.

MangaDex Nullifies Verizon’s Null-Route

In a recent announcement MangaDex revealed that its team has been successful. How they achieved this is being kept a secret for now but the site confirms that its solution works and they received zero help from Verizon.

“To eliminate some misinformation we’ve seen circulate we would very much like to not thank [Verizon] as they didn’t lift the ban on their end to this day. However we are really glad to have found a workaround and happy to welcome their users back on the platform” the team writes.

While this will be a cause for celebration for some Verizon users MangaDex says that it doesn’t know if the fix will be a permanent one. The best solution then would be to switch to an ISP that doesn’t quietly block sites and then offer no explanation.

“We also must mention that there is absolutely no guarantee that our current workaround will last forever so you might want to consider switching to an ISP that doesn’t censor your internet access at some point. That means pretty much any other one in the world” the team concludes.

The above image is courtesy of MangaDex which recently published an intriguing overview of its operations

Update November 14: MangaDex has responded to some of the questions we asked earlier. The site didn’t reach out to Verizon directly before taking countermeasures.

“MangaDex has not attempted to reach out to Verizon. Outside of utilizing the typical support channels we have found no clear way to reach out for such an issue. MangaDex is a large enough site so Verizon should be aware of the issue. Some of our users have reached out to Verizon but as far as we know none have had any favorable results.”

MangaDex believes that the blockade could be related to its CDN provider DDoS Guard as we also hinted at in our original coverage. However it could also be a more direct attack.

“The issue could possibly be MangaDex/Nyaa specific. We feel it’s an odd choice to target us instead of larger aggregators and other sites in the same category” MangaDex tells us.

This isn’t the only issue MangaDex is facing. The site explains that it’s also marked as “dangerous” by TrendMicro and appeals appear to be instantly rejected. SURBL meanwhile marked mangadex.network as spam",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3Mvbm90ZS0yMC01Zy1zZXJpZXMtbm93LXN1cHBvcnRzLWVTSU0tb24tVmVyaXpvbl9pZDEzNjQxM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Update adds eSIM capabilities to the Verizon Galaxy Note 20 5G series,"



Thanks to the latest update sent to the phones (which includes the October security patch) the Galaxy Note 20 line joins the iPhone and the Pixels as the only phones offered by Verizon that use eSIM. Verizon also offers Samsung's Galaxy Book Go 5G a Windows 10 laptop that also features an eSIM. Instead of switching carriers by swapping out a physical SIM card with eSIM you can activate your phone on another carrier by making a simple phone call.

Dual SIM Dual Standby has arrived for the Verizon Galaxy Note 20 series







Combined with the physical SIM card already used on the 2020 Note models the phones will offer dual SIM capabilities on Verizon. With dual SIM you can have one line for business and a second line for personal calls. You can also have separate voice and data plans and when you travel to another country or region you can add a local plan to prevent roaming charges.





The Galaxy Note 20 series will support Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS). This means that once you take a call on one of the two lines the other is inactive until you hang up the call. On the other hand Dual SIM Dual Active allows both lines to work at the same time which means juggling two calls simultaneously. It also could lead to an embarrassing situation if your wife and your boss call at the same time and you get confused and vow your undying love to your boss.





If you have one of last year's Galaxy Note 20 models and Verizon is your wireless provider keep an eye peeled for the update which carries a build number of RP1A.200720.012.N981USQU2DUJ6. To update your phone go to Settings > Software update and tap on Download and install.







You might recall that over two years ago Verizon AT&T  and the wireless industry's GSMA trade organization were involved in a Justice Department investigation. The trio was accused of collusion over a wireless standard that they had developed to block mobile device users from changing carriers even if they had eSIM activated on their phones. Eventually the DOJ ended the probe after taking no action when the GSMA introduced new standards designed to prevent the carriers from blocking customers who want to switch wireless providers.

As of now it appears that the Galaxy Note series is finished







Last year's Galaxy Note 20 lineup might be the last of the Galaxy Note series. The large-screened handsets debuted in October 2011 with the original generation model sporting a 5.3-inch display. It was the first smartphone to take us over the 5-inch mark and its 2500mAh battery was at the time the largest capacity found inside a smartphone.





Of course the Galaxy Note models were also known for carrying the S Pen a digital writing instrument that became more and more useful over the years. Samsung seems to have replaced the line with its Galaxy Z foldables which include the Fold and the Flip. And there is some consideration being given to the idea that the Galaxy S22 Ultra will be something of a Galaxy Note replacement including support and housing for the S Pen.

We Test Them Out,"If you're looking to upgrade your home's router one of the best moves you can make is to go with a mesh system that uses multiple devices to spread a more consistent connection throughout your entire home. And if you're going with mesh another great move is to spend up on a tri-band model with an extra 5GHz backhaul band that the system can dedicate to transmissions between the router and its satellites.

Enlarge Image MeshForce Rock Space and Tenda Nova each have sponsored listings on page one of most mesh router searches on Amazon. Screenshots by Ry Crist/CNET

A tri-band design like that can greatly improve your system's speeds and performance particularly when you're connecting at range through one of the satellites. The problem is that adding in a third band is an expensive proposition. Even if you try to keep the costs down by skipping Wi-Fi 6 and going with an earlier-gen Wi-Fi 5 system most tri-band models will typically sell for at least $300 or so. In some cases that'll only get you a two-pack with one router and one satellite.

Enter Amazon where the search rankings include a number of off-brand mesh routers from companies you've never heard of many of which are located overseas. Among them are a few tri-band models that make big performance claims -- and all of them cost significantly less than big-name marquee mesh systems from well-known names like Linksys and Netgear.

Locating local internet providers

How much less? The three I bought -- the Rock Space mesh system the MeshForce M7 and the Tenda Nova MW12 each sold in a three-piece setup for about $200 after applying coupons. That's less than what a two-pack of what our favorite dual-band Wi-Fi 5 mesh system Nest Wifi costs so skipping the brand name is essentially netting you an additional extender and a tri-band design for free here and then some. That's well within the too-good-to-be-true range but with each of these no-name mesh systems I was determined to answer the age-old question: is this cheap-looking piece of tech actually any good?

From left to right the Rock Space mesh system the MeshForce M7 and the Tenda Nova MW12. Ry Crist/CNET

Meet the meshtestants

The three mesh systems I purchased and tested out are each tri-band AC2100 models. The ""AC"" part tells you that they support Wi-Fi 5 (for newer Wi-Fi 6 models look for ""AX"") while the ""2100"" part tells you the combined top transfer speeds of the bands in Mbps. Just know that those top speeds are based on laboratory-controlled setups that don't take things like network congestion or interference from obstructions into account -- what's more you can only connect to one band at a time.

Locating local internet providers

At any rate the specs for these three systems are identical -- and the similarities don't stop there. Though the MeshForce M7 comes as a set of three cylinder-shaped nodes the other two (the Rock Space mesh system and the Tenda Nova MW12) both come as a set of three cubes one black and one white. Both of those cubes have green indicator lights in the same spot on the top face while the MeshForce system features an identical green indicator light on the front face. All three feature identical ports on the underside of each device too -- a power jack a WAN port for connecting to the modem and two spare Ethernet jacks with no USB jacks whatsoever.

Screenshots by Ry Crist/CNET

Each system comes from a differently named parent company -- Shenzhen Teno Network Technologies Company Limited for MeshForce Shenzhen Tenda Technology Company Limited for Tenda Nova and the aptly named Shenzhen RenQing Excellent Investment Company Limited for Rock Space (in some places the company is also listed as ""Excellent Technology""). Each system uses its own separate app too -- but those apps are functionally identical each with the same design the same features and the same typeface and copy. Each has a slightly different color palette but that's really about it.

The only other key difference I noticed is that the apps have different privacy disclosures in Apple's App Store. Specifically the MeshForce and Tenda Nova apps claim to collect data that isn't linked to your identity including diagnostics location info user content and device identifiers. Meanwhile the Rock Space app claims to collect no data at all.

I asked Apple if it was unusual for copycat apps like these to have different file sizes and privacy disclosures and a spokesperson noted that an app's data practices are at the discretion of the company or developer in question and that some disclosures are optional. Apple is working with the developers of the three apps to ensure that they're in line with the company's privacy and data security guidelines the spokesperson added.

As far as functionality is concerned these apps will do what most router apps do -- they'll walk you through the setup process and then let you adjust settings on your network as needed. Mind you those setting options are pretty meager. You can turn on a guest network or utilize some extremely basic parental controls but that's about it. There's a Quality of Service feature in each app which is usually intended to prioritize traffic to specific devices but with these systems it's just a switch that you toggle on with no way to actually prioritize anything.

In each case getting everything up and running was quick and painless. With each system the three devices are identical so you can use any one of them as the main router and the other two as extenders. Just pick one connect it to your modem with an Ethernet cable plug it into power and type in the password printed on the bottom of the device when the app asks you to. From there you'll plug the satellites in within a few meters to let them connect -- you'll then be able to unplug them and plug them back in somewhere else and voila your mesh network is up and running.

How do they stack up?

From the way they look to the ins and outs of how they perform let's run through the gauntlet of criteria you might use to pick between these systems starting with:

It isn't a speaker but the Rock Space router kind of looks like one thanks to that fabric top. Ry Crist/CNET

Design

All three systems feel lightweight and cheap to the touch and with the same specs and the same ports in the same place on the underside of each device there isn't much that's separating them from a practical standpoint. That leaves cosmetics and while I wouldn't call any of the three eye-catching the Rock Space system at least has a touch of style with the black build and the fabric on its top face. Though it doesn't play music or put out any sound whatsoever visitors to your home would be forgiven for mistaking it for a speaker or a home audio accessory. That's better than thinking it's a cheap router I suppose.

Winner: Rock Space

Hardware

Before testing each system out in full I made sure to run some speed tests throughout my home using only a single device from each one. That way I'd get a good look at the individual capabilities of each device in terms of range speed and signal strength.

In the end it was close but the MeshForce M7 finished with the fastest average download speeds throughout my home ringing in at about 156Mbps just over half of what my 300Mbps fiber internet plan is capable of. Rock Space finished in a close second at 154Mbps while Tenda Nova brought up the rear with average speeds of 139Mbps. Just know that none of those numbers are impressive. The previous-gen Wi-Fi 5 version of Eero and the AC1200 version of Netgear Orbi both of which are two-year-old dual-band mesh routers each finished about 50Mbps faster in this single router test with average speeds of 201Mbps and 196Mbps respectively. Nest Wifi another dual-band Wi-Fi 5 system finished with an average single router speed of 226Mbps. I'll also note that MeshForce also had the slowest average upload speeds of the three no-name systems though it redeemed itself somewhat by putting up the best performance at range with slightly higher speeds than the other two in the back of my house.

Winner: MeshForce

Download speeds

All three systems share the same specs and what appears to be the same control app so I was curious as to whether or not I would see much of a difference between them in my performance tests where I spend days taking countless speed measurements across multiple spots in my home a smallish 1300-square-foot shotgun-style house in Louisville Kentucky. In the end I get a good room-by-room look at what sort of speeds each system is delivering (and again this is a home with a 300Mbps fiber internet plan).

Each of the three systems performed as expected. In the previous single router test my speeds would plummet to the low double digits by the time I reached that back bathroom the farthest spot from the router and a recurring dead zone for a lot of routers I test. Now with one of the satellites hooked up in the master bedroom to boost the signal my speeds stayed well into the triple digits throughout the entirety of my home. The Rock Space system was the fastest with a whole-home average of about 220Mbps but the Tenda Nova and MeshForce systems were right behind it with averages of 215 and 206Mbps which is within the margin of error.

And again those speeds are pretty underwhelming -- for comparison the Wi-Fi 5 version of Eero and the AC1200 version of Netgear Orbi averaged speeds of 204 and 195Mbps respectively so they weren't too far behind despite lacking that third band. Meanwhile Nest Wifi averaged speeds in my home of 222Mbps so it managed to beat all three of these tri-band systems outright in spite of its dual-band design.

Winner: Push

Enlarge Image The green bars represent my average speeds when my connection started in the living room close to the router. The yellow bars represent my average speeds when I connected in the back bathroom far from the router. A good mesh router will give you similar speeds regardless of where you first connected so you want bars that are close together in each room here. Ry Crist/CNET

Mesh performance

Averages are one thing but I wanted to look a little deeper into the data to see if I could distinguish a performance winner. One way to do that is to examine the consistency of each system and evaluate how well the mesh handles your connection as you move about your home.

To account for that I split my speed tests into two groups. For the first group of tests I start with a fresh connection in the living room close to the router and work towards that back bathroom in the back of my house. For the second set of tests I reverse things and start with a fresh connection at range in the back bathroom then work my way towards the front of the house. A good mesh system should deliver fairly consistent results across both sets of tests -- matching green and yellow bars in that graph above.

At a glance none of the three were disasters but MeshForce was the least consistent. With Rock Space and Tenda Nova it's much closer. Rock Space nailed it in three rooms but was noticeably inconsistent in two. Tenda Nova meanwhile averaged out to minor inconsistencies across all five rooms.

Enlarge Image Dots that are closer together indicate better consistency here (think of these charts a little like targets at a shooting range). The Rock Space system had the tightest spread across all of my tests so it was the most consistent of the three mesh routers. Ry Crist/CNET

To split the difference and pick a winner let's look at one more set of graphs. In these each dot represents a single speed test result so you're seeing everything here. Dots that are closer together in each room indicate better consistency. MeshForce clearly has the most spread so again that's our loser -- and between Rock Space and Tenda Nova it's pretty easy to see that Rock Space was more consistent even if Tenda Nova averaged out to a very close second.

Winner: Rock Space

Ry Crist/CNET

Are any of them worth it?

If I had to use one of these three systems I'd go with Rock Space. Though it was close it did offer incrementally faster speeds than the other two along with better consistency from the mesh. Plus I think it's the least ugly of the three.

That said the real winners here are probably the established brands namely Eero Nest and Netgear Orbi. All three of them offer dual-band Wi-Fi 5 mesh systems that kept up with all three of these no-name tri-band systems without costing much more if anything. It wouldn't surprise me if other brands including Asus TP-Link D-Link and Linksys could make similar arguments with systems of their own. And I would trust all of those established brands to do a better job of delivering crucial security and firmware updates on a regular basis along with a better mix of useful features in the app.

In the end you get what you pay for -- and in this case I would skip all three of these off-brand systems and pay for a more impressive mesh router with a stronger track record. We've got plenty of good choices that fit that bill in our rundown of the best mesh routers of the year -- that's where I'd recommend turning if you're in the market for an upgrade and wondering what to buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzdGVsZWdyYW0uY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTQvc2hpcmxleS13aWxkLXBhdGh3YXlzLWJyaW5nLWV1cm9wZS10by1sb25nLWJlYWNoLWZvci1hbm51YWwtZnVuZHJhaXNlci_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzc3RlbGVncmFtLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzE0L3NoaXJsZXktd2lsZC1wYXRod2F5cy1icmluZy1ldXJvcGUtdG8tbG9uZy1iZWFjaC1mb3ItYW5udWFsLWZ1bmRyYWlzZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shirley Wild: Pathways bring Europe to Long Beach for annual fundraiser,"Pathways an organization that provides intensive support for severely traumatized young women to attend college recently celebrated its 25th Annual Party in the Park — but took a different path this year.

Instead of their customary format — a street party — guests pre-selected their venue with a “Passport to Pathways: European Adventure” choosing to visit one of three options Paris Seville or Athens and Rome (together).

What remained the same was the creativity of the party-givers. The group transformed the private backyards of three Park Estates homes to distinctively represent each city; or in the latter case the major destinations of Greece and Italy respectively.

An innovative “first” was the emcee/auctioneer working all of the parties remotely and simultaneously.

Working from a control booth in front of the Seville house he broadcast to all the locations at once. In the interim he visited each party and introduced himself. This achieved a traditional Paddle Raise without hiring three auctioneers. All donations were made electronically and displayed in real time on the large screens in each venue. In 10 minutes they raised $45000. Overall the event raised more than $750000 for Pathways Programs.

Still in the shadow of the coronavirus however some 300 guests safely gathered at the three distinct parties which included food live music dancing speeches and the auction.

In the Paris venue arriving guests walked through the metro into the Champs-Élysées where they were greeted with the Arc de Triomphe aglow with lights a huge model of the Eiffel Tower and other French-inspired designed. Can Can dancers and the Bierman Bros rock band played from a balcony with guitar solos in the crowd. Costumes included striped shirts and berets French maids painters and mimes.

As guests arrived in Seville they were greeted by life-sized posters of Spanish dancers and bull fighters with fans and flowers for the hair available. Two very large inflatable bulls floated in the pool. Featuring a festival theme colored paper lanterns were abundant with giant bulls and flamenco dancers cut-outs. Spanish dancers and a DJ entertained from the stage. Costumes included flamenco dancers and bull fighters.

Those attending the Athens and Rome party were greeted by a large Pegasus and Acropolis art and columns down the entry way. There was a large Trojan horse and a “philosophy pit” seating area. Costumes included lots of togas Greek and Roman goddesses Roman soldiers.

FYI: Pathways to Independence is a non-profit in Huntington Beach with a strong track record of helping women complete college and become self-sufficient.

Exactly 100 years since the discovery of insulin by a team of Canadian researchers revolutionized the treatment of diabetes the autoimmune disease continues to affect millions of Canadians with no cure in sight.

Advancements in science and technology have enabled us to monitor and manage diabetes better but there is still room for improvement experts say.

“Despite all of our advances we still see a lot of complications of diabetes today even in Canada and so I think we have a lot of room to improve” said Dr. Jeremy Gilbert an endocrinologist at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre in Toronto.

More than 11 million Canadians or one in three are living with diabetes or prediabetes according to Diabetes Canada.

Every hour of every day at least 20 people are diagnosed with the disease and every 24 hours more than 20 Canadians die of diabetes-related complications.

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body is unable to produce or properly use insulin – a hormone that controls blood sugar levels.

If left uncontrolled diabetes results in consistently high levels of blood sugar which can lead to serious complications such as cardiovascular disease vision loss kidney failure nerve damage and amputation.

Diabetes is also among the top 10 causes of death globally according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Progress in treatments

Since the 1921 discovery of insulin by Canadians Frederick Banting Charles Herbert Best James Bertram Collip and Britain’s John J.R. Macleod insulin injections are still the most common and effective treatment for Type 1 diabetes.

However the mode of delivery and monitoring have undergone upgrades.

Wearable glucose monitors and infusion pumps that deliver insulin continuously are considered a game-changer in managing diabetes significantly improving the quality of life of patients.

The latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.

Replacing the need to take urine or blood samples a flash glucose metre can help detect sugar levels throughout the day by inserting a small sensor under the skin of a person’s upper arm or belly. The results are displayed on a reader and can be linked to a smartphone.

Gilbert said the glucose-sensing technologies that enable continuous real-time monitoring has been a “paradigm shift.”

“It’s a much more sophisticated way to monitor sugar levels” said Dr. Michael Sefton professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Toronto.

The hemoglobin A1c blood test which allows patients and doctors to know how well the glucose has been controlled over the past three months is another major achievement in diabetes research according to Sefton.

“That gives a target that a person living with diabetes who is well-managed can shoot for.”

There have also been advancements within insulin itself which are safer to use and more user-friendly said Gilbert.

The more common Type 2 diabetes which accounts for more than 90 per cent of total diabetes cases is becoming increasingly common in children in Canada.

A variety of oral medications can be taken to treat it. Lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet exercise and weight loss can also help manage Type 2 diabetes.

New medications are available that reduce heart and kidney diseases beyond just the lowering of the sugar levels said Gilbert.

“Many of the people who live with diabetes have already seen an improvement in their lifespan and improvement in their lifestyle over … the past 30 years” said Sefton.

Future of diabetes

For the past decade his lab at U of T’s Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research has been working to develop a new way of treating diabetes to allow the transplant of pancreatic islets the cells in a human pancreas that make insulin.

Story continues below advertisement

That work builds on a ground-breaking procedure by a research team at the University of Alberta. Termed the Edmonton Protocol and published in 2000 it involved pancreatic islets being isolated purified and transplanted back from a donor into the livers of people living with Type 1 diabetes.

Now Sefton’s team is focusing on transplanting the islets under the skin. They are collaborating with Dr. Tim Kieffer’s lab at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. The project is funded by the non-profit Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).

While still in the pre-clinical trial stage and being tested on small animals Sefton believes this could change how diabetes is treated and become “quite routine” in the years to come.

“We think it’s the way of the future” he said. “It’s a tough problem and so we want to take small safe steps as we move forward.”

Another area that could prove pivotal is the use of stem cells for which several human clinical trials have been conducted.

Last month Vertex Pharmaceuticals said Phase 1/2 clinical trials of a novel investigational stem cell-derived therapy for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes led to a 91 per cent reduction in daily insulin requirement and robust improvements in glucose control. The treatment was also generally well tolerated the company said.

Going forward the aim should be to find therapies that not only make people feel well but are easy to take and do not result in significant side effects said Gilbert.

Where is the cure?

Despite the progress a cure still remains elusive and will be challenging to find experts say.

“Most of our approaches now are just to manage the diabetes but not necessarily cure it or put it into remission” said Gilbert.

Story continues below advertisement

A cure remains a “tough goal” because there are still many unanswered questions about the disease and more research is needed said Sefton.

Because there are several factors that contribute to the development of diabetes it has been a challenge to cure it said Gilbert.

But he remains hopeful.

“My hope is we continue to advance with the research we’re doing in Canada and worldwide to hopefully get to that cure sooner rather than later.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is what Polen Capital has to say about Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

“Facebook’s stock was pressured on concerns about regulation in the quarter. We are constantly monitoring the potential regulatory risks to Facebook (and all of our holdings). At this point we see very little chance that regulation changes Facebook’s business model in a meaningful and adverse way. Regarding the recent data shared by a former Facebook employee and the company itself on some of the unfortunate negative consequences of social media we recognize these types of issues will inevitably linger in different forms and fashions well into the future. We have been focused on the ability of Facebook to identify and mitigate these negative consequences while amplifying the value users typically cite for its apps across a long list of use cases. We continuously monitor the vibrance of the user base on Facebook’s apps to confirm that value.”

While The Bass Tank boys had been catching them good using jerkbaits and Alabama rigs (check out John Soukup’s 10-pounder) several fish were unwilling to commit. Warren explains the importance of watching your fish finders for trailing bass which often hang below the boat before dispersing. In this situation a Damiki-rigged fluke-style plastic is a top-notch follow-up bait.

TACKLE AND GEAR

The trick to Damiki rigging is doing very little with the bait. Whereas there’s a perception that you need to work a plastic actively the reverse is often key to triggering bass in the winter. One of the keys to the setup is rigging your minnow-imitating plastics to hang horizontally when fished vertically. Warren shares some basic tackle and rigging guidance to achieve this.

Lakireddy Bali Reddy an infamous Berkeley landlord who went to prison for sex trafficking young women from India has died according to media reports. He was 84.

Reddy was found unresponsive in his home on Monday and transported to Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland where he was pronounced dead of natural causes the Alameda County Sheriff's Office told Berkeleyside.

Telegu News International first reported his death adding it was due to ""respiratory ailments.""

Reddy was a wealthy landlord in Berkeley best known for his sex trafficking of young women from low castes to work in his empire of hotels and restaurants.

Prosecutors accused Reddy of bringing girls and women from India on fraudulent visas and then paying them low wages as if they were slaves and also sexually abusing many of them.

At the time of his arrest in 2000 Reddy owned more than 1000 rental properties in Berkeley include the once popular Pasand Restaurant on Shattuck Avenue making him one of the city’s richest landlords.

MORE: Woman 22 dies days after shooting at Lake Merritt

The criminal case started to be revealed when student journalists from Berkeley High School asked probing questions when 17-year-old Chanti Pratipatti died of carbon monoxide poisoning at one of his Berkeley properties in 1999.

In addition a Berkeley resident named Marcia Poole became suspicious when she saw four men moving what she first thought was a rolled-up rug out of the apartment building that Reddy owned and putting it into a Reddy Realty van. She noticed that a girl's leg was sticking out of the carpet.

The Berkeley students wondered why that teenager wasn't in school and their reporting exposed a string of abuses.

In addition to the sex trafficking plea Reddy and other family members were convicted of cheating immigration laws by having men pose as fathers in order to bring them to the United States. Many of the young women were from the Dalit caste in India and their parents thought life with Reddy in the United States was better than their poor lot at home.

Ultimately Reddy pleaded guilty and was convicted of sexually abusing nearly 25 women from India between 1986 and 2001. He ultimately spent eight years in Lompoc federal prison and registered as a sex offender in California. He also had to pay $2 million in restitution payments to his victims.

A businessman originally from Andhra Pradesh India he founded an engineering college that bears his name in his hometown of Mylavaram.

The college shared a message in tribute to Reddy on its website after he died saying ""we miss you Sir"" and calling him ""India's favorite son.""

But not many in Berkeley felt that way about him.

Reddy's crimes were cited in the books ""Hidden Slaves: Forced Labor in the United States"" and ""Body Evidence: Intimate Violence against South Asian Women in America"" among others.

""He was a horrible man who did terrible things"" said attorney Michael Rubin who sued Reddy in a civil case representing the young women.

The low rolling resistance of steel-on-steel will always beat rubber on road the ability to pull long chains of freight cars linked closely together gives trains a significant aerodynamic advantage as well. Not to mention the fact that the entire rail system is built around energy conservation avoiding gradients where possible and conserving momentum by using the fewest possible stops.

But while some areas have largely managed to electrify their rail systems others persist with diesel locomotives and these are largely responsible for nearly half a percent of global greenhouse emissions – somewhere around 250 million tons of CO2 equivalent each year – according to OWID. This will need to be addressed in the race to net zero by 2050.

Fitting rail infrastructure with overhead lines might make sense in some areas but in the US where nearly all rail infrastructure is privately owned distances are long many areas are sparsely populated and the government has done little to encourage electrification less than 1 percent of rail is electrified and this kind of infrastructure seems like an impossibly difficult solution.

A new study in Nature Energy puts some numbers on an alternative: battery-electric locomotives that carry their own energy supply. These are already starting to pop up with initiatives like Wabtec's FLXDrive the world's first 100 percent battery-powered locomotive which completed a three-month trial earlier this year carrying 2.4 MWh of battery on board.

Wabtec's FLXDrive locomotive is described as the world’s first 100-percent battery-powered locomotive Wabtec

Since today's diesel locomotives typically run electric drive systems anyway using the diesel engine as a generator it's not difficult to convert them to DC battery power. You just need a big battery and the wiring to connect it to the drive system.

In the new study paper the team proposes attaching dedicated battery boxcars behind the locomotive. Each boxcar the team calculates could pull as much as 14 MWh of energy storage in the form of long-cycle-life lithium ferrous phosphate batteries. You can run multiple locomotives and/or multiple battery boxcars to power a given train.

This study analyzes the energy use practicalities and economics of a theoretical train operating in California using four 3.3-megawatt locomotives pulling 100 boxcars and 6806 tonnes of revenue-earning cargo powered by a single battery boxcar.

It finds that this one large battery pack is enough to achieve a 241-km (150-mile) range enough to meet the average distance between stops for US Class 1 freight trains. The weight of the battery car increases the train's energy use by about 5 percent says the team but the overall energy consumption of the train is about half what a typical diesel-electric train uses thanks to the high efficiency of batteries and the ability to harvest some braking energy back into the system.

The battery cars could be charged at each stop during loading unloading and crew changes assuming a fast charger could be provided. This would take between 30-60 minutes using existing 2C charging technology. Alternatively the battery car could potentially be swapped out for a fresh one – meaning little in the way of fancy infrastructure would be needed and a spent battery could slowly charge up until it's next needed.

In terms of economics the team calculated the total cost of ownership (TCO) for battery-electric and diesel-electric locomotives over 20 years and found that battery-electrics should cost between US$6.47 to 8 million apiece with the lion's share taken up by battery and charging infrastructure costs. Diesels will cost around $5.85 million each the bulk of that taken up by fuel and maintenance.

But that's assuming there's no environmental damage costs – if these are levied ""under the assumption of continued roll-out of the EPA Tier 4 rule"" according to the researchers this could take the TCO of a diesel locomotive up to $11.83 million.

Should the entire US rail sector electrify its fleets in this manner the team points out that the country will effectively have some 200 gigawatt-hours of modular mobile energy storage rolling around the country portions of which can be dropped off to stricken areas suffering power loss from extreme weather events. This needn't cause the rail system to grind to a halt; the diesel engines are still on board ready to go if needed. While connected to the grid for charging they could also provide valuable fast-response load-balancing services as well. Both of these could become revenue opportunities.

Obviously there are other clean energy opportunities for rail as well including hydrogen. A hydrogen fuel cell locomotive like this one that debuted three years ago in Germany could be rolled out at around half the cost of a battery train say the researchers since it could avoid the high early costs of batteries and the necessity to build charging infrastructure. But even under the most conservative assumptions the TCO would end up about even with a battery train by 2050.

There is also the potential for diesel locomotives to be converted to run on ammonia which would make the energy storage smaller and lighter than hydrogen or batteries. Ammonia would also simplify fueling logistics. On the other side of the coin green ammonia will be more expensive than hydrogen fuel and burning it will be less efficient than running hydrogen through a fuel cell. The study doesn't mention ammonia as an alternative or attempt to draw any price comparisons.

The study is open access in Nature Energy.

Pessina 80 has shaken hands on upwards of 1500 deals since taking on his father’s failing pharmacy in Naples in the 1970s invariably leaving the negotiating table in control of a larger business.

They are already shooting television productions on this virtual stage. Dubbed The Infinity on Disney Stage 1 and situated on the same stage where sequences of Walt Disney’s groundbreaking Fantasia were filmed the new facility is composed of 700 state-of-the-art LED panels. When combined they create a 1600 square foot LED canvas—including doors—or approximately 16000 cubic feet on the main Volume plus 800 square feet of doors.

“Thanks to the leadership of Peter Rice and Dana Walden we are committing a stage on our lot to a permanent virtual StageCraft production installation” said Disney Television Studios production executive John Ziffren and technology executive Alex Grimwade who spearheaded the effort. “This stage will serve as an extraordinary resource for creatives both inside and outside The Walt Disney Company bringing this groundbreaking technology—often used in feature films and effects-laden series—to episodic television production. Whether it’s shooting routine driving shots creating worlds that only exist in the imaginations of our creators or traveling our casts and crews to both well-known and remote locations around the world without anyone having to get on a plane the possibilities are game-changing. Our partnership with Industrial Light & Magic with their end-to-end virtual production platform StageCraft ensures the most advanced production technology available today. It’s a huge step forward for our television operations and we’re excited to have this tremendous resource for our creative partners as well as other industry producers.”

Chris Bannister ILM’s StageCraft executive producer added “We are so excited to partner with the Disney Television Studios team on this project. ILM’s StageCraft brings about the production-hardened technology as well as experts in virtual production to help make creative visions a reality. By partnering with Disney Television Studios we are connecting with a whole new group of creatives and producers. We are excited to show how virtual production can help a wide range of productions from simple process shots to complex in-camera digital environments.”

The stage has already hosted a high-profile upcoming television series the Hulu Original series How I Met Your Father from 20th Television which premieres early next year. Showrunners Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger had conceived a pivotal sequence for an episode of the show set in New York City in which their lead character walks the Brooklyn Bridge with her friends. Rather than flying series star Hilary Duff and her castmates across the country and braving the logistical obstacles of the elements location shooting and permits ambient noise and other complications series director and executive producer Pamela Fryman was able to shoot her stars on the virtual stage—capturing a render of them walking the iconic location which will look completely authentic to viewers.

“Thanks to Disney’s new Infinity Stage I was able to spend the day in Burbank shooting a scene on the Brooklyn Bridge” said Fryman. “The logistics and price tag of shooting on location (even when there’s not a pandemic) would have made this scene impossible but thanks to this new technology the scene is in the can! A huge thank you to everyone involved who welcomed us with open arms and made the entire experience so much fun and a huge success.”

In addition to its future use for the hundreds of Walt Disney Company television productions each year the Infinity on Stage 1 is also available for rental to other studios and production entities. The facility will also be used as a training platform for production craftspeople to learn more about the possibilities unleashed by virtual production technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkdy1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vNS1mYWN0cy1hYm91dC1kaXNuZXktbGVnZW5kLXdob29waS1nb2xkYmVyZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Facts About Disney Legend Whoopi Goldberg,"Learn about Disney Legend Whoopi Goldberg born 11/13/1955.

1. A Very Merry Birthday

Whoopi was born in New York City on November 13 1955. That year may not have significance to most readers but serious Disney trivia aficionados will recognize that 1955 was the same year that Disneyland Park opened in Anaheim California.

Whoopi recognized this fact and pointed it out in her acceptance speech at the D23 Expo in 2017. “I was born the same year the park opened so I’ve always felt like it was home.”

Although her mother never got to bring her to Disneyland like she’d promised Whoopi instead was the one to bring her mom to the park once she’d grown up and become successful—which was certainly a special visit for both of them.

2. More Than a Laughing Hyena

Most Disney fans will recall Whoopi’s involvement in The Lion King as her seminal contribution to the house of mouse but the actress has been involved in many more Disney productions than the 1994 animated classic The Lion King.

Other voice acting work that Whoopi has done for The Walt Disney Company includes Miss Mittens in Snow Buddies Stretch in Toy Story 3 and the off-screen voice of Ursula in The Descendants 2.

She made appearances in multiple Muppets movies and shows including a substantial role as The Boss in the 2002 TV movie It’s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie.

And who can forget Whoopi’s phenomenal comedic performance in the massive hit Sister Act? Yes Sister Act is actually a Disney production as it was released through Touchstone Pictures a distribution label created and owned by The Walt Disney Company.

3. From Watching TV to Starring on It

In her acceptance speech at the D23 Expo Whoopi shared how she grew up watching The Wonderful World of Disney on her television as a child in the Public Housing Projects of New York City.

I doubt that Whoopi would’ve ever predicted that—40 years later—she’d star in multiple productions for the Walt Disney Company that aired on ABC including her work on The View.

In 1997 Whoopi portrayed Queen Constantina in the televised production of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella where she performed alongside other notable Black entertainers like Brandy and Whitney Houston.

The next year Whoopi had a starring role in A Knight in Camelot a made-for-TV comedy in which she’s sent back in time to medieval England. It was the umpteenth adaptation of Mark Twain’s A Young Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court but Whoopi’s sass gave it a memorable charm.

4. The Queen of California

Whoopi Goldberg has an undeniably recognizable voice and if you visited Disney California Adventure Park between 2001 and 2008 you’ll certainly have heard it.

The actress served as the narrator in the short film “Golden Dreams” which was shown at Disneyland Resort inside a theater designed like a replica of San Francisco’s Palace of Fine Arts.

Whoopi’s character in the film was the legendary queen of California Califia a fictional warrior-ruler who was the inspiration for the state’s name.

5. Close Friends

Even before Whoopi landed those notable roles in Disney productions the actress was already making friends with Mickey back in 1986.

In case you don’t know about the feat that occurred on May 25 1986 here’s a recap: Around 7 million people in America joined hands to form a line that stretched from New York City to California.

Hands Across America was organized to raise awareness and funds to fight hunger and homelessness in our country and the accompanying music video spotlighted the involvement of many celebrities. Among those in the crowd were Whoopi Goldberg and Mickey Mouse who are seen hand-in-hand.

A multi-talented artist Whoopi is one of the few people who have earned Emmy Grammy Oscar and Tony awards—the rare EGOT achievement. Of course looking at her repertoire it’s no surprise that she’s had such a successful career. Whoopi definitely deserved her Disney Legends Award.

To me Whoopi Goldberg will forever be Guinan working the bar at the Ten-Forward lounge aboard the USS Enterprise-D.

""They are already trickling in"" Armel Real Estate owner Deanna Armel told WKMG of the Disney employees looking at homes. ""I’m working with a Disney relocation right now buying in the Winter Garden area.""

DISNEY MOVING THOUSANDS OF JOBS FROM CALIFORNIA TO FLORIDA: 'BUSINESS-FRIENDLY CLIMATE'

Disney announced in July that it would move 2000 employees from California to Florida in part because of ""Florida’s business-friendly climate"" chairman of Disney Parks Experiences and Products Josh D’Amaro said at the time. He added that expanding Disney in Florida ""makes sense"" because of its lack of state income tax among other business issues such as collaborative efforts for the company.

The jobs will be located at a new Disney campus being built in Lake Nona a community in Orlando. The move was set to take place over 18 months starting in July.

Central Florida is seeing historic lows of available houses for sale which Armel said is making the moves more difficult. The September housing market in Orlando dropped by 39% when compared to last year according to the latest housing report by the Orlando Regional Realtor’s Association.

DISNEY TO REOPEN RENOVATED JUNGLE CRUISE RIDE CALLED OUT FOR RACISM

""It’s not just 2000 employees it’s 2000 employees their families and extended families"" she said. ""I also kind of panicked and was like ‘Gosh we don’t have enough inventory as it is’ more buyers coming in is going to make it more difficult to win bids for these buyers and we’re trying to help.""

The median price of a home is far below that of California’s sitting at $318000 for Florida and $951000 in California WKMG reported.

""It’s cash it’s all cash"" Armel said.

Another area realtor Sean Faulk of Forever Magic Realty said he’s also working with at least 20 other Disney employees looking to make the move.

""A great deal of Disney employees are contacting me to make that move"" Faulk told WKMG. ""Even as crazy as the housing market is it is still a lot less expensive than their housing market in California.""

""It does change the scale of things. There are a lot of people from California even if they don’t pay it off there is so much equity in their home that they can pay cash for a house here. So it makes our market even more competitive and drives prices up.""

This year California reported its first yearly population decrease in the state’s history. All in California’s population fell by more than 182000 in 2020. Many have cited the state’s high taxes and how it’s not affordable for families.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmVzdC10aGluZ3MtdG8tZG8tZHVyaW5nLW9uZS1kYXktdHJpcC10by1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtMjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How I Spend 24 Hours in Disney World — Favorite Things + Photos,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Growing up in Miami Florida just three hours away from Orlando I've been going to Disney World since I was 1. Now I'm 29 and a proud owner of an annual pass.

When I was younger it was much easier for my family to take time off work and school for a three- or four-day vacation in the parks. But we eventually transitioned to overnight trips from Saturday to Sunday to save time and money.

I've learned how to make the most out of these short 24-hour trips to Disney World. Read on for the things I always make sure to do see and eat.

Dole Whip at Magic Kingdom is nonnegotiable

There's nothing like enjoying a delicious cup of Dole Whip on a hot day at Magic Kingdom. I highly recommend ordering the vanilla-and-pineapple swirl.

I always place a mobile order to pick up in Adventureland because no one wants to be waiting in line in the sun.

I like to leave the park early to hit the resort pool

I always make time to chill by the pool. Noelani Soto

Do all Disney park-goers choose their resort based on the pool or is that just me?

Since I've been to the parks so many times I usually hit a few rides before heading to the pool.

The budget-friendly All-Star Resorts have fun pools in different shapes. But don't sleep on the Disney World partner hotels surrounding Disney Springs. The Hilton Buena Vista Palace has a great lazy river.

Riding the Skyliner can help you beat traffic with stunning views

The Skyliner provides transportation and views. Noelani Soto

Avoid Disney traffic on the roads by riding the Skyliner to Epcot Hollywood Studios Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort Disney's Art of Animation Resort Disney's Pop Century Resort or Disney's Riviera Resort.

The aerial views are incredible especially during sunset.

I try to make a dinner reservation at an Epcot restaurant

Epcot has so many different restaurant options. Noelani Soto

To maximize the number of parks I visit during short trips I like to book a dinner reservation at Epcot.

Despite going to Disney my entire life there are still so many restaurants I haven't checked out so it adds a fun new experience to my trip.

Jelly Rolls at the Boardwalk has the best late-night fun

If you're looking for adult late-night fun Jelly Rolls is a must.

The dueling-piano bar is located on Disney's BoardWalk and the audience can request songs for the pianists to play.

There's an entrance fee of $20 to $25 and it's a 21+ establishment but it's the most fun I've had in Disney World after hours.

The Wilderness Lodge is perfect for outdoor enthusiasts

The resort has a rustic outdoorsy theme. Noelani Soto

Want to feel like you're in the Appalachian Mountains without actually leaving Florida? The Wilderness Lodge is your place.

Sometimes it's nice just to take a stroll through the resort grounds and enjoy a cup of coffee before the chaos of the parks.

Sprinkles in Disney Springs has a 24-hour cupcake ATM

If you're in need of a sugary treat head to Sprinkles cupcake ATM at Disney Springs.

The cupcakes or cookies are dispensed in neat pink boxes any time of day or night.

I don't know how they do it but it's pretty magical.

I make time to resort-hop at the Grand Floridian

The fancy resort is worth visiting. Noelani Soto

The Grand Floridian is probably the fanciest resort at Disney World and I've had some serious luck resort-hopping there.

I'm not sure if this is a regular occurrence but sometimes you can find free activities food or beverages around the grounds.

On two recent occasions I was able to enjoy a nice glass of champagne and s'mores.

World of Disney at Disney Springs is the best place to grab souvenirs

Don't shop inside the theme parks unless you're looking for something specific to that park.

I usually wait until the end of my trip to do my shopping at the gigantic World of Disney store at Disney Springs. But be careful because I always go home with more than I expected.

I always try to catch the annual holiday decor but I only visit during off-weeks

Sunset Boulevard gets decorated for Christmas. Noelani Soto

My favorite time of year to visit is between fall and winter when you can catch all of the great Halloween and Christmas decor.

Instead of visiting the week of Halloween or Christmas though I try the weekends in between when there are usually fewer crowds.

I do my best to catch at least one of the fireworks shows

The nighttime shows are always worth it. Noelani Soto

You don't have to be in the park to watch a fireworks show.

I've been able to see the ones at Magic Kingdom while leaving the park on the Monorail. You can usually get a great view and avoid the exit crowds.

I end my trips with a late lunch at the Boathouse

Before heading back to Miami I love to enjoy a relaxing lunch at the Boathouse in Disney Springs.

There's something so soothing about sitting on the outdoor deck enjoying seafood — I recommend the lobster roll. It brings a quick 24-hour trip to a nice close.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMTEvZm9ydC13aWxkZXJuZXNzLWNhYmlucy1jcmFpZ3MtbGlzdC1zYWxlLWFkMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Buy and Live in a Disney Resort Room For Only $50000 - Inside the Magic,"Have you ever had the dream to just live at Disney World? For many of us Disney fans the idea of being able to live at a Disney World Resort experience the theming and magic at all times seems like a dream. Well although it may be too expensive to live every day of your life at a Disney World Resort we may have a solution that is relatively affordable and will leave you with the ability to live in a Disney World property!

Of course Disney Vacation Club is a great way to experience the Disney magic yearly and Golden Oak is a sure way to live at Disney World each day; however the first option is not permanent and the second is incredibly expensive.

While surfing the web on Craigs List it was discovered that an actual fully intact Fort Wilderness Resort log cabin was posted as an item for sale. The cabin is an actual Fort Wilderness Resort log cabin which was removed in 2016 and is now being listed as a sale item. The cabin is being sold in Florida for $50000 which may not be out of everyone’s budget if it means that they could own a piece of Disney magic.

The listing explains the history of the cabin as well as what is included:

For SALE: AUTHENTIC FORMER DISNEY’S FORT WILDERNESS LOG CABIN ***This is a Very unique opportunity to own a piece of Disney History. These units are rarely available for the general public to own or purchase. With it being the 50th Anniversary of Disney we are making a unit available for purchase.*** THIS IS AN ACTUAL Disney Fort Wilderness Resort log cabin that was removed from THE 2100 BLOCK back in 2016 and is now available for sale. Would be a fantastic opportunity for anyone that owns a piece of property/land and would like to use this for their very own Cabin in the woods Hunting Camp Guest House Mother-In Law Suite etc. or capitalize on an investment opportunity and turn it into a rental unit or as a vacation home and generate income on such sites as AirBNB VRBO HomeAway etc. Same cabins that are still in use at the resort and are renting from $325-$500+ per night. Unit is mobile (just like a mobile home) so can be towed and transported to any location you wish and has all the creature comforts of a 1Bed/1 Bath home and sleeps Six Comfortably. Unit has approx. 500 Sq. Feet of Living area.

Once relocated it would need a deck/stairs built to the doorways (This particular unit has a Large deck that could be included with purchase but would need to be disassembled and hauled off by the buyer at their own expense) electrical and water services hooked up to make them fully funcion like any other home. These units were built in 1998 by Liberty Homes out of Ocala Florida and will come with clean Florida Title (STILL IN DISNEY’S NAME) as well as HUD Certificate. The unit dimensions are roughly 12.5′ x 43′. I can assist the buyer with transport by getting you in contact with a transport company that is very familiar with moving these units as they are the ones who originally transported them to Disney back in 1998 and also relocated them to where they sit today. They have all the specialized equipment needed to safely transport these. THIS IS AN ACTUAL cabin that was removed from THE 2100 BLOCK of Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort so it has been used on their site commercially and shows typical signs of wear and tear from being used to house guests at the resort. This unit has 2 brand new mini Split Air Conditioning units that come with the unit comes fully furnished with many original Disney items such as the pictures on the walls desk lamps solid wood bed frames curtains Murphy bed etc. Being Sold As-Is/Where-Is but overall in good condition. Price: $50000 USD which includes all furniture and fixtures pictured 2 Mini Split A/C units and large exterior deck (Buyer responsible for removal and transport of deck) This Unit is located in Duette Florida but another can be viewed in Seminole Florida as well as Marble North Carolina if needed.

It may not be a room at Disney’s Grand Floridian but the cabin would be the perfect piece of memorabilia for any Disney fan! It could act as a great tiny home or can be placed on a lakeside area (or anywhere you own land) as a vacation destination.

Originally the deadline for broadcasters to submit bids during the auction was Monday November 8. A decision was expected to be reached on Thursday November 11. But the Premier League has now decided that the bidding will go to a second round. The new deadline is Thursday November 18. A final decision will be announced shortly thereafter.

While the final decision is not up to us we offer a poll below to have you cast your vote. Who do you want to win the next rights deal? Whomever the Premier League selects will have the rights from the 2022/23 through 2027/28 seasons.

According to Sports Business Journal the six US media companies involved in the bidding are (in no specific order):

NBC Sports

A combined bid from CBS and ESPN

FOX Sports

WarnerMedia and

Amazon

All of the above choices seem straightforward except one. WarnerMedia’s inclusion could go down one of two paths. Firstly HBO Max is looking to add sports programming. Recently WarnerMedia signed a seven-year deal with the National Hockey League to broadcast live hockey games. So soccer would be an ideal fit there too.

Secondly WarnerMedia is merging with Discovery. Expect the mega-merger to be ready by the middle of 2022. The plans are for the merged company to be named Warner Bros. Discovery to combine HBO Max and Discovery+ in a streaming service to compete head on with Disney+. Sports would be an ideal fit. But the timing may not work for the start of the 2022/23 Premier League season in August. But it could be ready for HBO MAX for sure.

Additionally don’t forget that WarnerMedia can use their Bleacher Report brand to promote its coverage of soccer too.

As we reported last week NBC Sports Chairman is taking nothing for granted with his company’s bid for the rights. That was one day after ESPN announced they had made a disciplined bid.

Don’t be surprised if more twists and turns happen this coming week as broadcasters evaluate their options and consider how much they’ll bid.

The idea of Sorkin with his divisive trademark style tackling the material and the casting of Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as the “I Love Lucy” stars left many skeptical that the film could pull it off. But based on the first reactions below it appears the movie has entered the awards race with audience members praising Kidman and Bardem for capturing the essence of the duo.

The film follows the real-life marriage of Ball and Arnaz who starred as married Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on the CBS sitcom “I Love Lucy” for six seasons in the ’50s. J.K. Simmons stars as William Frawley who played Lucy and Ricky’s landlord Fred Mertz on the show and Nina Arianda is Vivian Vance who played Lucy’s best friend Ethel Mertz. It also features “Arrested Development” costars Tony Hale and Alia Shawkat as well as Clark Gregg Linda Lavin and Jake Lacy.

Sorkin directed from his own script; it marks his third directorial effort after “Molly’s Game” and the Oscar-nominated “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Sorkin’s trademark style of long monologues fast-paced dialogue and earnest wit (best captured in “The West Wing”) has made him as celebrated as he is divisive.

Those qualities and Sorkin’s choice in casting has made “Being the Ricardos” a subject of curiosity in the film community since the project was announced earlier this year. In a recent interview Sorkin defended his picks: While Kidman may not be the spitting image of Ball that was no barrier for the director.

“We made this movie during COVID and so in Zooming with Nicole and Javier and everyone else I’d make it very clear to them that I am not looking for a physical or vocal impersonation of these people” Sorkin told the Hollywood Reporter. “Leading up to the first rehearsal I’d write to them every day ‘Just play the characters who are in the script.’ I know that Nicole was working on Lucy’s voice for a while and I wanted to relieve her of that.”

Amazon Studios is set to give “Being the Ricardos” a limited theatrical release on December 10 before it streams on Prime Video beginning December 12. Check out a handful of first reactions to the film in the posts below.

Sorkin's pandemic shoot Being the Ricardos is a fascinating look at one fraught week for Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz under duress on many fronts with I Love Lucy and their marriage at stake.

Lucy you’ve got some campaigning to do: BEING THE RICARDOS played well in its first screening suggesting a solid awards contender.

What is Oprah Winfrey's net worth?

Oprah 70 has a net worth of $2.8 billion according to Forbes.

She ""reinvested the profits from her show plus profits from films like The Color Purple Beloved and Selma (which her Harpo Productions coproduced) add up to an estimated more than $2 billion"" per the outlet.

Forbes also states that in 2020 Oprah sold the majority of her stake in her cable channel own to owner Warner Bros. Discovery ""in exchange for shares in the company.""

In 2015 the talk show pioneer bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers ""though she owns less now"" and became a brand ambassador for the weight loss company.

In 2018 CNN reported that her investment was worth over $400 million.

In February 2024 Variety reported that Oprah would be leaving the Weight Watchers board ""following the entertainment mogul’s revelation that she is using a weight-loss drug.""

""Winfrey informed the company this week that she decided to not stand for reelection at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in May 2024"" the outlet continued.

""I look forward to continuing to advise and collaborate with WeightWatchers and CEO Sima Sistani in elevating the conversation around recognizing obesity as a chronic condition working to reduce stigma and advocating for health equity” Oprah said in a statement according to Variety.

In December 2023 the star revealed to People that she is taking a weight loss medication.

""The fact that there's a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier in my lifetime feels like relief like redemption like a gift and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for"" she said in part.

""I'm absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself.""

Oprah also signed a multi-year content partnership with Apple in 2018 according to Variety.

The ultra-wealthy star grew up poor in rural Mississippi.

She started her career in Nashville before moving to Baltimore and co-anchoring the talk show People Are Talking.

After Baltimore she moved to Chicago where her job was to revamp a struggling morning show according to Business Insider. That show was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show.

During her career Oprah launched her own production company Harpo her own cable network and her own magazine.

She even starred in blockbuster films and was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in The Color Purple.

According to Forbes Oprah has homes in California and more than a dozen properties in Hawaii.

Why did The Oprah Winfrey Show end?

The Oprah Winfrey Show aired its final episode on May 25 2011 after having debuted on September 8 1986.

In an August 2017 interview with Vogue Oprah opened up about her decision to end the long-running TV program.

""I started thinking about the times: where we were would I be able to take it digital. People were moving into 'I want to be able to watch it when I want to watch it' and the four o'clock hour was no longer must-see television"" she said per TV Series Finale.

""I could feel that happening with the audience. Their behaviors were shifting and the media world was changing"" she continued.

""I had written something in my journals years before: 'I never want to stay too long in the ring so I end up punch-drunk.' I didn’t want people saying 'She shoulda quit that show three years ago!'

""I started reading this incredible article about Michael Jackson and one of Jackson’s friends was quoted as saying 'His number-one problem is that he never realized that Thriller was a phenomenon. And he spent the rest of his life trying to chase it.'

""And so when Bad only sold—only sold—20 million albums early on he was disappointed because it wasn’t Thriller. He thought he was going to top Thriller.

""I went Whoa. Pay attention to that. I didn’t want to be the person chasing a phenomenon. And that is what the Oprah show was. All the right elements came together at the right time. That won’t happen again.

""People would ask me 'Who will be the next Oprah?' And the answer is: 'There won’t be.'""

When did Oprah launch the OWN network?

Oprah founded the OWN network on January 1 2011.

Before its launch Oprah discussed the California-based cable network with O editor-in-chief Susan Casey.

When asked why she chose to start OWN the TV legend responded ""My goal in life is to live out the truest expression of myself as a human being.""

""We live in a culture that really only responds to that which is familiar famous wealthy—people pay attention to people who are known. I've always believed that that was what the fame was for so that people would pay attention"" she continued.

""For me though it's been equally important that once they're paying attention you have something meaningful worthwhile and of substance to say to them—you're not just yakety-yakking.

""In the early '90s when I was doing the show I wrote in my journal about creating a network for mindful television.

""Stedman and I were talking about the state of trash TV and what I was going to do and he said 'Why don't you own your own network?' And I was like 'Well how is that possible?' Because it seemed impossible at the time.

""But as I sat with the idea—own your own network—I thought of the letters OWN standing for the Oprah Winfrey Network. And I'm always looking for signs signals and so I wrote that down in my journal that night May 14 1992.""

Over a decade later OWN remains a successful network that airs many shows and podcasts."
WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzEzL2RpdmlkZW5kLXN0b2NrLXRyaXBsZWQtaXRzLXBheW91dC1vdmVyLTE3LXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Dividend Stock Has Tripled Its Payout Over the Past 17 Years,"This isn't the highest-yielding stock but could still be worth a closer look.

Don't underestimate the long-term compounding power of a rock-solid company with a steadily growing dividend like Waste Management (WM 0.47%). In this Fool Live clip recorded on Oct. 25 Fool.com contributors Jon Quast and Jason Hall discuss why income-seeking investors might want to put Waste Management on their radar.

10 stocks we like better than Waste Management

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Waste Management wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of November 10 2021

Jon Quast: One of the things that I like about Waste Management is just how rock solid its core business is. When you think about the need to have trash removed and dealt with is there anything more predictable in life? I mean we fill up a trash can all the time at my house and that is never going to change in our life I don't think.

Waste Management's core business is really intact. It's a solidly profitable company and it's one that management has really good expectations on what's going to happen. They can really plan ahead and really manage that business well. I'll just share a couple of stats real quick. We're not going too deep here just keeping time in mind. But this is typically a single-digit growth company.

Most recently here it's revised its outlook up. It's expecting revenue growth this year 2021 to be between 15.5% and 16%. That's actually pretty good for this company on a year-over-year basis. Now some of this is being propelled forward catalyzed by acquisitions. I think it has something in the ballpark of 25% of the market share when it comes to landfills in the United States is able to increase that market share with a recent acquisition and why can it make an acquisition? Because it's expecting between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in free cash flow this year.

Anytime you have a business that's throwing off those kinds of free cash flows it's really hard to bet against it. The dividend yield 1.4% roughly paying out 59% of its earnings right now. It's had a solid history of growing that nothing game-changing here this is over the last five years 40% dividend growth. You see it just stepping up gradually over time. It's a slow and steady business. It's rock-solid as far as its need in the world. So that's why I have it ranked as high as I do.

Jason Hall: I'm going to just share another chart real quick. If you stretch back to 2004 which is really when it implemented its regular dividend policy dividend's up 207%. It was not just a five-year story. This is basically 15 years little bit of earnings growth a little bit of operational improvement ringing it out and then passing that excess earnings growth onto investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5naWxiZXJ0c3VubmV3cy5jb20vY29tbXVuaXR5L2dpbGJlcnQtd2F0ZXItdHJhc2gtcGlja3VwLXJhdGVzLWdvaW5nLXVwL2FydGljbGVfOTA2NTI1NGEtNDQ4Yi0xMWVjLWJjMzYtYmY4ZWJiZjQ4ODQ4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gilbert water trash pickup rates going up | Community | gilbertsunnews.com,Replacing the North Water Treatment Plant is a major driver of the proposed increases in Gilbert’s water rates.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL211bWJhaS1uZXdzL3BsYXN0aWMtcG9sbHV0aW9uLWEtY3Jpc2lzLWluLW11bWJhaS1zLWJlYWNoZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1hcmFiaWFuLXNlYS0xMDE2MzYzMDk4MDk3MDkuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL211bWJhaS1uZXdzL3BsYXN0aWMtcG9sbHV0aW9uLWEtY3Jpc2lzLWluLW11bWJhaS1zLWJlYWNoZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1hcmFiaWFuLXNlYS0xMDE2MzYzMDk4MDk3MDktYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plastic pollution: A crisis in Mumbai’s beaches and the Arabian Sea,"Between his work as a fisher hauling catch in the early hours of the day from August to October and a gig as a lifeguard with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) 26-year-old Sanjay Bamaniya a resident of Sagar Kutir Versova has little time for fun. The fisher communities living along its coastline are losing access to fishing commons and livelihoods due to plastic pollution along the Mumbai beaches and Arabian Sea. (HT PHOTO)

But whenever he can he surfs. Well-built and athletic Bamaniya is a keen swimmer — he was part of a civic body operation that saved the lives of two boys who almost drowned during the recent Ganesh Chaturthi visarjan near Versova koliwada — and he has grown up with the ocean a walking distance from his front door. When he hits the waves at Juhu and Versova beaches he is undeterred by the pollution and debris that Mumbai pours into the sea every day he said.

“Surfing is incredible. Early on I taught myself to float on my stomach using large sheets of thermocol and travel with the waves. About three or four years ago I finally acquired a surfboard and now I do it quite regularly with a friend” he said.

Had it not been for the large thermocol sheets floating around Versova beach Bamaniya would have never learnt to surf. But the irony is not lost on him – Thermocol is one of the most common plastic pollutants in Mumbai’s coastline and it poses a larger threat to Bamaniya’s livelihood.

“Sometimes at high tide during monsoon months there’s so much plastic floating on the water you can’t possibly go swimming or surfing” Bamaniya said.

“When hauling fish we end up with several kilos of plastic waste in the nets. It can take hours to segregate the waste from the catch before going to market. We end up spending a lot of money and time fixing our nets; sharp bits of plastic can get tangled in them or even cut them open” he said.

A sea of plastic

Thermocol or expanded polystyrene (EPS) is one of several varieties of plastic that can be found along Mumbai’s shoreline. A recent research conducted by Helen White an oceanographer at Haverford College in Pennsylvania United States of America found that polystyrene comprised about 16% of plastic debris collected from three beaches of Mumbai: Juhu Mahim Ambojwadi in Malad.

Polyvinyl Chloride or PVC — typically used to make drainage pipes medical devices and insulation for power cables among others — made up 40% of the debris. Polyethylene Terephthalate or PET — usually found in food and beverage packaging — made up 17%. Trace amounts of Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA; 1%) acetal (1%) and silicon (1%) — components which have a wide range of application as industrial adhesives and in the manufacture of consumer electronics — were also found.

These results are based on analysis of nearly 1200 plastic samples that were collected at random from the above three locations in Mumbai between 2018 and 2020. White presented these findings as part of a trans-disciplinary collaboration entitled Inhabited Seas where natural and social science researchers architects and designers across the US and India studied various aspects of Mumbai’s urban design in the context of its geographical location as a coastal city and its rains.

That there is a crisis isn’t new information. But it took another catastrophic event to push this crisis into the limelight.

On May 17 an Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm with windspeeds between 150kmph and 160kmph made a landfall on the Gujarat coast leaving a trail of destruction behind. Lakhs of people were evacuated along the Konkan coast and property worth several lakhs was damaged. As the storm intensified over the days before it made landfall an accommodation barge off the coast of Mumbai broke free and sank. Another tugboat got caught in the swirling waters and went under. The Indian Navy launched a search and rescue operation almost immediately but at least 88 of the 274 people couldn’t be rescued.

On June 30 the Bombay high court expressed grave concern over another aftermath of the cyclone. A bench comprising the Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said that several newspaper reports had pointed to the amount of trash that the sea had regurgitated on Mumbai’s beaches and promenades. These reports painted a “very sorry picture with regard to the cleaning of the coast” the bench observed.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) told the court that it had collected 153 metric tonnes (MT) of waste mostly plastic from the city’s seven beaches the day after Tauktae passed Mumbai. That’s how much 51 elephants put together on a scale would weigh.

The exact quantum of the plastic polluting Mumbai’s shoreline however is hard to know.

In a paper published by the Elsevier Journal Science of the Total Environment in August last year a group of researchers from ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Education (CIFE) found that north-east Arabian Sea just off Mumbai contained an estimated 379 MT of marine debris of which plastics contributed to 40.6% of the total by weight. The rest consisted of varying proportions of “metal glass rubber wood/paper cloth/fibre and others (small degraded particles and natural debris like branches of a tree coconut etc)” the paper stated.

The researchers used a technique called swept area method where the ocean is trawled at selected sampling locations to collect data which is then used to arrive at a metric called the mean catch per unit area or CPUA. The group conducted 25 trawls between September 2017 and May 2018 collecting 1107 items of marine debris. Plastics items comprised 87% of it. “Among this plastic bags and food wrappers were dominant” the study noted.

The mean CPUA of marine debris in Mumbai’s water was estimated at 22.4 kg per square kilometre of the ocean though this method has its limitations as small objects like bottle caps loose fibers and cigarette butts are not always caught in trawl nets. The researchers used this number to calculate the quantum of marine debris in the study area — 379MT.

So what does this mean?

Martin Xavier who works at the Fisheries Resource Harvest and Post-harvest Management Division at CIFE and was one of the scientists involved in the 25 trawls said that the plastic to fish ratio is an estimated 1:17. “For 17kg of fish caught by a trawler off the Mumbai coast a corresponding 1kg of plastic is also inadvertently caught” he said.

“The presence of plastics is not just an environmental hazard but also a health hazard. As the plastics remain in the environment they become a source for microplastics which then find their way into the food chain and can bio-accumulate in humans” added Xavier.

In 2019 he led a study that estimated that there were 80 microplastic particles per 100 grams of fish bivalves (clams oysters) and shrimp caught in Mumbai. Microplastics are small pieces of plastic less than 5mm in length which enter the environment from disposal and degradation of various consumer and industrial products. Over time large pieces of plastic break off into tinier fragments under influence of wind abrasion and exposure to UV light. These may be ingested by marine life and move up the food chain when humans consume fish for example.

Studies show their potential to disrupt the body’s endocrine reproductive and cardiovascular systems in addition to potentially carcinogenic impact. “It is a serious concern as we found microplastic in the tissue which is the edible part” Xavier added.

It’s not just the deep ocean that’s polluted. A 2013 study led by researchers at the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency Sri Lanka found a mean abundance of 68.83 items of plastic per square metre of land on four beaches in Mumbai: Dadar Mahim Juhu and Aksa.

A more recent study published in July this year by researchers at CIFE found that plastics dominate the composition of marine debris in Mumbai’s mangrove forests comprising 62% of all surface debris items (by number) and 43 percent (by weight) collected from Versova Gorai Bandra Bandstand Sewri Vikhroli and Elephanta Island.

Such empirical findings come as no surprise to environmentalists and citizens some of whom have stepped in to clean up. One of them is Afroz Shah a lawyer and environmentalist who was credited with organising the world’s largest beach up in Versova in 2015 and has since kept up efforts at keeping the beach clean.

“In seven years of organising beach clean ups we’ve collected a total of 85000 tonnes of plastic from just two beaches Versova and Danapani. Most of it is plastic and most of the plastic is food wrappers and multi-layered packaging or MLP. MLP is so conspicuous precisely because it is essentially impossible to recycle and the informal system of rag-pickers has no use for it” Shah said.

His team of volunteers now regularly segregates MLPs and sends them to a pyrolysis plant where they are turned into oil.

In the past year in the midst of an unfolding catastrophe like the Covid-19 pandemic we’ve also added more plastic to our daily use: PPE kits gloves face shields N95 masks.

Plastic plastic everywhere

Plastic typically enters the ocean through the city’s drainage channels and rivers along with other pollutants like sewage and industrial waste. One way to reduce its ingress into the sea would then be to clean these channels.

Under the Mithi River Rejuvenation pilot the city purchased a specialised machine for mechanical removal of plastic waste (developed by Finland’s RiverRecycle project; the MMRDA is overseeing the project in association with the global Marine Debris Partnership). The machine is essentially a floating barge with a mechanical barrier that segregates and extracts plastic waste and other debris from the water. It is capable of cleaning up about 50 tonnes of waste a day.

But experts argue that this is hardly enough. An assessment by the state mangrove cell across 14 locations in 2019 found that more than 50000 tonnes of plastic was strewn in mangrove forests alone. Plastic garbage and sewage is found in the other city’s rivers too. According to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board the state itself produced over 300000 tonnes of plastic waste in the year 20-21 alone.

“A better option would be to install grates at the sea end of various outflows and have them cleaned regularly. This has been a demand of environmentalists in the past that we have also suggested in the High Court but the municipality has not shown any inclination toward considering it” said Stalin D director of city-based NGO Vanashakti which is currently pursuing litigation in the Supreme Court to curtail pollution of city drains.

For those living in closest proximity to this waste like Bamaniya the conspicuousness of plastics has become easy to overlook. “I know it is bad for the environment and that the fish eat it but I really don’t know what else to tell you” he said.

What’s fuelling the crisis?

On paper Shah explained India has a robust set of laws to deal with plastic waste including the Centre’s Solid Waste Management Rules and Plastic Waste Management Rules. In 2020 the Centre also came up with a draft policy called the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) which makes manufacturers responsible for recycling an amount of plastic equivalent to what they generate.

And while these rules clearly outline pathways for collection segregation and recycling of plastic they only address the problem of plastic once it has turned into waste.

“In the journey of plastic it doesn’t start out as waste. There is what I call the pre-litter stage when plastics exist on shelves of stores and in our homes as items of use. It’s only when they fall out of use that they become waste and that transition is something that the law has not even begun to address” Shah said.

What is required instead is what experts call a circular economy of plastic in which these materials aren’t allowed to turn into environmental contaminants.

“The EPR rules are meant to address this but there are problems with it. For example a manufacturer who produces 10kg of MLPs in a day is not actually required to recycle the same kind of plastic. He can just as easily recycle 10kg of PET bottles which have more resale value and fulfill his responsibility. The law generalises the types of plastic and leaves room for the worst kind to become pollutants. This is why we are stuck in a post-litter narrative and why beaches need to be constantly cleaned” Shah said.

What’s more there is no legal mandate for the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to act on plastic pollution in the ocean. “The mandate of the MPCB is to regulate industries. In the event that an industrial unit is found to be violating the Water Act we revoke our clearances. But as far as the specific issue of plastic pollution in the ocean is concerned there is no legal mandate for us to act. Our job is to make sure industries don’t pollute and the BMC’s job is to keep the beach clean. Where the sand ends and water begins there is a lack of clarity as to who is accountable for the problem.”

HERE’S WHAT WE CAN DO

Limit thickness of plastic carry bags ban manufacture of plastic lesser than 5 microns thick phase out single use plastic

Sanction the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines which places onus of recycling on the manufacturers

Recycle more. The state has the capacity to recycle 365236 tonnes per annum in its 111 recycling units. In 2020-21 Maharashtra generated 311254 tonnes of plastic; collected 251556 tonnes of plastic waste; of that sent 23237 tonnes to landfills and recycled 221278 tonnes.

Give plastic a longer social life; create a circular economy

Quote 1: “Whenever we receive segregated waste from generators all the components including plastic are properly recycled. Pollution happens because of littering and lack of segregation at source which is as much a responsibility of citizens as that of authorities. The Extended Producer Responsibility guidelines once implemented should be able to address the current situation. We have been working closely with the pollution control board for sustainable waste management and will continue to do so.”

From supporting women entrepreneurs to its many recycling and packaging collection programs — Coca-Cola has been at the forefront of industry initiatives towards inclusive sustainable solutions in the Philippines. Together with Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines the social development arm of Coca-Cola in the country the company has forged longstanding partnerships through the years to help contribute local solutions to strengthen community efforts on solid waste management.

One partner of Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines is marine conservation social enterprise Pure Oceans. The collaboration aims to train and empower communities and their women leaders to create waste management solutions that have a lasting impact.

Pure Oceans is composed of changemaker women led by founder Pia Roxas-Ocampo an advertising consultant by profession and a scuba diver and marine advocate at heart. The organization works with coastal communities to achieve sustainable solutions against plastic litter with its flagship project in the Philippines Linis Islas running in Tingloy Batangas.

Linis Islas is an advocacy program that has given women the power to lead and transform their communities by educating more people especially in litter-vulnerable islands. It also established buying programs at Barangay Santo Tomas in Tingloy and Barangay San Teodoro in Mabini Batangas to encourage communities to source clean and segregated plastics from coastal island communities for recycling or upcycling.

Tingloy a fifth-class municipality comprising Maricaban and Caban Islands and other small islets in Batangas with a total population of less than 20000 remains geographically isolated and at risk of solid waste accumulation and pollution; the island faces daily logistics and transport challenges in its solid waste management system.

As of Q1 this year the Pure Oceans project has diverted 29585 kg of plastic waste from oceans including film and multilayer plastics and types 1 to 6 plastics; established three materials recovery facilities; and provided solid waste management design training to 170 participants—80 percent of whom are women—in 15 barangays.

Despite the grave impact of the pandemic on various sectors the project was able to provide livelihood opportunities to women by funding their communities and encouraging them to segregate waste recycle and earn extra income for every bottle recovered in their household. In Q1 of 2021 alone Pure Oceans was able to provide a Php 26000 monthly income to 11 plastic buying program staff mostly composed of women while beneficiaries were able to recover 32 tons of plastic waste—equivalent to at least Php 156852—from the ocean since 2018.

“I’ve been scuba diving since 2006 and I’ve seen how much the sea has changed in less than two decades. It is disheartening for me to see the reefs being destroyed by plastics that come from tributaries or communities. There is a need to convince people that their waste is their responsibility. If one must use plastic our waste management system is in such a state that we ourselves need to make sure our plastic waste gets diverted from their current default endpoint—the reefs and seas” shares Ocampo.

“We are grateful to Coca-Cola Philippines for ensuring the recyclability of their packaging and increasing recycling capacity in the Philippines with their upcoming bottle-to-bottle recycling facility. Apart from that we appreciate that they are helping us on the other end of the plastic lifecycle—increasing collection rates where the waste is most threatening to community livelihood and health while also helping communities earn extra from those collection activities too. With their assistance we were able to begin and expand our work in 15 barangays within Maricaban Island’’ Ocampo adds.

Women as pillars of change

The partnership between Coca-Cola Foundation and Pure Oceans is leading the charge toward better waste management in local communities.

With the objective to collect at least 2700kg of plastics per month and reach at least 2120 beneficiaries it has opened an opportunity to women of Tingloy to have another source of income while staying at home and taking care of their children.

“Our mission at Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines has always been to deliver happiness refresh communities and help improve the lives of people. Our partnership with Pure Oceans enables women and waste pickers of Tingloy to receive training and education on waste management. Our milestone of collecting 29585 kg of plastic waste is just a start. We believe in collective action toward a common goal. And we look forward to working with more equally-passionate organizations who can help us in shaping a better future for the people in the communities that we are part of” says Cecile Alcantara President of Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines.

In 2018 Coca-Cola announced an ambitious goal to collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle and can it sells globally by 2030. Coca-Cola Philippines has made progress on its World Without Waste roadmap over the past three years and is steadfast on doing more to make this vision come to life.

“We recognise the urgency of the growing plastic waste problem and we are determined to be part of the solution. We will continue to forge partnerships with like-minded organizations industries consumers and local government units to support the transition to a closed loop economy and tackle marine pollution. This will help create a cleaner and more sustainable environment and uplift lives in underserved communities through income-generating programs that help reduce waste“ says Tony Del Rosario Coca-Cola Philippines President and VP for Franchise Operations for the ASEAN and South Pacific Unit-East Asia Region.

Dorshorst has already partnered with Barstool Sports on some opportunities to make money on her name image and likeness after the NCAA began allowing athletes to do so over the summer.

While the opportunities to make money on NIL are very exciting for Dorshorst she added it's important student-athletes have good advisers around them that can make sure everything they're doing is NCAA-compliant.

""I feel like if the NCAA made this easier to understand for the typical college student things would be a lot easier"" Dorshorst said. ""I feel like some people are afraid to capitalize off their name or image just based on the fear that they're going to mess up.""

That being said she's still optimistic about the potential impact of NIL opportunities for student-athletes competing in Olympic sports like track and field.

She said previously student-athletes who chose to compete at events like the Olympic games couldn't compete at the college level if they wanted to use their Olympic experience to attract endorsement deals. That's no longer the case.

In a complaint filed to the Manhattan federal court in early November Well Fargo said Gaw Capital Partners Chairman Goodwin Gaw owes more than $186 million in principal interest and fees on the 338-room hotel and asks that it be foreclosed on to recoup the bank's investments.

Gaw who purchased the hotel in 2017 for $340 million lashed out against the lawsuit and said he would 'vigorously defend' the 18-story Chelsea hotel against foreclosure Bloomberg reported.

The hotel recently played host to a Studio 54-themed Halloween Party for stars like Lorde and Ava Max and was where Solanges Knowles was recorded attacking brother-in-law Jay-Z inside an elevator in 2014.

Wells Fargo sued to sell the Standard High Line Hotel an 18-story 338-room hotel in NYC

Goodwin Gaw chairman of Gaw Capital Partners said he would 'vigorously defend' the hotel against foreclosure and blamed other loaners for his failure to make payments

Gaw Capital has blamed Apollo Global Management Inc. which can take control of the hotel in case of default for spurring settlement offers and payments on the loan.

'Apollo Global Management and its affiliates who own a small sliver - 18% - of the loan have demonstrated that they are more interested in putting their financial greed above interests of all involved including the bondholders' Gaw Capital spokesman Kai Speth said in a statement.

Well Fargo issued the lawsuit after Gaw failed to make payments on the $170 million loan

Apollo denied being the reason why Wells Fargo was seeking to foreclose on the property.

'Apollo is not a party to the foreclosure action which was initiated by the special servicer' a spokesperson said in an email responding to questions. 'The debtor in this case has failed to make payments under the loan and has been in default since May 2020.'

CWCaptial Asset management the special servicer managing the hotel's mortgage filed a formal notice of default in June 2020. A year later the company told Gaw it was accelerating the debt collection process because of the unpaid balance and rising interest costs.

Like most hotels in New York City the Standard High Line had been struggling after the pandemic forced it to shutdown.

The hotel later reopened with occupancy at a meager 30 per cent in December 2020 before rising up to 76 per cent in June.

Rooms at the hotel can go for as much as $2300 a night.

Like most hotels in New York City the Standard High Line had been hit hard by the pandemic

Gaw Capital Partners owns investments in hotels all around the world like the Hilton Del Mar in California

But even as Gaw fell behind on payments for the NYC hotel he continued to further invest his companies money in other projects like a $437 million hotel in Singapore Bloomberg reported.

Gaw Capital had about $3.25 billion under management in 2021 according to the company's website.

It owns investments in multiple hotels in the US and around the world including the Hilton Del Mar in California and the Soho House in Chicago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdW5jZi5vcmcvcGFnZXMvZG9ub3JzLXdoeS1wYXJ0bmVyLXdpdGgtdW5jZi1zcGRw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donors: Why Partner with UNCF SPDP?,"Donors: Do you want to build a diverse workforce? UNCF SPDP wants to help.

The knowledge and skill sets needed to be successful today poses a series of daunting challenges for employers as well as students.

• A college education once a “nice-to-have” component on a prospective employee’s resume is now a must-have—a prerequisite for almost every well-paying fast-growing job and career path.

• With America rapidly becoming a majority-minority population and workforce a pipeline of diverse and college-educated professionals will soon be in high demand.

• And as the competition tightens for these highly educated employees pressure will rise to choose the right employee the first time and to make hires who can hit the ground running—employees who come ready to perform and make an impact.

Meeting those three critical challenges is the mission of UNCF’s Student Professional Development Programs (SPDP) a collaboratively designed implemented and administered set of programs working with supportive corporate partners. The SPDP works to provide diverse students the preparation and support they need to succeed in college familiarize themselves with the professional path on which they will soon embark and prepare themselves to be competitive candidates for future employers after graduation. UNCF has deep experience and demonstrated success in each phase of the work involved in SPDP program design and implementation.

UNCF knows how to get students—especially high-potential diverse students from first-generation and low-income families—to and through college.

More than 460000 students have earned degrees from UNCF’s member historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

UNCF-member HBCUs have a higher average six-year graduation rate than non-HBCUs for comparable student bases.

African American recipients of UNCF scholarships have a 70 percent six-year graduation rate nearly double the graduation rate of all African American students (38 percent) and significantly higher than the rate for all students.

UNCF has worked closely with some of the nation’s leading firms and foundations to shape and execute internship programs including both stand-alone internship programs and internship-and-scholarship programs. UNCF SPDP partners include Anthem Carnival Cruise Lines Association of American Publishers Intel The Walt Disney Company Wells Fargo and the Walton Family Foundation.

UNCF has developed a menu of internship components from which partners can select—and can revise to suit their needs—in shaping their customized programs. Components include but are not limited to:

Student Recruitment/Identification

Interview Preparation

Career Coaching

Online Community/Career Curriculum

Mentorship Program

So what exactly is a neobank? I would define it as any service that holds your money. Many neobanks exist in the space between traditional banks and check cashing or payday loans even if that isn’t really how their marketing portrays them. They started to become popular over a decade ago though they weren’t called neobanks back then. It began when retailers and non-financial-institutions started getting into financial services. An example that stands out is Wal-Mart partnering with Green Dot and offering some light banking services to their customers and employees. Likewise some neobanks today partner with traditional banking institutions behind the scenes.

More attractive to a younger generation

Neobanks are popular among younger consumers because the old model of traditional banking doesn’t make sense for the post-millennial generation. For example they don’t often or at least not yet feel the need to have multiple accounts in the way people in their 30s or older may have a checking account savings account and money market account or even possibly a stock trading account. This may change over time as the generation most often targeted by neobank marketing start building their savings and long-term financial plans.

In terms of marketing these neobanks often focus on a younger demographic. They seem friendlier and more “human” than say a Wells Fargo or Bank of America which tend to skew more aspirational in their messaging. To attract customers some neobanks may also try to add a veneer of social messaging whether it’s environmental or social justice.

Why “risky” may not be a problem

Neobanks are often considered a “riskier” approach to investing than traditional banking. For example one risk associated with neobanks is that assets may not be insured through a program like the FDIC. This however wasn’t a major issue during the 2008 financial crisis so it may be that today’s newest bank customers aren’t worried about it. This is certainly not the case with stock and crypto trading apps though which are riskier and tied to the market rather than the financial solvency of the bank itself.

Some neobanks like Robinhood combine regulated and unregulated financial services in one place. Consumers should always read the fine print and figure out which investments best fit their risk profile -- crypto being at the least regulated and riskiest and cash in an FDIC-insured account being highly regulated and stable.

That said these apps make it really easy for individual investors to dip their toes in the water of investing in intangible assets. It’s substantially easier now for a Robinhood user for example to buy a fraction of a stock or try investing in cryptocurrencies. This is a huge democratisation of investment opportunities and it’s also something that traditional banks can’t offer.

For younger adults who can’t or won’t be able to buy a home they may find these potentially riskier investments more attractive as well and may have more capital to experiment with.

Overlapping customer segments

The idea that these neobanks serve the “underbanked” -- and therefore don’t overlap in their customer base with traditional banks -- may be overhyped. It’s true that it’s certainly more convenient than going to a bank branch to open an account and fill out a form (or filling one out online) but traditional banks generally don’t require much more information than say Cash App or Venmo. Neobanks still need to comply with US laws including identity verification anti-money laundering and know your customer rules.

They also often offer lower or fewer fees and sometimes higher interest rates on their checking and savings accounts because of their lower overhead costs which can be appealing to a broader consumer segment. Luckily this has forced some traditional banks to get competitive with their fees as well so it’s been a win-win for consumers overall.

Customer service may be Achilles Heel

One perhaps surprising area where traditional banks still may edge out neobanks? Customer service. Granted there are plenty of horror stories for both. But with a conventional bank there’s often a physical branch a customer can visit if they have an issue. With neobanks you may not even be able to call someone when you encounter a problem. Before customers sign up they should see what their customer support options are -- and see what the app store customer reviews say.

In conclusion it’s fair to say that neobanks are here to stay. They’re an excellent option for consumers and they have revolutionised investing in particular. As these neobanks evolve and their customer base ages and starts to accumulate more wealth traditional banks should get worried. The switching cost of moving banks isn’t tremendously high but it’s also not just a few clicks. And if customers are used to say free stock trades they probably won’t suddenly get comfortable paying for them without some robust and clearly articulated benefits.

This particular case going by the name of “The People of the State of California v. Purdue Pharma” started in 2014. The judge’s ruling noted that neither party requested a trial by jury. The trial took place before the judge between April 19 2021 and July 27 2021. Both sides rested their cases as of July 27 2021. Closing arguments took place on September 30 2021 and October 1 2021. The entire trial was conducted by way of Zoom. Tons of opioid cases like this one currently flood various jurisdictions of our nation. One concluded this summer in my home state of West Virginia. The judgment is still out on that one.

On November 1 the Honorable Peter Wilson issued his 46-page “Tentative Decision” in the California case wherein he ruled against “The People of California” (the collective name for the Plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit) and in favor of Purdue Pharma and the other drug companies named in the $50 billion dollar case.

Here’s a nutshell of a causality portion of his decision:

Judge Wilson’s ruling said:

The Plaintiffs contend that each defendant engaged in an aggressive false and/or misleading marketing scheme designed to increase and which succeeded in increasing the writing of prescriptions for defendants’ opioid medications and that the increased prescriptions have caused or contributed to the opioid crisis being experienced in California … The opioid crisis constitutes the public nuisance that plaintiffs seek to abate in their third cause of action. The alleged false and/or misleading marketing constitutes the false advertising which forms the basis for the first and second causes of action.

The burden of proof was on the Plaintiffs to prove the following:

False advertising Unlawful business practices. This included unlawful unfair or fraudulent business practices or unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising. Public nuisance. This was defined as affecting “an entire community or neighborhood or any considerable number of persons.”

The judge said there was “no dispute that the ‘interference with collective social interests’ caused by the abuse of opioids was ‘substantial.’” He emphasized that the plaintiffs had to prove that the defendant’s contribution was “unreasonable” in that the harms outweigh the benefits. They also had to prove that the contribution of the defendants was “more than ‘negligible or theoretical.’” The judge said the plaintiffs failed to prove the interference was unreasonable as defined by the legal precedent. He said the plaintiffs failed to prove the interference was more than “negligible or theoretical.”

In a nutshell and on my reading of it the judge said that by nature (of being Federally Controlled Schedule II medicines) these opioids have known risks including potential for abuse and addiction and they are medically necessary for some patients. Additionally he said some patients can get addicted to them even if they are used as prescribed.

As the number of prescriptions goes up the number of overdoses opioid deaths abuses and misuses goes up. These same numbers go up with increased doses. He agreed with that. The judge added that the California Legislature adopted measures including the Patients’ Bill of Rights of 1997 which saw that patients who needed opioids for pain could get them from clinicians without clinicians risking discipline.

He detailed the various prongs of the code that assured that the patients who needed these meds could readily get them from clinicians without the clinicians’ fear of discipline and that they are potentially medically necessary medicines that patients and health care practitioners should have access to the proper prescription of.

He then went on to say that it would be difficult to sort out which “marketing and promotion” (and note: I am staying out of the “false and misleading” verbiage of the document right there) led to medically appropriate increased opioid use versus which “marketing and promotion” led to increased medically inappropriate opioid use. He said the plaintiffs did not distinguish between these two increases and “Plaintiffs ask the court to infer that the rise in prescriptions generally must logically also have resulted in the rise of medically inappropriate prescriptions. But there is no evidence other than the rise itself from which this court can reasonably draw such an inference.

And even if the court could reasonably infer that false or misleading marketing must have caused some medically inappropriate prescriptions to be written no evidence before the court enables it to conclude without rank speculation whether the number or volume of such medically inappropriate prescriptions contributed to the alleged public nuisance and if so to what extent.”

The judge pointed out that the plaintiffs themselves called the opioid crisis “multifaceted.” They identified various players in the crisis including manufacturers distributors pharmacies doctors the illegal drug trade the FDA the DEA and the state. Because the plaintiffs acknowledged this without any evidence to show exact portions of causality amounts of each that the judge would not be able to assuredly delineate how much of a causal role these drug companies played. So he noted he would not be able to say whether their causal role was any more than “negligible or theoretical.” He said that if he said that their role was greater than that he would be speculating. Thus his ruling.

Over half a million Americans have died from opioids since 2001. The Purdue Pharma founding family and former owners of the Oxycontin producing company the Sacklers won immunity from these lawsuits just a few months before this California verdict. Forbes Magazine declared the Sackler family’s worth at 13 billion dollars in 2016. As part of their immunity proceedings they would pay 4.3 billion dollars. They maintain they’ve done nothing wrong even in the face of their company’s guilty pleas in 2007 and 2020 to criminal wrongdoing in marketing oxycontin. Judge Drain who oversaw the recent bankruptcy proceedings did not order the family to apologize for the crisis saying “A forced apology is not really an apology.”

No it’s not Judge Drain. As someone who is kind of big on valuing the words “I’m sorry” I agree with you there.

I am curious what other doctors who have ever prescribed opioids think about this verdict and this national flood of blame and money moving and this opioid fallout. I hear very little about it on medical news platforms like this one.

For me my own personal stories of opioid patients come to mind including one who keyed my car when I stopped prescribing his opioid after an acute injury. I think of some local opioid overdose deaths in my community. I would love to hear what other doctors and clinicians have to say about these issues like the “not responsible” verdict and the Sackler family running away liability-free and still worth billions of dollars. Does anybody feel like the opioid companies were pushy in the ‘90s and 2000s? Were they in the right? Is the California ruling in line with the common good? Are our prescribing practices under scrutiny? What runs through our heads right now doctors? I would love to know.

One of the largest and most productive sawmills in Kootenai County was built by Edward Rutledge owner of the Rutledge Lumber and Manufacturing Co. in Rutledge Minn. Frederick Weyerhaeuser also had a major interest in the Rutledge company. In 1901 Rutledge sent his assistant Frank J. Davies to Spokane to purchase timberland and set up a new branch of the company in North Idaho. By 1903 Davis had acquired more than 25000 acres for the company. He also purchased a mill site on the north shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene at the east end of the city of Coeur d'Alene and announced plans to build a large lumber manufacturing plant in 1905. However the plans were altered several times and the mill did not materialize until 1915.

The new company first known as the Edward Rutledge Lumber Co. was completed and began operations April 1 1916. Frank Davies became secretary of the company and Huntington Taylor an experienced lumberman from Wisconsin was made plant manager. When Davies died in 1917 Taylor became the general manager. He held that position until 1928. He was succeeded by George F. Jewett grandson of Frederick Weyerhaeuser. Jewett later became a top executive of Potlatch Forest Inc. In 1915 the Rutledge Timber Co. built a large home at 1501 E. Lakeshore Drive to house the company's managers. Today that house is known as the Jewett House.

From its beginning in 1916 up to 1930 the Rutledge Timber Co. was not a profitable organization. The Weyerhaeuser Co. which had an interest in four other large timber operations in North Idaho decided to merge the Rutledge Potlatch and Clearwater plants into one management unit. The Edward Rutledge Timber Co. in Coeur d’Alene in 1933 became the Rutledge Unit of Potlatch Forest Inc. From that date up to 1965 the Rutledge/Potlatch Co. produced 2.25 billion board feet of lumber the largest of any company in Kootenai County. However during the 1970s and '80s the economic situation changed for the worse. In 1987 the Rutledge Unit was sold to the Hagadone Corporation and in early 1988 the last log was run through the mill. Today The Coeur d'Alene Resort Golf Course is located on the site of the original Edward Rutledge Lumber Co.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Special to the Detroit Free Press

When times were most challenging during 2021 ongoing communication produced employee comfort for Matick Automotive Group says Molly Williams chief operating officer. And in the process her company earned the No. 3 ranking among midsize companies in the Detroit Free Press Top Workplaces competition.

[ Top Workplaces 2021: | Summary | Winners | Methodology ]

“Paul Zimmermann (vice president/partner-owner) and I did videos regularly to let our team members know what we were doing and why to maintain a clean safe workplace” Williams said.

“The videos allowed us to keep up with our team in real time which has been critical to our success. We want to be a place where our employees and customers feel comfortable about coming in and feel better about their day when they leave and timely communication helped us to accomplish that goal on the employee side.”

Williams explained that the company’s commitment to communication also promotes trust and cooperation among her team members.

“We have a great group of people and when we needed to roll out new rules and guidelines our team was able to adjust and adapt quickly and willingly” said Williams who described instances during the pandemic when safety compliance changes had to be made with only a day’s notice. “Our team members had the courage and willingness to come to work when a lot of people were at home. I am proud and grateful for our team; my inspiration comes from this group.”

Williams continued her praise by referring to her team as “frontline workers” because of their importance to the lives of the people they serve.

“People need their cars and they take it for granted that they can get their cars fixed when needed” said Williams whose company operates George Matick Chevrolet and Mattick Auto Wash in Redford Township along with Matick Toyota in Macomb Township.

“At Matick Automotive we have a group of people that are here to serve the needs of our customers so our customers can get back to work. And our team is willing to do this day in and day out no matter what.”

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Remember back in 2018 when gas prices were at record levels and we started seeing gas surcharges pop up?

Well are you ready for supply chain surcharges?

Sherwin Williams has instituted a 4% surcharge citing increased costs.

Construction company owner Brennan Dougherty said he only noticed the extra cost when he looked at his receipt after buying paint.

""Wow they're just flat out busting it out on the receipt 4%"" said Dougherty. ""Obviously if it was a bigger job it affects you a lot more. But 4% on a million dollar job is $40000.""

Experts say we can expect to see supply chain disruption until at least early next year so other companies may soon do the same.

""Who pays for that? The customer? Do we take it out of our percentage?"" Dougherty asked. ""It's hard to say. That wasn't there when we bid the job.""

ST. PETERSBURG Fla. — The global supply chain is still recovering from interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Shortages coupled with increasing demand are driving prices up on many goods.

But are some companies passing on rising costs to consumers through additional fees?

Several people on social media are posting pictures of their receipts specifically from Sherwin-Williams showing they were charged a “supply chain surcharge.”

THE QUESTION

Are companies adding surcharges on some goods and services due to ongoing supply chain issues?

THE SOURCES

Seckin Ozkul  director Supply Chain Innovation Lab at the University of South Florida

 director Supply Chain Innovation Lab at the University of South Florida Sherwin-Williams

FedEx

Harley-Davidson via MarketScreener

THE ANSWER

Yes companies like Sherwin-Williams are tacking on surcharges due to ongoing supply chain issues.

WHAT WE FOUND

The CEO of Sherwin-Williams the largest paint company in the U.S. warned investors in September the company was dealing with rising manufacturing costs due to waning availability of raw materials.

""The persistent and industry-wide raw material availability constraints and pricing inflation we have previously reported have worsened” Sherwin-Williams Chief Executive John Morikis said.

“We do not expect to see improved supply or lower raw material pricing in our fourth quarter as anticipated.”

A photo of a notice purportedly posted at the entrance of a Sherwin-Williams store says the surcharge is “due to increased costs associated with transportation freight and labor.”

A statement from the company confirms this “We have announced a 4 percent surcharge in The Americas Group effective September 20 through the end of the year.”

Seckin Ozkul the director of the University of South Florida’s Supply Chain Innovation Lab says what’s happening to the supply chain now started during the pandemic.

“We’ve never had such a big disruption before to our supply chain such as the pandemic” he said.

Quick drastic changes in demand over the past two years have had ripple effects up the supply chain. Those ripple effects according to Ozkul only get more dramatic the higher you go on the chain — known as the “bullwhip effect.”

It’s why we’re seeing backlogged shipping ports Ozkul explains. It’s a lot of the goods that had been held up now finally ready all at once with nowhere to go.

Not being able to get the products to store shelves in a timely manner is partly what’s driving up costs and some companies are passing the increase onto you. But it’s likely temporary he said.

“The surcharge is just another way of saying we are incurring additional costs and somebody needs to pay for it sorry we’re not going to pay for it” Ozkul said.

Ozkul says surcharges are not a new concept. When jet fuel costs go up airlines frequently pass those costs onto customers in the form of a fuel surcharge.

Other companies are doing it too. Harley-Davidson said squeezed inventory and higher raw material costs drove the company to increase surcharge pricing in the United States to offset costs.

Consumers are also doling out more for certain FedEx shipments. The carrier added a fuel surcharge which went into effect on certain deliveries at the start of November.

So why not just increase the price?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20va2luZy1yaWNoYXJkLXNjcmliZS16YWNoLWJheWxpbi0yMzM1NDUwNTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'King Richard' Scribe Zach Baylin Says Venus & Serena Williams Called Warner Bros Drama “Frighteningly Accurate ...,"With King Richard director Reinaldo Marcus Green and screenwriter Zach Baylin looked to tell the story of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams and of the parents who spurred them to greatness honing in less on the public record of the sisters’ accomplishments in the sports world and more on lesser-known aspects of their personal history.

“There are many iconic moments in their life and I think we worked hard to try to find the moments we didn’t know” said Baylin during Deadline’s Contenders Film: Los Angeles award-season event. “Really what happened inside the house and not just the SportsCenter highlights of their life and career.”

King Richard sees Will Smith portraying Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams’ (Demi Singleton) undeterred father Richard who was instrumental in helping the extraordinarily gifted athletes to fulfill their potential. Driven by a clear vision of their future and using unconventional methods Richard has a plan that will take Venus and Serena from the streets of Compton to the global stage.

‘King Richard’ Stars Will Smith Aunjanue Ellis To Receive Santa Barbara Film Festival Outstanding Performers Of The Year Award

On Sunday onstage at the DGA Theater Green reflected on his own experience coming of age as an athlete and how that informed his understanding of the Williams sisters’ journey. “I grew up with a father kind of like Richard” the director noted. “I knew what it was like to be out there striving for something.”

Green also noted that even if the film’s title pays tribute to Richard the Williams owe just as much of their success to their mother Oracene played by Aunjanue Ellis who was “the backbone” of the family.

Later in the conversation Baylin and Green were asked about the feedback they’ve received from the Williams family. While Baylin admitted that it was “fairly terrifying” to meet with them and pitch his take on the project in the early stages he also said that Venus and Serena “have spoken very highly” of the film calling it “a frighteningly accurate portrayal” of their coming-of-age story—which of course was gratifying.

Jon Bernthal Tony Goldwyn Dylan McDermott Andy Bean Kevin Dunn and Craig Tate also star in the film produced by Tim White and Trevor White via their Star Thrower Entertainment banner and Smith under his Westbrook banner. Serena and Venus Williams exec produced the project alongside their sister Isha Price. Its other executive producers are James Lassiter Jada Pinkett Smith Adam Merims Lynn Harris Allan Mandelbaum Jon Mone and Peter Dodd.

Warner Bros will release King Richard in U.S. theaters November 19. The drama will also be available to stream on HBO Max (via their Ad-Free Plan) for 31 days following its theatrical release.

The 5980-square-foot residence at 428 Saint Paul St. listed on Oct. 25.

Bill Barrett founder of Bill Barrett Corp. — an energy firm that has been rebranded following mergers — purchased the land with his late wife Louise in 2007 for $1.2 million later transferring it to a trust according to property records.

Listing agent Jeff Hendley of Compass said Barrett has not lived in the home for years although it has been occupied. Barrett and his late wife also purchased the property next door at 444 Saint Paul St. for $4.1 million in 2006 records show but that home is not for sale.

The four-bedroom six-bathroom home on the market was custom built in 2009 by John J. Lewis of Clearwater LLC. It features three primary suites an enormous second-level deck that “can easily host a group of 30 people” heated floors throughout and elevator access to all three levels according to the listing.

“First of all I think it’s on one of the best streets in Cherry Creek North” Hendley said. “There are beautiful trees along the block and it’s far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city.”

Barrett founded Bill Barrett Corp. in 2002 after his previous energy company Barrett Resources was acquired by the Williams Companies. Bill Barrett Corp. went public in 2004 and Barrett stepped down as CEO in 2006 leaving his son Fred to take over.

In 2017 Bill Barrett Corp. merged with Fifth Creek Energy in a deal valued at $649 million and was renamed HighPoint Resources Corp which subsequently merged with Denver-based Bonanza Creek Energy.

Address: 428 Saint Paul St. Denver

Listing price: $4.25 million

Stats: The two-story home includes 3743 square feet above ground level plus a nearly 2000-square-foot finished basement with a large bedroom and full kitchen.

The finer things: Before it was listed the sellers completed a $30000 smart home upgrade including updating its Control 4 and Lutron systems. There are vaulted ceilings and eight-foot tall doors throughout and the William Ohs kitchen features hardwood and limestone floors.

“One of the main focuses or desires of the seller was to have a solid quality house that kept the noise out” Hendley said.

The recovery in casino gambling in Macao always seems to be just around the corner but it never quite arrives. Yet another plunge in monthly gambling revenue in October shows the rebound remains over the horizon and makes Las Vegas casinos the better bet.

For those resort operators like Las Vegas Sands (LVS -1.40%) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN -0.82%) that make most or virtually all of their money from the Chinese enclave the losing streak is going to hurt for some time to come.

In contrast the likes of MGM Resorts International (MGM -0.69%) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR -3.00%) which rely primarily upon Las Vegas and other regional U.S. gambling markets that are playing a hot hand should be where investors put their money.

Macao's not the odds-on favorite

Macao's reported gross gambling revenue (GGR) last month tumbled to just 4.3 billion patacas which is the local currency and is the equivalent of around $544 million a 40% drop compared to last year and almost 26% below what the city took in the month prior.

It's the only place where it's legal to gamble in China and Beijing has been watching the money flow in and out of the casinos with a wary eye. Over the years it has imposed increasingly stringent regulations on casinos gamblers and the junket operators who ferry VIPs to and from the peninsula while lending them money to gamble.

The pandemic exacerbated the situation as virtually all travel to the city was closed. And outbreaks of COVID-19 variants have led nearby provinces where most of the travel to Macao originates to restrict travel once more.

Las Vegas Sands sold all of its U.S.-based properties to go all-in on Asian markets which at this point is essentially just Macao. It reported third-quarter revenue of $857 million last month. While that is nearly double the $446 million it took in for the same period in 2020 it remains far below the $3.2 billion it generated in 2019.

Similarly Wynn Resorts just reported third-quarter revenue of $995 million and while that's below the $1.6 billion realized two years ago it is not as bad as what Sands experienced because of Wynn's Las Vegas operations which represented almost half of this quarter's revenue. Typically Macao accounts for two thirds to three quarters of Wynn's net revenue.

Viva Las Vegas!

In contrast casino operators with a greater U.S. presence are seeing a rebound. MGM Resorts saw revenue surge 140% year over year to $2.7 billion this past quarter which is only 18% below 2019's $3.3 billion total. But more importantly its Las Vegas adjusted property EBITDAR (earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and restructuring or rent costs) was 21% higher than two years ago and regional casino EBITDAR was 29% higher.

And Caesars generated $2.7 billion in the third quarter versus $1.4 billion last year (because it merged with Eldorado Resorts in July 2020 there's no comparison to 2019).

In short Las Vegas and various regional markets have done away with most restrictions on casinos such as mask mandates and capacity restraints which led gamblers to flow back into the resorts. And as vaccinations proliferate even with the potential need for booster shots to follow consumers are more comfortable being in large crowded venues again.

Don't double down on Macao

Macao was once the world's biggest gambling market and it might eventually regain such status. Yet with the possibility of Japan opening its doors to casinos in the next few years along with Singapore and other Asian markets expanding their own gambling opportunities high rollers might find these other venues more attractive since they won't be under the government microscope Macao faces.

For investors looking for top casino growth stocks MGM Resorts or Caesars seem like winning hands as do regional players like Boyd Gaming or Penn National Gaming.

The odds are against those resort operators that call China home even figuratively and should probably be avoided.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2NyaW1lL2NvdXJ0cy9uZXctZGV0YWlscy1lbWVyZ2UtaW4td29tYW5zLW11bHRpbWlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItZXh0b3J0aW9uLWNhc2UtMjQ3ODI3NS_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9jcmltZS9jb3VydHMvbmV3LWRldGFpbHMtZW1lcmdlLWluLXdvbWFucy1tdWx0aW1pbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLWV4dG9ydGlvbi1jYXNlLTI0NzgyNzUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New details emerge in woman’s multimillion-dollar extortion case,"A woman is accused of extorting $12 million from a Las Vegas businessman and authorities have gone to great lengths to conceal the man’s identity.

A woman accused of extorting $12 million from a Las Vegas businessman by threatening to reveal his personal secrets received cryptocurrency luxury vehicles and an interest in a $1.8 million property at Mount Charleston according to police and court records.

Ava Blige 30 of Las Vegas was charged Sept. 30 with 27 felonies in the case. Authorities meanwhile have gone to great lengths to conceal the businessman’s identity.

The man’s name was blacked out in a declaration of warrant. Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Karen Bennett-Haron recently sealed an original criminal complaint in the case at the request of Clark County prosecutors after the document included his name. And attorneys for the Metropolitan Police Department have identified the man only as a “male individual” in a civil filing that seeks to confiscate cryptocurrency vehicles and jewelry paid to Blige.

District Court filings meanwhile indicate that a Las Vegas businessman Christopher Terry has sued Blige over a business deal involving a Mount Charleston property and payments made to keep his personal information confidential.

Blige’s former civil attorneys described Terry in court records as a co-owner of a global financial services company International Markets Live or imarketslive. The company offers products and training to traders in the currency market futures and financial markets.

Three attorneys from the law firm Holland & Hart which sued Blige on behalf of Terry either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on this story.

Attempts to contact Terry directly for comment were not successful.

Blige has denied any wrongdoing in her criminal case. She and her attorney Max Berkley of the Clark County public defender’s office have declined comment about the charges against her.

Report of extortion

A Metro police warrant for Blige states that a detective with the Summerlin area command was contacted in October 2020 by an attorney who wanted to report an extortion. The attorney said the client was out of the country in Dubai at the time.

The warrant released by Las Vegas Justice Court on Wednesday identified the victim only as “Christopher.” His last name was blacked out in the report. The attorney whose last name also was blacked out told police his client employed Blige at his company in 2016 and that the two “were in a relationship until August of 2019.”

“After separating Blige became very upset and began to make threats towards (the accuser)” police wrote. “(The attorney) explained (his client) wanted the separation to be on good terms therefore (he) provided funding and gifts to Blige.”

Over time the attorney said the payments to Blige were not good enough for her and she started threatening to release personal information about her lover if he failed to pay her.

“She would expose his company and it would ‘be worse than what Steve Wynn went through’” police wrote adding that the attorney said his client had paid Blige about $12 million.

Wynn stepped down as CEO and chairman of Wynn Resorts in February 2018 after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual harassment. He denied any wrongdoing.

Police held a videoconference with the man who claimed he had been extorted by Blige and he said he first hired her as an assistant but she was fired because of laziness. She then was hired as a personal assistant and was paid $4000 a month. Blige also was “learning how to manage the trade market” police wrote.

A romantic relationship between the two started in September 2017 according to the report.

A stormy relationship

The businessman told police he soon noticed that the couple would fight if he failed to give Blige money to purchase clothes jewelry and cars.

“She would tell him he made her that way so she had to live a certain lifestyle and he needed to pay for it” police wrote. “She became extremely controlling as the relationship continued.”

The man said he cut off the relationship by 2019 although “he did want to continue to help her with trading and be friends.”

He told police that Blige started threatening to post information “she had learned during private conversations they had when they were dating if he didn’t give her money.”

The accuser told police that Blige claimed to have recordings of him talking about his business partners.

“Some of the things he would say would be racially sensitive complain about certain people’s character and comments which would be concerning to one of his largest partners” police wrote.

The businessman told police he was from New York and at one point worked for a construction company that was “run by the mob” according to the report.

“He also told Blige about the secrets and layout of his business practices” police wrote. “Some of this information which was told to Blige in confidence wasn’t even known by his biggest business partners.”

Recorded conversations

The businessman went on to tell police that when he would not give Blige money she claimed she had recorded all their conversations including Apple FaceTime talks between the two.

“If his business partners or people in the trade community were to hear or see him speak the way he spoke about them they would leave and it would eventually cause his business to fail” police wrote.

Police ultimately reviewed the contents of the man’s phones and found 25000 text communications between him and Blige. At one point according to the warrant Blige told the businessman: “whatever Ava wants Ava gets.”

The man told Blige she could have a Mount Charleston residence after a lease expired on the property but Blige still posted embarrassing photos of the man on Instagram according to police who said she claimed to have 8000 photos she could distribute publicly.

Civil filings against Blige

In March Terry filed suit against Blige in District Court over a leaseback interest in a property in the 4900 block of Cougar Ridge Trail. The property according to the lawsuit and a Zillow listing is at Mount Charleston and is worth approximately $1.8 million. A notice of default against Blige was subsequently filed in the case according to court records.

Two months earlier District Court records show that an individual initially identified only as John Doe also sued Blige. The suit was filed by the same attorneys who sued Blige on behalf of Terry. It alleges that Blige and the anonymous CEO of an anonymous company that specializes in educating customers about financial instruments and trading markets were in an intermittent yearslong relationship.

The unnamed CEO according to the lawsuit ended up paying Blige “hundreds of thousands if not millions in cash cryptocurrency cars and real estate” in exchange for not disclosing personal information Blige had about the executive. The suit lists cryptocurrency transfers to Blige that were worth at least $3.4 million at the beginning of 2021.

According to the suit the unnamed CEO bought a lot of expensive vehicles and property “at the demands” of Blige. They included a 2016 Mercedes-Benz G Class worth $106000 a 2017 Ferrari 488 worth $239207 a 2017 Audi R8 valued at $143143 a 2017 Land Rover worth $117000 a Mount Charleston home worth $1.8 million and a property near Valley View Boulevard and Warm Springs Road valued at $775000.

At one point in the civil case attorneys for the unnamed CEO attempted to have segments of the litigation sealed. Blige’s attorneys in related filings then claimed that the anonymous CEO was Terry and that he had presented a “manufactured extortion plot” to silence Blige.

Blige’s civil attorneys also wrote in one motion that the items purchased for her were gifts from the CEO and that the suit was brought for the purposes of harassing Blige. However a notice of default against Blige was also listed in court records in the case.

In October of this year attorneys for Metro filed a civil forfeiture action for $640000 plus multiple crypto coins and vehicles. The only known claimant to the materials police were seeking to seize is listed in the filing as “Ava Blige.”

The Metro filing states that the assets were seized and subject to forfeiture after a “male individual” engaged in a personal relationship with Blige who then demanded she be paid to keep the man’s personal information private.

“Male individual transferred the equivalent of at least 100 Bitcoins to Blige or other cryptocurrencies” according to the filing.

Blige has not responded to the Metro forfeiture filing.

A preliminary hearing in Blige’s criminal case is set for Dec. 8.

It’s been two weeks since Halloween but Emily Mayfield still wanted to show off her outfit as well as her husband’s outfit as well.

A few days ago the wife of Cleveland Browns QB Baker Mayfield took to Instagram and showed off her NSFW costume that had both of them pixilated with some appropriately placed cardboard.

“#FLASHbackfriday to Halloween – just a couple of streakers creepy stache and all!” she wrote on Instagram.

Extremely well done.

Mayfield may be having fun in that photot but he is certainly having a terrible time playing the Patriots on Sunday as the team is currently down double digits in thye second half.

Two years after the tribe received federal recognition in 1936 the Army Corps of Engineers installed a lock-and-dam system just to the south along the Mississippi River. It repeatedly flooded the tribe’s land including burial mounds leaving members with only 300 livable acres.

Decades later a stockpile of nuclear waste from a power plant next to the reservation which the federal government reneged on a promise to remove in the 1990s has tripled in size. It comes within 600 yards of some residents’ homes.

With no room to develop more housing on the reservation more than 150 tribal members who are eager to live in their ancestral home are on a waiting list.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20vbWlubmVzb3RhLXNwb3J0cy9mb3VyLWNoYW1waW9ucy1jcm93bmVkLWF0LXN0YXRlLXZvbGxleWJhbGwtdG91cm5hbWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four champions crowned at state volleyball tournament,"The 2021 Minnesota high school volleyball season came to a close with four championship teams crowned Saturday at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul.

The first championship match was in Class 1A where Mayer Lutheran defeated Minneota 3-0 (25-15 25-20 25-18). It was Mayer Lutheran’s fourth state volleyball title.

In Class 2A Sauk Centre claimed their first state championship with a 3-1 (13-25 25-21 25-17 25-19) win against Jackson County Central. Jenna Gapinski-Vogt and Emma Kittelson each had 11 kills for Sauk Centre.

Perennial powerhouse Marshall earned their 7th state championship beating Kasson-Mantorville 3-0 (27-25 25-22 25-16). Tessa Gannott led all players with 15 kills and finished the night with a .464 hitting percentage.

Closing out the night in St. Paul top-seeded Wayzata defeated East Ridge 3-1 in the Class 4A championship. The Trojans also won the 2019 state title so they are officially back-to-back champs since there was not a tournament in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1udm9sbGV5YmFsbGh1Yi5jb20vbmV3c19hcnRpY2xlL3Nob3cvMTE5Mzk2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Class 4A championship: Wayzata finishes off undefeated season with win over East Ridge,"Wayzata closed out a season that can only be called one of the best in state history with a four-set 25-22 25-17 23-25 25-19 victory over East Ridge on Saturday in the state volleyball tournament’s Class 4A championship match.

The Trojans finished 34-0 for the season and have won 54 consecutive matches since 2019 when they won their first large-school championship.

“And how about this one: 53 in a row best-of-five. We haven’t lost a five-set match since 2018” said Wayzata coach Scott Jackson.

Avery Jesewitz led four Wayzata hitters in double figures in kills with 14. Stella Swenson had a whopping 55 set assists and libero Ella Voegele had 22 digs and 15 serve receives.

“Avery had her best match of the season for us” Jackson said. “And Stella was the stud she always is.

Two sophomores making all kinds of plays. We’re excited about the future with those guys.”

East Ridge making its first state tournament appearance since 2010 finished 23-10. Outside hitter Britt Carlson had 15 kills and Cam Greenwald added 10.

As it has all season Wayzata had to withstand an early onslaught from its fired-up opponent.

East Ridge built a 6-1 lead in the first set with setter Macey Spolidoro setting four different players for early kills.

But Wayzata calmly worked its way back and earned a close 25-22 victory

“I think it gave us a little motivation honestly” Carlson said. “We just weren’t able to pull through.

The Trojans then turned to the thing that makes them special: their wealth of talent.

Ella Voegele and Sophia Johnson dug and passed with precision and setter Stella Swenson deftly managed their exceptional collection of front-row hitters. The Trojans controlled the second set. They rarely let East Ridge have more than two points in a row and took a 2-0 lead with a 25-17 victory.

“We believe in each other” Voegele said. “We know what each other can do. That’s why we’re so good. We earn things. We’re not handed things.

East Ridge came out in the third set with renewed purpose winning 25-23. It was just the seventh set the Trojans lost all season.

East Ridge had lost to Wayzata in three sets early in the season.

“That was a completely different team even from the semifinals that we watched” Jackson said all of his players nodding in agreement. “They really came at us from the outset. It’s more satisfying to win that kind of match.”

Wayzata rebounded in the fourth and final set building a lead that ballooned to as many as eight before finishing off the match with a 25-19 victory.

“It feels so good” senior Sierra Moore said. “Everyone wanted to be the team to take us out. We got to show that we are the team that deserves to have this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzEzLzMtc3RvY2tzLXRoYXQtY291bGQtd2luLWJpZy11bmRlci1iaWRlbnMtaW5mcmFzdHJ1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks That Could Win Big Under Biden's Infrastructure Bill,"These stocks should benefit as the infrastructure bill becomes law.

After lots of debate and delay the infrastructure bill is on its way to President Joe Biden who will sign it into law. The $1 trillion spending package will provide funding for roads bridges ports rail water the electric grid broadband internet and so much more. It should provide a significant long-term boost to the U.S. economy.

The spending package should also boost the fortunes of companies focused on infrastructure. Three infrastructure stocks that these Fool.com contributors see as big beneficiaries are Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF -0.74%) Xcel Energy (XEL 0.40%) and United Rentals (URI 1.29%). Here's why they could be long-term winners as the U.S. makes a major investment to upgrade its aging infrastructure.

Leveraged to increased demand

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Cleveland-Cliffs): Over the past couple of years Cleveland-Cliffs has turned itself from a steel industry supplier into an integrated steelmaker that also sells key competitors iron ore pellets and other steelmaking inputs. Its core steelmaking assets are largely blast furnaces which create primary steel from iron ore. This is a capital-intensive process that requires high utilization rates in order to turn a profit. But if the infrastructure bill heats up demand that shouldn't be a big issue. Notably when operating at high rates blast furnaces are often more profitable than the electric arc mini-mills that underpin competitors like Nucor.

At the same time as its mills are doing well Cleveland-Cliffs could also be benefiting from increased demand for its steelmaking ingredients. Basically Cleveland-Cliffs wins and wins again as its customers which are also its steelmaking peers benefit. It is thus heavily leveraged to the elevated steel demand likely to come from increased infrastructure spending.

To be fair this isn't exactly news to Wall Street. Cleveland-Cliffs' stock is the best-performing North American steel mill over the past year. However thanks to the mergers used to create it the steelmaker also has the most leverage with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.3 times twice as high as the next competitor. But a good industry upturn can help generate the cash it needs to deal with its relatively weak balance sheet. And even if the stock doesn't continue to outdistance its peers it will have the opportunity to strengthen its industry position just the same.

Aligning its investment plan with the infrastructure bill

Matt DiLallo (Xcel Energy): The infrastructure package includes significant funding for the energy transition to cleaner alternatives. For example it features $7.5 billion for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and another $65 billion to improve the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid. The bill will also boost lower-carbon fuel sources like green hydrogen.

That aligns perfectly with Xcel Energy's investment plan. The utility has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is investing billions of dollars to achieve that bold goal.

In addition to investing heavily in renewable energy Xcel Energy is spending billions of dollars on upgrading its transmission system. It's also building EV infrastructure including installing charging stations in major transportation corridors and underserved communities. It sees the potential to invest $750 million on EV charging infrastructure in the 2022 to 2026 time frame and upward of an additional $1.7 billion in the back half of the decade. Meanwhile it sees significant potential in hydrogen. The company said it could invest up to $4 billion over the coming decade on hydrogen-related projects to blend that emissions-free fuel into its natural gas system.

The infrastructure bill should enhance Xcel's ability to make these investments. The company could tap into government-funded programs from the infrastructure bill to support its spending plans. That could enable it to achieve its decarbonization efforts while creating significant value for shareholders by growing its earnings and dividend.

Winning even before infrastructure spending kicks off

Neha Chamaria (United Rentals): Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill proposes huge investments into building roads bridges airports ports and clean energy. United Rentals' huge rental fleet serves all of these industries and more. In fact construction is at the core of United Rentals' business with its general rentals segment offering construction and industrial equipment and its trench power and fluid solutions segment offering specialty construction products and services.

As federal spending on infrastructure picks up so should demand for heavy machinery like the ones United Rentals rents out. In fact the company is already witnessing higher demand even before federal spending kicks off: In October while announcing its third-quarter numbers United Rentals raised the upper end of its 2021 revenue outlook to between $9.6 billion and $9.75 billion and expects to generate cash from operations worth $3.55 billion at the midpoint versus its earlier projection of $3.45 billion. Growth of 22% in its third-quarter rental revenue encouraged United Rentals to upgrade its outlook.

As the largest equipment rentals company in North America with 13% market share with a fleet of nearly 770000 machines presence in 49 states in the U.S. a highly diversified customer base and an acquisitive growth strategy to expand its footprint United Rentals looks well positioned to win as infrastructure spending in the U.S. gathers steam.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ2Jtd29sdmVyaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzEzL25vLTItbWljaGlnYW4taG9ja2V5LXN3ZWVwcy1uby0xOS1wZW5uLXN0YXRlLWF0LXN0YXRlLWNvbGxlZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No. 2 Michigan hockey sweeps No. 19 Penn State at State College,Next.

In una nota la clinica Mediterranea di via Orazio a Napoli la definisce con un pizzico di ironia la nuova ""collega"" dei medici dell'Unità Operativa di Ortopedia. Si chiama Rosa Knee e non è una persona bensì un robot di ultimissima generazione che si differenzia da tutti gli altri sistemi computerizzati partecipando attivamente alle procedure. Si tratta di un elemento grazie al quale è stata eseguita una complessa operazione di chirurgia robotica in protesi articolare al ginocchio su una signora di 81 anni.

Il robot è prodotto dalla multinazionale statunitense Zimmer Biomet: è dotato fra le altre cose di una fotocamera e di localizzatori ottici posizionati sulla gamba del paziente in grado di costruire un un modello anatomico tridimensionale capace di inquadrare in modo esatto la posizione del ginocchio nello spazio. Il dispositivo è costituito da due unità posizionate rispettivamente su ciascun lato del tavolo operatorio: un’unità costituita da un braccio robotico compatto e e un’unità ottica entrambi con touchscreen.

Spiegano dalla clinica di Mergellina che Rosa Knee per la sua precisione può essere essere considerato un tecnico in più in sala operatoria:
