Health Canada is warning the public about risks associated with counterfeit N95 respirators being sold across the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since mid-February authorities have recovered nearly 330000 of the fake masks from Canadian distributors having detained an additional 365000 at the U.S. border.

The fake respirators “lack any assurance of safety quality and efficacy” the health agency said in a March 19 advisory.

“Respirators are essential during the COVID-19 pandemic. They help protect health care providers and slow the spread of the disease.”

The illegally-made products resemble legitimate N95 masks by using the brand of established medical manufacturer 3M.

Products with missing straps strange odours or blocked valves are likely not authentic 3M respirators the advisory said.

“It is illegal to sell or advertise counterfeit health products. The Department takes this issue seriously and will use all available tools to stop these activities.”

Health Canada has detected three fake respirator versions circulating the country – including ones made to appear as Health Care Particulate Respirator and Surgical Mask 1860 and the 1860S models.

Counterfeit versions of 3M’s Aura Health Care Particulate Respirator and Surgical Mask 1870+ have also been seized by border officials.

The public health agency said it’s working with the company to identify the source of the fakes and determine where they may have been distributed or sold within Canada

Penny Wise became president of 3M Canada on Feb. 18 2020 just as the COVID-19 virus was beginning to take hold in Canada. 3M had tackled health crises before but like most Canadians Wise had no idea how much the world was about to change.

Wise plunged into a logistics crash course as the pandemic gained momentum and demand surged for 3M’s Canadian-made cleaning products while the parent company began a global push to make two billion N95 respirators tripling production in a single year.

Leading 3M Canada through the pandemic has taught Wise that the country needs to rethink supply-chain self-sufficiency for products such as personal protective equipment. Manufacturers such as 3M are hoping that the past year has convinced Canadian policy-makers taxpayers and buyers to support local assembly lines after the pandemic exposed critical weakness in Canada’s supply chains.

“I think there’s a broader discussion to be had for manufacturers and businesses in Canada in general” says Wise who is working on a new 3M plant in Brockville Ont. to make N95 masks as Canadians rethink the trade-off between the variety and affordability of goods made overseas and the importance of domestic manufacturing.

“One of the things I think that we need to change and look at from a Canadian point of view is this idea of our industrial strategy. Canada is very much recognized as an international trading partner and we are very engaged in that …but what do we need in order to be self-sufficient as we move forward so that we can protect our population during a crisis?”

Other manufacturers also scrambled to fill cracks in the supply chain exposed by COVID-19. At General Motors’ plant in Oshawa Ont. COVID-19 was yet another upheaval for a workforce still reeling from the plant’s closure in late 2019 and subsequent reopening as a parts plant in the first quarter of 2020.

Ian Soutter who helped set up GM’s mask-making operation in Canada said his spouse a pharmacist struggled to get a steady supply of protective equipment in the early days of lockdown.

“A year ago I was in a very different role. I was a plant guy and pivoting to electric vehicles” says Soutter. “There is not much about welding painting or shooting screws into a truck that looks like this.”

But GM found that much of the machinery and logic behind making a mask was the same as an auto part and was able to produce about 10 million masks at about one million per month. GM has a long history remaking its supply chain after events like the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 but COVID-19 presented new challenges Soutter says. For instance the raw materials to make masks were in extremely short supply so GM reached out to its sources of acoustic insulation and asked them to pivot too.

The pandemic also meant making hard choices for smaller manufacturers who saw their orders dry up last spring.

“I don’t even want to say the number of hours per week (we’ve been working)” says Jamie Bakos of Titan Clean Energy Projects Corp. “It’s not sustainable but it is very busy.”

Saskatchewan-based Titan repurposes materials headed for the landfill into products like soil enhancer or charcoal kitty litter. The company also makes biodegradable melt-blown fabric for use in PPE and air filters to help reduce the environmental burden of disposable PPE.

Molded Precision Components in Oro-Medonte Ont. says it had about two months of cash on hand when orders for its automotive parts dropped to near-zero last March. The advanced manufacturing company sought grants to make protective equipment moving 3D printers into engineers’ homes and machinery into local fire halls and hockey arenas. On top of making face shields the company devised a hand-sanitizer bottling system that was more efficient than purchasing the sanitizer ingredients from overseas.

While some of the auto business has now come back the family business plans to stay in the medical supply industry and build a medical industrial park for other local suppliers.

Owner David Yeaman says Canadian companies can’t just expect buyers to pay a made-in-Canada premium forever or they risk the PPE supply chain slowly migrating back to cheaper goods made overseas. Instead Yeaman says advanced manufacturing technology is needed to make a premium product that is competitive with outside bidders.

“We’ve got to think differently as Canadians” says Yeaman.

But entrepreneurs like Yeaman now face an uphill battle getting hospitals and other PPE purchasers to commit to contracts going forward says Next Generation Manufacturing Canada which gave Yeaman’s company a grant. Many corporate PPE buyers have rigid requirements like certifications that are done in U.S. labs which have been closed during the pandemic says NGen chief executive Jayson Myers.

Myers is hoping that COVID-19 prompts buyers of PPE to rethink their mandates to buy specific overseas products and test new Canadian-made alternatives.

“We’ve already seen a number of companies that are laying off their employees and shutting down the production of PPE that they’ve set up simply because…they can’t get them on the market. In fact some of them found better markets outside of Canada” says Myers.

“Some of these problems existed way before COVID. But the fact that we have these structural problems has become very apparent — the major one is around the procurement system itself.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tzb25maXJlLmNvbS9uaWtlLWFpci1tYXgtOTUtY29jb251dC1taWxrLWRkNjYyMi0xMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grab the Nike Air Max 95 Coconut Milk Now,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kicksonfire.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Though Peter Bergman has played Jack Abbott on The Young and the Restless for years he was not the first actor in the role. Did the late Terry Lester the first thespian who played the character before Bergman leave the show due to Lauralee Bell?

Peter Bergman took over the role of Jack Abbott on ‘The Young and the Restless’ when Terry Lester left

Prior to playing Jack Bergman had another role on daytime television. He previously played Dr. Cliff Warner on All My Children starting in 1989. He was on the show for about 10 years before the series parted ways with him. Everything worked out as The Young and the Restless tapped him to be the new after Lester left the show.

In portraying Jack Bergman has played him a very long time and in turn has become one of the longest-serving cast members on the show. The character is not only one of the most important ones in The Young in the Restless history but is one of the most iconic characters in daytime television and soap opera history as a whole.

Terry Lester reportedly had an issue with the character being sidelined

When Lester left the show it was heavily rumored that Lester had problems with Jack being back-burned on the show. In hand with this rumor it was speculated that Lester had issues that he was being sidelined specifically due to Lauralee Bell the daughter of show creator Bill Bell getting more airtime. Bell commented on the situation in an interview after reading tabloid reports about it saying “It has dragged on for so long. After the first two articles I thought ‘OK.’ Now I am thinking ‘Enough already.'”

She debunked any issues with Lester and said that he told her himself that his issues were not with her. She said in 1989 “He took me aside and told me that I had nothing to do with the problems.”

The actor added “He taught me so much. At a point when he and my dad were having contract difficulties he took me aside and told me that I had nothing to do with the problems and if he ever took it out on me he was sorry. I went to his production of Kiss Me Kate and thought he was wonderful. A few months ago he wrote me the nicest letter.”

Teen characters got more airtime in the summer

Bell said in general it appeared that the show’s teen characters were featured more in the summer because kids were out of school.

“In the summer we deal with social issues that will affect teens” she continued. “We have three months to do a beginning middle and end. Of course that means a lot of airplay for the younger cast members. There were weeks that I worked five days. I am sorry if that pushed other characters or cast members aside but it was needed so we could do the story. Summer’s over and I am working two three days a week which is fine with me. That is a great schedule which gives me time to take my singing and dancing lessons. I don’t even know what my next story will be.”

She also added that the younger cast members on the show always respected Lester and she wished that she could have worked more alongside him on the show.

“A lot of the younger cast members were really impressed with Terry” Bell continued. “After they would do a scene with him they would be awed. I often wished I could have gotten some tips from Terry. He was always pleasant to me but I never felt I could knock on his dressing room door and ask his advice. He was always busy with other projects which I understood.”

Here's how to turn over a new leaf,"Former Australian finance minister Mathias Cormann was last week elected Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) after campaigning on a platform with climate action as a central plank.

In a statement following his appointment Cormann pledged to “drive and promote global leadership on ambitious and effective action on climate change to achieve global net-zero emissions by 2050”.

Cormann’s selection came despite concerns his climate track record in federal parliament made him an unsuitable candidate.

It’s said the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. If that proves correct with Cormann we shouldn’t expect much on climate change. But his new gig does present an opportunity for Cormann to change his stripes.

Richard Wainwright/AAP

A poor climate record

From 2013 to 2020 Cormann was finance minister in the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments – an administration with arguably one of the worst records on climate change of any OECD government.

Just last week Australia ranked last on a list of the world’s 50 largest economies for “green” spending to aid economic recovery after the COVID pandemic according to a United Nations report.

The litany of the Coalition’s indictments is too long to list in full here. But dubious highlights include:

abolishing Labor’s carbon price in 2014

abolishing the Climate Commission

unsuccessfully seeking to kill off the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.

And Cormann has also discouraged the climate action of others. For example in 2017 he described Westpac’s lending restrictions on coal projects as “very very disappointing”.

The OECD itself has condemned Australia as “one of the most carbon-intensive OECD countries and one of the few where greenhouse gas emissions (excluding land use change and forestry) have risen in the past decade”.

It is not hard to see why many around the globe lobbied against Cormann’s new appointment including the British Labour Party.

In stark contrast to his political record Cormann embraced the need for climate action during his campaign for the OECD job. This included an opinion piece in support of net-zero emissions by 2050 – a target Prime Minister Scott Morrison has yet to commit to.

So if Cormann really has had a genuine change of heart what can he do on climate action in his new role?

Cormann’s climate opportunity

Cormann may be used to being a cabinet minister but his new role is more like a departmental secretary but with new political masters.

The Paris-based OECD consists of 37 member states which run the organisation. Cormann answers to them and many – including the United States and the United Kingdom – have adopted strong climate targets.

With a budget of around A$600 million and a permanent secretariat of more than 2500 staff the OECD has at its disposal significant resources to set international agendas and standards that can shape climate policies around the globe.

It regularly does so in other domains. For example since the global financial crisis in 2008 the OECD has led the way on taxation reform. It helped forge new rules governing how national tax authorities share information and how they might address multinational tax avoidance.

Cormann in a tight spot

If Cormann is genuine about his climate action agenda he may be forced to take positions at odds with the Morrison government.

The first potential pressure point involves carbon prices and carbon tariffs for which the OECD could be called upon to play a coordinating role.

A carbon price sets a price on carbon pollution at home. Carbon tariffs do so at the border. Crudely speaking these are taxes on imports that produce considerable carbon pollution and which originated in countries not pulling their weight on climate change.

The agenda of US President Joe Biden includes a “carbon adjustment fee” for countries failing to meet climate and environmental obligations. The European Union is also pressing ahead with a similar proposal.

Given even the OECD has concluded Australia is a climate action laggard we look likely to be slugged. Predictably Energy Minister Angus Taylor has declared his government is “dead against” such tariffs and there are early signs Cormann will back his former colleagues on the tariff issue.

He last week urged caution saying the measure entailed “many downside implications for global trade and the world economy”.

The second pressure point is fossil fuel subsidies. In 2009 G20 countries agreed to phase out trillions of dollars in government handouts that prop up the oil gas and coal industries. Since then the OECD has campaigned against the subsidies describing them as “environmentally harmful costly and distortive”.

OECD countries may come under growing international pressure to eliminate the handouts. This includes Australia which according to IMF estimates maintains US$29 billion in fossil fuel subsidies each year.

The third lesser known point involves the rules governing export financing for fossil fuel infrastructure. In 2015 the US Obama administration pushed for OECD countries to restrict financing for new coal power plants in overseas countries. The bid succeeded despite opposition from Australia and a handful of other nations.

While not perfect the rules were a first step in phasing out coal. Many environmental groups are now campaigning for these rules to be tightened and to extend to oil and gas. It is not hard to guess what Australia’s position will be.

A new chapter?

The outgoing head of the OECD Ángel Gurría last month said tackling the world’s environmental crises was “the single most important intergenerational responsibility […] We are on a collision course with nature and we have to change course for future generations”.

He urged countries to “put a big fat price on carbon” – a position clearly at odds with the Morrison government.

Unsurprisingly Cormann’s rhetoric so far has been more restrained. But if he is to match the climate ambition of the OECD’s biggest member states his future behaviour will have to be very different to that of his past behaviour.

Those have since evolved into what is now called their “Studio” drivers but they’re essentially the same thing; versions of their drivers that are geared more towards content creation rather than gaming.

They’ve seen a lot of changes over the last couple of years especially since the launch of their first series RTX cards and now their new March 2021 version of the Studio drivers focus heavily on the latest AI-powered tools from Adobe including the new Super Resolution feature as well as the newest neural engine in Blackmagic’s DaVinci Resolve 17.

The March 2021 update NVIDIA says provides a nice performance boost for Adobe’s new Super Resolution feature currently available in Adobe Camera Raw and coming soon to Lightroom and Lightroom Classic as well as all of the recently added Neural Filters. The Neural Engine in DaVinci Resolve 17 as well as new features like the Magic Mask also see a bit of a boost.

They say that there are also benefits for 3D artists although the only software I can see mentioned by name is Blender’s AI-powered OptiX denoising (which is pretty awesome btw).

For those who use NVIDIA graphics cards but don’t game choosing to go with the Studio drivers is a no brainer but many people still don’t know they even exist. The company’s Game Ready drivers are typically installed on new machines by default – or even if you install them yourself but go with the “Express” installation – but they’re well worth taking advantage of showing some big performance boosts over the standard gamer drivers for many creative applications.

If you’re not running the Studio drivers yet or you are but haven’t updated to the newest release head on over to the NVIDIA blog to find out more and download it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZGNleGVjLmNvbS9zb3VyY2luZy1wcm9jdXJlbWVudC9uZXdzLzIxMzMxMjE5L2F2ZXR0YS1mb3JtZXJseS1waWNzLWF1ZGl0aW5nLWF2ZXR0YS1zdXJ2ZXktZmluZHMtY3N1aXRlLWV4ZWNzLWNvbmNlcm5lZC1vdmVyLWhvdy1icmV4aXQtd2lsbC1pbXBhY3Qtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLXJlc2lsaWVuY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avetta Survey Finds C-Suite Execs Concerned Over How Brexit Will Impact Supply Chain Resiliency,"Nearly one-third (29%) of survey respondents anticipate changes in documentation and administrative processes; 16% on sales revenue; 11% on market/sector competition; and 10% on hiring permanent staff in accordance with Brexit yet only 5% saw an impact on engaging temporary staff and keeping sustainability environmental and social value commitments according to an Avetta survey.

Not only have they started to replace ladders and scaffolding on jobsites everywhere but they’ve also garnered attention due to their mobility flexibility and adaptability. With a variety of options to choose from including boom lifts scissor lifts and telehandlers they’re suitable for any size project in close to any work environment.

However the use of aerial lifts comes with a unique sense of dangers. Common hazards like electric shock due to close proximity to power lines falls or ejections from the basket machine tip-overs objects falling from the lift itself or structural failure can all lead to injury or even death.

One of the most serious of these hazards is falls from elevation. According to OSHA fatalities caused by these accidents continue to be a leading cause of death accounting for 320 of the 1008 occupational construction fatalities recorded in 2018. To help combat this epidemic OSHA holds the National Safety Stand-Down week each year to raise fall hazard awareness in an effort to stop fatalities and injuries. This year the event will take place in early May.

A Safety Stand-Down is a voluntary event for employers to talk directly to their employees about safety and reinforcing the importance of fall prevention. Rental business owners can conduct one by having a toolbox talk with employees conducting safety equipment inspections developing rescue plans to show renters and discussing job specific hazards. Though fall prevention is an incredibly important topic promoting safe operation and avoiding any precarious behavior in general is as equally so. This is why proper training is necessary for anyone using aerial work platforms. It’s also important for rental business owners to create awareness around common hazards before renting out these pieces of equipment to their customers.

On top of proper training aerial lift manufacturers have taken extra steps to promote safe practices and initiatives while also working to make their equipment even more safe for the jobsite. Today’s aerial lifts provide features that accentuate safe operation stability and support such as slip-resistant surfaces high guard rails harnesses and lanyards and machine tracking and telematics systems. Some have even stepped up and created initiatives to draw attention to common equipment and jobsite hazards.

We spoke with a few aerial lift manufacturers from across the industry about their safety practices initiatives and equipment features. Though they all have multiple examples to choose from we asked them to only pick one to focus on to find out how they directly affect rental business owners while promoting a safer work environment.

No matter what size your company is or how diverse your fleet is equipment management is something rental business owners do every day. A solution to common problems telematics has been an evolving technology in the aerial lift industry helping to maximize productivity and minimize downtime.

Genie Genie released their own telematics platform called Genie Lift Connect which provides fleet and service managers tools to support fleets properly. The program has a variety of features including seeing the health of machines in a single view fleet reporting the ability to search individual asset numbers and understanding machine utilization and drive ROIC. It also aids in maintenance as it can remotely diagnose equipment saving costly site visits and schedule upcoming maintenance for easy planning.

Earlier this year Genie unveiled a new add-on feature to Lift Connect called Access Manager which gives rental companies the option to remotely manage access to their fleet. The program assigns a unique code that can either be randomly generated or personally selected like an ATM pin code to an individual operator through the Lift Connect portal. That operator can then be assigned to specific equipment ensuring that only authorized operators can operate the machine.

In a press release from the company Christine Zeznick Genie director of product and business development Telematics Terex AWP said “Not only does this provide greater security for equipment it also can help ensure only trained operators have codes.”

Separate from Access Manager Genie also announced the Remote Disable functionality where equipment owners can remotely disable or enable operation of their equipment through the Lift Connect portal.

Haulotte As most know visibility is key for safe operations of aerial lifts. However what many don't consider is the time of day before and after a project. That is the loading and unloading operations of MEWPs are regularly carried out at the beginning or end of the day. This delicate procedure can be dangerous when the ambient light is no longer sufficient like at dawn or dusk. To help navigate this situation while improving driver safety Haulotte developed the Haulotte Activ' Lighting System.

When visibility is reduced the twilight sensor automatically activates the Haulotte Activ' Lighting System. With a minimum of 10 LED lighting points placed around the machine the operator can safely access accurately control and identify obstacles and edges clearly in the working area. According to Haulotte all headlights and lighting points are installed on the machine in such a way as to avoid any risk of operator glare offering increased visibility of both the environment and controls.

Hy-Brid Lifts website Hy-Brid Lifts by Custom Equipment has made it a point to create innovative solutions for problems plaguing those in the aerial lift industry. That includes falls from ladders—with as many as 2000 people injured every day in ladder-related incidents—which is why the company developed their push scissor lift series including the PA-1030. The company’s goal both with message and equipment is to reduce falls from ladders using what they call a “Ladders Last” mentality.

With this campaign Hy-Brid Lifts promotes the benefits of lifts including their safety productivity mobility and more. Features like height versatility reducing user fatigue by eliminating repetitive climbing of ladder rungs more platform workspace for tools and materials and easy drawer access combine to show why lifts are the safer option for jobsites. And not just that but time management is a huge consideration as using ladders last eliminates the time necessary to set up ladders can reduce the time it takes to complete a task and makes handling materials easier.

Providing renters and contractors with more efficient ladder-less solutions and promoting a campaign like “Ladders Last” can help them rethink how they complete tasks and staying safer while working at height.

“A company’s risk of a serious workplace injury increases every time an employee climbs a ladder"" says Justin Kissinger VP of marketing for Hy-Brid Lifts by Custom Equipment. ""‘Ladders last’ is meant to help shift employee mindset and encourage choosing safer alternatives for working at height when possible. Rental centers have the opportunity to help bridge a safety gap for contractors and communicate the unmatched efficiency and safety gained through lifts without requiring an intimidating long-term investment.""

He continues ""Although contractors may pay more up front for a lift the savings of finishing a job weeks ahead of schedule and reducing injury risk and workman’s comp claims pays them back significantly more than an economically priced ladder.”

JLG Another manufacturer in the access equipment industry is taking on ladders. In support of National Ladder Safety Awareness Month which ran February 22 through March 31 JLG published a whitepaper called ""5 Steps to Reach Zero Falls From a Ladder at Work.""

In it JLG highlights how Oshkosh Corporation and its brands have been working towards eliminating falls from ladders at work and on jobsites in a proactive pursuit of the highest level of OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).

“Jobsite safety has always been a core pillar at JLG “says Jennifer Stiansen director of marketing JLG. “With falls from ladders being a core contributor to jobsite incidents it is important that JLG supports industry initiatives that bolster education and awareness around implementing safety practices and safe use.”

According to Stiansen one JLG low-leve access lift could replace multiple ladders from 5-feet up to 20-feet on any given jobsite creating a new revenue stream for rental companies who might not already offer them. The company will continue to work towards touting safer alternatives to ladders and keeping the industry safer through the reduced risk of falls and overuse injuries.

LGMG

LGMG Lingong Machinery Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary LGMG recently joined the North American market with their first facility being built in 2019 in Chambersburg Pennsylvania. The company’s focuses include safety and customer support with a vision for integration between construction machinery and technology.

The company has accomplished that vision with QR codes. A QR code is included on every machine scannable with smartphones which allows LGMG’s system to accurately track the machine via internal procedures and also puts information right at the customer’s fingertips.

By scanning the code the user is taken to all pertinent information such as spec sheets operation manuals service manuals and a parts catalog. LGMG believes that users having access to this information as fast as possible makes their machines safer if there is an issue and helps get it resolved faster.

A safety concern regularly mentioned throughout the aerial lift industry is lift capacity and making sure the machine is not being overloaded with operators equipment and materials.

MAGNI Magni Americas’ telescopic handlers help to elevate this concern by coming standard with a load moment indicator (LMI) system that prevents overloading and inhibits operators from putting machines in an unsafe position. A large full-color touchscreen in the cab displays a dynamic load chart that updates depending on the attachment on the machine. These load charts tell the operator exactly how much they are lifting and how high they can safely lift the load. If they try and lift above the machine's limits for a specific load there will be an audio signal and it will lock them out preventing them from getting into an unsafe situation.

There are lots of attachment options available for Magni rotating telehandlers including forks jibs hooks winches and more. RFID tags on each attachment automatically pair with the Magni’s advanced computer system bringing up the correct load chart for each attachment. So no matter what attachment is on the end of the boom operators can feel confident that they know the machine's limits and operate safely and efficiently.

Sinoboom Machine paint isn’t always the first thing to come to mind when you think “safety.” However in the rough jobsite environments where MEWPs consistently work paint chipping and rust build-up from steel corrosion is common. And extensive corrosion can weaken the metal even leading to failure.

Before operating a MEWP a pre-inspection of the unit for excessive rust corrosion or oxidation is required. Having seen issues with poor paint quality on MEWPs Sinoboom invested in a paint application technique for their scissor lifts similar to those seen on high-end luxury car steel components. The results show less corrosion on Sinoboom scissor lifts than competitor models and the paint cleans up easier making the unit quickly ready for its next rental.

Most manufacturers use electrophoretic painting sometimes called e-coat for painting metal surfaces. The process involves immersing the part in a wet paint that uses an electrical current to attract the paint product to a metal surface. Many variables affect whether the coating lasts or if it begins to chip right away including the quality of paint and the preparation of the parts before e-coating. Sinoboom’s unique process of using a specific pigment paint mix combined with an extreme temperature oven to cure the paint has led to less rust and corrosion over time.

Skyjack When the new ANSI A92.20 standards were introduced Skyjack was one of the first manufacturers to start shipping compliant machines to rental companies. A key design change mandated by the new standards was the inclusion of load sensing in most MEWPs. These overload sensors which have been used in global markets for over a decade help ensure that platform capacity limits are adhered to and that machines are being used for what they’re designed for.

In addition to the safety-related changes outlined by ANSI Skyjack also implemented design changes that go beyond standards and further contribute to proper on-site machine use. Secondary Guarding Electrical (SGE) is a standard feature on booms which includes a sensor bar that instantly stops all functions when pushed against and initiates an audible siren and light beacon. If pressure is applied to the bar for more than one second the engine will also stop which halts all regular functions until reset. The emergency lowering controls can still be operated to bring the platform safely to the ground.

An example of an optional enhancement to this feature is the Secondary Guarding Lift Enable (SGLE). For use on vertical masts and scissor lifts it’s designed so the machine only lifts when both the joystick enable and tamper-proof secondary enable button are activated. The release of either of these switches will stop lifting functions immediately. An added benefit is that it keeps the operator’s body in an upright position and away from railings which mitigates the risk of entrapment.

Snorkel Operator safety as we know is paramount. Providing an additional level of protection for the operator without adding any complexity to the machine itself is a difficult feat for most. However Snorkel took that challenge head on and designed by their in-house engineering team created the Snorkel Guard Secondary Guarding System.

Snorkel Guard is a simple mechanical secondary guarding system that is fitted as standard to all factory-built Snorkel boom lifts. It features a spring-loaded rail that sits above the upper control panel that cuts out machine operations when compressed. When Snorkel Guard is activated the horn is sounded and a flashing blue light on the platform is illuminated. Whenever the system is activated the platform can be lowered from the ground using the selector switch to enable the lower control panel.

Matthew Elvin CEO of Snorkel said “The value of Snorkel Guard to a rental business owner is that in addition to providing their customers with an additional level of protection while using the lift the Snorkel Guard design does not interfere with normal lift operation and does not have any complicated electronics which potentially lead to increased service calls.”",,,,,,

Last March when markets cratered as the coronavirus spread Domino’s held up reasonably well. Sure it saw a brief decline during the market-wide sell-off but already coming off of a spike in February 2020 shares were pretty close to where they were at the start of the year.

And with lockdowns providing carry-out restaurant chains a windfall strong results helped push the stock well above its pre-COVID price levels. Now though as vaccine optimism rises “stay-at-home” restaurant plays are fading in popularity among investors.

DPZ stock may have bounced back a bit after its late February correction (partly due to a disappointing earnings release) but don’t expect the pullback to end here. Although shares aren’t necessarily going to fall completely back to their early 2020 prices as growth slows and more compelling opportunities present themselves there’s going to be less interest in this stock.

Domino's Stock And Slowing Growth

Late last month the pizza chain released quarterly results. With both revenue and earnings falling short of expectations shares dipped on the news.

Wall Street analysts expected $1.39 billion in sales for the quarter. Instead the top line came in at $1.36 billion. Sell-side consensus called for $3.89 per share in earnings but the company posted adjusted earnings of only $3.46 per share.

While results were up from the prior-year quarter they still missed investors’ expectations. As mentioned above in the weeks since its pullback we’ve seen DPZ stock partially recover.

Yet with the outlook calling for slowing growth shares may have room to fall. How much further? Given its slightly higher valuation relative to similar names expect only a modest pullback from here.

Slight Pullback Possible But Nothing Dramatic

As its growth slows and investors focus more on restaurant recovery plays it’s going to be hard for Domino’s Pizza stock to resume its prior upward trajectory.

It should be noted though that the situation here differs from other restaurant stocks that thrived during 2020. A good example is Chipotle (CMG) which has clearly gotten ahead of itself valuation-wise.

Yet with significant growth projected for the coming year Chipotle likely has enough to keep its stock price steady. However with DPZ’s sales and earnings growth set to fall back into the single-digits this stock might not be able to grow into its valuation.

Story continues

Instead expect valuation contraction. Fortunately though not to a severe degree. With a forward P/E ratio that is only slightly higher than similar names like McDonald’s (MCD) additional pullbacks may be minimal.

What Analysts Are Saying About DPZ Stock

According to TipRanks DPZ is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys and 7 Holds. At $414.24 the average analyst price target suggests 14% upside potential. (See Domino’s stock analysis on TipRanks)

Bottom Line

As investors become more interested in bidding up recovery plays restaurant stocks that thrived during the pandemic (such as Domino’s) will likely fade in interest.

And unlike some other names which have high levels of growth potential to keep their share prices stable this company’s slowing growth doesn’t offer that opportunity.

So where’s DPZ heading from here? Expect another pullback though likely nothing dramatic. But more importantly don’t expect shares to make another move higher anytime soon.

In a lengthy statement Mr. Reed apologized to a former lobbyist Nicolette Davis whose allegation that the congressman groped her during a 2017 political trip was reported on Friday by The Washington Post. Mr. Reed said that he took “full responsibility” for the episode and that it “occurred at a time in my life in which I was struggling” with an alcohol addiction.

“Even though I am only hearing of this matter as stated by Ms. Davis in the article now I hear her voice and will not dismiss her” Mr. Reed 49 said. “In reflection my personal depiction of this event is irrelevant. Simply put I caused her pain showed her disrespect and was unprofessional. I was wrong I am sorry and I take full responsibility.”

Chemistry can make it smell better at least,"Credit: Shutterstock

It’s been a long pandemic winter. As warmer weather arrives in the Northern Hemisphere we can finally crack open some windows. Spring cleaning takes on a special urgency after weeks and months spent hunkered down in our homes with partners kids and pets.

All that togetherness. All those smells. It’s the fish cooked two nights ago the dog’s bed the litter box the pile of dirty laundry and the sofa that has gotten way more use than normal.

At consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble maker of the Febreze line of air fresheners an interdisciplinary team of scientists investigates this claustrophobic stew with the aim of making our indoor environment more pleasant and increasing our sense of well-being. The scientists would also like to rebut critics who say spraying chemicals is not the best way to keep a home odor-free and fresh.

In late January the Febreze team held a media event to showcase how the science that goes into its air-care products makes them both effective and safe. The event was virtual as we’d all been stuck at home for nearly a year—which only served to highlight the benefits of Febreze said Morgan Brashear senior scientist for home care at P&G.

Febreze product developers marry fragrance with functional chemistry that traps or breaks down odor compounds. “We do a lot of consumer research on habits and practices—and what we do that causes odors good and bad—so we can develop technologies to address bad odors” Brashear said.

We do a lot of consumer research on habits and practices—and what we do that causes odors good and bad. Morgan Brashear senior scientist for home care Procter & Gamble

The event also gave P&G scientists a chance to describe how they formulate products that are safe for people and pets. That’s important because many of the ingredients in common air fresheners are both volatile and reactive—indeed that’s how they work. When the products drift outside they can contribute to the formation of unhealthy smog. And researchers who study indoor air quality say some ingredients react with other chemicals in the home to form substances that could affect human health.

It’s not easy to create a safe product that performs well in the home explained Steve Horenziak a P&G research fellow focused on Febreze. “We’re limited in what we can do” he said “because we’re not applying a product directly to a source of malodor” such as a dog or teenager.

Instead an air freshener uses a small amount of ingredients to do a big job. It has to evaporate at room temperature deploy reactive chemicals to combat smelly molecules and leave a scent that can offset different malodors. Some scent chemicals particularly aldehydes do double duty by leaving a pleasant scent and reacting with malodorous amine- and sulfur-based molecules.

The workhorse ingredient in Febreze is not a scent but rather the doughnut-shaped starch molecule hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin. It has a cavity the perfect size for capturing small smelly molecules Brashear said.

When Febreze launched in 1998 as a line of fabric refreshers it was embraced by consumers who wanted to rid clothing of the smell of cigarette smoke. Once P&G convinced people to spray Febreze on clothes Horenziak said they started spraying it on other hard-to-clean odor-collecting fabrics like sofas and carpets.

Today the Febreze line goes beyond fabric refreshers to include air spray oil diffusers and wax melt products. And as the list of smells Febreze is called on to vanquish has grown the chemistry has expanded beyond cyclodextrins.

Many of our least favorite smells are either acidic or basic. Our skin for example releases fatty acids the breakdown products of triglycerides. In contrast the telltale smell of a cat’s litter box comes from high-pH ammonia. And an ammonia derivative trimethylamine is responsible for the stink of raw fish.

Just as a squeeze of lemon can make fish taste less fishy Febreze uses neutralizing ingredients to eliminate smells Horenziak told attendees. The products contain a reservoir of buffering chemicals including sodium citrate and sodium maleate to counter basic and acidic odors.

In a product demonstration P&G scientists compared Febreze with a competitor product SC Johnson’s Glade. A pH indicator showed that Febreze neutralized an ammonia compound but Glade did not.

C&EN asked SC Johnson to comment on the demo. In an email the company says Glade has been shown to be effective at reducing malodor perception for ammonia-type odors.

A newer target for P&G’s researchers is cooking smells. One downside of today’s open-floor-plan homes Horenziak said is that cooking odors can really travel. For example aldehydes from fat oxidation are carried away from the stove by convection currents and move around the home. Away from the heat they fall out of the air and get trapped in soft surfaces where they slowly release odor over time.

P&G calls this migration the cycle of malodor. It upgraded the Febreze formula to add the functional polymer polyethylenimine to soak up aldehydes from cooking fats.

As the company adds new ingredients it avoids others. One category on the “no” list is phthalates a family of fragrance carriers that are considered to be endocrine-disrupting compounds associated with harm to reproductive health according to health scientists and regulators. P&G instead uses dipropylene glycol a low-toxicity alcohol to dissolve solid fragrance ingredients like vanillin.

And while competing air freshener sprays also do not contain phthalates Brashear said Febreze stands out for not using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as isobutane or propane as propellants. Instead nitrogen keeps the water-based contents under pressure.

With its 7500 R&D employees P&G has the scientific heft to do its own safety testing. For example it works to ensure that substances in air fresheners cannot enter the lungs. Febreze is formulated to deploy particles of 85–120 µm small enough to smell but too large to enter the respiratory tract.

Human safety isn’t the only issue: 88% of surveyed P&G customers live in households with dogs and 11% share space with cats. Because dogs chew on everything they have high exposure to home care products P&G veterinary scientist Daniel S. Marsman said at the media event. Cats have a different risk profile because of how their livers metabolize chemicals and the way their kidneys concentrate urine Marsman explained.

Despite P&G’s efforts to ensure safety some academic researchers who study urban indoor air quality say scented air fresheners are not the best way for people to neutralize bad odors.

“I don’t use air fresheners or anything that contains fragrances” says Shelly L. Miller a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. She says it’s too challenging to evaluate the long and constantly changing lists of ingredients in scented products. In addition scientists are finding that ingredients react with chemicals in the air and in other products to form new substances some of which may be hazardous.

For example fragrances contain terpenes like linalool and limonene that react with indoor ozone and hydroxyl radicals to produce formaldehyde and ultrafine particles (Int. J. Hyg. Environ. Health 2020 DOI: 10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.113439). Terpenes also react with chlorine from common cleaning products to produce volatile reaction products and chlorine-containing particles (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2019 DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.9b04261).

Miller says the best way to eliminate odor is to remove it by using an air cleaner with an activated carbon or potassium permanganate filter. As part of the Healthy Homes program for Fort Collins Colorado Miller works to educate residents on nontoxic freshening and cleaning methods to reduce exposure to chemicals that can cause health problems.

Air fresheners and other consumer products also put VOCs into the outdoor air. In California emissions from consumer products are the largest single human-caused source of VOCs contributing to smog formation says Melanie J. Turner information officer for the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

CARB has restricted VOCs in consumer products for 30 years. As California’s population grows total consumer product use has also increased. So the state is now proposing rules to reduce the allowed VOC content in air fresheners from 20% to 10% by weight in 2023 and to 5% in 2027. Other limits target solid products and systems that automatically disperse fragrance.

The P&G scientists said that not using a volatile propellant helps Febreze stay under the VOC limits. The company’s R&D team is also researching whether terpenes in its products contribute to the formation of smog outdoors or formaldehyde or other pollutants indoors.

Meanwhile Horenziak found in a review of research studies that malodor itself has negative effects on human behavior and well-being (Atmosphere 2020 DOI: 10.3390/atmos11020126). Living with foul odors can contribute to depression anger and stress and even cause physical symptoms like headache and nausea.

Our mission is focused on fostering belonging – especially at a moment in which humanity needs human connection more than ever before. But that feeling of belonging is made possible by Hosts and the unique experiences that Hosts offer guests. It’s what makes Airbnb special and different.

Over five years ago Airbnb Hosts in San Francisco were faced with a ballot measure that would have severely restricted home sharing taking away a source of income that has helped them afford to live in a city they love. So they did what Hosts do best: they formed a community and successfully worked to ensure they could continue to do what they love and share their homes with people from around the world.

That community of Hosts was the Home Sharers Democratic Club the first Airbnb Host Club which still exists today.

“When I started hosting there weren’t many local resources for hosts. There were no books nor online forums where you could learn about hosting exchange ideas and help each other out. So I posted on Craigslist asking if there were other hosts who were interested in getting together to share information about a range of topics like insurance local zoning laws and tips like where to buy the best sheets and other supplies. The four people at that first meeting in my living room grew to an online and offline community of thousands. Monthly meetings were attended by 25-30 people.” Peter Kwan Airbnb Superhost Boardmember of Home Sharers Democratic Club and member of the Airbnb Host Advisory Board

We were proud to assist the Host Club in organizing lobbying and turning out the vote against this ballot measure – and we worked to build on their success. Just after the successful vote in San Francisco in 2015 we announced at a press conference that in collaboration with Hosts we would launch and support Host Clubs around the world.

Since that time we’ve announced and supported the launch of Host Clubs in Africa San Juan across Latin America Mexico City Copenhagen Vienna – the list goes on. Today there are more than 300 Host Clubs around the world proudly supported by Airbnb and made up of Hosts just like those first Hosts in San Francisco who stood up for their right to home share and earn money to pay their bills.

Who Makes Up Host Clubs

Host Clubs are networks of Airbnb Hosts guests small business owners and local community leaders. From teachers to medical workers and hosts with one listing to hosts with more than one listing Host Clubs are made up of people from all walks of life who are passionate about their ability to home share and for the direct economic impact it brings to communities.

“I’ve met dozens of hosts in Portland who are just like my wife and me – they love Portland and are cheerleaders for the city. Hosting helps them pay the bills but they also do it because it gives them an opportunity to show off our city and our state. These are hard working Portlanders who want to make a contribution to our community and I think it’s important to tell their stories.” Willy Airbnb Superhost and Host Club Leader in Portland

In 2017 Hosts in the Western Cape of Africa joined together to launch the continent’s first Host Club in Khayelitsha called Tirisano’s Home Sharing Club. The club was launched by Hosts from underserved communities across the Western Province.

“It is so great for me to be a part of this home sharing club. I just see myself as being a part of the whole world. It’s opened up so many doors and I can already see I have such a bright future. I’m looking forward to seeing our new club grow to welcoming new people and being able to help different communities.” Maria Airbnb Host and member of the Tirisano’s Home Sharing Club

Work Done By Host Clubs

To support other hosts in their own communities Host Clubs share advice and best practices meet other like-minded people in the community support volunteer activity to ensure Airbnb remains an important economic driver in the places they call home and engage as constituents with their local leaders. Since 2016 more than 150000 Hosts have advocated for their local communities by sending more than 800000 emails and tweets to their local representatives.

As residents who are sharing their stories with lawmakers these Host Clubs have been able to make the case for clear and fair short-term rental regulations around the world – including recently in Portland Long Beach and San Diego.

Host Clubs have also engaged in a range of other activities:

In Prague we work with the local Host Club to hold a workshop on responsible hosting.

In Orlando we worked with the local Host Club to launch a partnership with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to drive tourism to the region in order to support continued efforts to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

The Cape Town Home Sharing Club gathered Hosts from across the city to discuss creatives ideas to battle drought-like conditions and gather creative ideas to combat water scarcity empowering each other to encourage their guests to live like a local.

The Hobart Host Club in Tasmania organizes regular fairs to allow small businesses in their area to meet hosts share local products and support their community.

The Community Leaders Team at Airbnb works closely with Host Clubs and is dedicated to empowering Hosts around the world through this work helping them to connect with their fellow Hosts in their region to collaborate and give back to their local communities. The team consists of 25 people representing 10 countries and eight languages who guide local Hosts as they build their Host Clubs and develop community programming and resources to provide local Host leaders with tools and inspiration.

Why This Work is More Important Than Ever

Like so many others our Host community has been affected financially by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to new Airbnb data significant percentages of Homes Hosts have either experienced a pay cut or reduced hours at work themselves.

Many have turned to sharing their homes on Airbnb which has provided a critical and urgent COVID-19 social safety net to help stay economically afloat in these unprecedented times. New Hosts with only one listing who welcomed their first guests during the pandemic have made $1 billion since March 2020. Fifty-five percent of these new Hosts are women a segment of the population that has been most affected financially by the pandemic and these Hosts have collectively earned more than $600 million since March 2020.

In the US these new Hosts have earned an average of $3900 since the pandemic began money that is often being used to pay important bills.

We’re incredibly proud of the work we’ve done with Airbnb Host Clubs to advocate for home sharing around the globe. As the world begins to recover from the pandemic we believe home sharing will be an integral part of the return of the tourism economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzFhZmIzMTczLTQ0NGEtNDdmYS05OWVjLTU1NDc3OWRkZTIzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb using 'independent' host groups to lobby policymakers,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Ferndale Considering Regulations for Airbnb/Short Term Rentals

(Crystal A. Proxmire March 21 2021)

Ferndale MI – The City of Ferndale is considering an ordinance that would require owners of short term rentals such as those offered on Airbnb to register their properties and maintain certain standards in order to maintain their license.

“If these property owners want to change their property from a residential home to a business then they need to be treated like a business” said Councilperson Greg Pawlica at the Jan. 25 2021 city council meeting where the proposed ordinance to license and regulate LTRs was first introduced.

The ordinance would require an annual fee for property owners set clear rules for the number of people permitted to stay overnight based on available space and provide a mechanism for revoking licenses of property owners who fall short of standards in terms of upkeep limiting guests and avoiding issues such as parking problems parties and crime.

Tracking and inspection would be funded by the fees. The proposed fee is 185.00 per year for Residential Short Term Rental Unit $185.00 a year for a Non-Residential Short Term Rental Unit and $75.00 a year refund of a portion of the annual licensing fee for a Short Term Rental Unit leased for no more than 14 days a calendar year.

“When I was on council I started getting complaints from residents who live next to or near a short term rental and there were not a lot of records of a trend of Airbnb rentals in the city” said Mayor Melanie Piana. “We really didn’t have a lay of the land in 2019 of where this was going.”

The City created a taskforce to study the STR issue and has already connected with 20 STR owners who voluntarily participated in registering their properties.

The City also has been tracking ads for STRs through sites including Airbnb. They found that depending on the season there were between 30-90 STRs advertised.

Emily Loomis the City’s Assistant Building Official stated “The goal of the ordinance is right now short term rentals are not regulated so any building or structure could technically operate as a short term rental but without regulation. This allows the city to regulate short term rentals to try and mitigate any adverse impacts that it can have on the welfare the safety the health and just the overall quality of life for the surrounding properties.”

Some issues include buildings that have not been cleaned and maintained as well as those that have attracted large parties and even crime. A Jan. 4 2021 drive-by shooting is one example. Neighbors to the north in Royal Oak have had similar problems.

“Some of the goals with the ordinance are overnight occupancy limits” Loomis explained. “This one is based off square footage and the tables within the Michigan residential code. There is the ability to revoke the license of a short term rental if it has had three documented verified ordinance violations with the revocation per review of City Manager.” Complaints would need to be substantiated and the City Manager would have discretion for revocations. There would also be an appeal process.

At the Jan. 25 meeting resident Mike Flores who owns multiple STR properties in cities outside Ferndale explained the economics saying that property owners make more money in the three months of renting at $100-$500 per night in the busy travel season than in an entire year renting to a person or family to live there year-round.

Not including unregistered STRS about 20% of housing in Ferndale is registered as long term rental properties which are inspected and regulated for use by long term tenants.

As traditional renters are displaced and a revolving door of transient guests comes in complaints to the city increase. Piana acknowledged the challenge for neighbors. “They didn’t sign up to live next to a hotel when they bought their house” she said. “So there’s a balance here that we’re trying to achieve.”

In addition to the immediate concerns of neighbors the City is concerned with the loss of affordable rental properties for residents. “Places like Traverse City and Saugatuck have a real problem with more homes going over to short term rentals than being available for people to live in losing some affordable housing. So it’s a real issue for cities” Piana said.

On top of finding a way to preserve affordable housing without imposing on property owners’ rights municipalities are facing the potential for deregulation by the state.

“There’s another track here going on at the same time the legislative track” Mayor Piana said. “The legislators have been trying to prevent cities from passing short term rental ordinances and preempting them taking away cities’ power to even put in a local ordinance so the local government can even try to control these short term rentals in the way that is best for their community. “ She said cities would have to be mindful that such legislation could pass and the ordinance would no longer apply. She encouraged those who have an opinion to reach out to their State officials to weigh in on the issue.

The ordinance will be introduced at the Monday March 22 Ferndale City Council meeting. For more info visit https://www.ferndalemi.gov.

The main talking point is undoubtedly the skate ramps - but Jason said this is only one unique feature The Shed offers.

'The ramps are just an iceberg tips of what this venue can give. The spirit of place here is like a satisfied sigh' he said adding: 'The feelings provoked like waking up completely refreshed and actually ready to experience everything.'

The amalgamation of the skate ramps and living areas allows the AirBnb to differentiate itself from others available in the area as well as the incredible artwork by artist Mr Basix.

'The Shed is unashamedly a shed. The beauty of its rustic and robust heart is that everyone can really relax' Jason said.

'The Sheds ease with its identity connects it very well to the area and soon enough you will be one of the locals enjoying coffee at harvest.'

The shed design was completed by Lucy herself who wanted to create a space where 'children can create adventures and memories'

Prior to transforming the shed into an epic getaway house the couple used the remote corners of the space to store 'adult-related sources of fun' such as motorbikes a beach buggy and gym equipment.

'Soon enough the Shed began looking like the club house form the movie the Expendibles which we didn't mind a bit!' Jason said.

The shed design was completed by Lucy herself who wanted to create a space where 'children can create adventures and memories'.

'Lucy worked hand in hand with a local builder daily to mould the layout and vibe into what now stands' Jason said.

Her inspiration was her own childhood lost in old sheds on her Fathers properties where there was distance from adults countless spaces to lose herself in and a gorgeous lack of fragility.

Due to the wide number of features Jason said the 'best feature' is based on each guest's personal opinion.

'Perhaps to a 6-year-old boy it will be disappearing into the enormous treehouse in our avocado tree to a mother just breathing with all her family happy each in their own world and space' he said.

'But for us the best feature is the spirit of the space the energy and the breathtaking view.'

“Don’t go there don’t use this washroom this is not safe this is not accessible this is not hygienic you will get an infection.”

In 2019 Kelshikar along with his wife Rupali started Woloo  which stands for women’s loo and is India’s first chain of women’s powder rooms. Supreet Shah a former engineer with Infosys and Amit Arondekar who has 12 years of retail industry experience are the other co-founders in the start-up.

“Instead of improving the situation women in India began adjusting. Adjust in terms of holding on to the urge to pee don’t change pad or quit school and quit office” Kelshikar the chief strategy officer of Woloo said.

The statistics bear this out. Of the 365 million menstruating women in the country only 18 percent use sanitary napkins while the remaining 82 percent who live in semi-rural and rural India use unhygienic products like newspapers dried leaves and clothes a 2020 report from markets research firm Research and Markets said .

But growing awareness about intimate hygiene and sanitary products has helped the market for feminine hygiene products in India. The feminine hygiene market is projected to reach INR 58.62 billion ($809 million) by 2024 in India clocking a compound annual growth rate of about 14.9 percent during 2019-2024 according to the report.

“India has the largest percentage of girls quitting higher studies India has the lowest percentage of adoption of sanitary products and India has the lowest percentage of working women” Kelshikar said.

“Whenever we spoke about sanitization we only spoke about villages and slums. But urban women from the ages of 4-60 the moment they step out of their homes the hygiene facility is zero” he said. “The journey [of Woloo] or thought process started from here.”

India has poor public sanitation facilities. In his attempt to address the situation Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the Swachh Bharat or Clean India initiative to build 111 million toilets predominantly in rural India in 2014.

The lack of safe and hygienic toilet facilities exposes women to health risks and gender-based violence. Woloo is not the first organization to focus on women’s sanitation facilities. There have been several initiatives from state governments and private players to address this persistent problem.

Telangana a southern Indian state launched ‘She Toilets’ in 2016 with a toilet diaper changing station and a vending machine for sanitary pads. Over 7010 such toilets have been built in the state according to the government.

A Hyderabad-based startup called Loocafe was started in 2017 to provide free public luxury washrooms to challenge the poor perception of Indian public toilets. Loocafe has teamed up with the Chennai city corporation to build Loocafes in five areas in the southern city.

Launched In 2016 Ti Toilet — which means her in Marathi — is a start-up that converts old buses into washrooms-on-wheels in Maharashtra’s Pune city. For a nominal fee of INR 5 ($0.06) women can use toilet facilities and buy sanitary napkins and diapers.

Multiplex cinema chain PVR’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiative PVR NEST has Pink Toilets that provide safe toilets a private play area for children and sanitary napkins.

Woloo brought the concept of powder room as a first. Its business model focuses on the 150 million-strong urban women population in India and is two-fold. The first is an aggregation model which is the powder-room; a physical outlet with a washroom a café a changing room a convenience store and a diaper changing facility with Wi-Fi and CCTVs.

“That’s our infrastructure model but that was not sufficient. So another way we looked at it is can we create an Oyo or Airbnb of toilets?” Kelshikar said.

To that end Woloo launched a beta app on Android’s Play Store on March 8 to help women locate and use the nearest washroom.

Mumbai-based Supriya Jan an activist with grassroots organization Coro India’s Right To Pee campaign  was invited to visit Woloo’s first powder-room in Thane in 2019.

“Anywhere new things come up we just go and meet people specifically if it’s for women and done by women” Jan told Zenger News. “Our experience was good. In a market where people go for shopping in the same line having a Woloo is a relief.”

“We spoke with women auto-rickshaw drivers and other people who were accessing the powder-room. It’s a good effort. We visited when it started and it was very new. It’s been almost two years and now they need to get people’s feedback. Who are the people who use it? We are looking at different levels we can’t put all women in one box” Jan said.

Woloo wants its powder rooms to be near locations like train and bus stations markets places of worship and colleges to increase accessibility.

But the Thane facility was the first and last powder-room opened two years ago. To push ahead Woloo is now offering franchising opportunities to women entrepreneurs who want to run powder rooms. The company has also reached out to corporations asking them to enroll their employees for a free trial.

Kelshikar is hopeful that in six months Woloo will be operational in five more cities including Pune. “We will be in 100 cities in three years with 100000 powder rooms” he said.

“The way we have designed the unit economics of the model is every powder room is cash positive in 18 months. We are asset-light with the aggregation model. It’s asset-light because everything is franchised. Hygiene dignity for every woman is the mission.”

Woloo’s newly launched app is a subscription-based model with a one-month free trial after which it costs INR 99 ($1.4) a month totaling INR 118 ($1.6) after adding a goods and services tax. The store in Thane has 1200 subscribers.

The retail stores are one part of Woloo’s model the other is listing hygienic washrooms on the app by giving certifications to restaurants QSR (quick service restaurants) schools offices and retail outlets that have sanitation facilities.

The start-up even offers cashback. “You can go to say a McDonald’s or anywhere you can get yourself navigated there the Woloo app gives you 10 points and the app asks you to rate the facility. You can redeem the points from the stores. We are a retail company hygiene access is a tool to drive in customers” Kelshikar told Zenger News.

In recent years Indian women have been big spenders in the retail market.

“In online retail the transaction takes place at a virtual level so there’s no problem” K.S. Chandrasekhar professor and dean at Institute of Management in Kerala told Zenger News. “It’s offline retail where women face issues. If you look at the entire retail structure it’s male-centric.” Chandrasekhar co-authored a research paper on the ‘Changing Roles of Women and the Implications on Retail Strategies’ in 2019.

Woloo also has an exclusive association with the Toilet Board Coalition  a global body under the World Bank for the Woloo Assurance of Hygiene certification.

“We created a unique property which is a hygiene certification it’s like the ‘Michelin star of toilets’. This is non-existent worldwide we have a patent” Kelshikar said.

No hard feelings I’m just locked into the Apple ecosystem.

Yet I finished the review on the Amazon Halo… and it’s still on my wrist months later. Here’s why I’m wearing two fitness wearables at the same time – and why you might want to too.

Let’s get one thing straight: I’m not advocating for wearing two Apple Watches or even any two smartwatches. Each of my wearables offers something the other does not and given the Halo doesn’t have a screen the Apple Watch is the only one grabbing my attention – though it still feels a little silly to wear two devices at once.

There are big advantages to sporting two wearables that have different approaches to tracking activity and here’s my argument for why you’d want to dual wield wearables too.

One active one passive

As previously mentioned there’s a reason only one of my wearables has a display: I only want my notifications and text previews going to one wrist-mounted tracker. I can’t begin to imagine how dorky it would look if I had to check both wrists to see which got my call.

To put it simply: it’s nice to have two wearables but only need to fuss with one.

When I do head out for a run or lift weights or sit down with some YouTube yoga it’s nice to only have to activate workout tracking on the Apple Watch – the Halo automatically detects when I’ve worked up a sweat and monitors your level of exertion with decent accuracy.

As anyone who’s owned an Apple Watch knows the battery barely lasts a day so I snap it back on its wireless charger any time I’m back working at my desk. Without a screen the Amazon Halo lasts a week before needing to juice up (so long as the oddball voice-analyzing Tone feature is turned off or else that battery life shrinks to two days) so it’s nice to only worry about one wearable during the day.

This keeps my stress minimal making sure my watch and phone are topped off during the day and generally forgetting about the Halo until I want to check what it’s tracked.

Two wearables two approaches to health tracking

When I want to pay attention to my progress in the middle of a workout and immediately after I’ve pounded the pavement I’ve got the Apple Watch. When I want to escape the grind of daily calorie/fitness/standing goals I’ve got the Amazon Halo. That tracks health on a week-long basis with two scores: fitness and sleep displaying big numbers to gauge my progress at a glance and more complex results if I want to delve deeper.

That’s an arbitrary ‘if’ – some weeks I just want to focus on daily goals tracked by my Apple Watch and easily visible on my iPhone’s big iOS 14 Fitness App widget but feel secure knowing that the Halo is tracking my less immediate goals in the background. On the other hand it’s good to let go of the grind of the Fitness App’s relentless daily calorie and exercise goals to see the bigger week-long picture of the Halo app’s Activity score.

(Image credit: Future)

I don’t necessarily put more faith in one metric over another but it’s nice to have both as motivating goals especially to get me out of the house when working from home. I can either see my weekly progress via Halo Activity score or look at the Calendar feature in the Apple Fitness app to see my streak. On any given day one of those is bound to spur me on to get another run in.

(Image credit: Future)

Likewise I flip between both approaches to sleep tracking from day to day. Sometimes I like seeing the Halo’s Sleep score that shows a graph of how long I spent in REM Light and Deep sleep states as well as intermittent waking periods; others I prefer Apple Health app’s weekly or monthly glances at sleep length. Both show me patterns though I tend to prefer Amazon’s approach as it has a more insightful breakdown of my sleep activity with explanations of each stage.

(Image credit: Future)

It helps that all the Halo’s information is only stored and visible in the Amazon Halo app; the Apple Watch 5 stores workout activity in the Fitness app and also tracks my sleep but I keep forgetting that the latter records are stored in the Health app’s Sleep section. It’s a bit annoying for those results to be divided and leads me to typically ignore the multitude of other features in the Health app (like mindfulness activity and so on) in my focus on workout results.

(Image credit: Future)

Two fitness services too

Lastly the Amazon Halo comes with six months of its premium service – essentially the full functionality of the wearable including its complex fitness and sleep scores as well as workout mini-classes provided by existing services like Orangetheory 8fit and Openfit. (Without this subscription the Halo only tracks basic health metrics like steps and heart rate.) The Apple Watch on the other hand has access to Apple Fitness Plus were I to pay for its monthly subscription.

Getting the former with essentially six months of trial service is a nice bonus given the latter may be hefty on top of the Apple Watch 5’s price retailing for $399 / £399 / AU$649 though it’s been replaced by the Apple Watch 6 on Apple’s website. But the Amazon Halo is a reasonably affordable add-on at $99 (roughly £75 AU$140) and with six months of fitness classes and other extras it’s not too bad of an add-on to your fitness game.

But if one wanted to get a secondary fitness wearable one of the more minimalist choices from our best cheap fitness trackers is probably the way to go – and while they might not offer the idiosyncratic tracking of the Amazon Halo they do have longer battery life than most smartwatches and track in the background while you’re paying attention to your main wearable which I’ve found to be the key.

Just don’t get one that shows notifications from your phone – you’ll only want to worry about one of your wrists buzzing with missives and messages from the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Nhc2Utc3R1ZGllcy90cmlwbGVsaWZ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TripleLift Case Study,"Adjusting Advertising to Meet Evolving TV-Watching Habits

With offices across the globe TripleLift invents and scales consumer-centric advertising formats across desktop mobile and video. The company started with native programmatic advertising in 2012 but has expanded into display branded content video and TV advertising across 13 formats. Now TripleLift creates integrated ad experiences in OTT and streaming TV. As streaming and OTT TV services become the norm consumers are no longer accepting the old model of 8–15 minutes of commercials per half hour of TV. Product placement can reach a higher number of consumers when they are most engaged. But the logistics are difficult: traditional brand integration for TV shows and media is a long and expensive manual process. “Brands have to call a media company or TV network and work with ad salespeople” says Michael Shields general manager of connected TV business at TripleLift. “These deals have very long lead times and for execution a brand has to remain involved from preproduction to production filming and postproduction revisions. It takes a lot of people in coordination.” To solve these issues TripleLift set out to create a programmatic targeted advertising solution for OTT environments by building on AWS which it had already used for a decade. “Our pioneering postproduction solution renders brands and products in postproduction into TV shows” explains Shields. “Now marketers don’t have to have physical products on set or adhere to production schedules. They can more closely match where their products are integrated into shows so they can tie their advertising expenditure to their integration expenditure.” By monetizing previously untouched potential advertising time this technology creates a new revenue source for streaming services and production companies which are now able to share in the upside of a hit show.

One of TripleLift’s premier partners is food and lifestyle brand Tastemade which has now deployed TripleLift ad experiences in over 200 episodes of its programming. “TripleLift’s deep learning–based video analysis provides us with a scalable solution for finding thousands of moments for inserting integrated ad experiences in programming supplementing a high-touch marketing function with artificial intelligence” says Jeff Imberman Tastemade’s head of sales and brand partnerships.



Pioneering an Advertising Solution on AWS in Less than 6 Months

Building the infrastructure to analyze videos at scale took TripleLift 5–6 months and it can continuously iterate on that process using Amazon SageMaker which enables users to quickly prepare build train and deploy high-quality ML models. The solution encompasses several steps. First TripleLift acquires rights from programmers so that it can apply edits to their shows. Then it uses computer vision to analyze the video and determine the right moment to insert brands and products. TripleLift can identify objects people text scenes and even activities using Amazon Rekognition which makes it simple to apply image and video analysis through proven highly scalable deep learning technology. Once TripleLift’s creative teams identify where to place products and ad units they perform compositing using cloud-based editing and automation software running on Amazon WorkSpaces—such as Nuke Autodesk Maya and Cinema 4D—to insert brand artwork into each shot. This desktop-as-a-service solution makes it simple to provision either Windows or Linux desktops in just a few minutes and quickly scale to provide thousands of desktops to workers across the globe. The TripleLift solution is much faster at recognizing initial ad opportunities than humans are. “AWS solutions can do the work in about half the time it would take a human to do so manually” says Luis Bracamontes computer vision and ML engineer at TripleLift. “Now our creative team has more time to do creative work not just watch videos.” Another benefit is scalability. “As we receive more volume the solution generates insertions faster. So it both saves time and scales to help us manage high volumes of content” says Bracamontes. The Amazon SageMaker–powered technology further personalizes ad content by deploying numerous iterations of each ad placement. Modified versions of the content are delivered to users programmatically and different users see different versions of the clip. After TripleLift composites branded placements into shots it helps publishers sell personalized targeted placements using its real-time ad marketplace. TripleLift can serve each branded product placement ad by stitching the shots into the streaming feed through server-side ad insertion using AWS Elemental MediaTailor which lets video providers insert individually targeted advertising into their video streams without sacrificing broadcast-level quality of service. “Using existing server-side ad insertion frameworks like AWS Elemental MediaTailor TripleLift can serve these experiences dynamically and with frame-level accuracy to deliver different experiences to different users” says Shields. Serving TV ads dynamically with targeting and audience-based measurement is a fundamental departure from previous methods of TV advertising. And because TripleLift uses its existing digital ad infrastructure it can run the measurement and analytics capabilities that brands expect from digital advertising on streaming TV and OTT video which helps it trace the impact of an ad on brand favorability recall and even sales. “TripleLift can recognize the impression based on the audience profile data it has” says Shields. “The solution can serve different experiences to different users and the whole thing is trackable both to the ad agency and the publisher.”

The fight over forming a union at the hugely profitable tech and retail giant has triggered immense political interest and pushed labor rights on to America’s front pages especially during the coronavirus pandemic when warehouse workers for online retail have become an essential workforce.

Workers’ ballots must reach the National Labor Relations Board regional office in Alabama by 29 March to be counted. A majority of the ballots cast determine the outcome of the election with around 5800 employees eligible to vote.

Ballots for the election went out to workers on 8 February. Amazon’s attempts to delay the vote and force an in-person election were denied by the National Labor Relations Board.

The union effort has received several high profile endorsements including a video released by President Joe Biden asserting his support for workers’ right to organize unions endorsements from several members of Congress including Senator Bernie Sanders and Republican Senator Marco Rubio other labor unions such as the NFL Players Association the MLB Players Association support from Black Lives Matter and several local organizations.

Darryl Richardson a picker who helped start the union organizing drive after reaching out to the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union last year emphasized that the broad support for the unionization effort has helped significantly.

“It made a big difference because we had a lot of employees who didn’t understand or know anything about the union or what the union could bring to the company. With the help of everybody around the world supporting us it did change folks’ ideas on how to vote” said Richardson. “You had employees undecided about it confused about it who were going to vote ‘no’ but now the tables turned and a lot came around and said they’re going to vote ‘yes’.”

The unionization effort in Alabama has amplified broader discussions on Amazon’s role in the growing wealth and income inequality in the US and racial justice issues that have been further exposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Union organizers estimate 85% of workers at the Alabama warehouse are Black. Of Amazon’s workers in the US 27% are Black.

On 17 March the US Senate budget committee held a hearing on the Income and Wealth Inequality Crisis in America where Jennifer Bates a Bessemer Amazon warehouse worker noted during her testimony “we the workers made the billions for Amazon. I often say we are the billionaires – we just don’t get to spend it.”

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos declined an invitation to participate in the hearing.

According to an analysis by the Brookings Institution Amazon’s profits increased by $9.4bn from 2019 and Amazon’s founder and CEO Jeff Bezos saw his net worth increase by nearly $68bn. The report noted Amazon could have quintupled the hazard pay it provided to workers during the pandemic and still exceeded 2019 profits.

Sara Nelson international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA was one of several high profile visitors to the union organizing base at Bessemer through the union election. She noted the Amazon union election in Alabama has broader connotations for the entire US labor movement and the dignity of workers.

“They have turned the whole world’s eyes to Bessemer Alabama and there’s a lot of pride in that” said Nelson. “They’re kicking off a new era of organizing. Whether they get the vote in this election to win or not they’ve already won because they’ve sown into the consciousness of working people everywhere who feel like they don’t have any respect where they live and work and aren’t happy where they are that they don’t have to take it and they actually have a way to fight back.”

Amazon has strongly opposed unionization for years in the US successfully squashing previous unionization attempts in the US though it hasn’t faced an organizing effort at the scale of the Bessemer warehouse.

Richardson and other Amazon workers involved in the union organizing effort have fought for months against an aggressive Amazon anti-union campaign.

Amazon is spending nearly $10000 each day plus expenses on anti-union consultants for the union election as workers faced regular captive-audience meetings encouraging workers to vote against the union have been inundated with anti-union text messages ads flyers posters around the warehouse and an anti-union website was launched. More recently during the election a USPS mailbox was installed at the warehouse and instructions were sent to workers on how to cast ballots in opposition to the union.

A report by the Economic Policy Institute in December 2019 found employers are charged with violating federal law in more than 54% of union elections with large bargaining units and US employers spend roughly $340m annually on consultants who specialize in union avoidance.

Amazon’s anti-union arguments have frequently cited the company’s $15 minimum wage and claimed the company already offers everything a union would provide while emphasizing union dues. A recent New York Times report noted Amazon’s starting pay at $15 an hour is about $3 less than the median wage in the Birmingham Alabama metropolitan area and that workers at nearby warehouses with unionized workforces receive higher pay.

“I truly feel we’re going to win” added Richardson. “If the union comes in the power will split up and people will have a voice. You will have someone represent you to make sure you’re not fired just because they’ll make sure you’re treated fairly working in a safe environment and that promotions are fair. The union can make a difference.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1hem9uLWJlY29tZXMtdGhlLXRvcC1jbG90aGluZy1yZXRhaWxlci1pbi10aGUtdS1zLW91dHNlbGxpbmctd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQtZ2FwLWFuZC1vdGhlcnMtMTE2MTYwMDIxOTfSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9hbWF6b24tYmVjb21lcy10aGUtdG9wLWNsb3RoaW5nLXJldGFpbGVyLWluLXRoZS11LXMtb3V0c2VsbGluZy13YWxtYXJ0LXRhcmdldC1nYXAtYW5kLW90aGVycy0xMTYxNjAwMjE5Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon becomes the top clothing retailer in the U.S. outselling Walmart Target Gap and others,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-becomes-the-top-clothing-retailer-in-the-u-s-outselling-walmart-target-gap-and-others-11616002197 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1hem9uLWJlY29tZXMtdGhlLXRvcC1jbG90aGluZy1yZXRhaWxlci1pbi10aGUtdS1zLW91dHNlbGxpbmctd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQtZ2FwLWFuZC1vdGhlcnMtMTE2MTYwMDIxOTfSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9hbWF6b24tYmVjb21lcy10aGUtdG9wLWNsb3RoaW5nLXJldGFpbGVyLWluLXRoZS11LXMtb3V0c2VsbGluZy13YWxtYXJ0LXRhcmdldC1nYXAtYW5kLW90aGVycy0xMTYxNjAwMjE5Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbWNraW5sZXlwYXJrLm5ld3MvbmV3cy8xNDU4LXNpZ24tcGVybWl0cy1jb25maXJtLWFtYXpvbi1jb21pbmctdG8tMzV0aC1hbmQtYXNobGFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sign Permits Confirm Amazon Coming to 35th and Ashland,"Sign Permits Confirm Amazon Coming to 35th and Ashland

Just-issued sign permits for the last-mile shipping warehouse replacing the former Wrigley factory at West 35th Street and South Ashland Avenue specify that Amazon Inc. will be moving into the site. As listed in the series of eight building permits issued on Friday March 19 2021 the largest sign — at 26 feet wide — will present an Amazon smile logo on the side of the warehouse wall.

Other Amazon-specific permitted signs include those to designate pickup and returns associate entry customer service and ground and directional information. All sign permit descriptions are labeled with the ""Amazon Stockyards"" moniker.

Amazon has not yet officially confirmed their occupancy of the last-mile warehouse in the McKinley Park neighborhood. When contacted last year by this publication the famously reticent company only shared their boilerplate response that they don't discuss their future business planning. They have not replied to more recent press inquiries.

Historic Central Manufacturing District

The last-mile warehouse development project has been under construction since summer 2020. Titled the South Branch Commerce Center the project has NAI Hiffman in a management and marketing role with financing from the Stonemont Financial Group. and development by Karis Industrial (a division of Karis Capital LLC).

Once complete the warehouse will offer more than 260000 square feet of interior space with capacity for dozens of truck docks and parking for hundreds of trailers and car on the 16.38-acre property. The site is part of the original East District of the historic Central Manufacturing District (CMD) now one of Preservation Chicago's top seven most-endangered civic spaces.

As previously reported here in the McKinley Park News a March 12 2021 building permit for data cabling had also identified Amazon as a tenant and other reporting in Chicago media also pointed to Amazon's likely tenancy at the site."

AAL,American Airlines Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS90aGUtY2VvLW9mLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWV4cGxhaW5zLXdoeS1iYWNrLXRvLWZyb250LWJvYXJkaW5nLWRvZXNudC13b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The CEO Of American Airlines Explains Why Back-To-Front Boarding Doesn't Work,"Airlines want to board planes quickly. A short delay has knock-on effects because the next flight is likely delayed and the next flight. Passengers miss their connections bags don’t make their next flight either and crew delayed on one flight delay other flights too (and may even reach their maximum duty hours for the day leading to cancelled flights).

So the science of how to board a plane quickly matters a great deal to the bottom line. Southwest Airlines has said it would cost them 8-10 planes per day just to add “a couple of minutes of block time to each flight in our schedule.”

Every so often airlines tinker with their boarding process trying to speed things up. Southwest tends to board quickly because the order in which a passenger boards determines where they’ll sit on the plane. So they show up at the gate 30 minutes before their flight and they line up in a usually orderly fashion. Airlines with assigned seating do not have that advantage.

One study found an optimal board process would be to board

passengers in a series of waves with the first passengers called to board seated in window seats two rows apart—first 30A then 28A then 26A and so on. Next the same for the other side of the plane (30F 28F 26F). The process continues with odd row window seats on either side middle seats and finally aisle seats. Each person can sit down within moments of one another without getting in anyone’s way. In field tests it proved to be almost twice as fast as most conventional methods and 20% to 30% faster than have-at-it entirely random boarding—which is also faster than the method used by airlines. (He too would board slower passengers requiring assistance first.)

In the real world you can’t do that. Doug Parker explains that there are customer considerations and you can’t just do whatever is best for fast boarding. Especially now you want to socially distance passengers during the boarding process even if most airlines are no longer blocking seats and planes are increasingly full.

He explained in a meeting with flight attendants earlier in the month why American Airlines won’t move to ‘back-to-front’ boarding despite its intuitive appeal:

We have looked at that we’ve studied it and while it may seem better to have people go from back to front ..what you really want to do is window-to-aisle but if you do that you split up families and things. When you do back-to-front there is just as much if not even more in some cases interaction with customers getting up and out of the aisle as there is with our process. So what we choose to do instead is tell our frequent flyers – our elite customers – they can board whenever they like and then we use our normal boarding process. And then we ask when you leave because we have everyone actually window-to-aisle and they’ll leave properly..but we’ve seen no increase in the lack of close interaction by going back-to-front versus the process we use. ..We’ve studied this with operations engineers who go look and watch and we don’t see any material change and in some cases more interaction.

You can’t split up families so the ‘theoretically best boarding order’ doesn’t work. And back-to-front leads to bunching as well. And since those don’t work out as well in practice as in theory their regular boarding process stands.

This is why airlines all tinker with their process from time to time and never stop tinkering because they’re never been able to do much to improve – with few exceptions.

In the early days of Southwest Airlines they struggled financially and returned one of their planes. They kept the bulk of their schedule despite having one fewer aircraft. And to do that they needed to turn planes in 10 minutes. Passengers were deplaning out the rear of the aircraft while new passengers were getting on. Southwest’s cabin crew even do light cleaning of the aircraft between flights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vbXVsdGktYXNzZXQtY2hhbm5lbC9nZXQtcmVhZHktZm9yLWEtZ3JlYXQtYW1lcmljYW4tdHJhdmVsLWFuZC1zcGVuZGluZy1ib29tL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vbXVsdGktYXNzZXQtY2hhbm5lbC9nZXQtcmVhZHktZm9yLWEtZ3JlYXQtYW1lcmljYW4tdHJhdmVsLWFuZC1zcGVuZGluZy1ib29tL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get Ready for a Great American Travel and Spending Boom,"A little over a hundred years ago the United States emerged from the double whammy of a world war and deadly pandemic. Eager to get back to “normal” life Americans went on a decade-long spending splurge buying cars and radios and stocks most for the first time ever.

Although we all know how it ended the Roaring Twenties was largely a product of pent-up demand.

This summer I believe we could see the start of a similar demand-driven economic boom as millions of Americans newly vaccinated and $1400 richer make up for lost time by booking flights and vacations going on cruises taking the family to Disney World and more.

As I shared with you earlier this month close to $18 trillion sit in Americans’ savings accounts right now—a record amount. Much of this cash is just waiting to be unleased into the U.S. economy.

Things are already heading in the right direction. According to CLSA’s proprietary reopening index the U.S. saw the biggest weekly gain since the start of the pandemic up 8% as the number of new daily infections dropped further. Here in Texas all COVID-19 restrictions were lifted 100% last on Wednesday just in time for Spring Break.

Airlines Betting on a Strong Rebound in Summer Bookings

Last week marked the one-year anniversary of the start of the pandemic and if Google Trends data is any indication Americans are ready to travel again. The number of Google queries for online travel agencies Expedia Priceline and Travelocity hit pandemic highs last week as airlines announced new deals and routes.

Low-cost carriers Allegiant and Southwest recently expanded their networks to include 36 new non-stop routes in the former’s case 17 in the latter’s. According to Bloomberg this is the second-largest network expansion in Allegiant’s history and the largest for Southwest since 2013.

Across the Atlantic Lufthansa is also adding to its slate of summer destinations in anticipation of a strong rebound in bookings. Europe’s largest carrier will add around 20 new routes from Frankfurt and 13 from Munich to vacation spots such as the Caribbean Canary Islands and Greece.

Meanwhile credit card data from the end of February shows an uptick in airline booking among older Americans—those most likely to have been fully vaccinated. At a Raymond James conference the CEOs of Delta and Spirit told investors that bookings took a positive turn in mid-February.

Passenger volume in the U.S. is still down about 60% compared to pre-pandemic levels but I expect this to improve the closer we get to vacation season and as more people get their shots. Cowen aviation analyst Helane Becker who helped us launch our airlines ETFs in 2015 told Yahoo Finance that she believed the number of daily passengers would cross above 1 million by March 20. As of March 14 the number exceeded 1 million people for the fourth day straight.

American Airlines is so optimistic of a recovery in summer leisure travel that it just increased the size of its debt financing from $7.5 billion to $10 billion. The debt according to MarketWatch is underpinned by the carrier’s $20 billion AAdvantage loyalty program.

Another sign that airlines are sensing a shift in Americans’ appetite for air travel? Budget carrier Frontier filed to IPO last Monday saying that it was “well positioned to take advantage of the anticipated demand recovery as vaccine distribution continues.” Rival carrier Sun Country also provided new details for its own upcoming IPO on Monday telling investors it seeks to raise some $200 million to help pay off pandemic crisis loans from the federal government.

$15 Billion Stimulus for Airlines and Airline Contractors $8 Billion for Airports

The U.S. aviation industry is set to receive another round of fresh stimulus now that President Joe Biden has signed the $1.9 trillion rescue package.

American and United immediately dropped plans to lay off or furlough a combined 27000 workers.

Included in the bill is approximately $15 billion for airlines and airline contractors $8 billion for airports and concessionaires.

As expected U.S. airline and airport trade groups were quick to praise the rescue package. Airlines for America (A4A) wrote that it’s “vital to have our employees on the job and ready to assist as our nation prepares to move forward from this crisis” while the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) said that the amount earmarked for airports “underscores the enormous financial impact that the pandemic is having on airports and the entire aviation ecosystem.”

How the Semiconductor Chip Shortage Will Contribute to Inflation

One of the anticipated consequences of economic reopening is higher inflation. Add trillions of dollars in new debt and money-printing and inflation could end up being hotter than any of us expected.

Last week the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the consumer price index (CPI) rose slightly to 1.7% year-over-year in February up from 1.4% in January.

Of the items tracked by the BLS used car and truck prices advanced the most at 9.3%. This was the sixth straight month that used vehicle prices jumped more than 9% compared to last year.

The reason for this is simple economics: Too few vehicles available for sale during the pandemic and too many buyers.



In a research report CLSA wrote that the chip shortage “should ultimately hasten electrification of the global automotive industry.” With chip supply in question automakers are shifting priority to the products highest in demand right now i.e. electric vehicles (EVs). A number of companies including Ford General Motors and Toyota have extended plant shutdowns due to limited chip availability.The price hike is likely to continue with the global shortage in semiconductor chips which are used extensively in automotive manufacturing. The “smarter” our cars and trucks get the more chips are needed.

As a result prices for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will certainly face upward pressure as fewer of them roll off factory floors.

The moral to the story? If you’re in the market for a new car or truck you might want to make a purchase sooner rather than later.

Ethereum Mining Revenue Broke Above $1 Billion for the First Time

The chip shortage has hit other industries of course including crypto mining. Demand from miners is so high right now that chipmaker Nvidia announced it will be releasing a new series of semiconductors designed specifically for mining Ethereum.

In other Ethereum-related news Coin Metrics data shows that monthly revenue generated by Ethereum miners hit a record $1.37 billion in February an incredible 1300% increase from the same month in 2020 and a 65% increase from the previous month.

Miner revenue includes inflation rewards (block subsidy) and transaction fees. Miners are paid rewards in the blockchain’s native currency for producing valid blocks and processing transactions.

This is very good news for HIVE Blockchain Technologies the only publicly traded crypto miner that mines both Bitcoin and Ethereum using 100% green energy.

On Thursday and Friday the Department of Transportation unveiled the latest round of Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP) applicants. The program is a grant designed to help small communities address airfare and air service issues unlike Essential Air Service (EAS) due to the lesser-known program not being a direct subsidy and having broader eligibility.

To be eligible for the SCASDP communities must not have air service or must use their grant for indirectly subsidizing air service obtain service to an underserved airport or other ways to improve air service. These communities must not be larger than what the FAA classifies as a “small hub airport” have not received a SCASDP grant within the last ten years nor be a part of the EAS program.

Around 70 small-to-medium-sized cities have applied for this grant to improve their air service. Among these applicants some have expressed interest from two of the newest airline startups in the U.S. Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways.

Breeze Airways

Recently Breeze Airways the startup led by David Neeleman — the man behind JetBlue WestJet and Azul — received government approval for interstate travel.

Due to this the anticipation of the airline’s route network and its fixation on serving underserved cities have risen. In a previous interview with AirlineGeeks David Neelman stated “[it’s] much like we got in Brazil — there were a lot of cities that didn’t have nonstop services between them so there are about five hundred routes that we’re looking at and don’t have nonstop services.”

“In March 2021 Breeze plans to introduce scheduled service on three routes from a southeastern United States airport to four points northeast and from another airport farther south to four points in the northeast southeast and the southern plains” the airline hinted in a filing last year. “In the subsequent months Breeze will increase the number of destinations from the two initial airports and open another airport in the southeastern United States with service to points in the midwest southern plains and northeast.

Beginning in July Breeze plans to initiate service from another airport in the Southeast to points in the Mid-Atlantic Northeast and Southern plains while increasing the number of destinations from its initial airports. In October Breeze plans to begin service from two additional southeastern airports with service primarily to the northeast.”

Islip N.Y. is a heavily rumored Breeze destination. In a filing for the city’s SCASDP grant a timeline for the entrant of a new carrier matches with the estimated launch schedule of Breeze Airways. According to the launch timeline the airline will announce its intent to start service on April 16 file its schedule on May 3 and launch flights on June 14. Furthermore the filing contains two redacted letters of support from the airline in question which could indicate that Breeze Airways is hiding its future route announcements to build more anticipation for its low-cost carrier network.



If these dates are similar to Breeze’s timeline airline industry stakeholders will see a mid-June launch of the low-cost carrier. For reference Islip is seeking $1.2 million in funding for “innovative marketing and cost abatement” for service between the airport and unserved cities outside the Eastern Time Zone.

Additionally the airline expressed interest in two cities Bentonville Ark. and Norfolk Vir. Bentonville is seeking $250000 in federal funding part of a $1.5 million incentive to recruit additional low-cost carrier service to the airport including a revenue guarantee for the carrier. In its grant application the airport expects a September route announcement with a route launch by December 2021. Furthermore Bentonville expects to provide waivers on airport rent and landing fees using the calculation of 16 flights per week.

In a letter of support the airline states “Breeze Airways is interested in serving a number of unserved routes from XNA. While we cannot guarantee Breeze will initiate new service should XNA receive SCASDP funding in the form of a revenue guarantee it would greatly enhance the probability of new service.”

Meanwhile in the letter of support to Norfolk Breeze Airways express the same sentiment. For reference Norfolk is pursuing $400000 in federal funding with a total of $800000 looking to grow air service in general. Also New Haven Conn. mentioned Breeze Airways as a startup with “considerable interest.” In a previous SCASDP application from 2019 the airport stated that they had multiple meetings with the low-cost carrier with assurances that the Airbus A220 would work from their “short runway.”

Avelo Airlines

Avelo Airlines will be running with a similar business model though with a larger aircraft the Boeing 737-800. While little is known about the airline it is based in Houston and plans to have one of its first bases in Burbank Calif.

The carrier expressed interest in two destinations on both sides of the United States. Firstly the airline is targeting service to Ogden Utah a city north of Salt Lake City. In Ogden Utah’s application to the Department of Transportation the airport wants service to the San Francisco Bay area with Avelo’s Boeing 737-800.

If the application is accepted Ogden would receive $800000 in SCASDP funding and provide a revenue guarantee of $950000. Also substantial waivers for landing fees and rent will be imposed with a launch in March 2022.

Avelo Airlines branded as the former Xtra Airways in the application states “…XTRA Airways (‘XTRA’) supports the plan to provide the air service described therein namely nonstop service between OGD and the San Francisco Bay area… However due to economic risk in starting a new market our support is contingent on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s grant offer. The amount of the grant shall be sufficient to fund the elements of the application for which federal funds are specifically requested.”

In addition to service with Breeze New Haven Conn. expects “considerable interest” from Avelo Airlines. The airport expects the carrier to use the airport as a potential focus city for their Northeast operation. It is stated that the airline was working with Avelo on service to Chicago and Charlotte though it is unknown to what extent the service will be. If the grant is accepted the airport will target a fall 2021 launch. Despite New Haven having only a 5600-foot runway Avelo assures that the airport’s current runway is capable of supporting its operation.

In another letter of support Avelo Airlines adds “…XTRA Airways (“XTRA”) extends its enthusiastic support for the HVN grant application for improved air service…HVN fits well into XTRA’s strategy of serving secondary airports of major metropolitan areas that lack adequate air service…The start date of the proposed service hinges on funding and implementation of the applicant’s air service improvement strategy which is designed to reduce the economic risk associated with initiating the service described.”

The start-up airline is also looking to add service to Phoenix Ariz. according to sources familiar with the company.

It’s not because of any training program or incentives that the company has set up.

One of the most frustrating thing I hear from cabin crew all the time is about the small percentage of their colleagues who are slackers who perform poorly and do as little work as possible (increasing the workload for everyone else). This is frustrating because there’s usually very little consequence. And seeing poor performers do just as well as those who provide exemplary service is demoralizing.

This isn’t strictly a union versus non-union issue. While in general Delta’s non-union flight attendants have seemed happier with their jobs and friendlier to customers than American’s Southwest Airlines unionized flight attendants are generally more than pleasant too. Southwest does however manage to push out disgruntled employees about 1/7th of 1% per year.

U.S. airlines mostly discipline for attendance not poor service and there’s little they can do to change this culture – or so it seems. United Airlines is actually trying something new: sharing passenger feedback from each flight directly with cabin crew.

United surveys passengers on their flight experience – satisfaction with service whether they were thanked whether cabin crew were visible throughout the flight and whether they were friendly. You might think that only people who complain fill out surveys but “In 2020 United flight attendants received over 20000 compliments.”

United is starting a test April 1 to share survey feedback with Chicago and Honolulu-based cabin crew flying certain routes

The airline will roll out surveys in-app and via seat back entertainment screens.

The question – and it’s a really interesting one – is will direct customer feedback (anonymized after a flight) be taken constructively causing employees to try to do better? Will positive feedback reinforce an employee’s desire to perform well? It’s still not a monetary reward. Their position in the company isn’t necessarily enhanced. But we all like positive feedback and to do those things which garners it. And if it’s clear how to avoid negative feedback that could shape behavior as well.

This could easily go wrong and I wonder whether United will actually censor some of the comments. Feedback provided anonymously via a keyboard can be mean-spirited and foul-mouthed. Believe me I get some every day!

Still in a world where U.S. airlines have few tools for encouraging good service and competing forces that demoralize crew into working as little as some of their colleagues get away with this is an interesting experiment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9yb3dsYW5kLWJyb3duLTc0Ny_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Was Rowland Brown And What Was His Connection To The Boeing 747?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9yb3dsYW5kLWJyb3duLTc0Ny_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Offshore Wind in the Atlantic Will Be Big. Really Big,"Off the coast of New Jersey these days surveillance vessels hired by European energy companies are taking measurements of the ocean depths and underwater research drones are analyzing water temperatures to accumulate data on the Mid-Atlantic ""Cold Pool.""

Onshore in places like the Port of Paulsboro along the Delaware River south of Camden and Philadelphia labor unions port officials and politicians are angling for new marine terminals to build and ship off massive steel monopiles.

And in weekly board meetings state-appointed officials in charge of the Garden State's public utilities are discussing massive overhauls to the power grid and many miles of new transmission lines.

Billions of dollars will be invested in the next several years — at sea and on land — to erect hundreds of wind turbines miles from the coast in order to bring New Jersey 7500 megawatts of renewable energy. That's enough to power half of the state's 1.5 million homes.

Eight other states along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have embarked on similar endeavors preparing for the arrival of a new era in American energy.

""Wind energy is going to be real. It’s just a question of how much"" EnvironmentNJ executive director Doug O'Malley said. ""Flooding down the shore is real. Our number one priority is how our coastal communities are going to be a generation from now. Who knows if we’re here in 2050? We need to study this as much as possible but also understand we need to look at the full picture of climate change.""

Offshore Wind Farms: The Lease Areas and Developers

Seventeen federally leased areas are off the coasts of eight U.S. states as of December 2021. Click on each lease site to see how many turbines are expected or estimated to which developer they belong and how much power will be generated. Turbine totals are either based on developers’ proposals or estimated using power generated by the largest turbine currently on the market.

Dire predictions of climate change and how to most quickly pivot to clean energy have fueled the embrace of offshore wind. And while most stakeholders seem on board with the nearly Eiffel Tower-sized turbines the fishing industry remains a holdout. Meanwhile the cumulative effect of so many turbines spread across the Mid-Atlantic Bight remains unknown. The bight stretches from the Outer Banks of North Carolina to the Gulf of Maine.

Only seven wind turbines currently rotate in American waters but more than 1500 are in planning or development stages from North Carolina to Massachusetts according to an NBC10 Philadelphia analysis of the federally leased areas and the 17 projects currently in development. The analysis used data from federal and state agencies as well as individual project proposals. Some proposals have cited specifically how many turbines will be built. For others an estimate was made using the megawatts approved for a project divided by the energy generated by the most powerful turbines on the market. Currently General Electric is able to construct a 12-megawatt giant called the Haliede X that can power a single-family home for two days with just a single rotation of its blades.

The turbines will occupy areas of the continental shelf encompassing 2722 square miles — larger than the state of Delaware — and most energy experts believe the ones currently in planning stage are only the first wave.

""We’re talking about a huge amount of offshore resources"" Theodore Paradise senior vice president of transmission engineering firm Anbaric said. ""We’re talking about massively more than these numbers. (States are) making what feels very big in procurement targets.""

Several developers all European have submitted construction proposals to the federal government to build out wind farms by the late 2020s. None has been approved yet even though the first few have sat in a queue at the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management since 2018.

The first farm in the federal queue Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts was given its final environmental impact study by BOEM this month and industry leaders now believe the federal permitting process will pick up under President Joe Biden.

The first wave of offshore wind farms are being considered for the Mid-Atlantic between North Carolina and Massachusetts. Advocates are pushing for hundreds of the nearly Eiffel Tower-sized turbines by 2030. Here's why they are considered key to America's energy future.

“The United States is poised to become a global clean energy leader” U.S. Interior Department Assistant Secretary Laura Daniel Davis said in announcing Vineyard Wind's environmental approval on March 8. “To realize the full environmental and economic benefits of offshore wind we must work together to ensure all potential development is advanced with robust stakeholder outreach and scientific integrity.”

Vineyard estimates turbines could begin powering Massachusetts homes in mid-2024 according to its most recent timeline presented to BOEM.

Politicians environmentalists and European companies have invested interest in the plans. Big issues still to confront include lucrative North Atlantic fishing concerns; ecological effects on what is known as the Mid-Atlantic Bight's ""Cold Pool""; and the fundamental remaking of power grids that bring the electricity into homes and businesses of 100 million Americans.

Rising Heights of Offshore Wind Turbines

Wind turbines in the ocean are much bigger than the on-land versions that dominate the landscape in places like the American Midwest. Here is how the largest turbine on the market General Electric's 12MW Haliede X compares in size to some well-known structures.

What is the Mid-Atlantic Bight's 'Cold Pool'? How Would 1000s of Turbines Affect It?

Every year off the coast of the eastern United States from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Cape Cod in Massachusetts forms a unique oceanographic feature called ""the Cold Pool.""

It's a layering of water temperatures that makes for breathtakingly cold water near the ocean floor and much warmer water near the surface and beaches. The effect is called stratification and it is created each spring peaks each summer and mixes up once again each fall.

The stark difference in water temperature during the late spring and summer months makes it one of Earth's unique marine ecosystems. It gives the continental shelf off the northeastern United States a diversity of fauna that has persisted for centuries. Fishermen and scientists alike credit the Cold Pool with powering the renowned fisheries of New England New Jersey and Maryland.

No one knows the extent to which thousands of wind turbines would have on the stratification process or if the twirling horizon-scrapers will affect the Cold Pool at all.

For much of the last decade offshore wind advocates analyzed the potential — and ecological effects — of the renewable energy at the individual turbine level and at the farm level.

A third way of looking at the new energy source has only recently emerged.

""The third level is what happens if you have 10 of these wind facilities that are near each other?"" said Josh Kohut a marine biologist at Rutgers University's Center for Ocean Observing Leadership.

Kohut and his colleagues at RU COOL released a research paper in late January that looked for potential effects on the Cold Pool through the lens of European offshore wind projects.

""The scale of the impact of these wind farms has the potential to alter the unique and delicate oceanographic conditions along the expansive Atlantic continental shelf'"" the report summary reads.

Northern Europe from Scotland to Germany has a two-decade head start on the United States in the offshore wind realm. More than 5000 turbines currently operate off the coasts of eight countries there pumping 25 gigawatts of energy into power grids.

The Rutgers team studied the continent's 110 farms looking for similar ecological areas to compare with the Mid-Atlantic Bight and its Cold Pool.

Two places in particular stood out: the Irish Sea off Scotland and the German Bight in the North Sea.

But the report found that differences in the stratification of the European bodies of water make the research conducted off the other continent difficult to directly compare with the Mid-Atlantic Bight.

[To read the FULL REPORT by Kohut and his colleagues CLICK HERE.]

""The potential for these multiple wind energy arrays to alter oceanographic processes and the biological systems that rely on them is possible"" the report summary said. ""However a great deal of uncertainty remains about the nature and scale of these interactions.""

The Rutgers team concluded more data and analysis is needed. Kohut said technology makes it possible to get a better sense of the cumulative effect of the Cold Pool in the next couple years.

He said his team continues looking at European wind farms' effects on ocean stratification there while also deploying an underwater drone off of the New Jersey coast to get data from the Cold Pool.

""Our objective is to get the latest and best science available to the people making these decisions"" Kohut said.

The European study was funded by the Science Center for Marine Fisheries a group with fishing industry affiliations that seeks to promote sustainable fisheries.

""We didn’t know the scale and depth and rate at which wind mills would develop"" SCEMFIS chairman Greg DiDomenico of Cape May N.J.-based Lund Fisheries said in an interview. ""It’s now at a tremendous pace. We have not heard what will be the impact of that type of development on the Mid-Atlantic ecosystem. And if in fact it’s wind mills at any cost then someone needs to tell us that.""

O'Malley the executive director of EnvironmentNJ which advocates for environmental issues in the Garden State said more studies on the ecological impact of offshore wind is welcome. But he added studies have been going on for years already and ""the Cold Pool is going to be affected by climate change like the rest of ocean"" if nothing is done to stem the reliance on fossil fuels.

""We’ve been strongly advocating for offshore wind and also for looking at all the site locations and the impacts"" O'Malley said. ""The ocean is a big place but also a busy place. The hope is there is a way to accommodate for offshore wind and also the ecology of the ocean.""

A Fundamental Change to the Way Power Is Delivered

For the last century the energy grid has connected power plants fueled by coal oil and gas to homes and businesses through a network of utility lines and power substations. In more recent decades nuclear plants helped wean the country off of a strictly fossil fuel diet. Still every decade or so a meltdown — whether it was in Pennsylvania or Russia or Japan — as well as the fossil fuel industry hindered a full embrace of nuclear power.

Traditionally power plants have been closer to the center of the country — places like Ohio West Virginia western Pennsylvania Tennessee where fossil fuels were mined.

At a conference of offshore wind industry leaders and experts in energy infrastructure hosted by the New Jersey Board of Utilities in late February one utility executive said the power grid is ""used to a west-east flow of energy"" and ""as we move into this new era we’re going to encounter a very different set of problems.""

Re-routing the flow of energy is not a cheap problem.

In traditional terms energy experts say adding a mile of transmission line can cost $1 million. Many miles of new offshore transmission lines will be part of the cost to connect to offshore wind farms. But it won't be the only cost.

Power grid operators like the PJM Interconnection have to upgrade many of the onshore power substations where the new wind farms off the coast will connect to the grid. PJM is a regional transmission operator headquartered in Valley Forge Pa. that connects power to 65 million Americans in 13 states. It was formed in the late 1920s when New Jersey and Pennsylvania combined their public utility grid and grew to incorporate other states as far west as Ohio and Tennessee and south to parts of North Carolina. New York state has its own system as does New England.

The cost to upgrade substations up and down the coast will likely run into the billions for each state.

Take New Jersey where two would-be projects Ørsted's Ocean Wind and EDF Renewable/Shell New Energies' Atlantic Shores have already put in requests to PJM for substation upgrades.

Their requests collectively add up to $3.5 billion according to an NBC10 Philadelphia review of wind energy entries in the PJM New Service Queue.

And that cost is only for projects that would provide up to 3000 megawatts from wind farms less than half the 7500 megawatts from offshore wind that Gov. Phil Murphy has mandated by 2035.

Officials with New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities and PJM have told NBC10 Philadelphia that all of those costs will never be realized. They say that prudent planning now in order to integrate the eventual 7500 megawatts will save consumers in the long run.

The $3.5 billion in current requests according to BPU and PJM officials will change or disappear altogether when some of the first upgrades are completed. They also say the total doesn't reflect the work being done now to avoid ""pancaking"" upgrades to the transmission grid.

New Jersey became the first state in November 2020 to sign a ""state agreement"" approach to offshore wind upgrades with PJM. The initiative is designed to account for future offshore wind projects that are not yet proposed.

“We are blazing the trail as we walk"" BPU manager of regulatory affairs Joseph DeLosa said. ""We’re the first do the state agreement approach with PJM.""

Additionally developers will pick up part of the tab for transmission upgrades and spread that cost across many years officials with BPU and the state's public utilities say.

“Everything we’re doing all of our clean energy objectives taking the state to 100% clean energy depends on the transmission system being able to take the power to customer"" BPU's general counsel Abraham Silverman said. ""If you don’t have that we’re just really behind.”

Infrastructure experts believe the upgrades in the end are integrating a renewable energy with more reliable market prices than fossil fuels.

""Is this going to be $3 or $4 billion? That seems like a lot of money but it's (spread) over decades"" Paradise the senior vice president at Anbaric said. ""The exciting thing for customers is the power you get from that is a free source.""

He noted that the biggest cost in any energy user's bill now is the price of the commodity itself be it oil or gas. That won't be the case with offshore wind.

""Wind is free. You don’t have to fill up the tank everyday"" Paradise said.

The Last Holdouts: Fishermen Versus Offshore Wind Farms

Tom Dameron who lives in South Philadelphia and runs the commercial fleet for Surfside Seafood in Port Norris N.J. fished and captained boats for decades in New Jersey and Alaska.

He decided a few years ago to get involved in advocating for his industry in issues like catch quotas and offshore wind.

Dameron said fishing interests seem to be low on the list of priorities for federal and state agencies that collaborated during the creation of the lease areas.

""What’s been disappointing about it is if you look at the lease areas and the players involved you know they want to keep them out of flyways of birds and not seeing them from the beach"" he said.

Commercial fishermen say they are concerned about the ability to trawl in the lease areas and BOEM has adjusted developers' plans to require wind turbines be at least one square mile apart.

Still boat captains are not convinced that spreading them apart will be enough to safely fish the lease grounds.

""I’ve had friends lose boats and lose crews in these areas. To put these at a mile apart and think that a commercial fisherman with a 150-ft boat can continue operating in these areas I don’t know"" Dameron said.

Annie Hawkins executive director of the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance which advocates for fishermen says she isn't sure how states are cooperating with each other as officials try to line up wind developments to meet clean energy goals.

""There is the state’s desire for wind energy"" Hawkins said using New York state and its goal of 9000 megawatts by 2035 as an example: ""Okay we need lease areas to accommodate New York to get those 9 gigawatts. But there is not a national comprehensible strategy.""

A BOEM spokesman said the federal agency which is part of the Department of the Interior now weighs the benefits and detriments of every proposed wind farm at each of the three levels that the Rutgers researcher Josh Kohut described: turbine farm all farms.

""BOEM assesses the impacts of offshore wind projects individually and cumulatively through the National Environmental Policy Act environmental assessment process. These assessments use the best scientific information available regarding potential impacts of proposed offshore wind energy facilities"" BOEM spokesman Stephen Boutwell said in an email. ""This includes studies from European offshore wind farms academic research and BOEM’s own Environmental Studies Program. As part of BOEM's Environmental Studies Program BOEM invests in environmental studies to understand the potential effects of leasing on the human and natural environment based on the feedback we get from stakeholders – including studies on oceanographic processes like the Mid-Atlantic Cold Pool.""

The federal efforts combined with the ambitions of states have not yet convinced fishermen that their industry is being considered fully according to DiDomenico the SCEMFIS chairman who advocates for Mid-Atlantic fisheries.

""I would much rather have someone look at me and go 'You’re getting wind mills and we don’t care.' I would have much more respect for people"" he said. ""But there are legitimate ecosystem concerns that appear to be I guess viewed as not important because we’re going to save the planet.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlaXJ0b25kYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wMy9hcm15LW9mLXN5Y2Ftb3JlLXlvdXRoLWNlbnRlci12b2x1bnRlZXJzLXRvLXJlY2VpdmUtc3RhdGUtYXdhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Army of Sycamore Youth Center volunteers to receive state award,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2021/03/army-of-sycamore-youth-center-volunteers-to-receive-state-award/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlaXJ0b25kYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wMy9hcm15LW9mLXN5Y2Ftb3JlLXlvdXRoLWNlbnRlci12b2x1bnRlZXJzLXRvLXJlY2VpdmUtc3RhdGUtYXdhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHktam91cm5hbC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9ncmVlbi1kcmVhbXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green Dreams,"Mark P. Mills is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a faculty fellow at Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science where he co-directs an Institute on Manufacturing Science and Innovation.

What impact will Biden’s energy policies have on global climate?

The short answer: none. The key issue is unrelated to anyone’s opinion about global warming. What matters is whether the kinds of efforts proposed can arithmetically make any meaningful difference in world energy use. I emphasize “world.” Cancelling the Keystone Pipeline for example didn’t eliminate oil use. It just shifted where it’s shipped to and how it’s shipped—somewhere else and more expensively. And even if efforts to strangle Keystone’s output were successful eliminating that much oil use wouldn’t change anything in the global context. For example China plans to build more coal power plants that will in carbon terms equal about 20 Keystone Pipelines. And about one-third of those new coal plants are already under construction. That’s just China. Similar plans for more coal and more oil and more natural gas use are afoot in South Asia and the rest of the world.

The administration has proposed spending $2 trillion on its climate programs. Does this represent the true cost of “decarbonizing” energy production in the U.S.?

That’s not even close to the true cost either directly or indirectly in terms of overall economic consequences. Looking just at the electric grid which accounts for about one-third of America’s energy use it would cost at least $5 trillion to build enough wind solar and battery systems to replace all the power plants that currently burn natural gas and coal. And in broad economic terms all that money will have been spent to produce the same quantity of the same product—kilowatt-hours. That kind of spending is the polar opposite of improving society’s productivity. This matters because increasing productivity is as all economists know the key to increasing society’s overall wealth. Even if such programs create jobs and they would we’d be putting more labor into producing the same output which ultimately is negative for economic growth.

How will these policies affect cities?

If they’re implemented as envisioned it will mean both more expensive and less reliable electricity. A realiable grid is more important in our increasingly everything-digital age and also as more electricity is used for transportation. Roughly speaking we’ll nearly have to double the grid to replace all the oil used on the roads.

What lessons should we take away from last month’s cold snap and rolling blackouts in Texas?

Eventually after all the finger-pointing and green-spinning we’ll find out that there were multiple relevant factors in the domino of events that happened. That’s always the case with big disasters. But all disasters start with a trigger. In Texas it began with a near total loss of output from the state’s huge wind farms. Put differently there wouldn’t have been an outage if just a fraction of the Texas wind capacity had instead been the kind of power plants that grid operators can call on when they’re needed. And those would be things like winterized natural gas turbines. At the center of the debate about how to prevent a next time—and there’s always a next time with weather events—there’s a simple truism: the hallmark of all critical infrastructure is reserve capabilities that are available when needed. I know that some people are seriously proposing that batteries can do that job for wind. Texas is planning to build the world’s second biggest battery-storage system for a “next time.” For perspective that planned huge storage system will be able to store just three minutes of the electricity produced by Texas wind farms.

What recent books would you recommend on energy and the environment?

For confirmation that there are no global-scale solutions to changing world energy supply or demand there’s Bill Gates’s new book How to Avoid A Climate Disaster. Gates of course starts from the premise that we need to do something. For sobering perspective on the consequences of green-energy technologies I just started reading The World For Sale: Money Power and the Traders Who Barter the Earth’s Resources. The title is self-explanatory. As I’ve written often the shift from oil and gas to wind solar and batteries is a shift from liquids and gases to using solids and mining for energy minerals. That shift entails an enormous—about ten-fold—increase in the total quantities of materials used for each unit of energy delivered. And it means a shift in the places where we get critical energy materials; from domestic production to imports. Those shifts will be consequential.

Doom-scrolling getting you down?

Put the phone away for an hour. Or better yet make it 24 hours – you might just get $2400 out of it.

Reviews.org a company that tests home services and products is holding a 24-hour digital detox challenge. They’ll pay their chosen challengers over two grand to survive a whole day without screens.

“If you’ve got the desire to ditch your devices for a day but still need to get paid this is the perfect opportunity for you” the company wrote on its website where aspiring digital detoxers can go to apply.

Glued to social media? Perfect (for the contest)

To help determine who should apply the company asks some discerning questions.

“Have you always wanted to win reality competitions like American Ninja Warrior but you’ve been too busy trying to beat Mario Kart and Mortal Kombat instead?” Reviews.org asks potential applicants.

“Do you know a little too much about your old acquaintances from social media?”

According to the company the ideal candidate is someone who is “definitely into tech” and up for a challenge. And while it might seem easy to take an Instagram detox for a day – the challenge is a bit more involved.

It’s not as easy as it sounds

Those selected for the challenge will not only have to swear off their phones for the day but television gaming computers smart watches and smart home devices (think smart speakers) are also off limits.

But the company clarifies microwaves are still okay.

The challengers will receive safes to store their electronics in for the 24 hours along with a $200 Amazon gift card to put together a tech-free “survival kit” the company wrote.

Some survival kit suggestions from Reviews.org include a typewriter to replace computers writing paper to replace texts and paints and brushes to replace the fine art of the selfie.

Challengers will have to review the survival kit and give feedback on the experience after completing the challenge – but they’ll do so while holding the coveted “2021 Digital Detox Challenger” title.

Screen time is a growing health risk

The company’s challenge comes at a time when “screen time” has taken on new meaning.

The pandemic has forced many people to work remotely and students to study online making screens more of a necessity than ever before.

According to a 2019 report from nonprofit Common Sense Media US teens were spending an average of more than seven hours per day on screen media for entertainment alone.

“We have a feeling someone out there needs a break” Reviews.org wrote.

To apply the company requests a bit of personal information and a 100-word question about why you’re right for the challenge. Applications will be open until March 26 and winners will be announced on the company’s YouTube page on March 29."

She is originally from Xi'an China.

Allison Wang a Cherry Hill resident since 2007 came to this country because she like generations of immigrants before her believed in the American ideal.

""What made America great is the open and welcoming culture of diversity"" said Wang an accounting director with a healthcare company and a mother of two. ""That’s why it attracts so many talented and diverse people.""

But recently she and other Asian Americans like her have wondered ""Is this really the country we signed up for?""

Recent attacks on Asian Americans many brought on by hatred and misplaced blame for the COVID-19 pandemic have created a sense of fear among a diverse community made up of several cultures nationalities languages and histories who are all nonetheless often seen as a monolith.

And the brutal murders of eight people — six of them Asian women — in Atlanta have fueled more fear among Asian Americans in South Jersey but also a sense of resolve that the time to act to end hate is long overdue.

During a Zoom meeting arranged by the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey several people talked about their experiences with discrimination and racism and their fears for their families and themselves.

They and others also expressed hope that in the same way that the killing of George Floyd sparked a reckoning over treatment of Black Americans the Atlanta shootings might also bring recognition support and action to stop the targeting of Asian Americans.

Nothing new but worse than ever

Edward Wang is a professor of Asian history at Rowan University who has lived in the United States for more than 30 years. A former member of the Cherry Hill Board of Education and a native of Shanghai China he said anti-Asian sentiment is nothing new.

""Looking back in this country's history Asian Americans have been discriminated against since at least 1882 with the Chinese Exclusion Act"" he noted. Before 1965's Immigration and Nationality Act quotas kept most Asians from becoming American citizens.

But even for those who are citizens including Asians born in the United States there is discrimination.

""We are constantly being asked 'where did you come from?'"" said Wang. ""People assume that if you are Asian you must be a recent immigrant. It's not very comfortable for us.""

U.S. Rep. Andy Kim represents New Jersey's Third District and is the son of Korean immigrants.

""The short answer is yes I have experienced racist discrimination and so have members of my family along with many others in South Jersey"" Kim told the Courier-Post.

People avoided him told him they worried he could give them the coronavirus; he had heard from Asian restaurateurs whose businesses were targeted with racist graffiti.

Rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump especially his use of terms like ""China virus"" and ""kung flu"" made things worse creating a sense of blame as COVID-19 forced lockdowns and the lockdowns caused the economy to crater.

""We know that discrimination existed before coronavirus and sadly it will continue after this is over"" said Kim a Democrat. ""But this has been gasoline poured over a fire.""

Kim worries that as tensions escalate with China over issues like trade and human rights xenophobia hate and discrimination could escalate as well.

And many Asian Americans worry not only for themselves but for their families.

""All Asian American kids have experienced this kind of discrimination but the pandemic has raised it to a level that cannot go unnoticed and must be stopped"" said Xiufang Chen a Cherry Hill resident and mother.

""This is the first time I don't feel safe"" said Li Li the principal of Cherry Hill Huaxia Chinese who is originally from Xi'an China. Some parents she's spoken with she said ""don't want to make a big fuss or want to let it go but really we shouldn't. ... We should let our kids know what (behavior) is right and what is wrong.""

The 'model minority' problem

Often seen as ""model minority"" a monolith of hardworking industrious and entrepreneurial people Asian Americans are really a diverse race from countries with very distinct cultures languages histories and cuisines.

For example there are 56 ethnic groups in China and linguists estimate 297 living languages are spoken among the 1.21 billion people in Mainland China Taiwan Hong Kong and Tibet. The Philippines is a nation with more than 7000 islands and more than 170 ethnic groups influenced by centuries of migration and conquest from Malaysia South Asia Spain China and the United States.

""The model minority is a damaging perception but it's one that lends itself to people thinking they can ignore (Asian Americans) that they are off doing their own thing that if they don't complain then everything must be going well"" said Kim.

Many Asian Americans don't speak up he acknowledged ""because they don't think anything will happen or that anyone will care"" leading to greater feelings of isolation.

""Many in the Asian community struggle"" said Chen. ""Sometimes when I think of this tragedy (the Atlanta shootings) I get angry because did it take this happening for people to realize Asian Americans deserve attention?""

""It dodges the real problem we have"" said Nina Gao president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and Shanghai native who lives in Cherry Hill.

""It is a way to wedge us out of the mainstream: You can take care of yourselves you all live in these Chinatowns. We give you this glorious title but it keeps us away it makes us feel very foreign.""

""We're thought of as self-supporting and people who make a lot of money and that makes us targets"" said Wen Gu a librarian from Cherry Hill.

""Many Americans don't want to take the time to really learn about us so they lump us all together"" said Gao who is on the faculty of Rutgers University's biomedical and health services department. ""They think we are all the same we all eat weird food and speak a weird language that we are not Americans.""

""People don't notice us because we keep our heads down and we work hard"" said Doris Zheng a 21-year-old Rutgers–Camden student. Her family emigrated from a small city in Southeast China more than 20 years ago; her father is a chef and her mother is a home health aide.

Zheng vice president of the university's Student Government Association said she's supportive of Black and brown people's struggles with systemic racism in American. ""But Asian Americans are often hidden in the dark and there's this idea that we're smart and work hard and we don't need any help.

""There's this perception of us as prim and proper and perfect. We seem to be doing fine but really that's because we are working so damn hard.""

The model minority idea she noted is not only damaging to Asians — it also minimizes the very real problems faced by Black and brown Americans making others think they should overcome obstacles as well as Asians do without understanding the differences in their histories and the kinds of racism they encounter.

Is Atlanta a tipping point?

Kim pointed to ""this moment of mourning"" for the victims of the Atlanta shootings — and initial news of the shootings which first characterized the shooter's sex addiction as a motive drawing a strong backlash — as an event that brought the problem of anti-Asian hate to light.

In a February address to the nation to acknowledge the loss of 500000 Americans to COVID-19 President Joe Biden urged an end to attacks on Asian Americans Kim noted. The President and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Asian American leaders in Atlanta on March 19.

""People have told me they finally feel heard and seen"" said Kim. ""The question now is is it going to be sustained even after this tragedy falls out of the spotlight? Is this something durable that can lead to change? Many of us have been calling for that for at least a year.""

""What bothers me about Atlanta is blaming a hate crime on a sex addiction which this is clearly not"" said Gao. ""This was obviously targeting Asian women.""

Jinwei Cao recalled an incident in June when apartment residents in Newark Delaware found fliers that said ""Kill Chinese virus"" at their doors.

The incident rattled students at the University of Delaware where Cao teaches. While she was satisfied with the police and university responses to the fliers she said ""it was really unacceptable.""

""The Atlanta shootings I heard from so many friends and students who felt like this is a breaking point"" said Gao.

""It's threatening our very existence in this country.""

Stepping up and weighing next steps

Edward Wang said he's been in conference calls with other Asian American groups nationwide.

There is talk of a national march like the Black Lives Matter marches that took place in the wake of the George Floyd killing in May.

Rallies by and in support of Asian Americans have been held in Philadelphia's Chinatown; another one is planned for 10 a.m. Sunday at the Chinatown Gate at 10th and Arch streets.

He's hoping more attention — from politicians policymakers media and educators — will lead to more knowledge of the struggles of Asian Americans as well as a greater appreciation of their many different cultures histories and contributions.

Asian Americans like so many other Americans have stepped up to help in myriad ways during the pandemic.

""There are so many Asian Americans on the front lines"" said Kim. ""Like the very large community of Filipino American nurses. Doctors. Small business owners.""

The Asian American Alliance of South Jersey has organized food giveaways and collected donations for personal protective equipment to hospitals and first responders its members said. They've delivered meals to local police departments and helped furloughed workers.

Xiaoping Ma a physician who lives in Cherry Hill heard alarming news from her native Wuhan China as the virus began to spread there. She recalls being among the first to always wear a face mask warning others to do the same and hearing the fear and desperation from friends family and medical school classmates there.

She helped organize donation drives through the Chinese American Physicians Association connected with colleagues in Wuhan as they learned more about how to contain the virus sharing information and insight — all while dealing with her own fear for family members and fellow medical professionals here and in Wuhan.

Ma who has been in the United States since 1989 and has been a citizen since the 1990s said she felt guilty that Wuhan was the place where the virus originated — but angry at the way it was characterized here.

""When the previous president called it 'the China virus' the 'Wuhan virus' it made me so angry so afraid. How can an American president be so uneducated and say those things? But I tried to stay anchored on my work.""

""We want people to know we are part of the community"" said Gao.

""I see a lot of hope; a lot of people have reached out"" to show support said Sharon Xiaoyun Hou. She's received support from the University of Pennsylvania where she works. ""People checked in on me to see if I was OK and that shows me how most of the people in America really are.""

Ma said her running group which includes Black white gay straight and Asian runners rallied around her. Running and a new Peloton bike have been her primary stress relievers she said. ""I don't think I've ever run so much as I have the last year.""

""Although many of us are first generation (immigrants) we are all United States citizens"" said Li.

""We love this country and we want it to be better.""

View the current offers here.

Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines gets high marks from flyers thanks to its (typically) reliable operations great customer service and myriad flyer-friendly initiatives which most recently includes the airline's policy of blocking middle seats for a longer period than any other airline during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent years the airline has made a big push to renew its fleet with state-of-the-art business-class cabins which started in 2017 with the introduction of Delta One Suites on board the airline's Airbus A350 aircraft. Since then Delta has worked to bring the rest of its fleet more or less in line with the standard set by the Suites product introduced on the A350.

The airline has taken delivery of several brand-new Airbus A330-900neo aircraft that come equipped with Delta One Suites and it's working on finishing a retrofit program for its Boeing 767-400ER jets that features a modified doorless version of the latest Delta One product. And it completed a retrofit program of its entire Boeing 777 fleet not long before it made the decision to retire that aircraft entirely due to the coronavirus pandemic. And on all of its newly delivered and retrofit widebody airplanes it has installed a new premium-economy product known as Delta Premium Select.

Still though there is some fragmentation in Delta's fleet which means not all premium experiences are created equal with the airline. Make sure to continue reading so you know which Delta premium seats are best and which ones you should avoid if possible.

1. Delta One Suite

As of late 2017 the Delta One Suite became the king of the hill in terms of Delta aircraft seats. They're arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration and provide ample space and privacy thanks to the sliding door found at each suite. Since their introduction other products have come onto the scene from airlines like ANA of Japan and Qatar Airways but Delta's suites remain a top option for long-haul flying. You will find Delta One Suites on the carrier's Airbus A350 and Airbus A330-900neo aircraft.

Where to find them: Due to irregular flight schedules and massive cuts in international capacity it's been difficult to pin down where exactly Delta One Suites-equipped aircraft are flying. However things are starting to stabilize and it looks like we'll begin to see more-regular service introduced as countries begin to lift travel restrictions. As a general rule you can expect to find Delta One Suites on flights from the carrier's hubs in Atlanta (ATL) Detroit (DTW) and Seattle (SEA) to both Europe and Asia.

2. Delta One on the Boeing 767-400ER

While Delta's retrofit Boeing 767-400ERs (764) don't technically feature Delta One Suites the new Delta One product is about as close as you'll get without having a sliding door. Flyers can expect thoroughly modern design entertainment systems lighting lavatories and more. The updated Delta One product for the 764 is essentially an updated version of the Thompson Vantage seats it has installed in its 767-300 aircraft meaning seats are on the narrow side and there isn't a ton of storage to speak of. However it still represents a massive upgrade over the previous version with its tiny IFE screens creaky seats and hardly any privacy.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Where to find them: The 764s can generally be found on flights from Delta's hub at New York-JFK to Los Angeles (LAX) and various destinations in Europe as well as some flights from Atlanta (ATL) to cities in deep South America including São Paulo-Guarulhos (GRU) and Santiago de Chile (SCL). We expect to see more destinations served by the 764 as Delta adds cities back to its international route network.

The easiest way to determine whether or not your flight will feature the new interior is to peek at the seat map. You'll want to find 764 (as opposed to 76D) aircraft and seat maps will show 34 Delta One seats as opposed to 40 on the old variant. The new 764s have a Premium Select cabin too while the old version lacks that cabin entirely.

3. Reverse Herringbone

After Delta One Suites and Delta One on board the 764 Delta's reverse-herringbone seat is the next-best option for premium flyers. This 1-2-1 configuration affords a good amount of privacy personal space and storage. The one downside of this product is that the physical aspects of the IFE system are outdated with small and somewhat laggy screens.

Where to find them: The reverse-herringbone seat is exclusively found on Delta's Airbus A330-200 and -300 fleets. Currently they're flying on various international routes from across Delta's hubs.

4. Thompson Vantage

The Thompson Vantage seat found on Delta's Boeing 767-300ER aircraft (all of these jets are set to be retired by 2025) is the least-desirable all-aisle-access business-class product the airline offers. The seats are not very private and when the bed is fully flat you feel very close to the floor of the plane. Furthermore the IFE screens are woefully small and laggy and can be very frustrating to operate and see especially in bright light.

Where to find them: These non-retrofit Boeing 767s can be found on various international flights including destinations in northern South America like Lima (LIM) and Bogotá (BOG). You'll have this product if the flight is marked as operated by a 767-300 or you can tell by looking at the seat map. These aircraft have 40 seats up front versus 34 in the new variant.

5. Boeing 757

Arranged in a 2-2 configuration these seats go fully flat and sport an in-flight entertainment screen USB ports and power outlets. While these seats aren't private in any way and there is limited storage they're more than adequate on relatively short hops including transcontinental routes

Where to find them: Delta's 757s equipped with the Delta One cabin regularly fly between New York-JFK and San Francisco (SFO) as well as some other longer domestic flights and even some short transatlantic routes to Europe.

6. Delta Premium Select

Delta introduced its take on a premium-economy product (it calls it Premium Select) at the same time it debuted the Delta One Suite. Each seat comes with its own footrest power port adjustable headrest and a large IFE screen. On Airbus A350s the seats are arranged in a 2-4-2 configuration on the A330-900neos it's a 2-3-2 configuration and on the 764 you'll find a 2-2-2 configuration.

Where to find them: Delta Premium Select can be found on board the Airbus A350 and A330-900neo as well as the Boeing 767-400ER.

7. Delta Domestic First Class

While Delta's domestic first class is nothing to write home about it's comfortable for short hops and most domestic flights. And Delta announced early last year that it will introduce a new version of its domestic first-class product on its forthcoming Airbus A321neos.

Most of Delta's domestic first-class seats have seatback IFE monitors which is more than can be said for some of its U.S. competitors. In general you can expect a similar experience across the majority of its domestic fleet but there are slight differences among aircraft types with regard to seat width and recline.

Remember though when it comes to choosing a domestic plane seats aren't everything. For those seeking a complimentary upgrade you're better off choosing a plane with a higher ratio of first-class seats.

Where to find them: On most routes within the US as well as some shorter international routes to Mexico the Caribbean and Canada.

How to Book

If you're looking to book an award ticket in any of these seats there are thankfully a few options. While SkyMiles aren't highly valued per TPG's own valuations you can of course book premium flights with Delta through its own loyalty program. Unfortunately you can expect sky-high award rates for the overwhelming majority of its flights in premium cabins.

If that's the route you want to pursue though remember you can boost your SkyMiles balance by applying for one of Delta's cobranded credit cards (terms apply):

Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card: Earn 65000 bonus miles after you spend $2000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership. Offer ends 8/2/23.

Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card: Earn 85000 bonus miles after you spend $4000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership. Offer ends 8/2/23.

You'll likely get more value for your hard-earned miles if you book flights through one of Delta's partners however. Two of your best options are Virgin Atlantic's Flying Club and Air France-KLM's FlyingBlue.

Related: Unlock incredible value with Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Virgin Atlantic recently devalued its award chart for Delta-operated flights increasing the price of awards to Asia by as much as 175%. Thankfully though it reversed course on significantly changing redemption rates for flights between the U.S. and Europe.

If you are considering booking a Delta One flight through Virgin Atlantic remember the program is a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards so it's relatively easy to boost your balance. Not only that but both Amex and Citi offer occasional transfer bonuses meaning you'll need even fewer points than normal to book awards.

FlyingBlue on the other hand is a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards and Capital One Rewards (at a 2:1.5 ratio).

However you'll only be able to use these miles to book saver-level awards on Delta so expect extremely limited availability. Second you will typically pay more taxes and surcharges on these tickets than using Delta SkyMiles.

Bottom Line

Delta's been working hard to modernize its fleet and give premium flyers a truly premium experience at the pointy end of the plane. Its new and retrofit aircraft provide a thoroughly modern experience with features that flyers expect in 2021 and these products really can compete with some of the best in the world. However there is still some variation in the airline's fleet and knowing which aircraft to seek out and which to avoid remains an important ""to-do"" on the checklist before booking a ticket.

That’s still far from the 75 to 85 percent of Americans experts estimate need to be vaccinated in order to get the coronavirus pandemic under control but recent research indicates that goal is within reach: a February survey by the Pew Research Center found 69 percent of American adults either have received at least one dose of vaccine or intend to be vaccinated when they can.

That’s an improvement over recent months; in November before vaccinations had been rolled out about 60 percent of Americans said they planned to be vaccinated.

But there remains a deep partisan divide in willingness to be vaccinated — and in how Americans view the danger caused by the pandemic. Pew’s work and other recent surveys have found Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be willing to take the vaccine and are more likely to be concerned about the public health ramifications of the pandemic.

As Zeeshan Aleem recently wrote for Vox:

CBS News released a poll conducted between March 10 and 13 which found 33 percent of Republicans say they won’t get the vaccine when it becomes available to them while just 10 percent of Democrats said the same. In that survey 47 percent of Republicans said they’ve already received the vaccine or plan to do so compared to 71 percent of Democrats. Those findings follow a recent poll from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist which found that 47 percent of people who supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election say they won’t choose to be vaccinated (versus 10 percent of Biden supporters) as well as a Monmouth University poll released earlier in March that found 59 percent of Republicans either wanted to wait and “see how it goes” before getting vaccinated or said they were likely to never get one. By contrast 23 percent of Democrats felt the same way.

Similarly Pew found 83 percent of Democrats have been vaccinated or plan to be compared to 56 percent of Republicans.

The Kaiser Family Foundation and Washington Post recently discovered that partisan vaccine hesitancy extends to the medical profession. A survey they conducted from February 11 to March 7 found 40 percent of Republican health care workers — including doctors nurses and staff — feel available vaccines may not be safe and effective. That view was held by 28 percent of Democrat health care workers.

Why this is the case is not completely clear — Dr. Anthony Fauci the top infectious disease expert in the United States told Meet the Press that the divide “makes absolutely no sense.”

Republicans appear to be far less worried about — and frightened by — Covid-19 than Democrats

One thing polls have made clear of late is that people’s political inclinations tend to correspond with how worried they are about the virus in general something that could influence how likely they are to take measures to prevent exposure and infection.

According to the Pew survey for instance 82 percent of Democrats say that the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to the health of the American population compared to 41 percent of Republicans. That divide has been fairly steady since last March when 33 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of Democrats were worried about the threat Covid-19 posed to public health.

Pew also found Republicans to be much less concerned about the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus — 40 percent of Republicans said they worry these variants some of which are more transmissible and deadly could lead to “a major setback” in progressing toward the end of the pandemic compared to 60 percent of Democrats. Members of both parties largely agree that the virus is a threat to the economy however with 83 percent of Democrats and 81 percent of Republicans sharing that sentiment.

A Franklin Templeton/Gallup study conducted in December 2020 — when confirmed daily cases regularly topped 200000 (compared to the 50000 to 60000 confirmed cases seen for most of March 2021) — found Republicans far less likely to believe a coronavirus infection posed a hospitalization risk than Democrats. Members of both parties were found to vastly overestimate an infected person’s chances of being hospitalized with 28 percent of Republicans 41 percent of Democrats and 35 percent of independents believing the hospitalization rate was at least 50 percent. Far more Republicans than Democrats — 26 percent to 10 percent — correctly responded that about 1 to 5 percent of those infected must be hospitalized.

According to more recent polling from CBS/YouGov (conducted from March 10 to 13) 51 percent of Republicans said they weren’t concerned about being infected with Covid-19 compared to the 17 percent of Democrats who weren’t concerned. When asked why they weren’t concerned most Republicans said the risk of infection was exaggerated or declining.

These numbers suggest that at least a portion of Republican vaccine hesitancy may stem from some Republicans feeling as if the coronavirus is not something that is overly dangerous — or something to fear.

The results come as a majority of Americans express optimism about the state of the pandemic. About 60 percent of Americans say that the “coronavirus situation” is getting better and 26 percent said it’s staying the same according to a Gallup poll taken February 14 to 21. Only 14 percent say it’s getting worse the lowest response to that question since July. For the pandemic to end however more people than are currently willing to do so will need to take a vaccine — and key to making that happen will be overcoming hesitancy among all groups Republican voters included.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIxL3RoYWlyLWFpcndheXMtcm95YWwtb3JjaGlkLXBsdXMtcGFydG5lcnMta2VlcC1oYXdraW5nLXRoZWlyLXJhdGhlci13b3J0aGxlc3MtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thai Airways Royal Orchid Plus Partners Keep Hawking Their Rather Worthless Credit Cards,"The financial partners of Thai Airways Royal Orchid Plus are maintaining a strong presence in the Thai market and have actually increased their marketing efforts in recent months trying to gain new customers.

It’s no secret that customers can do almost nothing with their ROP miles at the moment especially since 99% of Thai Airways flights are grounded the airline is still in bankruptcy administration and customers still wait for hundreds of millions in refunds.

Thai Royal Orchid Plus (access their website here) has extremely limited use right now for example you can book domestic flights within Thailand for 5000 points (cash value US$30).

ADVERTISEMENT

To some degree ROP members are able to redeem miles for Star Alliance flights although I have the impression that availability for these flights has become sparse (possibly with manual blocking involved).

There is also an issue for members holding existing Thai Airways tickets issued on TG stock and using ROP miles. As the bankruptcy court has blocked all refunds members don’t their tickets including high surcharges refunded either. Existing ticket holders can however use their leftover coupons for the so called special flights which are one way flights ex Thailand to various destinations in Asia and Europe without an active inflight entertainment system (THAI doesn’t have money to pay the licensing fees).

THAI’s business re-organization under the bankruptcy court has implications on Thai Royal Orchid Plus members:

Policy on facilitation for members of the Royal Orchid Plus (ROP) program During the business reorganization process members of the Royal Orchid Plus program are not deemed creditors of the Company who are entitled to file for debt repayment in accordance with the business reorganization plan. This is because the earned miles were to be redeemed for rewards namely conditioned air tickets of the Company. Nevertheless we always acknowledge the value of your ROP membership and privileges attached to program; and we will see to the continuity of this benefit program for our valued ROP members. Please rest assured that your miles are valuable to us and that the ROP status and membership as well as the benefits shall continue during the period of business organization. In this regard ROP members shall be entitled to enjoy various privileges redeemable with the ROP miles when the Company resumes normal operation. For members whose miles are about to expire the Company is in the process of extending such miles and membership status. Further details will be posted on thaiairways.com/rop Let the Company reiterate that your benefits brought by the ROP program shall continue to exist and you are not required to file for debt repayment or take any legal actions during the business reorganization. Policy on facilitation for THAI air ticket holders We are well aware that there are THAI air ticket holders whose tickets remain unused due to the COVID-19 pandemic where the Company was forced to cancel most domestic and international flights. While THAI is undergoing business rehabilitation these ticket holders are not deemed creditors of the Company who are entitled to file for debt repayment. This is because of the eligibility of your air tickets which can be exercised when the Company resumes normal operations corresponding to the latest COVID-19 situation. Therefore please be affirmed that your tickets will remain eligible and you have full rights to use such air tickets in all aspects in compliance with the business reorganization plan of the Company where neither debt repayment nor legal actions are required to be proceeded by the air ticket holders during the business reorganization.

In other words the customer has no rights to anything and all the company can offer at this point are promises without any guarantees what will eventually happen to those.

As such and in regards to accumulating more Royal Orchid Plus mileage through local credit cards I’d definitely advise against continuing to use these cards until Thai Airways and ROP returns to regular business operations (if ever). Most definitely I wouldn’t open any new accounts for ROP cards as advertised all over the place right now. You have promotional booths at shopping malls in train stations and banners wherever you see.

For the same reason you should also not transfer any loyalty points of whatever source (hotel loyalty points credit card points) to Thai Royal Orchid Plus at this time.

Royal Orchid Plus credit cards are plentiful in Thailand almost every bank is issuing them in one form or the other including American Express AEON Citibank UOB and all of the local banks. It’s almost impossible to find co-branded cards for foreign airlines programs issued by Thai banks.

Conclusion

Financial institutions in Thailand continue to hawk credit cards to collect a currency (Thai Airways ROP miles) that have little to no value at the moment.

There are absolutely better options around and if you’re already holding a ROP credit card I’d contact the bank to change the product to another card type or in the very least a complete refund of the annual fee until it’s feasible again to use the card for purchases and utilize it’s travel benefits. All of the banks offer cashback cards or their own points currency.

If you still like to collect frequent flyer points then I suggest change to American Express for Membership Rewards points or UOB Privimiles (my personal favorite).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZW5nbGlzaC8yMDIxL01hci8yMS9hbWVyaWNhbi1ob3Jyb3Itc3Rvcnktc2Vhc29uLTEwLXRpdGxlLXJldmVhbGVkLTIyNzk1NTYuaHRtbNIBiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9lbmdsaXNoLzIwMjEvTWFyLzIxL2FtZXJpY2FuLWhvcnJvci1zdG9yeS1zZWFzb24tMTAtdGl0bGUtcmV2ZWFsZWQtMjI3OTU1Ni5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'American Horror Story' season 10 title revealed,"The much awaited season of the long-running and acclaimed FX anthology will feature two different storylines -- ""One by sea one by the sand."""

The climate movement is ascendant and it has become common to see climate change as a social justice issue. Climate change and its effects—pandemics pollution natural disasters—are not universally or uniformly felt: the people and communities suffering most are disproportionately Black Indigenous and people of color. It is no surprise then that U.S. surveys show that these are the communities most concerned about climate change.

One year ago I published a book called A Field Guide to Climate Anxiety. Since its publication I have been struck by the fact that those responding to the concept of climate anxiety are overwhelmingly white. Indeed these climate anxiety circles are even whiter than the environmental circles I’ve been in for decades. Today a year into the pandemic after the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed and the attack on the U.S. Capitol I am deeply concerned about the racial implications of climate anxiety. If people of color are more concerned about climate change than white people why is the interest in climate anxiety so white? Is climate anxiety a form of white fragility or even racial anxiety? Put another way is climate anxiety just code for white people wishing to hold onto their way of life or get “back to normal” to the comforts of their privilege?

The white response to climate change is literally suffocating to people of color. Climate anxiety can operate like white fragility sucking up all the oxygen in the room and devoting resources toward appeasing the dominant group. As climate refugees are framed as a climate security threat will the climate-anxious recognize their role in displacing people from around the globe? Will they be able to see their own fates tied to the fates of the dispossessed? Or will they hoard resources limit the rights of the most affected and seek to save only their own deluded that this xenophobic strategy will save them? How can we make sure that climate anxiety is harnessed for climate justice?

My book has connected me to a growing community focused on the emotional dimensions of climate change. As writer Britt Wray puts it emotions like mourning anger dread and anxiety are “merely a sign of our attachment to the world.” Paradoxically though anxiety about environmental crisis can create apathy inaction and burnout. Anxiety may be a rational response to the world that climate models predict but it is unsustainable.

And climate panic can be as dangerous as it is galvanizing. Dealing with feelings of climate anxiety will require the existential tools I provided in A Field Guide to Climate Anxiety but it will also require careful attention to extremism and climate zealotry. We can’t fight climate change with more racism. Climate anxiety must be directed toward addressing the ways that racism manifests as environmental trauma and vice versa—how environmentalism manifests as racialized violence. We need to channel grief toward collective liberation.

The prospect of an unlivable future has always shaped the emotional terrain for Black and brown people whether that terrain is racism or climate change. Climate change compounds existing structures of injustice and those structures exacerbate climate change. Exhaustion anger hope—the effects of oppression and resistance are not unique to this climate moment. What is unique is that people who had been insulated from oppression are now waking up to the prospect of their own unlivable future.

It is a surprisingly short step from “chronic fear of environmental doom” as the American Psychological Association defines ecoanxiety to xenophobia and fascism. Racism is not an accidental byproduct of environmentalism; it has been a constant reference point. As I wrote about in my first book The Ecological Other early environmentalists in the U.S. were anti-immigrant eugenicists whose ideas were later adopted by Nazis to implement their “blood and soil” ideology. In a recent dramatic example the gunman of the 2019 El Paso shooting was motivated by despair about the ecological fate of the planet: “My whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn’t exist.” Intense emotions mobilize people but not always for the good of all life on this planet.

Today’s progressives espouse climate change as the “greatest existential threat of our time” a claim that ignores people who have been experiencing existential threats for much longer. Slavery colonialism ongoing police brutality—we can’t neglect history to save the future.

RESILIENCE AND RELATION AS RESISTANCE

I recently gave a college lecture about climate anxiety. One of the students e-mailed me to say she was so distressed that she’d be willing to submit to a green dictator if they would address climate change. Young people know the stakes but they are not learning how to cope with the intensity of their dread. It would be tragic and dangerous if this generation of climate advocates becomes willing to sacrifice democracy and human rights in the name of climate change.

Oppressed and marginalized people have developed traditions of resilience out of necessity. Black feminist and Indigenous leaders have painstakingly cultivated resilience over the long arc of the fight for justice. They know that protecting joy and hope is the ultimate resistance to domination. Persistence is nonnegotiable when your mental physical and reproductive health are on the line.

Instead of asking “What can I do to stop feeling so anxious?” “What can I do to save the planet?” and “What hope is there?” people with privilege can be asking “Who am I?” and “How am I connected to all of this?” The answers reveal that we are deeply interconnected with the well-being of others on this planet and that there are traditions of environmental stewardship that can be guides for where we need to go from here.

Testing Pioneer – and Eugenicist

""To tell the truth about standardized tests"" Kendi said ""is to tell the story of the eugenicists who created and popularized these tests in the United States more than a century ago.""

As the U.S. absorbed millions of immigrants from Europe beginning in the 19th century the day’s leading social scientists many of them White Anglo-Saxon Protestants were concerned by the infiltration of non-whites into the nation’s public schools.

In his 1923 book A Study of American Intelligence psychologist and eugenicist Carl Brigham wrote that African-Americans were on the low end of the racial ethnic and/or cultural spectrum. Testing he believed showed the superiority of “the Nordic race group” and warned of the “promiscuous intermingling” of new immigrants in the American gene pool.

Furthermore the education system he argued was in decline and ""will proceed with an accelerating rate as the racial mixture becomes more and more extensive.""

Shortly after the publication of ""A Study of American Intelligence"" in 1923 the College Board commissioned Carl Brigham to lead development of the SAT.

Brigham had helped to develop aptitude tests for the U.S. Army during World War I and – commissioned by the College Board - was influential in the development of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). At the time he and other social scientists considered the SAT a new psychological test and a supplement to existing college board exams.

The SAT debuted in 1926 joined by the ACT (American College Testing) in the 1950s. By the 21st century the SAT and ACT were just part of a barrage of tests students may face before reaching college. The College Board also offers SAT II tests designed for individual subjects ranging from biology to geography.

Entrenched in Schools

Brigham’s Ph.D. dissertation written in 1916 “Variable Factors in the Binet Tests” analyzed the work of the French psychologist Alfred Binet who developed intelligence tests as diagnostic tools to detect learning disabilities. The Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman relied on Binet’s work to produce today’s standard IQ test the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Tests.

During World War I standardized tests helped place 1.5 million soldiers in units segregated by race and by test scores. The tests were scientific yet they remained deeply biased according to researchers and media reports.

In 1917 Terman and a group of colleagues were recruited by the American Psychological Association to help the Army develop group intelligence tests and a group intelligence scale. Army testing during World War I ignited the most rapid expansion of the school testing movement.

""The tests have failed time and again to achieve their intended purposes: measuring intelligence and predicting future academic and professional success. The tests not the black test-takers have been underachieving.” - Ibram X. Kendi

By 1918 there were more than 100 standardized tests developed by different researchers to measure achievement in the principal elementary and secondary school subjects. The U.S. Bureau of Education reported in 1925 that intelligence and achievement tests were increasingly used to classify students at all levels.

The first SAT was administered in 1926 to more than 8000 students 40 percent of them female. The original test lasted 90 minutes and consisted of 315 questions focused on vocabulary and basic math.

“Unlike the college boards the SAT is designed primarily to assess aptitude for learning rather than mastery of subjects already learned” according to Erik Jacobsen a New Jersey writer and math-physics teacher based at Newark Academy in Livingston N.J. “For some college officials an aptitude test which is presumed to measure intelligence is appealing since at this time (1926) intelligence and ethnic origin are thought to be connected and therefore the results of such a test could be used to limit the admissions of particularly undesirable ethnicities.”

By 1930 multiple-choice tests were firmly entrenched in U.S. schools. The rapid spread of the SAT sparked debate along two lines. Some critics viewed the multiple-choice format as encouraging memorization and guessing. Others examined the content of the questions and reached the conclusion that the tests were racist.

Eventually Brigham adapted the Army test for use in college admissions and his work began to interest interested administrators at Harvard University. Starting in 1934 Harvard adopted the SAT to select scholarship recipients at the school. Many institutions of higher learning soon followed suit.

The Triumph of Pseudo-Science

In his essay “The Racist Origins of the SAT” Gil Troy calls Brigham a “Pilgrim-pedigreed eugenics-blinded bigot.” Eugenics is often defined as the science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics. It was developed by Francis Galton as a method of improving the human race. Only after the perversion of its doctrines by the Nazis in World War II was the theory dismissed.

“All-American decency and idealism coexisted uncomfortably with these scientists’ equally American racism and closemindedness” Troy writes.

Binet Terman and Brigham stood at the intersection of powerful intellectual ideological and political trends a century ago when the Age of Science and standardization began according to Troy.

“In (those) consensus-seeking times scientists became obsessed with deviations and handicaps both physical and intellectual” Troy states. “And many social scientists misapplying Charles Darwin’s evolving evolutionary science and eugenics’ pseudo-science worried about maintaining white purity.”

Decades of Racial Bias

By the 1950s and 1960s top U.S. universities were talent-searching for the “brainy kids” regardless of ethnicity states Jerome Karabel in “The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard Yale and Princeton.”

This dictum among universities to identify the brightest students as reflected by test scores did not bode well for students from communities of color who were—as a result of widespread bias in testing—disproportionately failing state or local high school graduation exams according to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing (FairTest).

According to Fair Test on average students of color score lower on college admissions tests thus many capable youth are denied entrance or access to so-called “merit” scholarships contributing to the huge racial gap in college enrollments and completion.

High-stakes testing also causes additional damage to some students who are categorized as English language learners (ELLs). The tests are often inaccurate for ELLs according to FairTest leading to misplacement or retention. ELLs are alongside students with disabilities those least likely to pass graduation tests.

Needed: Assessments that tells educators in real time where students are academically socially and emotionally.

African-Americans especially males are disproportionately placed or misplaced in special education frequently based on test results. In effect the use of high-stakes testing perpetuates racial inequality through the emotional and psychological power of the tests over the test takers.:

And although most test makers screen test items for obvious bias their efforts often do not detect underlying bias in the test’s form or content.

These biases have long-ranging and damaging consequences not only for students their families but also the economic well-being of their communities.

There is a clear correlation for example between test scores and property values.

Popular private school ratings systems such as GreatSchools.org (40 million unique visitors every year) may be accelerating existing patterns of racial and socioeconomic segregation. Their rankings are based largely on standardized test scores and are fed into national real estate web sites. According to a 2019 study of GreatSchools ratings areas with highly-rated schools usually see increases in home prices.

""Affluent and more educated families were better positioned to leverage this new information to capture educational opportunities in communities with the best schools"" the authors wrote. ""An unintended consequence of better information was less rather than more equity in education.""

A Chalkbeat analysis found that GreatSchools ratings effectively penalize schools that serve low-income and Black and Hispanic students “generally giving them significantly lower ratings than schools serving more affluent and more white and Asian students.""

More Effective Assessment Systems

The National Education Association believes that the guidance offered by the Department of Education in February doesn’t go far enough in providing the necessary flexibility schools need to support their students. Moving forward the focus should be on promoting authentic assessments that reflect the broad range of students learning and skills including creativity leadership critical thinking and collaboration.

This was a conversation that drove many of the educator-led victories in the years before the pandemic. Joining forces with families and other allies educators worked diligently to reduce the over-reliance and misuse of testing and shift the focus to fairer more effective assessment systems that actually support the academic social and emotional needs of their students.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL2pvZS1iaWRlbi1zcGVjaWFsLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtZm9yY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the Biden Administration Shine Light on Special Ops Programs?,"Members of the U.S. special operations forces deployed to 154 countries or roughly 80 percent of the world’s nations last year but information about exactly where elite forces conduct missions under what authorities they operate who they’ve killed and whether they’re adhering to the laws of armed conflict is closely guarded buried in obscure legal provisions shrouded in secrecy or allegedly unknown even to Special Operations Command.

The command known as SOCOM will only name half the countries where its forces were active in 2020. It claims that its personnel — Navy SEALs Army Green Berets and Marine Corps Raiders among them — have captured or killed “thousands of terrorists” under one obscure program but also that it doesn’t track such data. SOCOM refuses to provide even basic information about publicly acknowledged operations.

The Biden administration has imposed temporary limits on counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids outside conventional war zones like Afghanistan to “ensure the president has full visibility on proposed significant actions in these areas” Emily Horne a National Security Council spokesperson told The Intercept. But so far there is little indication that the new administration will be more open with the American people about what commandos are doing and where they’re doing it.

“We need greater transparency around counterterrorism” Luke Hartig a senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in the Obama White House and now a fellow in New America’s International Security program told The Intercept. “We need to do it carefully in a way that doesn’t endanger special operators or their host-nation partners but greater transparency about where we’re conducting operations and why we’re conducting operations is essential.”

U.S. Special Operations Command has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. “Special operations-specific funding” topped out at $3.1 billion in 2001 compared with $13.1 billion now. Before 9/11 there were roughly 43000 special operations forces. Today there are 74000 military personnel and civilians in the command. Two decades ago an average of 2900 commandos were deployed overseas in any given week. That number now stands at 4500 according to SOCOM spokesperson Ken McGraw.

As the command’s global reach has grown so has the toll on America’s commandos. While special operations forces make up just 3 percent of American military personnel they have absorbed more than 40 percent of the casualties mainly in conflicts across the Greater Middle East. Suicide rates among commandos are also the highest in the military and outpace the general population according to an internal study of special operators’ suicides between 2012 and 2015 commissioned by SOCOM and obtained by The Intercept. “Nearly all cases suffered some form of PTSD or emotional trauma following the first deployment” the report notes.

“Greater transparency about where we’re conducting operations and why we’re conducting operations is essential.”

A special operations culture fixated on “force employment and mission accomplishment has led to sustained high operational tempo” to the “detriment of leadership discipline and accountability” a 2020 SOCOM ethics report noted. The Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General recently announced an investigation into whether SOCOM has implemented “law of war” mandates and whether war crimes have been properly reported.

America’s most elite troops specialize in 12 core competencies including counterinsurgency counterterrorism security force assistance unconventional warfare and “direct action” a euphemism for the types of missions that resulted in the killings of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by Army Delta Force commandos and Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden by Navy SEALs. Other missions have included the 2013 abduction of terror suspect Abu Anas al-Libi in Libya by Delta Force operators; a 2017 SEAL raid in Yemen that killed more than two dozen civilians; and a drone program run by SEALs that resulted in 54 declared airstrikes in Somalia last year more than were carried out under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations combined.

Three programs have been especially key to recent U.S. special operations around the world according to unreported SOCOM statistics exclusive documents congressional testimony and interviews with former government officials and others. The trio of efforts — one employing proxy troops another supporting surrogate irregular forces and a globe-spanning training program with a troubled past — underscores a host of largely invisible dangers from failures to rigorously evaluate activities to a subversion of human rights safeguards to a pattern of loose oversight of commando missions that experts say could lead to catastrophe.

Special Ops vs. Great Powers

Some of the least-known special operations missions are authorized under a provision known as “Section 1202 Authority” which first appeared in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA and is “used to provide support to foreign forces irregular forces groups or individuals” taking part in irregular warfare. Neither the Defense Department SOCOM nor any media outlet has ever revealed detailed information about 1202 missions but based on what little is known about them they are explicitly focused on so-called near-peer competitors such as China and Russia or as former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper put it “non-terrorist threats including malign state actors.”

China Russia and Iran are “practitioners of campaigns of disinformation deception sabotage and economic coercion as well as proxy guerrilla and covert operations” according to an unclassified summary of the Irregular Warfare Annex to the 2018 National Defense Strategy released last October. The document called for the U.S. military to fight fire with fire through “proactive dynamic and unorthodox approaches to [irregular warfare] that can shape prevent and prevail against our nation’s adversaries.” Gen. Mark Milley chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff praised Section 1202 Authority as a “highly useful tool for enabling irregular warfare operations” aimed at countering “coercion and aggression by revisionist powers and rogue regimes.”

America’s capacity “to train foreign forces irregular forces with the 1202 authority” would be key to supporting conventional forces in a conflict with Russia or China SOCOM Commander Gen. Richard Clarke said during a 2019 House Armed Services Committee hearing. But because 1202 authority relates to great power competition its use involves far greater dangers than a one-off commando raid in Syria or even a sustained campaign in Somalia.

“The risks of escalation and unintended consequences are much greater” said Linda Robinson director of the Center for Middle East Public Policy at the RAND Corporation and a leading expert on U.S. special operations. “High-end state actors are a far cry from even a robust nonstate actor like ISIS.”

The Biden administration’s counterterrorism review “will seek to ensure appropriate transparency measures” Horne of the National Security Council told the New York Times. When asked whether more information will be forthcoming about 1202 programs Horne told The Intercept: “We won’t have more to share beyond the statement we provided earlier for now.”

War on the Cheap

In the earliest days of the war in Afghanistan as U.S. commandos and CIA personnel sought to support the Afghan Northern Alliance in its fight against the Taliban Army Special Operations Command found that it lacked the authority to provide direct payments to its new proxies and was forced to rely on CIA funding. This prompted a broader push by SOCOM to secure the ability to support foreign forces in counterterrorism missions a military corollary to the CIA’s use of militia surrogates that was ultimately enshrined in U.S. law as U.S.C. Title 10 § 127e known in military parlance as “127-echo.”

127e allows special operations forces to use local troops to do America’s bidding and according to Maj. Gen. James Hecker vice director for operations for the Joint Staff “provides us viable surrogate forces designed to achieve U.S. [counterterrorism] objectives at relatively low costs in terms of resources and especially risks to our personnel.”

Such operations which have been used extensively in Africa can be run either by Joint Special Operations Command — the secretive organization that controls SEAL Team 6 Delta Force and other special mission units — or by more generic “theater” special operations forces. Originally granted a $25 million budget under a predecessor program in 2005 127e is funded at four times that level and has “directly resulted in the capture or killing of thousands of terrorists disrupted terrorist networks and activities and denied terrorists operating space across a wide range of operating environments at a fraction of the cost of other programs” according to SOCOM’s Clarke.

The basis for Clarke’s statement is unclear however. McGraw the Special Operations Command spokesperson said SOCOM doesn’t have hard numbers on those captured or killed.

This may not be the program’s most worrying blind spot.

“It’s not asking much to require as a matter of law that the U.S. military take specific steps to ensure we’re not funding or supplying war criminals or abusive praetorian guards.”

Typically foreign troops who receive U.S. assistance undergo vetting under the so-called Leahy law to weed out gross violators of human rights. But when asked whether 127e surrogates underwent any type of screening U.S. Africa Command referred The Intercept to the State Department which referred a reporter back to AFRICOM.

In fact the program has always been immune from such oversight. While traditional security cooperation and security assistance activities conducted by special operations forces have long been subject to oversight under the Leahy law the 127e program as an effort in which proxies conduct missions for U.S. aims has been exempt from assessment monitoring and evaluation including Leahy oversight. That may finally be changing: The 2021 NDAA is the first to require the Pentagon to describe how it ensures that U.S. taxpayer dollars aren’t funneled to war criminals.

“The Leahy laws were developed specifically to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars don’t go to the units and individuals who are known to have committed violations of internationally recognized human rights — the serious crimes of torture rape or murder” said Dan Mahanty who ran the State Department’s Office of Security and Human Rights during the Obama administration and now heads the U.S. program at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “It’s not asking much to require as a matter of law that the U.S. military take specific steps to ensure we’re not funding or supplying war criminals or abusive praetorian guards.”

A History of Violence

Another program Joint Combined Exchange Training or JCET has a similarly troubled history of exploiting human rights loopholes. “JCETs often appear to bring America’s premier soldiers into conflict with aims of American diplomacy enunciated in Washington” Dana Priest of the Washington Post wrote in 1998 casting the program as one in which “effective civilian oversight and coordination with the State Department or National Security Council is minimal to nonexistent.”

Soon after the General Accounting Office (now known as the Government Accountability Office) also documented a failure to “accurately” report to Congress “the number of JCETs that were conducted their costs or their relationship to counternarcotics and counterterrorism.” And a 2013 RAND study of JCETs conducted in the Africa Command Pacific Command and Southern Command areas of operations found “moderately low” effectiveness of the missions in all three regions.

Officially the “training” provided by JCETs is for the benefit of American commandos but experts have long recognized that the program is also meant to aid foreign partners. In fact the missions’ goals include “enhancing partner forces’ counterterrorism abilities” as well as “gaining regional access with a minimal footprint” and solidifying “military-to-military contacts” according to exclusive SOCOM documents obtained by The Intercept.

JCETs are generally conducted by small groups of commandos such as an Army Special Forces Operational Detachment-Alpha a 12-person team or a Naval Special Warfare element focusing on “mission essential tasks particularly foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare” according to the files. In 2018 and 2019 commandos conducted a total of 278 JCET missions in 68 countries. SOCOM reports show that more than 4800 American special operators and nearly 32000 foreign personnel took part.

Not long after Priest’s 1998 exposé the Leahy law was applied to JCETs theoretically barring foreign units or individual troops implicated in gross human rights abuses from receiving U.S. assistance. Subsequent Intercept reporting on overseas training programs including JCETs raised serious questions about the quality of U.S. vetting procedures while a separate investigation revealed that JCETs were still regularly conducted with foreign militaries whose members were implicated in widespread atrocities.

An analysis of the SOCOM documents obtained by The Intercept finds that JCETs continue to be conducted with troops from countries labeled as consistent violators of human rights. More than 20 years ago Priest’s reporting drew special attention to JCETs conducted with Colombian forces despite their dismal human rights records. The new files show that commandos carried out four JCETs in Colombia during 2018 and 2019 despite State Department human rights reports alleging unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government.

Colombia is not an anomaly. In 2018 and 2019 JCETs were carried out with numerous nations whose security forces stand accused in State Department reports of widespread abuses including Azerbaijan Bangladesh Burkina Faso and Indonesia whose governments have been implicated in unlawful or arbitrary killings; Egypt the Philippines and Sri Lanka whose forces have reportedly committed extrajudicial killings; and Tajikistan which has been accused of “forced disappearance by the government in collusion with foreign governments; torture and abuse of detainees by security forces.”

This week the U.S. launched a two-month JCET to train Mozambican marines “to support Mozambique’s efforts to prevent the spread of terrorism and violent extremism.” A State Department press release noted that “civilian protection [and] human rights … are central to U.S. cooperation and are foundational to effectively counter the Islamic State in Mozambique.” But earlier this month Amnesty International issued a report detailing extrajudicial killings by the Mozambican military. Mozambique’s embassy in Washington D.C. did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

Oversight Wanting Oversight Wanted

As the Biden administration reviews the bedrock precepts of American war-making policy over the last two decades including the post-9/11 authorizations for military force and the rules governing counterterrorism missions outside conventional war zones how and where commandos will be employed in the coming years hangs in the balance.

“We need a firm clear oversight mechanism to make sure the things we’re doing on the ground are consistent with our broader strategy and policy.”

The reviews are all the more critical given that many billions of dollars have been poured into special operations over the last two decades but U.S. military interventions in special operations forces-centric locales like Burkina Faso Mali Niger and Somalia have been marked by worrisome and worsening outcomes. A 2019 study by Robinson and her RAND colleagues found that special operations forces’ assessments of their own efficacy “are not standardized or consistently implemented” making it impossible to evaluate for example Clarke’s glowing assessments of the 127e program to Congress. “They don’t have the data to prove it in the way that I and other RAND researchers think is needed” Robinson told The Intercept.

In terms of human rights safeguards Hartig the New America fellow sees broader policy considerations governing special operations as more important than issues with specific programs like the lack of Leahy vetting for 127e activities. “We need a firm clear oversight mechanism” he told The Intercept “to make sure the things we’re doing on the ground are consistent with our broader strategy and policy.”

If the administration concludes that special operators can continue to conduct lethal operations outside conventional war zones as was common under Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama then 127e and 1202 programs are likely to continue without major changes. This means that it’s up to Congress to rein in globe-spanning special operations and institute safeguards that ensure transparency bar commandos from supporting abusive foreign military units and protect the United States from being unintentionally drawn into wars said Mahanty of the Center for Civilians in Conflict.

Offshore Wind in the Atlantic Will Be Big. Really Big,"Off the coast of New Jersey these days surveillance vessels hired by European energy companies are taking measurements of the ocean depths and underwater research drones are analyzing water temperatures to accumulate data on the Mid-Atlantic ""Cold Pool.""

Onshore in places like the Port of Paulsboro along the Delaware River south of Camden and Philadelphia labor unions port officials and politicians are angling for new marine terminals to build and ship off massive steel monopiles.

And in weekly board meetings state-appointed officials in charge of the Garden State's public utilities are discussing massive overhauls to the power grid and many miles of new transmission lines.

Billions of dollars will be invested in the next several years — at sea and on land — to erect hundreds of wind turbines miles from the coast in order to bring New Jersey 7500 megawatts of renewable energy. That's enough to power half of the state's 1.5 million homes.

Eight other states along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have embarked on similar endeavors preparing for the arrival of a new era in American energy.

""Wind energy is going to be real. It’s just a question of how much"" EnvironmentNJ executive director Doug O'Malley said. ""Flooding down the shore is real. Our number one priority is how our coastal communities are going to be a generation from now. Who knows if we’re here in 2050? We need to study this as much as possible but also understand we need to look at the full picture of climate change.""

Offshore Wind Farms: The Lease Areas and Developers

Seventeen federally leased areas are off the coasts of eight U.S. states as of December 2021. Click on each lease site to see how many turbines are expected or estimated to which developer they belong and how much power will be generated. Turbine totals are either based on developers’ proposals or estimated using power generated by the largest turbine currently on the market.

Dire predictions of climate change and how to most quickly pivot to clean energy have fueled the embrace of offshore wind. And while most stakeholders seem on board with the nearly Eiffel Tower-sized turbines the fishing industry remains a holdout. Meanwhile the cumulative effect of so many turbines spread across the Mid-Atlantic Bight remains unknown. The bight stretches from the Outer Banks of North Carolina to the Gulf of Maine.

Only seven wind turbines currently rotate in American waters but more than 1500 are in planning or development stages from North Carolina to Massachusetts according to an NBC10 Philadelphia analysis of the federally leased areas and the 17 projects currently in development. The analysis used data from federal and state agencies as well as individual project proposals. Some proposals have cited specifically how many turbines will be built. For others an estimate was made using the megawatts approved for a project divided by the energy generated by the most powerful turbines on the market. Currently General Electric is able to construct a 12-megawatt giant called the Haliede X that can power a single-family home for two days with just a single rotation of its blades.

The turbines will occupy areas of the continental shelf encompassing 2722 square miles — larger than the state of Delaware — and most energy experts believe the ones currently in planning stage are only the first wave.

""We’re talking about a huge amount of offshore resources"" Theodore Paradise senior vice president of transmission engineering firm Anbaric said. ""We’re talking about massively more than these numbers. (States are) making what feels very big in procurement targets.""

Several developers all European have submitted construction proposals to the federal government to build out wind farms by the late 2020s. None has been approved yet even though the first few have sat in a queue at the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management since 2018.

The first farm in the federal queue Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts was given its final environmental impact study by BOEM this month and industry leaders now believe the federal permitting process will pick up under President Joe Biden.

The first wave of offshore wind farms are being considered for the Mid-Atlantic between North Carolina and Massachusetts. Advocates are pushing for hundreds of the nearly Eiffel Tower-sized turbines by 2030. Here's why they are considered key to America's energy future.

“The United States is poised to become a global clean energy leader” U.S. Interior Department Assistant Secretary Laura Daniel Davis said in announcing Vineyard Wind's environmental approval on March 8. “To realize the full environmental and economic benefits of offshore wind we must work together to ensure all potential development is advanced with robust stakeholder outreach and scientific integrity.”

Vineyard estimates turbines could begin powering Massachusetts homes in mid-2024 according to its most recent timeline presented to BOEM.

Politicians environmentalists and European companies have invested interest in the plans. Big issues still to confront include lucrative North Atlantic fishing concerns; ecological effects on what is known as the Mid-Atlantic Bight's ""Cold Pool""; and the fundamental remaking of power grids that bring the electricity into homes and businesses of 100 million Americans.

Rising Heights of Offshore Wind Turbines

Wind turbines in the ocean are much bigger than the on-land versions that dominate the landscape in places like the American Midwest. Here is how the largest turbine on the market General Electric's 12MW Haliede X compares in size to some well-known structures.

What is the Mid-Atlantic Bight's 'Cold Pool'? How Would 1000s of Turbines Affect It?

Every year off the coast of the eastern United States from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Cape Cod in Massachusetts forms a unique oceanographic feature called ""the Cold Pool.""

It's a layering of water temperatures that makes for breathtakingly cold water near the ocean floor and much warmer water near the surface and beaches. The effect is called stratification and it is created each spring peaks each summer and mixes up once again each fall.

The stark difference in water temperature during the late spring and summer months makes it one of Earth's unique marine ecosystems. It gives the continental shelf off the northeastern United States a diversity of fauna that has persisted for centuries. Fishermen and scientists alike credit the Cold Pool with powering the renowned fisheries of New England New Jersey and Maryland.

No one knows the extent to which thousands of wind turbines would have on the stratification process or if the twirling horizon-scrapers will affect the Cold Pool at all.

For much of the last decade offshore wind advocates analyzed the potential — and ecological effects — of the renewable energy at the individual turbine level and at the farm level.

A third way of looking at the new energy source has only recently emerged.

""The third level is what happens if you have 10 of these wind facilities that are near each other?"" said Josh Kohut a marine biologist at Rutgers University's Center for Ocean Observing Leadership.

Kohut and his colleagues at RU COOL released a research paper in late January that looked for potential effects on the Cold Pool through the lens of European offshore wind projects.

""The scale of the impact of these wind farms has the potential to alter the unique and delicate oceanographic conditions along the expansive Atlantic continental shelf'"" the report summary reads.

Northern Europe from Scotland to Germany has a two-decade head start on the United States in the offshore wind realm. More than 5000 turbines currently operate off the coasts of eight countries there pumping 25 gigawatts of energy into power grids.

The Rutgers team studied the continent's 110 farms looking for similar ecological areas to compare with the Mid-Atlantic Bight and its Cold Pool.

Two places in particular stood out: the Irish Sea off Scotland and the German Bight in the North Sea.

But the report found that differences in the stratification of the European bodies of water make the research conducted off the other continent difficult to directly compare with the Mid-Atlantic Bight.

[To read the FULL REPORT by Kohut and his colleagues CLICK HERE.]

""The potential for these multiple wind energy arrays to alter oceanographic processes and the biological systems that rely on them is possible"" the report summary said. ""However a great deal of uncertainty remains about the nature and scale of these interactions.""

The Rutgers team concluded more data and analysis is needed. Kohut said technology makes it possible to get a better sense of the cumulative effect of the Cold Pool in the next couple years.

He said his team continues looking at European wind farms' effects on ocean stratification there while also deploying an underwater drone off of the New Jersey coast to get data from the Cold Pool.

""Our objective is to get the latest and best science available to the people making these decisions"" Kohut said.

The European study was funded by the Science Center for Marine Fisheries a group with fishing industry affiliations that seeks to promote sustainable fisheries.

""We didn’t know the scale and depth and rate at which wind mills would develop"" SCEMFIS chairman Greg DiDomenico of Cape May N.J.-based Lund Fisheries said in an interview. ""It’s now at a tremendous pace. We have not heard what will be the impact of that type of development on the Mid-Atlantic ecosystem. And if in fact it’s wind mills at any cost then someone needs to tell us that.""

O'Malley the executive director of EnvironmentNJ which advocates for environmental issues in the Garden State said more studies on the ecological impact of offshore wind is welcome. But he added studies have been going on for years already and ""the Cold Pool is going to be affected by climate change like the rest of ocean"" if nothing is done to stem the reliance on fossil fuels.

""We’ve been strongly advocating for offshore wind and also for looking at all the site locations and the impacts"" O'Malley said. ""The ocean is a big place but also a busy place. The hope is there is a way to accommodate for offshore wind and also the ecology of the ocean.""

A Fundamental Change to the Way Power Is Delivered

For the last century the energy grid has connected power plants fueled by coal oil and gas to homes and businesses through a network of utility lines and power substations. In more recent decades nuclear plants helped wean the country off of a strictly fossil fuel diet. Still every decade or so a meltdown — whether it was in Pennsylvania or Russia or Japan — as well as the fossil fuel industry hindered a full embrace of nuclear power.

Traditionally power plants have been closer to the center of the country — places like Ohio West Virginia western Pennsylvania Tennessee where fossil fuels were mined.

At a conference of offshore wind industry leaders and experts in energy infrastructure hosted by the New Jersey Board of Utilities in late February one utility executive said the power grid is ""used to a west-east flow of energy"" and ""as we move into this new era we’re going to encounter a very different set of problems.""

Re-routing the flow of energy is not a cheap problem.

In traditional terms energy experts say adding a mile of transmission line can cost $1 million. Many miles of new offshore transmission lines will be part of the cost to connect to offshore wind farms. But it won't be the only cost.

Power grid operators like the PJM Interconnection have to upgrade many of the onshore power substations where the new wind farms off the coast will connect to the grid. PJM is a regional transmission operator headquartered in Valley Forge Pa. that connects power to 65 million Americans in 13 states. It was formed in the late 1920s when New Jersey and Pennsylvania combined their public utility grid and grew to incorporate other states as far west as Ohio and Tennessee and south to parts of North Carolina. New York state has its own system as does New England.

The cost to upgrade substations up and down the coast will likely run into the billions for each state.

Take New Jersey where two would-be projects Ørsted's Ocean Wind and EDF Renewable/Shell New Energies' Atlantic Shores have already put in requests to PJM for substation upgrades.

Their requests collectively add up to $3.5 billion according to an NBC10 Philadelphia review of wind energy entries in the PJM New Service Queue.

And that cost is only for projects that would provide up to 3000 megawatts from wind farms less than half the 7500 megawatts from offshore wind that Gov. Phil Murphy has mandated by 2035.

Officials with New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities and PJM have told NBC10 Philadelphia that all of those costs will never be realized. They say that prudent planning now in order to integrate the eventual 7500 megawatts will save consumers in the long run.

The $3.5 billion in current requests according to BPU and PJM officials will change or disappear altogether when some of the first upgrades are completed. They also say the total doesn't reflect the work being done now to avoid ""pancaking"" upgrades to the transmission grid.

New Jersey became the first state in November 2020 to sign a ""state agreement"" approach to offshore wind upgrades with PJM. The initiative is designed to account for future offshore wind projects that are not yet proposed.

“We are blazing the trail as we walk"" BPU manager of regulatory affairs Joseph DeLosa said. ""We’re the first do the state agreement approach with PJM.""

Additionally developers will pick up part of the tab for transmission upgrades and spread that cost across many years officials with BPU and the state's public utilities say.

“Everything we’re doing all of our clean energy objectives taking the state to 100% clean energy depends on the transmission system being able to take the power to customer"" BPU's general counsel Abraham Silverman said. ""If you don’t have that we’re just really behind.”

Infrastructure experts believe the upgrades in the end are integrating a renewable energy with more reliable market prices than fossil fuels.

""Is this going to be $3 or $4 billion? That seems like a lot of money but it's (spread) over decades"" Paradise the senior vice president at Anbaric said. ""The exciting thing for customers is the power you get from that is a free source.""

He noted that the biggest cost in any energy user's bill now is the price of the commodity itself be it oil or gas. That won't be the case with offshore wind.

""Wind is free. You don’t have to fill up the tank everyday"" Paradise said.

The Last Holdouts: Fishermen Versus Offshore Wind Farms

Tom Dameron who lives in South Philadelphia and runs the commercial fleet for Surfside Seafood in Port Norris N.J. fished and captained boats for decades in New Jersey and Alaska.

He decided a few years ago to get involved in advocating for his industry in issues like catch quotas and offshore wind.

Dameron said fishing interests seem to be low on the list of priorities for federal and state agencies that collaborated during the creation of the lease areas.

""What’s been disappointing about it is if you look at the lease areas and the players involved you know they want to keep them out of flyways of birds and not seeing them from the beach"" he said.

Commercial fishermen say they are concerned about the ability to trawl in the lease areas and BOEM has adjusted developers' plans to require wind turbines be at least one square mile apart.

Still boat captains are not convinced that spreading them apart will be enough to safely fish the lease grounds.

""I’ve had friends lose boats and lose crews in these areas. To put these at a mile apart and think that a commercial fisherman with a 150-ft boat can continue operating in these areas I don’t know"" Dameron said.

Annie Hawkins executive director of the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance which advocates for fishermen says she isn't sure how states are cooperating with each other as officials try to line up wind developments to meet clean energy goals.

""There is the state’s desire for wind energy"" Hawkins said using New York state and its goal of 9000 megawatts by 2035 as an example: ""Okay we need lease areas to accommodate New York to get those 9 gigawatts. But there is not a national comprehensible strategy.""

A BOEM spokesman said the federal agency which is part of the Department of the Interior now weighs the benefits and detriments of every proposed wind farm at each of the three levels that the Rutgers researcher Josh Kohut described: turbine farm all farms.

""BOEM assesses the impacts of offshore wind projects individually and cumulatively through the National Environmental Policy Act environmental assessment process. These assessments use the best scientific information available regarding potential impacts of proposed offshore wind energy facilities"" BOEM spokesman Stephen Boutwell said in an email. ""This includes studies from European offshore wind farms academic research and BOEM’s own Environmental Studies Program. As part of BOEM's Environmental Studies Program BOEM invests in environmental studies to understand the potential effects of leasing on the human and natural environment based on the feedback we get from stakeholders – including studies on oceanographic processes like the Mid-Atlantic Cold Pool.""

The federal efforts combined with the ambitions of states have not yet convinced fishermen that their industry is being considered fully according to DiDomenico the SCEMFIS chairman who advocates for Mid-Atlantic fisheries.

""I would much rather have someone look at me and go 'You’re getting wind mills and we don’t care.' I would have much more respect for people"" he said. ""But there are legitimate ecosystem concerns that appear to be I guess viewed as not important because we’re going to save the planet.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L2ZlYXR1cmUvc3RvcnktaWNvbmljLWxlZ2FjeS10b3dlci1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLTIxOTI4MNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L2ZlYXR1cmUvc3RvcnktaWNvbmljLWxlZ2FjeS10b3dlci1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLTIxOTI4MD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Story of the Iconic Legacy Tower in Bangladesh,"The race to touch the sky the need to emerge taller is as old as time. Yet during the past century we have seen numerous skyscrapers being built. However all of them are located in other parts of the world. When you think of skyscrapers the Burj Khalifa the Shanghai Tower in China or One World Trade Center in the USA will pop up in your mind. Being said that Bangladesh is now on its way to build Legacy Tower the tallest building in Asia.

Background of Legacy Tower

Although the construction was scheduled to begin in 2016 it did not come to fruition. Initially it was decided that the height would be 142 floors. Since the old plan did not see any shed of hope the construction started with the new plan.

The idea to make a tall skyscraper in Bangladesh came from Bangladeshi-American industrialist Kali Prodip Chaudhuri. After many discussions and meetings the idea was sketched on paper and Purbachal was selected as the location. However it took quite a while to get approval from Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) and from the Civil Aviation Authority Bangladesh (CAAB). After several revisions the project got approval in 2019. Both the Bangladesh government and a private organisation Powerpac Holdings limited agreed to invest in the project. PowerPack bought 46.1-hectares of land in 2019 at Purbachal new town sector 19.

Financials

In 2020 Powerpac managed to secure a $7.7 billion equivalent to Tk600 billion funding from a foreign source. Later they also worked to get an additional $4.3 billion from undisclosed sources. So far the estimated cost would be Tk 96000 crore. However it may increase as the project progresses.

Detail

The legacy tower will be 428 m (1404 ft) tall while the tip will be measured at 473 m (1552 ft) tall. It will have 111 floors in total and from 96F-111F it will feature a legacy lounge. The lounge will offer a fantastic view of the Purbachal new town from the highest observation deck in Bangladesh as it is going to be Asia's one of the tallest buildings.

The construction has started in October 2020 which is expected to finish in 2027. However the authority also keeps the scope of extending the finish date.

Design

The legacy tower is a part of the 'Bangabandhu Tri Tower' which consists of two more skyscrapers beside the Legacy Tower. The other two buildings are the 51-story Language tower and the 71-story Liberation tower. Considering the three towers as hubs 38 additional buildings will also be built around the Bangabandhu Tri Tower.

It is designed by Heerim Architects. Besides the Planners of South Korea suggested many unique structural and aesthetic features. The Towers are being constructed jointly by the three different organisations. Among the three two of them are Bangladeshi and the other one is from Japan. PowerPac Holding and Shaker Group will join the Kajima Corporation of Japan.

Technologies

The buildings will be able to generate power via solar and from waste energy. However the three towers will have three different observatory decks namely Purbachal Eye Dhaka Eye and Dhaka Moon.

Surroundings

As mentioned earlier the Bangabandhu Tri Tower will work as a central part surrounded by several other buildings. However we have already talked about the Liberation and Language tower.

The whole project is entitled the Purbachal Central Business District (CBD) development. The other buildings will be a part of the CBD project.

However the additional building will be ranging from 38-40 floors which will include numerous facilities such as-

Convention centre: CBD will have a dedicated 45 storied commercial tower which will be 220 m or 720 feet tall. The total area of the convention centre will be 3.6 million square feet.

Business Hotel: The 42-floor business hotel will surely entertain foreign delegates and visitors.

Commercial zone: A separate commercial zone will also be there which will have nine floors and an area of 243620 square meters.

Grade A Offices: These buildings will be 45 storied with a height of 225 m or 673 feet.

Purbachal Infra Zone: The Infra Zone will consist of 10 commercial towers each of them consisting 42 floors.

Residential Zone: The ten residential buildings of 42 floors each will have a height of 170 m or 560 feet.

Hospital Zone: A 200-bed hospital also be included in the design.

Educational Zone: Schools are a part of the residential area. Therefore the schooling facility will be located in the residential area.

Central Park: Waterfront space along with the water deck facilities will be a great source of entertainment for both residents and visitors.

The authority will implement an underground common duct system to make the water and sewage system convenient. Besides the electricity and communication lines will also go underground. High tech and modern wall will be established to surround the area which will serve as a protection boundary and elevated walkway for cycling or jogging.

Additionally the automated waste management system has also been added to the plan and the wastages will be discharged in the common ground. However the project also keeps the proper drainage system in the plan and heavy rainfall will not be an issue. The intelligent traffic system supplies convenient traffic information so that the residents will not have to face traffic issues.

Approximately 60% of the cost has already been arranged while two other countries the UAE and the Philippines are interested in making an investment in Bangabandhu Tri Tower. Many Bangladeshi people may disagree with this project but the project will lead to building the economic strength of Bangladesh.

Onshore in places like the Port of Paulsboro along the Delaware River south of Camden and Philadelphia labor unions port officials and politicians are angling for new marine terminals to build and ship off massive steel monopiles.

And in weekly board meetings state-appointed officials in charge of the Garden State's public utilities are discussing massive overhauls to the power grid and many miles of new transmission lines.

Billions of dollars will be invested in the next several years — at sea and on land — to erect hundreds of wind turbines miles from the coast in order to bring New Jersey 7500 megawatts of renewable energy. That's enough to power half of the state's 1.5 million homes.

Eight other states along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have embarked on similar endeavors preparing for the arrival of a new era in American energy.

""Wind energy is going to be real. It’s just a question of how much"" EnvironmentNJ executive director Doug O'Malley said. ""Flooding down the shore is real.

Offshore Wind Farms: The Lease Areas and Developers

Seventeen federally leased areas are off the coasts of eight U.S. states as of December 2021. Click on each lease site to see how many turbines are expected or estimated to which developer they belong and how much power will be generated. Turbine totals are either based on developers’ proposals or estimated using power generated by the largest turbine currently on the market.

Dire predictions of climate change and how to most quickly pivot to clean energy have fueled the embrace of offshore wind. And while most stakeholders seem on board with the nearly Eiffel Tower-sized turbines the fishing industry remains a holdout. Meanwhile the cumulative effect of so many turbines spread across the Mid-Atlantic Bight remains unknown. The bight stretches from the Outer Banks of North Carolina to the Gulf of Maine.

Only seven wind turbines currently rotate in American waters but more than 1500 are in planning or development stages from North Carolina to Massachusetts according to an NBC10 Philadelphia analysis of the federally leased areas and the 17 projects currently in development. The analysis used data from federal and state agencies as well as individual project proposals. Some proposals have cited specifically how many turbines will be built. For others an estimate was made using the megawatts approved for a project divided by the energy generated by the most powerful turbines on the market. Currently General Electric is able to construct a 12-megawatt giant called the Haliede X that can power a single-family home for two days with just a single rotation of its blades.

The turbines will occupy areas of the continental shelf encompassing 2722 square miles — larger than the state of Delaware — and most energy experts believe the ones currently in planning stage are only the first wave.

""We’re talking about a huge amount of offshore resources"" Theodore Paradise senior vice president of transmission engineering firm Anbaric said. ""We’re talking about massively more than these numbers. (States are) making what feels very big in procurement targets.""

Several developers all European have submitted construction proposals to the federal government to build out wind farms by the late 2020s. None has been approved yet even though the first few have sat in a queue at the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management since 2018.

The first farm in the federal queue Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts was given its final environmental impact study by BOEM this month and industry leaders now believe the federal permitting process will pick up under President Joe Biden.

The first wave of offshore wind farms are being considered for the Mid-Atlantic between North Carolina and Massachusetts. Advocates are pushing for hundreds of the nearly Eiffel Tower-sized turbines by 2030. Here's why they are considered key to America's energy future.

“The United States is poised to become a global clean energy leader” U.S. Interior Department Assistant Secretary Laura Daniel Davis said in announcing Vineyard Wind's environmental approval on March 8. “To realize the full environmental and economic benefits of offshore wind we must work together to ensure all potential development is advanced with robust stakeholder outreach and scientific integrity.”

Vineyard estimates turbines could begin powering Massachusetts homes in mid-2024 according to its most recent timeline presented to BOEM.

Politicians environmentalists and European companies have invested interest in the plans. Big issues still to confront include lucrative North Atlantic fishing concerns; ecological effects on what is known as the Mid-Atlantic Bight's ""Cold Pool""; and the fundamental remaking of power grids that bring the electricity into homes and businesses of 100 million Americans.

Rising Heights of Offshore Wind Turbines

Wind turbines in the ocean are much bigger than the on-land versions that dominate the landscape in places like the American Midwest. Here is how the largest turbine on the market General Electric's 12MW Haliede X compares in size to some well-known structures.

What is the Mid-Atlantic Bight's 'Cold Pool'? How Would 1000s of Turbines Affect It?

Every year off the coast of the eastern United States from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Cape Cod in Massachusetts forms a unique oceanographic feature called ""the Cold Pool.""

It's a layering of water temperatures that makes for breathtakingly cold water near the ocean floor and much warmer water near the surface and beaches. The effect is called stratification and it is created each spring peaks each summer and mixes up once again each fall.

The stark difference in water temperature during the late spring and summer months makes it one of Earth's unique marine ecosystems. It gives the continental shelf off the northeastern United States a diversity of fauna that has persisted for centuries. Fishermen and scientists alike credit the Cold Pool with powering the renowned fisheries of New England New Jersey and Maryland.

No one knows the extent to which thousands of wind turbines would have on the stratification process or if the twirling horizon-scrapers will affect the Cold Pool at all.

For much of the last decade offshore wind advocates analyzed the potential — and ecological effects — of the renewable energy at the individual turbine level and at the farm level.

A third way of looking at the new energy source has only recently emerged.

""The third level is what happens if you have 10 of these wind facilities that are near each other?"" said Josh Kohut a marine biologist at Rutgers University's Center for Ocean Observing Leadership.

Kohut and his colleagues at RU COOL released a research paper in late January that looked for potential effects on the Cold Pool through the lens of European offshore wind projects.

""The scale of the impact of these wind farms has the potential to alter the unique and delicate oceanographic conditions along the expansive Atlantic continental shelf'"" the report summary reads.

Northern Europe from Scotland to Germany has a two-decade head start on the United States in the offshore wind realm. More than 5000 turbines currently operate off the coasts of eight countries there pumping 25 gigawatts of energy into power grids.

The Rutgers team studied the continent's 110 farms looking for similar ecological areas to compare with the Mid-Atlantic Bight and its Cold Pool.

Two places in particular stood out: the Irish Sea off Scotland and the German Bight in the North Sea.

But the report found that differences in the stratification of the European bodies of water make the research conducted off the other continent difficult to directly compare with the Mid-Atlantic Bight.

[To read the FULL REPORT by Kohut and his colleagues CLICK HERE.]

""The potential for these multiple wind energy arrays to alter oceanographic processes and the biological systems that rely on them is possible"" the report summary said. ""However a great deal of uncertainty remains about the nature and scale of these interactions.""

The Rutgers team concluded more data and analysis is needed. Kohut said technology makes it possible to get a better sense of the cumulative effect of the Cold Pool in the next couple years.

He said his team continues looking at European wind farms' effects on ocean stratification there while also deploying an underwater drone off of the New Jersey coast to get data from the Cold Pool.

""Our objective is to get the latest and best science available to the people making these decisions"" Kohut said.

The European study was funded by the Science Center for Marine Fisheries a group with fishing industry affiliations that seeks to promote sustainable fisheries.

""We didn’t know the scale and depth and rate at which wind mills would develop"" SCEMFIS chairman Greg DiDomenico of Cape May N.J.-based Lund Fisheries said in an interview. ""It’s now at a tremendous pace. We have not heard what will be the impact of that type of development on the Mid-Atlantic ecosystem. And if in fact it’s wind mills at any cost then someone needs to tell us that.""

O'Malley the executive director of EnvironmentNJ which advocates for environmental issues in the Garden State said more studies on the ecological impact of offshore wind is welcome. But he added studies have been going on for years already and ""the Cold Pool is going to be affected by climate change like the rest of ocean"" if nothing is done to stem the reliance on fossil fuels.

""We’ve been strongly advocating for offshore wind and also for looking at all the site locations and the impacts"" O'Malley said. ""The ocean is a big place but also a busy place. The hope is there is a way to accommodate for offshore wind and also the ecology of the ocean.""

A Fundamental Change to the Way Power Is Delivered

For the last century the energy grid has connected power plants fueled by coal oil and gas to homes and businesses through a network of utility lines and power substations. In more recent decades nuclear plants helped wean the country off of a strictly fossil fuel diet. Still every decade or so a meltdown — whether it was in Pennsylvania or Russia or Japan — as well as the fossil fuel industry hindered a full embrace of nuclear power.

Traditionally power plants have been closer to the center of the country — places like Ohio West Virginia western Pennsylvania Tennessee where fossil fuels were mined.

At a conference of offshore wind industry leaders and experts in energy infrastructure hosted by the New Jersey Board of Utilities in late February one utility executive said the power grid is ""used to a west-east flow of energy"" and ""as we move into this new era we’re going to encounter a very different set of problems.""

Re-routing the flow of energy is not a cheap problem.

In traditional terms energy experts say adding a mile of transmission line can cost $1 million. Many miles of new offshore transmission lines will be part of the cost to connect to offshore wind farms. But it won't be the only cost.

Power grid operators like the PJM Interconnection have to upgrade many of the onshore power substations where the new wind farms off the coast will connect to the grid. PJM is a regional transmission operator headquartered in Valley Forge Pa. that connects power to 65 million Americans in 13 states. It was formed in the late 1920s when New Jersey and Pennsylvania combined their public utility grid and grew to incorporate other states as far west as Ohio and Tennessee and south to parts of North Carolina. New York state has its own system as does New England.

The cost to upgrade substations up and down the coast will likely run into the billions for each state.

Take New Jersey where two would-be projects Ørsted's Ocean Wind and EDF Renewable/Shell New Energies' Atlantic Shores have already put in requests to PJM for substation upgrades.

Their requests collectively add up to $3.5 billion according to an NBC10 Philadelphia review of wind energy entries in the PJM New Service Queue.

And that cost is only for projects that would provide up to 3000 megawatts from wind farms less than half the 7500 megawatts from offshore wind that Gov. Phil Murphy has mandated by 2035.

Officials with New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities and PJM have told NBC10 Philadelphia that all of those costs will never be realized. They say that prudent planning now in order to integrate the eventual 7500 megawatts will save consumers in the long run.

The $3.5 billion in current requests according to BPU and PJM officials will change or disappear altogether when some of the first upgrades are completed. They also say the total doesn't reflect the work being done now to avoid ""pancaking"" upgrades to the transmission grid.

New Jersey became the first state in November 2020 to sign a ""state agreement"" approach to offshore wind upgrades with PJM. The initiative is designed to account for future offshore wind projects that are not yet proposed.

“We are blazing the trail as we walk"" BPU manager of regulatory affairs Joseph DeLosa said. ""We’re the first do the state agreement approach with PJM.""

Additionally developers will pick up part of the tab for transmission upgrades and spread that cost across many years officials with BPU and the state's public utilities say.

“Everything we’re doing all of our clean energy objectives taking the state to 100% clean energy depends on the transmission system being able to take the power to customer"" BPU's general counsel Abraham Silverman said. ""If you don’t have that we’re just really behind.”

Infrastructure experts believe the upgrades in the end are integrating a renewable energy with more reliable market prices than fossil fuels.

""Is this going to be $3 or $4 billion? That seems like a lot of money but it's (spread) over decades"" Paradise the senior vice president at Anbaric said. ""The exciting thing for customers is the power you get from that is a free source.""

He noted that the biggest cost in any energy user's bill now is the price of the commodity itself be it oil or gas. That won't be the case with offshore wind.

""Wind is free. You don’t have to fill up the tank everyday"" Paradise said.

The Last Holdouts: Fishermen Versus Offshore Wind Farms

Tom Dameron who lives in South Philadelphia and runs the commercial fleet for Surfside Seafood in Port Norris N.J. fished and captained boats for decades in New Jersey and Alaska.

He decided a few years ago to get involved in advocating for his industry in issues like catch quotas and offshore wind.

Dameron said fishing interests seem to be low on the list of priorities for federal and state agencies that collaborated during the creation of the lease areas.

""What’s been disappointing about it is if you look at the lease areas and the players involved you know they want to keep them out of flyways of birds and not seeing them from the beach"" he said.

Commercial fishermen say they are concerned about the ability to trawl in the lease areas and BOEM has adjusted developers' plans to require wind turbines be at least one square mile apart.

Still boat captains are not convinced that spreading them apart will be enough to safely fish the lease grounds.

""I’ve had friends lose boats and lose crews in these areas. To put these at a mile apart and think that a commercial fisherman with a 150-ft boat can continue operating in these areas I don’t know"" Dameron said.

Annie Hawkins executive director of the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance which advocates for fishermen says she isn't sure how states are cooperating with each other as officials try to line up wind developments to meet clean energy goals.

""There is the state’s desire for wind energy"" Hawkins said using New York state and its goal of 9000 megawatts by 2035 as an example: ""Okay we need lease areas to accommodate New York to get those 9 gigawatts. But there is not a national comprehensible strategy.""

A BOEM spokesman said the federal agency which is part of the Department of the Interior now weighs the benefits and detriments of every proposed wind farm at each of the three levels that the Rutgers researcher Josh Kohut described: turbine farm all farms.

""BOEM assesses the impacts of offshore wind projects individually and cumulatively through the National Environmental Policy Act environmental assessment process. These assessments use the best scientific information available regarding potential impacts of proposed offshore wind energy facilities"" BOEM spokesman Stephen Boutwell said in an email. ""This includes studies from European offshore wind farms academic research and BOEM’s own Environmental Studies Program. As part of BOEM's Environmental Studies Program BOEM invests in environmental studies to understand the potential effects of leasing on the human and natural environment based on the feedback we get from stakeholders – including studies on oceanographic processes like the Mid-Atlantic Cold Pool.""

The federal efforts combined with the ambitions of states have not yet convinced fishermen that their industry is being considered fully according to DiDomenico the SCEMFIS chairman who advocates for Mid-Atlantic fisheries.

""I would much rather have someone look at me and go 'You’re getting wind mills and we don’t care.' I would have much more respect for people"" he said. ""But there are legitimate ecosystem concerns that appear to be I guess viewed as not important because we’re going to save the planet.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvcGVyc2lzdGVudC1wb2xsdXRhbnRzL21pY3JvYmVzLXNhdmUtdXMtUEZBUy85OS9pMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can microbes save us from PFAS?,"In brief Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are high-profile environmental contaminants whose strong carbon-fluorine bonds make them difficult to degrade. Scientists have reason to believe that microbes could be enlisted to do the job. These researchers have identified microbes that defluorinate select PFAS to different extents and they are working to identify the mechanisms behind PFAS breakdown. Some are aiming to boost the microbes’ activity to achieve complete defluorination while others are developing practical ways to combine microbes with chemical remediation of contaminated water and soil. Because the odds are stacked against microbes’ being able to conquer PFAS on their own researchers also say that regulatory agencies should restrict PFAS use without delay.

For 3 decades starting in the 1940s General Electric dumped solvents from its manufacturing facilities into New York’s Hudson River contaminating it with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Scientists worried about how best to clean up the pollutants. “At that time they thought PCBs were completely nonbiodegradable” says Lawrence P. Wackett a biochemist at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities who consulted for the company in the late 1980s.

But analysis of sediment cores extracted from the river throughout the 1980s showed that the PCBs were slowly losing their chlorine atoms and turning into benign hydrocarbons. Later scientists determined that the transformation was performed by microbes (Science 1987 DOI: 10.1126/science.236.4802.709).

Now researchers are hoping microbes could do the same for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) also known as forever chemicals. Used in personal care products as well as firefighting foam stain-repellent coatings and membranes for chlor-alkali production PFAS have strong carbon-fluorine bonds that make them difficult to degrade. PFAS have become a high-profile contaminant polluting areas near manufacturing facilities that make or use them and military sites like air bases. Researchers are still trying to fully understand the health effects of PFAS but have determined that some are carcinogenic and toxic to multiple systems.

Traditionally to treat contaminated water remediators first concentrate the PFAS typically via an activated carbon filter and then incinerate the saturated filters at high temperatures. Biological remediation could be more cost effective for low levels of PFAS in large volumes of contaminated material. So far no organism has been found that can completely defluorinate PFAS but researchers have no reason to believe that microbes couldn’t eventually do the job. “Never say never in terms of what they can’t handle” Wackett says.

The US Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) has funded extensive research into the chemical and physical remediation of PFAS. In 2018 SERDP launched a call for research proposals exploring the biodegradation of PFAS and awarded $2.75 million to five projects beginning last year.

However other scientists like Rolf U. Halden an environmental engineer at Arizona State University worry that investigating bioremediation of PFAS distracts from the real work of having to dial back on their use. Halden is “very very skeptical” that a microbe could be practically deployed to remediate PFAS. “I think that this will only delay the actual hard question that we have to answer: How much [PFAS] is too much and how do we get to a healthy use of these very useful materials?” he says.

If it’s going to fail let’s fail fast so that we do not waste time on this. Pedro J. J. Alvarez environmental engineer Rice University

Microbial infallibility

In his 1951 textbook The Chemical Activities of Bacteria British microbiologist Ernest Gale put forward the microbial infallibility hypothesis—that if there is energy to be gained from a compound a microorganism will figure out how to extract it and create a niche for itself. After the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill for example scientists found that microbes eventually ate most of the energy-rich hydrocarbon compounds that spilled into the Gulf of Mexico resolving part of the problem naturally.

Halogenated compounds such as PCBs contain much less energy than hydrocarbons but microbes can still use them (Biochem. J. 2020 DOI: 10.1042/BCJ20190720). In the Hudson River Dehalococcoides bacteria living in oxygen-poor environments in the sediment transfer electrons to the PCBs reducing them and kicking out chloride ions Wackett explains.

In fact Dehalococcoides are obligate dehalogenators Halden says meaning they can survive only by dumping their electrons on halogenated organic compounds. But there are significant differences between PFAS and their chlorinated counterparts he says. To start carbon-fluorine bonds are much stronger and harder to break than carbon-chlorine bonds.

More importantly microbes evolved along with thousands of naturally occurring chlorinated compounds so when bacteria like Dehalococcoides encounter human-made chlorinated pollutants like PCBs or trichloroethylene (TCE) they don’t see those pollutants as completely foreign. “These organisms existed before we created TCE” Halden says. But naturally occurring fluorinated compounds are rare; only fluoroacetate is well studied in plants and it contains just one fluorine atom. PFAS in contrast especially the perfluorinated ones are swathed in fluorine atoms. “That renders the chemicals almost bulletproof” Halden says.

PFAS are so recalcitrant that one of the five SERDP-funded projects investigating biological methods to destroy PFAS instead demonstrated that previously reported chemical degradation methods don’t work. Pedro J. J. Alvarez an environmental engineer at Rice University had been working with bacteria that can produce copious amounts of superoxide outside their cells. Alvarez read that superoxide generated by decomposing hydrogen peroxide could break down perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) one of the most common PFAS found in the environment (Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett. 2014 DOI: 10.1021/ez4000862) so he proposed that superoxide-generating bacteria could perhaps degrade PFAS. He and his colleagues found however that superoxide generated chemically or enzymatically could not break down PFOA (Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett. 2020 DOI: 10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00505). When Alvarez and his team dug deeper they found that another heavily investigated substance for PFOA degradation hydroxyl radicals could not do the job either (Chemosphere 2020 DOI: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.125883).

But Alvarez is not discouraged. “If it’s going to fail let’s fail fast so that we do not waste time on this” he says. That way the research community can move on and try other approaches. His team’s recent work on using the superoxide-generating bacteria to dechlorinate TCE has shown outstanding results Alvarez says. The bacteria are effective even when oxygen which could compete with TCE as an electron acceptor is present. Because TCE is a common cocontaminant with PFAS Alvarez thinks the superoxide-generating bacteria could still prove useful by eliminating other pollutants that may interfere with remediation processes that target PFAS.

And Alvarez believes in the microbial infallibility hypothesis—that a microbe will find a way to use even tough compounds like PFAS. “I am certain that it can happen” he says.

A point of weakness

A key factor for how easily a microbe can break down a fluorinated compound is if the molecule contains a spot vulnerable to attack such as a carbon-hydrogen bond says Jinxia Liu an environmental engineer at McGill University. Liu has been investigating the biotransformation of polyfluorinated compounds called fluorotelomers for over a decade. Fluorotelomers such as 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid which is used in firefighting foams contain such a spot that is susceptible to microbial action.

Aerobic Gordonia bacteria perform a well-known transformation on fluorotelomers: they consume the sulfonated part leaving a highly persistent perfluorinated carboxylic acid. Liu has observed perfluorinated biotransformation products that are one or two carbons shorter though suggesting that Gordonia is also capable of chopping up the fluorinated tail one carbon at a time. “In theory we can completely defluorinate a fluorotelomer” says Liu whose calculations show that the process is energetically favorable. But Liu’s team observed that the removal usually stops after two cycles. The researchers are working to figure out why the defluorination stops and how to push the microbes to repeat the removal until all the fluorine atoms are gone.

In perfluorinated molecules moieties like a double bond could serve as the necessary point of weakness. Yujie Men of the University of California Riverside incubated KB1 a commercially available microbial culture that is used for dechlorination and that includes Dehalococcoides bacteria with lactate and a variety of perfluorinated molecules. The lactate provides electrons for the microbes while the PFAS act as electron acceptors. The microbes degraded 100% of one unsaturated perfluorinated molecule—(E)-perfluoro(4-methylpent-2-enoic acid)—after 130 days and more than 90% of another—4555-tetrafluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pentenoic acid—after 70 days compared with none of the saturated perfluorinated compounds (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2020 DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.0c04483).

Men’s team has identified intermediates suggesting that two initial reactions—with opposite effects—compete during the biotransformation process. The microbes could be replacing fluorine atoms on the double-bonded carbons with hydrogen thereby making the molecule more vulnerable to additional defluorination. Or they could be adding two hydrogen atoms across the double bond creating a saturated compound that is more resistant to defluorination. Men is working to identify the specific bacteria responsible for the reactions and the enzymes involved. “There is a way to direct them as long as we know which microorganism and which enzymes are carrying out the defluorination reaction and the hydrogenation reaction” she says.

As for PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) which contain no weak spots a bacterium native to the wetlands of New Jersey may be able to defluorinate them (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2019 DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.9b04047). Peter Jaffé and his group at Princeton University have been studying A6 a strain of the microbe Acidimicrobium since 2005. This microbe performs a reaction called Feammox in which it transfers electrons from ammonium ions to iron(III) ions in acidic soil.

Jaffé’s team sequenced A6’s genome and noticed it had genes coding for dehalogenases. “Some of them were quite novel” Jaffé says. The team then decided to see what happens when A6 is given only PFAS as its sole source of carbon. Over 100 days of incubation with either PFOA or PFOS the researchers found a steady disappearance of up to 60% of the compounds with an accompanying rise in dissolved organic carbon and fluoride ions.

Jaffé is now collaborating with the University of Minnesota’s Wackett to decipher the mechanisms behind A6’s defluorinating power. Wackett is using a combination of computational and experimental techniques to narrow down the enzymes and the genes that could be responsible.

Practicality

In the laboratory researchers can create ideal conditions for microbes to feed on PFAS or even force them to do it. Deploying microbes out in the environment for in situ remediation however presents significant challenges. Halden notes that Jaffé’s and Men’s studies used high concentrations of PFAS. But in the real-world environment even though PFAS are present in some places at levels dangerous to people’s health they still exist only at parts-per-billion concentrations.

Worse there are many other goodies in the environment for microbes to feast on and it is hard to control what they choose. Men has witnessed microbes in the commercial KB1 culture turn from consuming PFAS to eating an alternative like TCE when it is present. “It’s very difficult because it’s like you’re asking someone to eat grass rather than normal food” Men says.

Our strategy is based on the understanding that we aren’t going to be able to directly biodegrade these PFAS. We need to start the job for the microorganisms. Bruce E. Rittmann environmental engineer Arizona State University

Whether microbial action can be exploited cost-effectively will also depend on the contaminated site Alvarez says. A key parameter is how quickly water will carry PFAS at a particular site to another place: if the migration is slow remediators can get away with a slow microbial degradation process. “But if the rate of migration is fast then you better look for a more aggressive faster solution to protect public health” he says.

A more feasible option is ex situ remediation in which the contaminated material is pumped away and treated in an isolated bioreactor under controllable conditions. In a treatment facility biological remediation can also be paired with chemical remediation. Bruce E. Rittmann an environmental engineer at Arizona State University is taking such a two-step approach.

“Our strategy is based on the understanding that we aren’t going to be able to directly biodegrade these PFAS” he says. “We need to start the job for the microorganisms.”

In Rittmann’s strategy PFAS first go through a hydrogenation reaction with a palladium catalyst which replaces some of the fluorine atoms with hydrogen. Then the partially defluorinated material is fed to a diverse group of microbes that finish the defluorination job. Rittmann has successfully demonstrated the steps individually and is now working to link them in a two-stage setup. The group is also investigating various research questions such as how much defluorination is required in the first step and what the biotransformation products are.

McGill’s Liu is collaborating with microbiologist Nancy N. Perreault of Canada’s National Research Council to explore microbial biodegradation of PFOS after it first receives photochemical treatment that partially defluorinates it.

Currently the microbes being studied for PFAS degradation grow too slowly and their defluorination performances are not good enough for any practical remedy for environmental contamination of PFAS Men says. Nevertheless at the risk of sounding too optimistic Men says she is hopeful that microbes will eventually rise to the challenge: “Bacteria have really huge potential and they evolve very fast.”

Whether or not microbes are ever able to conquer PFAS most researchers agree that the use of PFAS should be restricted without delay. Despite voluntary phaseouts and even international bans on a few PFAS some 1400 PFAS are still being used in about 200 applications spanning almost every industry. Some applications such as medical equipment and chlor-alkali membranes might justify the use of PFAS. But PFAS may not be required for other products—like artificial turf guitar strings or children’s rain jackets. “We have to look deeper into what’s really necessary and what is not” Liu says.",,,,,,

There’s a healthy amount of synthesizer development and manufacturing going on in Russia and here are the ones you should keep an eye on.

Polivoks

Whenever someone mentions Russian synths the Polivoks is the first machine that comes to mind. Built like a Soviet tank it was the USSR’s attempt at a Moog-like synthesizer that ended up having a completely unique character all of its own. While it’s difficult to find functioning originals the allure of the Polivoks remains and numerous clones and tributes to this synth have emerged over the years.

Here’s Hainbach having a go on an original Formanta Polivoks

With that out of our system we can now look at what’s hot and what’s cool in Russian synthesizers of today.

SOMA LABs

Top of the list has to be Soma Labs. Founded by Vlad Kreimer after the success of the LYRA-8 synthesizer they have continued to produce exciting unique organic and fascinatingly poetic machines that follow none of the usual music gear rules. While they do have an office in Poland it is in the development lab in Moscow that all the magic happens -“inheriting the best engineering traditions of the USSR – the country of advanced scientific and industrial achievements.”

Their product range includes the original LYRA-8 drone synth The Pipe a strange voice and breath controlled synth and the Pulsar 23 which is probably the most awesome drum machine ever conceived.

AVP Synths

Also based in Moscow are AVP Synthesizers who have been producing and modifying synths and drum machines for over 20 years. Behind the scenes they are a collective of musicians and producers.

Most recently their focus has been on analog drum synthesis with their huge ADS-7 drum synth and their more contained Ritmibox with 5 sound channels. It’s interesting how the style of the Polivoks tends to bleed through into the aesthetic of these synths.

ELTA Music

Recently they released the SOLAR 50 synthesizer playground which is a large exploratory machine of sound and possibility. It has 10 individually controller voices that are manipulated via an experimental touch controller. There’s nothing out there quite like it. But it was their Polyvox Mini that first brought them to our attention.

The Polyvox-M was inspired by the Soviet synth but designed to be simpler and lighter and maybe even remove a few of the flaws of the original. The result is a nice looking box with tank-track sides and a welcome splash of colour.

Eternal Engine

Here’s an entire synthesizer based on vacuum and gas-filled radio tubes. It’s called Apparatus and it totally nails that Soviet synth aesthetic that we like so much. It’s both industrial and beautiful brutal and organic. The audio signal path is based entirely on radio tubes. It’s duophonic and capable of sounding gooier than anything else out there.

Infradeep

Previously known as the Nave Polymorph the PVX-800 from Infradeep is unapologetically based on the Polivoks. They’ve added a few waveforms an arpeggiator ring modulator MIDI and they’ve stabilised it and wrapped it up in a rather nice looking desktop box in blue or white.

Playtronica

Playtronica comes with a very different vibe. They are into curiosity playfulness and the human touch. They’ve been messing around with simple interactive electronic instruments that generate sound in response to touch using you (or fruit) as the source of voltage and modulation. They are a lot of fun.

Coming soon is the equally different Orbita turntable sequencer which couldn’t be further from the Polivoks vibe and looks fantastic.

Polivoks Reissue

Of course you could always buy the real thing. Not the original but as near you’re going to get in a new synthesizer. The Polivoks Pro is based on the original schematics using 85% original Soviet-era parts and hand-crafted in Russia.

We heard about this in 2016 and at the time only 100 were being made and so it’s quite possible that this is all over already. But the website is still live and you can register your interest by email.

Update: Apparently you can buy them for €1600 ex VAT from Schneidersladen.

And more…

If you know of any other Russian based manufacturers that we’ve missed then do let me know in the comments. There’s a growing number of modular makers in Russia that would make a great subject for a future article.

Something didn't quite add up during Sunday's ""Splinter"" episode of The Walking Dead. Picking up right where what was originally the season 10 finale ended ""Splinter"" showed what happened next to Princess Eugene Yumiko and Ezekiel after they were surrounded by white-armor-clad stormtrooper-looking soldiers at the train yard meeting spot designated by Eugene's radio buddy Stephanie.

The episode then focused on what happened immediately in the aftermath to Princess who was thrown into a train car (never a good place to be on The Walking Dead incidentally). Through conversations (either face-to-face or through walls) with her new friends we learned about Princess' devastating past which included her being physically assaulted by her stepfather. That trauma came back into play later as we watched Ezekiel brutally assault one of the captured soldiers only to then realize it was actually Princess—who confessed to suffering from ADHD PTSD anxiety depression and ""crushing loneliness""—that was beating the soldier and that she had been imagining the interactions with her traveling companions all along.

Princess eventually cut a deal with the soldier answering the questions she had refused to answer before and giving him his weapon back—only to then see her friends with bags over their heads and then one placed on hers as well. Where are they off to next? Turns out it may not be where comic book readers familiar with this story arc think. That's according to showrunner Angela Kang who shared more insight and intel on the installment.

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: First off was I the only one getting flashbacks to train car A at Terminus while watching this?

ANGELA KANG: Absolutely. It's so funny because this train station idea comes from the comic book. They go to this old rail yard and it definitely felt like Eugene—anytime he's in a train car or train station—he'd be a little bit like ""Oh my God!"" It was weird for me because we haven't done this much around trains in a while. Then there's more to come later...

Where did the idea come from to delve into both Princess' past and her mental illness?

With Princess there was this very practical thing that ended up happening which is that when we were filming these episodes we didn't fly our European-based actors here because at the time we started prepping the epidemiologist was like ""Well air travel across the country there's ways to mitigate the risk but anybody who doesn't have to fly right now really shouldn't.""

So the decision was made to leave Eleanor [Matsuura] and Nadia [Hilker] who hail from the U.K. and Germany [and play Yumiko and Magna] at home until we could get a little more of a handle on what was going on which sucks because we love Eleanor and she desperately wanted to come back to work. But we made a decision for safety reasons. It wouldn't have made sense to not have her in the episodes and it didn't make sense to not deal with that grouping at all. We felt like we wanted to touch on them but how do you do that and just leave a member of the foursome out of the episode other than via voice and the effect shots?

And we're like the way you can do it is if you make the story about a POV. It's got to come through a character's individual experience because then you can live it through what they are seeing hearing and experiencing. Since Princess is the newest of that group we thought what a great time to dive in more with Princess. Paola [Lázaro] is great. I think the audience anytime we have a new character they're hungry to know more about them and live through their experience.

So then the writers started working on it and had this wild pitch for the twist at the end which I was not expecting but which I thought was really interesting. So [the Princess idea] came about from production limitations [then became] a practical reality of ""Well what do we want to talk about?"" And then ""What can we learn about her without getting ahead of what we have planned for season 11?"" And so it sort of makes sense to illuminate a little bit more about who she is and where she came from and the challenges she's faced as somebody who has had to live by herself for a very very very long time and the things that has done to her mental state.

I saw Paola Lázaro who plays Princess with you on Friday Night in With the Morgans talking very openly about growing up with ADHD. I know everything in terms of the production process and shooting these episodes was different and writers couldn't be around as much so were you all able to have conversations with Paola about her input on Princess' mental state and how to show that on screen?

I've talked to her a bit about ADHD. I absolutely adore Paola. She's so wonderful and she's got this real openness of spirit so even in the first conversation I had with her before I cast her in the role she went deep. We had a very deep conversation and I was like ""All right."" She's got the emotional availability that we need for this role as well as being very funny and bright. But the character in our conception of her has a lot of things going on. I think we wanted somebody who could play that depth so we absolutely talked up the fact that she is ADHD.

My son is diagnosed ADHD as well so I think there's something to that that's very meaningful but it's also like this is somebody who's gone through so much trauma before the apocalypse but also within the apocalypse and is in a very very stressful situation. So I think with Princess we're always kind of playing like we know she's got this active imagination. She's the one that tied up the walkers into these little scenarios so in this episode I think she's made up this whole scenario like is it some kind of an episode. Is it just something that is her way of coping with being examined naked while being asked these really intrusive questions?

We sort of wanted to leave that open. And with Paola she always has really smart questions but she's also very much a problem solver on her own so we kind of gave her the episode and she ran with it in a lot of ways which I think was really exciting. She just makes very very interesting acting choices on screen and connects to material in a deep way and really dives down.

What's it like when you're crafting a story where you don't necessarily want to tip the audience off to what you're doing with Princess imagining these voices and faces but you also have be able to backtrack it so it all adds up later once the pieces are put in place?

The interesting thing [about] this episode—and Khary Payton [Ezekiel] has talked about this too—is where it all starts to fall apart is in the scene with Ezekiel. He just is acting a little bit un-Ezekiel-like and so even when it was being pitched to me I was like ""I don't know if he would say this line. That doesn't seem quite right."" I had a lot of notes on the scene. And then once they revealed why I was like ""Okay I get it but now let's go back and make sure that we're tipping it at the exact moment that we want to and not from the first moment of the scene necessarily.""

So we went through [the episode] multiple times to try to figure out ""Do we think we are holding the illusion well enough?"" and then finding those moments with little clues where it's starting to break. There are things that if you go back and look it's like ""Wait a second why was it so easy for her to get from one train car to another?"" Even in the way that the episode is shot it's very very subtle but the stuff that is ""real"" is shot one way and then the stuff that is fantasy is with a little bit of handheld shake which we don't always use. It's very subtle but there are just ways like that where it differentiates itself.

The big thing that we wanted was [for Princess to have] a skill: She's actually very good at studying people and understanding human nature. So in a way I think she has a good read upon this group that she's with even though she hasn't known them very long. However it's not like a hundred percent accurate either. We'll get to an episode in season 11 where there are moments when she's like ""Huh that didn't go exactly the way I thought it did.""

Paola Lázaro as Princess on 'The Walking Dead'. Josh Stringer/AMC

Princess totally beat the crap out of this soldier. I guess the closest comparison to the state she's in now would maybe be Morgan in ""Clear."" Since I'm guessing proper medication is pretty scarce at this point is this something we need to monitor moving forward in terms of Princess?

With Princess we're still having all those conversations. I think she has these things that she's dealing with and the apocalypse makes it difficult to manage or at least it's different. Like my son is on ADHD medication and it's not exactly like she's been doing that. In the apocalypse she hasn't been able to talk to a therapist about her depression or her PTSD so there's just a lot that's going on with her. And as with all of our characters who are dealing with the trauma that they're having to live through that is part of their story but it's not the only thing that defines them. So it's just it's part of the emotional underpinnings of her that we'll explore in various ways as time goes on.

This captured soldier tells Princess this is all just protocol and alludes to the fact that things will be better once they go through this questioning just to make sure they are on the up and up. Should we believe him?

That it's all on the up and up? He's in kind of a bad situation himself so I think there are elements that you'll find to be true but of course everybody's got their own perspective on things certainly Princess. She's no idiot and I think she believes him enough and that means something but that doesn't mean things aren't complicated. I mean it's a bunch of people in these scary suits. It certainly doesn't feel good.

I have a feeling I know where they're being brought to but what do you want to say about where Eugene Ezekiel Yumiko and Princess are heading to next with those bags over their heads?

I will say they're heading somewhere and it may not be exactly what people are picturing at first so those who know the comics... there may be stop along the way. I'll say that.

What's coming up next week?

The next episode is called ""Diverged"" and we're going to check back in with Daryl Carol and Dog. This starts in the aftermath of the fight that they had at the end of ""Find Me."" In a lot of ways this is a lighter-toned episode as they're both working through their thoughts and emotions by being busy and taking care of some things that need to be taken care of that manifest in different problems that they wind up [with] as they are split up. Hopefully it'll just be these fun stories about these two with the dog playing his own role in it as we see them in the aftermath of what was a very very painful conversation for the two of them and we see where they're at with each other.

Saudi Aramco is no longer the world's most profitable company after the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on oil demand in 2020.

Aramco reported its full-year 2020 results on Sunday showing a 44% collapse in profits to $49 billion. The world's largest oil company said that despite the results it plans to pay out its full-year dividend of $75 billion.

The shortage in chips the “brain” within every electronic device in the world has been steadily worsening since last year.

Initially the problem was only a temporary delay in supplies as factories shut down when the coronavirus pandemic first hit.

However although production is back to normal a new surge in demand driven by changing habits fuelled by the pandemic means that it is now reaching crisis point.

Car manufacturers investing in tech-heavy electric vehicles the boom in sales of TVs and home computers and launch of new games consoles and 5G-enabled mobile phones have all driven demand.

Even the mighty Apple a $2tn company and the world’s biggest buyer of semiconductors spending $58bn annually was forced to delay the launch of the much-hyped iPhone 12 by two months last year due to the shortage.

“Chips are everything” says Neil Campling media and tech analyst at Mirabaud. “There is a perfect storm of supply and demand factors going on here. But basically there is a new level of demand that can’t be kept up with everyone is in crisis and it is getting worse.”

Ford recently cancelled shifts at two car plants and said profits could be hit by up to $2.5bn this year due to chip shortages while Nissan is idling output at plants in Mexico and the US. General Motors said it could face a $2bn profit hit.

Last month Sony which along with other console makers has struggled with stock shortages over the last year said it might not hit sales targets for the new PS5 this year because of the semiconductor supply issue. Microsoft’s Xbox has said it forecasts supply issues continuing at least until the second half of the year.

However the most telling example of the semiconductor crisis has come from Samsung the world’s second-largest buyer of chips for its products after Apple. Earlier this week the company said it might have to postpone the launch of its high-end smartphone due to the shortage despite also being the world’s second-largest producer of chips.

“It is incredible that Samsung sells $56bn of semiconductors to others and consumes $36bn of them itself finds it may have to delay the launch of one of its own products” says Campling.

Samsung’s co-chief executive Koh Dong-jin who also heads its mobile business unit highlighted a significant issue saying that there is a “serious imbalance” in the pecking order of who is getting the limited supplies of chips.

Car manufacturers who cut chip orders as vehcle sales fell last year found themselves at the back of the queue when they tried to reorder when the market rebounded. The entire global car industry buys about $37bn worth of chips with the biggest players such as Toyota and Volkswagen spending more than $4bn each making them relative minnows for semiconductor suppliers.

“The worst affected have been autos because they were last to the party; if Apple is spending $56bn a year and growing who are you going to keep supplies going to first?” says Campling.

The chip shortage looks set to persist for some time yet. It can take up to two years to get complex semiconductor production factories up and running and manufacturers are in the process of significantly raising prices for the second time in less than a year.

“There is no sign of supply catching up or demand decreasing while prices are rising across the chain” says Campling. “This will cross over to people in the street. Expect cars to cost more phones to cost more. This year’s iPhone is not going to be cheaper than last year.”"

Use of another class of materials polyolefins (POEs) has grown rapidly in the past few years. IHS Markit put the market share of POE encapsulants at 20% last year almost doubling from 11% in 2017. And this share is expected to reach 30% by the end of 2022.

“The main drivers for POE growth will be the strong increase of bifacial glass-glass technology (both p-type and n-type) as well as competitive prices reached by increasing scale in manufacturing” says IHS Markit senior research analyst Karl Melkonyan. “Though EVA will continue to account for most of the market it is not recommended to use for bifacial technology or others such as n-type and thin films.”

The growth of bifacial modules the majority of which use glass front and back raises multiple challenges for encapsulant materials. Despite estimates that they are at least 30% more expensive than EVA module manufacturers are turning to POE-based encapsulants as the most attractive solution. “By its nature EVA has limitations especially when considering 30 or 40 year lifetimes” explains George Touloupas director of technology and quality at CEA. “POE is in principle a better material and it is more stable than EVA. With the scaling up of bifacial modules its share has grown considerably.”

Over time EVA decomposes in field conditions producing acetic acid. In a glass-backsheet stack this acid can permeate through the backsheet and escape the module without causing any harm. For glass-glass modules however acetic acid is trapped and can build up eventually causing corrosion and significant performance loss. This may have motivated some suppliers to investigate POE as an alternative for glass-glass modules. Producers of transparent backsheet materials also cite the ‘breathability’ of their backsheets and the prevention of acetic acid build-up as an advantage for their products over glass-glass in bifacial modules.

The EVA breakdown mechanism however is driven by moisture and glass-glass modules effectively prevent water ingress. “The absence of water combined with EVA stabilizer additives should ensure that glass-glass modules do not suffer from excessive corrosion due to acetic acid formation” explains Touloupas. This has proved sufficient for modules to pass the accelerated testing conducted by manufacturers and in third-party quality assurance. And EVA is still used in glass-glass lamination although often in combination with a POE encapsulant.

Potential-induced degradation

The second challenge for bifacial modules and largest driver for the recent pickup in the use of POE encapsulants relates to the prevention of a new mechanism of potential-induced degradation (PID) affecting the rear side of bifacial modules. A combination of new EVA formulations and frontside cell surface treatments is broadly thought to have “solved” PID issues in monofacial modules. With recent growth in bifacial technology however a new mechanism of PID particularly affecting the rear side of cells has been observed (see pv magazine 02/2021 p.44).

Replacing EVA with a POE-based encapsulant is among the only effective solutions for module manufacturers to secure products against PID risk and related reliability issues. Since it seems the materials in a POE encapsulant are inherently more expensive to produce than EVA and the large modules on the market today require a thicker encapsulant layer as well as having a larger area to cover innovations focused on minimizing the costs are already being seen.

Some module suppliers opt to use the tried and tested EVAs for frontside encapsulation and a single sheet of POE between the cells and the rear glass as a PID prevention strategy. Encapsulant and backsheet manufacturer First Applied Materials – based in Hangzhou China – has patented a coextruded EVA/POE/EVA encapsulant sheet where a thin layer of POE at the center ensures good PID resistance. The lower cost but still reliable EVA makes up the bulk of the encapsulant layer and these coextruded encapsulants increasingly appear on module makers’ roadmaps.

“Coextrusion products not only have the advantages of fast easy processing in lamination with EVA but also retain the strong anti-PID performance of POE” says Kevin Wu First Applied Materials’ overseas marketing director. “The limitation is that the characteristics of both EVA and POE must be understood deeply and it is difficult to control the thickness uniformity of the middle POE layer.”

Processing POE

Aside from the added material cost POEs are also held back from the mainstream by difficulties in their processing. Lower temperature and pressure requirements may be attractive to manufacturers but long cycle times a narrow temperature window and low glass adherence are not. Until these issues are solved manufacturers will likely stick to EVA unless absolutely necessary.

Manufacturing POE encapsulant as a thermoplastic rather than a cross-linked polymer is one way to potentially make the materials easier to process. This is the approach favored by Austrian manufacturer Borealis in its Quentys BPO range of POE-based encapsulants.

“BPO is a tailor-made thermoplastic encapsulant where adhesion functionality is directly incorporated in the polymer chain as opposed to grafted solutions leading to excellent inherent adhesion” said Alper Muraben team leader for solar at Borealis. “In addition the polymer’s high melt temperature and high viscosity eliminates the need for the encapsulant to be cross-linked during module lamination. This significantly simplifies both the resin-to-film extrusion step and module lamination process.”

Muraben further explains that the Quentys encapsulant allows for shorter lamination cycles compared to other POE materials and also processing at lower pressures and temperatures compared to EVA. This in turn reduces stress placed on the cells during lamination. Finally he notes that the high viscosity of the encapsulant minimizes the chance that cells or ribbons can move during the lamination process – relevant for modules utilizing non-soldering interconnection technologies.

First Applied Materials offers both cross-linked and thermoplastic POE products including a range of encapsulants featuring Dow Chemical’s Enlight series of thermoplastic POE products. The company particularly recommends the cross-linked product for modules installed in high-humidity environments and for prolonged PID resistance. For the thermoplastic materials meanwhile “the no cross-linking characteristic can effectively shorten laminating time of PV modules” according to Wu. “And this helps to improve customers’ productivity.”

Italian laminating equipment manufacturer TekniSolar meanwhile has developed tools and processes which it says allow it to work effectively with either encapsulant material as well as others. “The use of one material or the other in our experience depends mostly on the specific module technology” explains TekniSolar CEO Vittore De Leonibus. “Our technology allows any type of panel to be laminated with a very short cycle time thanks to the combination of multi-stage curing a fast vacuum system uniform heat application and a flat press in place of the usual membrane.”

POE prospects

Bifacial is today regarded as a mainstream PV technology and is expected to continue to rapidly grow over the next few years. And this should leave space for POE encapsulants to grow alongside.

Though EVA will likely continue to account for the larger market share in the short to medium term other recent developments in module technology indicate that a slow shift toward POE is underway. Aside from bifacial the gentler processing afforded by POE means it is widely favored for the lamination of heterojunction and TOPCon modules the cells of which are highly sensitive to raised temperatures. Increasing module power ratings as seen with the recent advent of larger wafer modules could also be good news for POE.

“We expect POE to become a more viable option as solar panels increase in power” says De Leonibus. “In other words when the solar panel produces more the cost of producing it will be allowed to exceed ceilings that are set for the most common solar panel types in production up until now.”

With its Quentys Encapsulant Borealis has also been able to demonstrate an increase in module performance compared with modules encapsulated with EVA. In testing conducted by the company at an outdoor site in Abu Dhabi modules encapsulated with Quentys have demonstrated an energy yield more than 2% above reference EVA modules over a 12-month period. Laboratory testing conducted by Fraunhofer ISE has also shown significantly stronger performance from the Quentys-encapsulated moduleswhich were shown to lose 5.5% of their initial power rating after a harsh series of damp heat UV and thermal cycling tests compared to 33.4% for an industry reference EVA. “Another growth path for Quentys is some module makers wanting to replace traditional EVA applications with Quentys thanks to the productivity gains and higher power retention it brings” said Muraben.

Rear-side PID protection has given polyolefins a push into the encapsulant market. And longer lifetime expectations higher power ratings and other developments in module technology mean that manufacturers will have an eye on them. Choice of material is only one piece of the puzzle and quality of the backsheet or glass and of the lamination process itself are equally vital to ensuring that an encapsulant can offer good long-term protection. “The bare truth is that POE is a better material than EVA due to its stability; provided of course that the specific formulations are good and manufacturing is proper” said CEA’s George Touloupas. “POE must reach the same cost and ease of manufacturing of EVA to fully replace it. This is not foreseen to happen soon at least not in the short term.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYW5kdGVjaC5jb20vc2hvdy8xNjU2OC9zbWljLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWEtbmV3LWZhYi1pbi1zaGVuemhlbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXRvLXN0YXJ0LWluLTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SMIC to Build a New 28nm Fab in Shenzhen: Production to Start in 2022,"One of the more interesting facets of the ongoing chip crunch has been just how widely it's impacted the fabs and tech companies. The crunch isn't just happening for high-performance leading-edge nodes as one might expect but tech companies are also jostling for wafers on much older processes as well. So with demand for older and more mature manufacturing technologies is still on the rise SMIC has announced that the Chinese chipmaker intends to build a new 28 nm fab in order to meet the increasing demand for lower-density chips.

The new fab will be located near Shenzhen and will process 300-mm wafers using 28 nm and larger process technologies. SMIC's goal is to eventually achieve production capacity of around 40000 wafer starts per month however the company does not specify when this goal is projected to be attained. Meanwhile SMIC does disclose that it expects to start production at the new fab sometimes in 2022. The company's manufacturing capacities already operate at a 95.5% utilization rate so especially during this chip crunch SMIC is in bad need of additional capacity.

Mature nodes account for the lion's share of SMIC's revenue. Over 95% of SMIC's sales in Q4 2020 were for wafers processed using 28 nm and larger fabrication technologies (see the table below the story). While modern PCs and smartphones rely on primary processors made using leading-edge nodes they also use a wide variety of support chips produced using older processes. Usually such chips (e.g. power ICs display drivers) have a very long lifecycle and are used for dozens of applications. To that end it makes a great financial sense for SMIC to build a fab that will expand its 28 nm 40/45 nm 55/65/ nm and older nodes production capacity.

SMIC said that the estimated new investment for the project will total $2.35 billion. Meanwhile the company's capital expenditures in 2021 will decrease to $4.3 billion down from $5.7 billion in 2020 and $5.9 billion in 2019.

Outfitting this new 28 nm fab will be a bit tricky but overall it shouldn't be too hard given the age of 28 nm technology. Since SMIC is in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List companies from the USA need to apply for an export license which runs the risk of being denied even though it's equipment for an older node. TrendForce reported earlier this month that Applied Materials Lam Research KLA-Tencor and Axcelis had applied for appropriate licenses earlier this year so if the licenses are granted then SMIC should have little trouble equipping its new fab with new tools. Otherwise it would have to seek tools elsewhere perhaps buying them from smaller Chinese chipmakers that ceased to receive aid from the Chinese government last year.

As usual SMIC will build and equip the new fab in partnership with local authorities in this case the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government and Shenzhen Major an investment company controlled by Shenzhen Municipal. The foundry expects to own about 55% of the fab 23% will be owned by Shenzhen Municipal and its investment company whereas the remaining 22% will be owned by third-party investors.

A new material developed by LMU-chemists has now set a speed record for such a change.

On the highway at night. It rains the bright headlights of the car behind you are blinding. How convenient to have an automatically dimming rearview mirror in such a case. Technically this helpful extra is based on electrochromic materials. When a voltage is applied their light absorption and color change. Controlled by a light sensor the rearview mirror can thus filter out strongly dazzling light.

Recently experts discovered that in addition to established inorganic electrochromic materials a new generation of highly ordered lattice structures can also be equipped with this capability: so-called Covalent Organic Frameworks COFs for short. They consist of synthetically produced organic building blocks that in suitable combinations form crystalline and nanoporous networks. Here the color change can be triggered by an applied electrical voltage which causes an oxidation or reduction of the material.

Modular construction principle

The LMU-team led by Thomas Bein (Physical Chemistry LMU Munich speaker of the cluster of excellence e-conversion) has now developed COF structures whose switching speeds and coloration efficiencies are many times higher than those of inorganic compounds. COFs are attractive because their material properties can be adjusted over a wide range by modifying their molecular building blocks. Scientists at LMU Munich and the University of Cambridge took advantage thereof to design COFs that were ideal for their purposes.

“We have made use of the modular construction principle of the COFs and designed the ideal building block for our purposes with a specific thienoisoindigo molecule” says Derya Bessinger first author and PhD student in the group of Thomas Bein. Incorporated into a COF the new component demonstrates how strongly it can improve the COF’s properties. “For example with the new material we cannot only absorb the shorter-wavelength UV light or small parts of the visible spectrum but also achieve photoactivity well into the near-infrared spectral regions” says Bessinger.

At the same time the new COF structures are much more sensitive to electrochemical oxidation. This means that even a low applied voltage is sufficient to trigger a color change of the COFs which is also completely reversible. In addition this happens at very high speed: the response time for a complete and distinct color change by oxidation is around 0.38 seconds while the reduction back to the initial state takes only about 0.2 seconds. This makes the e-conversion team’s electrochromic organic frameworks among the fastest and most efficient in the world.

Very high stability in long-term tests

Two things in particular are responsible for the high speed: The conductive framework structure of the COFs enables fast electron transport in the lattice. And thanks to an optimized pore size the surrounding electrolyte solution can quickly reach every corner. This is essential because the positive charge generated in the oxidized COF structure must quickly be charge-compensated by negative electrolyte ions. Last but not least the product of the Munich scientists who are part of the e-conversion cluster of excellence has a very high stability. Long-term tests showed that the material was able to maintain its performance even after 200 oxidation-reduction cycles.

With these fundamental findings the publication advances the development of a new class of high-performance electrochromic coatings. The obvious demand for this is shown by current applications of such “smart glass” as switchable solar-protection and privacy-shield windows for whole building facades.

Shares have lost about 7.7% in that time frame underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release or is Arista Networks due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

Arista Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates on Higher Revenues



Arista reported solid fourth-quarter 2020 results wherein the top and the bottom lines beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by a healthy momentum in the enterprise vertical and customer additions. Also both revenues and adjusted earnings improved year over year.

Net Income

On a GAAP basis net income in the reported quarter declined to $183 million or $2.31 per share from $260.6 million or $3.25 per share in the prior-year quarter. Despite the top-line improvement GAAP earnings were down due to higher operating expenses in the quarter and income tax benefit in the prior year.



Excluding non-recurring items non-GAAP net income came in at $197.7 million or $2.49 per share compared with $183.4 million or $2.29 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents delivering a positive surprise of 3.8%.



In full-year 2020 Arista recorded GAAP earnings of $634.6 million or $7.99 per share compared with $859.5 million or $10.63 per share in 2019. Non-GAAP earnings in 2020 were $718.4 million or $9.04 per share compared with $786.8 million or $9.73 in 2019.

Revenues

Quarterly total revenues improved 17.4% year over year to $648.5 million and was well ahead of the company’s guidance of $615-$635 million. The uptrend was primarily led by solid customer additions and growth in the enterprise vertical partially offset by shipment constraints resulting from the COVID-19 operating environment. The top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $629 million. Total revenues in 2020 aggregated $2317.5 million compared with $2410.7 million in 2019.



Arista generated 74% of total revenues from the Americas and the remainder from international operations. Almost 36% of the vertical mix was driven by cloud titans 36% from enterprise and financials and 28% from cloud service providers. Product revenues jumped to $518.3 million from $447.5 million year over year while Service revenues grew to $130.2 million from $105 million supported by renewals and subscriptions.

Other Details

Non-GAAP gross profit improved to $421.6 million from $360.2 million for respective margins of 65% and 65.2%. The non-GAAP gross margin was at the high end of the company’s guidance of 63-65% reflecting healthy software and services mix.



Total operating expenses increased to $219.9 million from $180.3 million in the prior-year quarter owing to higher R&D costs high variable compensation and other headcount-related charges partially offset by lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was up to $243.5 million from $205.8 million in the year-ago quarter with corresponding margins of 37.6% and 37.3% respectively.

Cash Flow & Liquidity

In 2020 Arista generated $735.1 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $963 million in the prior year. As of Dec 31 2020 the cloud networking company had $893.2 million in cash and cash equivalents with $227.9 million of non-current deferred tax liabilities compared with respective tallies of $1111.3 million and $254.7 million in the year-ago period.

Q1 Outlook

The company expects to witness continued growth within its enterprise vertical in the forthcoming quarters with customer mix remaining the key driver. For the first quarter of 2021 Arista expects revenues of $630-$650 million. It anticipates a non-GAAP gross margin of 63-65% and a non-GAAP operating margin of around 37%.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

It turns out estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.

VGM Scores

At this time Arista Networks has a nice Growth Score of B though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.

Overall the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably Arista Networks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

How did you get into law?

CR: From a young age the teachers and adults in my life would tease me about becoming a lawyer one day. Though I had never met a lawyer or witnessed any sort of legal proceeding outside of television I started to dream about it. My mother was a single mom and things were not always easy growing up. I came from a community of humble hardworking folks and I vowed that if I ever became a lawyer those were the type of people I would help.

I attended Louisiana State University for business but the goal was always to get into law school. My junior year I was able to borrow money from my grandparents to obtain LSAT study materials and I was fortunate enough to get into LSU Law where I eventually graduated then passed the Bar exam.

What type of law did you practice?

CR: I started out working at a defense firm but I quickly realized that that was not the industry for me. I had become a lawyer to help the people not defend big businesses and insurance companies. I was unfulfilled and unsatisfied. I started picking up extra work on the side until I decided to set out on my own and found Chaz Roberts Law - where I represent real people.

What was it like striking out on your own?

CR: The first few years were difficult. I was operating out of a broom closet taking whatever cases I could. I took cases that no one else wanted. Those early days were tough but incredibly formative in making me the lawyer I am today. I practiced everything from family law to criminal defense even a part time public defender for five years until I found my niche in personal injury law. Though I occasionally take criminal defense cases the majority of my work is focused on helping others who have been hurt or injured due to someone else’s fault.

What differentiates you from others in your industry?

CR: I am an “anti-lawyer lawyer.” I don’t bring the traditional stuffy lawyer style to my client interactions. I’m young active and up to date on all the latest technology. When I was in law school I thought my humble beginnings were a curse but later I realized that this was actually a huge advantage to me. I was once the underdog too and this allows me to bring a sense of empathy and relatability to my clients that they can’t find anywhere else.

Story continues

I also am a huge advocate for technology in the legal industry. I’ve been using technology in my practice for years so when COVID hit my team already had the infrastructure in place to adapt quickly. This came as a huge benefit to us as we were still able to serve clients just as well as we had before the restrictions.

How do you balance being a busy lawyer husband father and community member?

CR: It all comes down to my priorities. From the start I have prioritized my family my health and my clients. I put my family first always striving to be present and engaged with my wife and children. A lot of people envision lawyers as partaking in too many happy hours and lavish lunch meetings - but that is not me. I work out 5-7 days a week and I am training for a marathon. Finally I am a product of the community I was raised in so I am dedicated to giving back to my community. I coach local sports teams donate time and money to local programs and I serve on the Louisiana Public Defender Board which oversees public defense in Louisiana. I support the community both physically and financially wherever possible. My commitment to my health family and the community resonates with my clients they know when they sit across from me that they are getting a real person with real values.

I approach each day as a new opportunity to better serve my clients to love my family and to support my community.",,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Sportcom

Hosking a d’abord obtenu le troisième meilleur résultat de la première manche grâce à ses 7200 points. Elle a toutefois été devancée au tour suivant et a glissé en cinquième place. À sa dernière présence sur la piste la Québécoise a manqué de rotation à son dernier saut ce qui a provoqué son unique chute de la journée et qui l’a aussi empêchée d’améliorer son pointage.

« Je suis extrêmement contente de ma performance » a néanmoins déclaré Elizabeth Hosking à Sportcom. Même si elle a eu à lutter la fatigue en cette fin de saison cela n’a pas influencé sa préparation en vue de la finale. « C’est sûr que je voulais avoir le plus de repos possible pour m’assurer d’être prête mais je savais ce que j’avais à faire. J’avais un peu de fatigue accumulée mais c’était le cas pour tout le monde. »

La championne du monde Chloé Kim a une fois de plus eu le dernier mot dimanche avec une note de 9050 points. L’Espagnole Queralt Castellet (8600 points) a tout tenté pour la déloger mais a chuté à son ultime tentative assurant du même coup la victoire à l’Américaine. La Japonaise Sena Tomita a complété le podium avec 8250 points.

C’est la deuxième fois de sa carrière qu’Elizabeth Hosking se hisse parmi le top-5 d’une Coupe du monde de demi-lune. Elle avait également fini cinquième en 2019 à la Coupe du monde de Mammoth Mountain.

Celle qui a pris le septième rang de la finale des Championnats du monde la fin de semaine dernière reviendra maintenant à la maison pour une première fois depuis le 3 janvier dernier alors qu’elle quittait pour entamer la saison en Suisse. Elle était ensuite restée en Europe pour s’entraîner en vue des deux compétitions qui ont été présentées à Aspen.

« Ça fait 76 jours que je suis partie de la maison. Ça fait un petit bout que je suis loin ! » a-t-elle souligné. « Je reviens extrêmement fière de moi et ç’a été ma meilleure saison. J’ai gagné une Coupe européenne j’ai terminé septième aux Championnats du monde et cinquième à une Coupe du monde. Ça me motive beaucoup et je veux me rendre sur le podium. »",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGVwZWNoZS5mci8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL3RlbXBzLWRlY2hhbmdlcy1zdXItbGEtdmllLWFmZmVjdGl2ZS1kZXMtZW5mYW50cy05NDM5MDc5LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carmaux.

An influential group of medical experts the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended last week that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue to get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74 the task force said.

This is a marked difference from the task force’s previous guidance which was to start biennial mammograms by age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health care provider but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50.

I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer?

To help us with these questions I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

People should now starting getting mammograms at age 40 according to new recommendations. yacobchuk/iStockphoto/Getty Images

CNN: How common is breast cancer?

Dr. Leana Wen: In the United States breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About 42000 women die every year from this cancer.

It’s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening by definition is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage before it has spread when there is the best chance for successful treatment.

CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes?

Wen: In recent years there has been a disturbing trend of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer.

In fact breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 20 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women.

This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100000 person-years compared to 15 per 100000 person-years among White women according to a 2023 JAMA Network Open study.

According to a study in the journal Lancet Oncology the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier at age 40.

The US Preventive Task Force’s change now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for instance recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The American Cancer Society gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.)

CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?

Wen: I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40.

This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations.

The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings.

CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives?

Wen: The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers.

Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer.

CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram?

Wen: A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don’t need to remove your underwear pants or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts.

The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram.

CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed?

Wen: Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound breast MRI or both.

I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses.

The American College of Radiology for example recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur.

CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer?

Wen: The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This once again is an issue to be discussed with one’s individual provider who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient’s wishes.

CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk?

Wen: Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that exercise can lower cancer risk in general as well as eating more whole foods and less ultraprocessed substances.

Women should also seek care if they develop any concerning symptoms such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit redness or flaky skin on the breast nipple discharge other than breast milk or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.

The Met Gala Vogue's annual celebration of fearless fashion was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on Monday night. It's a big night for fashion and celebrities which include a number of athletes. Tom Brady Steph Curry Russell Westbrook Simone Biles Carmelo Anthony and other major sports stars have been invited in the past.

The theme for 2024 was ""Garden of Time"" to celebrate the opening of the ""Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion"" exhibit at the Met. Let's see how this year's chosen athlete-stars (the gala is by invitation only) interpreted that theme.

It seems fitting to start with Angel Reese the college basketball star who was drafted by the Chicago Sky in late April and is currently one of the biggest stars on the planet. She celebrated her 22nd birthday on Monday by making her Met Gala debut in a stunning low-cut seafoam green gown adorned with an ostrich feather tutu and embroidered tulle.

The most talked-about look of the night came from Ben Simmons. He's still playing for the Brooklyn Nets (though you're forgiven if you hadn't noticed) but since they're not in the playoffs he was free to attend. He came solo wearing a black suit and black coat with panels of plaid fabric at the top and a vine down the side. The outfit wasn't bad but his literal interpretation of the ""Garden of Time"" theme involved a clock briefcase.

Near Brookville in southeastern Indiana’s Franklin County. Emergency Management Agency officials here confirm this was “a small tornado” according to the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office.

Reily Township in Butler County

Roofs were ripped off homes and barns in Franklin County he confirmed.

The weather service plans to send a team out to survey as many tornado-suspected areas as possible on Wednesday he said.

However they will be somewhat limited because more severe weather is expected Wednesday night.

Damage from a possible tornado was also reported in the Clarksville area of Clinton County along U.S. 22 and State Route 350 according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Wilmington post.

NWS said they could not confirm that because they’ve had no overnight reports of damage in that county.

Power outages were approaching 1000 at midnight but now are down to 635 Duke Energy customers mostly in Warren County according to the utility’s website.

A tree fell into two homes on Hayden Drive in Greenhills according to the NWS and Greenhills police.

It happened about 10:30 p.m. in the 40 block of Hayden Drive police say.

It fell into one house first damaging it to the point water came in and then fell onto the second house.

Are We Not Aroused?,"Watching the red carpet at Monday night’s Met Gala I couldn’t help but recall a prediction I’d heard from Emily Kirkpatrick who writes the Substack newsletter “I <3 Mess.” She’d told me recently that before the end of 2024 it’s possible that “someone is going to show up fully nude on a red carpet.”

That didn’t happen at this year’s gala but it got very close as Doja Cat — who appeared earlier this year at the Grammy Awards in what was called “the most naked dress ever” — presented at the Met Gala in a long clinging soaking wet transparent and entirely revealing white T-shirt by the label Vetements.

Near-nudity is everywhere at least on celebrities and the celebrity adjacent. Bianca Censori Kanye West’s 29 year-old partner wandered around Paris wearing a cropped jacket with sheer pantyhose and seemingly nothing on underneath her modesty preserved only by the stockings’ single center seam. Julia Fox attended a fashion launch with three silver medallions covering her private parts under a long — and frequently parted — trench coat.

This nearly nude look is not as one might imagine evidence of an increasingly oversexed culture but rather of a culture that’s increasingly over sex."

But this one is a little… different.

This bizarrely-modified Camry was recently shared on Reddit after being spotted on a motorway in Texas and while the stock Camry TRD has been tastefully altered with aerodynamic and powertrain modifications the same cannot be said about this one. In fact it seems as though the owner has spent a little too long in AutoZone.

Kicking things off are a pair of vortex generators on the roof while a look at the trunklid reveals mounting points for a rear wing even though there actually isn’t a rear wing in sight. Elsewhere the family sedan is rocking white racing stripes over the rear and as the aforementioned ‘Sport’ ‘Turbo’ and ‘SE’ badges informing fellow motorists of just how serious it is.

Arguably the most bizarre change are the tailpipes. On the right we can see a blue-tipped exhaust sitting alongside a smaller exhaust while on the left there is another large tailpipe also sitting next to a smaller exhaust. We suspect just one or two of these are actually functional.

Other weird changes made to the car include the fitment of various pieces of chrome trim flared wheel arches louvers on the side windows and stickers across the arches and rear-quarter panels. The front end of the Camry also looks to have been altered but we don’t have any photos of it.",,,,,,

Ringwald has been a working actress ever since but where is the rest of the cast today?

Back in the spring of 1984 Samantha Baker’s parents forgot her 16th birthday in the classic film Sixteen Candles. Written and directed by John Hughes Sixteen Candles starred Molly Ringwald in her first major film role.

The movie also featured the ultimate high school crush — Jake Ryan played by Michael Schoeffling. Nearly four decades after the film’s premiere where is the cast today?

‘Sixteen Candles’ launched Molly Ringwald’s career

The 1980s belonged to Molly Ringwald. Sixteen Candles launched her career and put her on the path to becoming an 80s legend. And she has Hughes to thank. When Hughes wrote the role of Sam he had Ringwald in mind.

She and Hughes teamed up again for The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. Ringwald continued her film career in the 90s with films like For Keeps and The Pick-up Artist. In the 2000s and beyond Ringwald has transitioned to TV. From 2008 to 2013 she starred in The Secret Life of the American Teenager on ABC Family. Most recently Ringwald has played Mary Andrews on The CW’s Riverdale.

In 2007 Ringwald married writer Panio Gianopoulos. They share three kids: daughter Mathilda Ereni and twins Adele Gerogiana and Roman Stylianos.

Where is Jake Ryan?

Michael Schoeffling became a Hollywood heartthrob overnight when he starred as Jake Ryan in Sixteen Candles. Of course this is the film that Schoeffling is known for. But he actually starred in ten films during his career. His final acting credit was in the 1991 cult classic Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken.

After that film Schoeffling retired from acting and moved to Pennsylvania with his wife Valerie. They are the parents of two children Scarlet and Zen. Schoeffling owns a woodworking shop and furniture store but has remained out of the spotlight for three decades. No photos of Schoeffling have surfaced in three decades. But he did start trending on Twitter in 2020 when he turned 60 years old.

‘Sixteen Candles’ also made Anthony Michael Hall a star

Fans will remember that Anthony Michael Hall played “Farmer Ted” in Sixteen Candles. He was the geek with braces who’s in love with Sam. The 1980s were just as kind to Hall as they were to Ringwald. He collaborated with Huges again in The Breakfast Club and Weird Science.

Hall has starred in numerous other films and also had a short run on Saturday Night Live. Other TV roles have included The Dead Zone and Riverdale. He currently has a recurring role on ABC’s The Goldbergs.

Haviland Morris retired from acting in 2014

Fans will remember the most popular girl at school was Caroline Mulford played by Haviland Morris. She started the film as Jake’s girlfriend but after they broke up she hooked up with Ted. After her role in Sixteen Candles Mulford’s film credits included Who’s That Girl and Home Alone 3.

Mulford has also appeared on TV in Law & Order The Good Wife One Tree Hill and Sex and the City. In 2014 she retired from acting and now works in New York real estate with her husband Robert Score.

What happened to the Bakers from ‘Sixteen Candles’?

Paul Dooley played Sam’s kindhearted dad Jim Baker. His career has spanned decades. His credits include The Golden Girls ALF The Wonder years ER Curb Your Enthusiasm Grey’s Anatomy and Cars.

Carlin Glynn played Sam’s mom Brenda Baker. She appeared in numerous films before she retired in 2006. Blanche Baker played the role of Sam’s older sister Ginny. After Sixteen Candles Baker continued her acting career until the mid-90s. She transitioned to a career in bronze sculpture but still appears in indy films from time to time.

As for the Baker’s Chinese foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong actor Gedde Wantanabe has gone on to appear in dozens of movies and TV shows. He was on ER for seven seasons. He also voiced the character Ling in Disney’s Mulan.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The conventional response is that weekly magazines due to the way they pursue stories for the sake of sensationalism do not always follow journalistic “decorum” the way daily newspapers and TV stations do. The first scoop came about after Shukan Bunshun stalked Seigo Suga the eldest son of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and caught him entertaining ministry officials as a representative of Tohokushinsha Film Corp. So while the tabloid press sometimes resorts to dodgy practices such practices offer them more opportunities to find these kinds of stories.

But once these stories break major media usually picks them up and elaborates. During a discussion on the web program Videonews.com veteran freelance journalist Tetsuo Jimbo mentioned that the missing element in the story was why Seigo Suga was entertaining ministry officials. Given Tohokushinsha's satellite broadcast business it doesn't sound like a mystery since the ministry oversees the nation's airwaves but as Jimbo's interlocutor sociologist Shinji Miyadai said nobody even knows why Seigo Suga was working for Tohokushinsha in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sounds like an anomaly doesn’t it? A “poor man’s banker” but that’s what thousands of disenfranchised immigrants called the gracious Amadeo Pietro Giannini.

His contemporaries referred to him as “America’s Banker.”

The son of Italian immigrants Virginia and Luigi Amadeo was born on a farm in San Jose California on May 6 1870.

At 7 he was traumatized by the murder of his father and at 14 he went to work in his stepfather’s produce business. The hardworking Giannini — who earned a partnership in the business — found success sold the company to his employees and “retired” at the young age of 31.

Giannini’s reputation as an astute and talented businessman quickly spread and he was enticed to join the Board of Directors of the Columbus Savings Loan Society a small bank in San Francisco’s Little Italy.

Mr. Giannini thrilled with the offer saw an opportunity to provide banking services to immigrants and the underprivileged. But he was too often at odds with the policies of the Board which had little interest in servicing the hardworking immigrant class so he resigned.

In 1904 he opened his own Bank of Italy directly across the street from his former employer the Columbus S&L.

Giannini intended to provide banking for “the little fellow”: the farmers merchants and laborers — many of whom were immigrants.

He visited homes of the less fortunate and convinced them it was safe to move their small savings from their mattresses to his bank.

Giannini’s banking operations took off but unfortunately in 1906 disaster struck San Francisco. The infamous earthquake disaster destroyed many of the banks including the Bank of Italy.

But Giannini was determined to continue banking especially at a time when his customers would need it most.

Borrowing a produce wagon Giannini raced to North Beach — battling the fires and rubble — and brought the bank’s valuables and records back to his home.

He set up shop in front of his house using a plank stretched across a couple of beer barrels and amid all the rubble he continued to offer loans to customers.

When some of his more destitute customers apologized for having no security as collateral he replied: “Your face is sufficient security for me!”

Giannini was a gracious practitioner but he was also a genius who revolutionized banking in the United States.

In 1909 he pioneered the concept of “branch banking” after he noticed customers traveling long distances to do business. His first of hundreds of branches was opened in San Jose. When most banks closed at 3 p.m. Giannini kept his banks open until 9 or 10 at night for workers.

In 1928 Giannini negotiated a takeover of the Bank of America and merged it with the Bank of Italy. He became Chairman of the Board and by 1945 the Bank of America was the largest bank in the United States.

He supported large and small businesses with significant financial assistance. He helped finance the construction of the Golden Gate bridge and he provided financial backing to the California wine and movie industries.

Giannini was a philanthropist of the most significant magnitude; a man of great compassion and generosity.

He gave much of his money to charitable foundations. When he died his estate was valued at a rather modest $500000. His philosophy was “personal wealth was not a priority.”

Amadeo Pietro Giannini died on June 3 1949 at the age of 79. He was a giant in the banking industry; a man of great vision and business acumen.

Proud of his Italian heritage Giannini gave extensively to Italian-American causes and to all Americans.

Bitcoin mining can help the development of renewable energy technologies by allowing a quicker return on green investments according to the head of one of North America's biggest crypto miners.

Mike Colyer chief executive of Foundry a sister company of major bitcoin player Grayscale told Insider he thinks bitcoin can be ""a bridge between our current energy production and this future world of renewable energy production.""

His argument is the boom in green-energy creation has led to oversupply in many areas which can be difficult to manage and costly for renewables firms.

Colyer said locating bitcoin mines near renewable energy projects can help deal with this oversupply in turn helping the development of green technology.

""It allows for a faster payback on those solar projects or wind projects which means more of them can be built faster in regions where before it was not attractive because they would produce too much energy for the grid in that area"" he said.

Other miners have echoed this argument although the secretive nature of the industry means it is difficult to gauge the rate of change.

And many remain unconvinced. As the bitcoin price has soared this year arguments over its intense energy use have heated up with climate concerns making some investors wary of the world's biggest cryptocurrency.

Bank of America analysts on Wednesday said in a note that bitcoin is ""not good news for the environment"" estimating that it uses almost the same amount of electricity as the Netherlands.

""Bitcoin's estimated energy consumption has grown over 200% in the past two years creating large environmental risks"" the analysts including commodities strategist Francisco Blanch wrote. They noted that most mining is done in China where coal is dominant.

Bitcoin is ""mined"" when computers are hooked up to the cryptocurrency's network to verify transactions. As a reward for this work which involves solving puzzles miners can sometimes receive small amounts of bitcoin.

Huge amounts of computing power are now dedicated to mining bitcoin with more drawn in as the price skyrockets.

Yet Colyer said bitcoin mining is increasingly using renewable energy as green power becomes cheaper. His mining company Foundry is owned by Grayscale-owner Digital Currency Group and also provides equipment financing and advice.

""The bitcoin algorithm is relentless in its drive for efficiency and cost reduction"" he said. ""It's built in there's no stopping it. Every miner in the world is constantly looking for ways to take cost out of the production of bitcoin. And the most cost-effective energy [in North America] is renewable energy.""

A report from Cambridge University in September last year estimated 39% of proof-of-work mining is powered by renewable energy primarily hydroelectric.

Michel Rauchs an affiliate of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance told Insider it is difficult to come up with an accurate assessment of how ""green"" bitcoin is.

He said within China the renewable share of mining changes throughout the year due to ""seasonal migration patterns"" that see miners move towards hydroelectric plants during the wet season. ""So it really depends at what point of time... you're looking at this"" he said.

The Bank of America analysts argued bitcoin's energy consumption is only going to worsen due to the system's structure which makes mining more difficult over time.

""The rising complexity of the system creates ultimately a vicious environmental cycle of rising prices rising hashpower rising energy consumption and ultimately rising CO2 emissions"" they wrote.

Colyer said Foundry is working on a number of ways to make mining greener. ""We're focused on the newer technology like immersion mining where the machines are actually put in a coolant and they don't use air cooling... We work with the flare gas guys that are chasing the flare gas emissions.""

However many investors are worried about how long it might take to make bitcoin green.

Bank of America said: ""As renewable energy production increases over the next 20 years quantum computers reduce energy usage and new more efficient crypto assets continue to emerge the cryptocurrency space could eventually find ways to reduce its carbon footprint.

""But a rapid surge in adoption of bitcoin presents a major risk and thus drives bitcoin's low environmental score.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5reGFuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLzY1LXllYXItb2xkLXdvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLWRpc3B1dGluZy1tYXNrLXBvbGljeS1hdC1vZmZpY2Utc3VwcGx5LXN0b3JlLWdhbHZlc3Rvbi1iYW5rL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5reGFuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLzY1LXllYXItb2xkLXdvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLWRpc3B1dGluZy1tYXNrLXBvbGljeS1hdC1vZmZpY2Utc3VwcGx5LXN0b3JlLWdhbHZlc3Rvbi1iYW5rL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,65-year-old woman arrested after disputing mask policy at office supply store Galveston bank,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.kxan.com/news/coronavirus/65-year-old-woman-arrested-after-disputing-mask-policy-at-office-supply-store-galveston-bank/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5reGFuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLzY1LXllYXItb2xkLXdvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLWRpc3B1dGluZy1tYXNrLXBvbGljeS1hdC1vZmZpY2Utc3VwcGx5LXN0b3JlLWdhbHZlc3Rvbi1iYW5rL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5reGFuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLzY1LXllYXItb2xkLXdvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLWRpc3B1dGluZy1tYXNrLXBvbGljeS1hdC1vZmZpY2Utc3VwcGx5LXN0b3JlLWdhbHZlc3Rvbi1iYW5rL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

At 6 months the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was 61% for patients randomized to a levonorgestrel-containing IUD alone 67% for those also encouraged to participate in a weight-loss intervention and 57% for those who received metformin in addition to the IUD reported Andreas Obermair MD of the University of Queensland in Brisbane Australia.

The only factor that significantly predicted response was diagnosis with the pCR rate reaching 82% across study arms for women with endometrial hyperplasia with atypia a precancerous lesions compared to 43% for those with stage I endometrioid adenocarcinoma (P<0.001) according to findings presented at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) virtual meeting.

Obermair concluded that the treatment was safe and effective with high compliance but that long-term follow-up is necessary.

""Standard treatment of endometrial cancer is total hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without surgical staging"" explained Obermair. ""However for two groups of patients this is challenging -- for young women who wish to preserve fertility and also for elderly and frail women with multiple medical comorbidities who are at risk of prolonged hospital stay higher risk for procedure-related adverse events and high cost.""

Medical societies clinicians and patient groups have called for non-surgical options for these patients he said and while levonorgestrel IUDs have been used in the past in this setting ""robust evidence"" was lacking.

The open-label three-arm phase II trial randomized patients in a 3:3:5 ratio to the IUD (52 mg levonorgestrel) plus observation the IUD plus a weight-loss intervention or the IUD plus metformin (250 mg twice daily). The weight-loss intervention consisted of a 6-month subscription to Weight Watchers with patients encouraged to lose 7% of total body weight within 6 months. At month 3 patients underwent endometrial assessment to check for disease progression.

Obermair explained that metformin a common diabetes drug has been shown to have anti-proliferative effects in endometrial cancer while weight loss can reduce the risk of the disease and is associated with improved overall survival in patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer.

""One of the things that most interested me in this study is the remarkable weight loss that you saw across these various arms"" said SGO discussant Angeles Alvarez Secord MD of Duke Cancer Center in Durham North Carolina. ""In my clinical experience and the research that we have conducted it is very difficult for endometrial cancer patients to lose weight even when you do perform counseling and most often these women continue to gain weight.""

In the weight-loss arm 25% of patients shed the target goal of at least 7% of their initial body weight by the 6-month timepoint as compared to 19% in the observation arm and 16% in the metformin group.

""While the [pCR] results in the women with atypical endometrial hyperplasia were very reassuring the findings in endometrial cancer were lower than what I expected"" added Alvarez Secord.

She asked Obermair if he would treat a patient with atypical endometrial hyperplasia using such an approach in the clinic come Monday.

""When we have very obese frail and medically compromised women with a very high risk of a conversion from a minimally invasive to open [surgery] we should really consider levonorgestrel IUD as an alternative because the response rate is extremely high"" he said.

Study Details

Patients were eligible if they had stage I endometrioid adenocarcinoma (International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians grade 1 MRI showing depth of invasion below 50%) or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia BMI greater than 30 and CA-125 levels lower than 30 U/mL. Those with grade 2/3 disease or high-risk cell types were excluded as were patients who received progestins as recently as 12 weeks prior to study entry or had received pelvic radiotherapy.

Overall 58% of the study patients had endometrioid cancer and 42% had endometrioid hyperplasia. The median age was 53 average BMI was 47.7 and 43% were premenopausal. A little more than a fourth of patients had a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 0 and a little more than a fourth were already on metformin at study entry -- these patients were randomized between the weight loss and observation arms. The pCR rate among women on metformin randomized to the weight loss arm was 48%.

Stratification factors included diagnosis (endometrioid adenocarcinoma or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia) BMI menopausal status and tumor location. For pragmatic reasons women with a contraindication to metformin were randomized into either the weight loss or observation arms and women ineligible for the weight-loss arm were randomized to either the observation or metformin arms.

In terms of compliance three of 165 patients expelled the IUD; eight of 58 assigned to Weight Watchers never registered; and by the 6-month timepoint 23 of 39 patients who attended the program at all were still participating. Nearly all patients (91.4%) started metformin in that arm with 78.9% completing metformin at the 6-month assessment.

Baxter pauses then slowly reaches out his hand and rests it on the bear's paw touching the very last animal he stuffed before wrapping up a lifelong taxidermy career. His shop Telesky Taxidermist Ltd. stopped taking work last July and will soon close its doors for good.

It was a passion Baxter 72 said he picked up when he was just 17 when he joined his brother working at Hawkins Taxidermists Ltd. on Main Street.

""I was working with nature and I loved it. And that's the big thing. And you had to be obsessed with this job to stick with it"" he said.

""It's just not what a lot of people think. We're not a bunch of savage killers. We don't relish in seeing [animals] dead all the time … [We] like putting that life back into it.""

His Arlington Street shop was founded by Ron Telesky more than 50 years ago. When Telesky died Baxter's brother Jim Baxter bought it from Telesky's wife.

In 2012 Baxter bought the shop from his brother.

""He decided that he wanted out so that's when I came back to Winnipeg … I was living in Calgary for a while came back to Winnipeg and came back working here and then eventually bought the business from him once I [got] a little more acclimated to what went on in here because every place is different every place is run differently.""

Over the years he says the business hasn't changed much.

When former employees would come by to visit many described the experience as being ""like walking into a time capsule"" Baxter said.

WATCH | David Baxter on shutting down his taxidermy shop:

'End of an era': Taxidermist calling it quits Duration 2:37 David Baxter the owner of Telesky Taxidermy on Arlington Street reflects on a life spent working with nature and looks forward to retirement.

While interest in taxidermy has waned over the years border shutdowns brought on during the COVID-19 pandemic made it nearly impossible for taxidermists to do business.

""When they closed the Canadian border there was nothing"" he said. ""There was no work. Canadians still get some taxidermy work done but nothing like what was coming from the other countries.""

At one point Baxter says he remembers Hawkins getting about 2500 fish 150 deer heads 30 moose heads and tons more elk and caribou a year.

Ron Telesky started Telesky Taxidermist Ltd. more than 50 years ago in Winnipeg. When he died David Baxter's brother Jim Baxter bought the shop from Telesky's wife. In 2012 Jim sold the business to his brother. (Submitted by David Baxter)

""It was unbelievable"" he said. ""And it was constant. Constantly three four people just working on fish two or three people working on deer heads and game heads and stuff like that.""

Other things though haven't changed much.

""There's still the skinning. There's still the fleshing. There's still the dirty work"" he said. ""There's still the blood and there's still all the rest of it to go with it.""

Now that his lifelong passion is wrapping up Baxter says he's looking forward to retiring and getting to travel one day.

But the business shutting down is still hard to take — and when the building is torn down as Baxter suspects it will it will be even more difficult.

""It's the end of an era"" he said. ""There won't be anything. There won't be any memory of it after and it's sad to see it go.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJuei5jby5uei9uYXRpb25hbC9wcm9ncmFtbWVzL3NhdHVyZGF5L2F1ZGlvLzIwMTg3ODgzMzEva2F5LWJheHRlci1hdXR1bW4tZ2FyZGVuaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kay Baxter: Autumn gardening,"Autumn is one of the best times to improve soil health and plant growth gardening and permaculture expert Kay Baxter says.

The most obvious resource at this time of year is falling leaves she told Saturday Morning.

“Minerals are contained in leaves and in the autumn they fall to the ground so instead of vacuuming them up and them ending up in the ditches and drains and the waterways hold them” Baxter says.

Leaves contain valuable nutrients she says.

“As home gardeners we can collect leaves leaves that go colourful contain high levels of potash which is really valuable for fruiting trees and leaves that stay brown have high levels of calcium.

“So collect them and put them in a big pile in your back yard and they turn to leaf mould which is really amazing for the garden and for the orchard and really high in minerals so we are holding the minerals in our own back yard.”

Two major minerals that tend to be unavailable in most gardens are calcium and phosphate she says.

She tends to use this time of year to sow cover crops that will unlock these minerals.

“Oats and lupins are my two favourite winter crops so in spring I’ve got a whole lot of material for making compost which is going to be raising the calcium level and raising the phosphate level.”

She says healthy soil makes pests and diseases in the garden a “non-issue.”

“If we focus on looking after the health of the soil building the humus levels building the carbon levels building the mineral levels and the fungi and microbe levels then the pests become a non-issue – assuming we’ve also got enough water because water stress can bring them as well.”

JACKSONVILLE Fla — One of Jacksonville's Best Buy stores has fallen victim to a round of closures the retailer executed in the last few weeks. A crew from New York was in the now empty store at 9355 Atlantic Blvd. on Sunday selling the remaining fixtures.

A sign was posted in the entrance stating in part ""This Best Buy is closed .... permanently ...""

According to BusinessInsider.com the retailer plans to close two stores in the Richmond Va. area and one store in Syracuse N.Y. Carbondale Ill. and Brockton Ma.

The electronics retailer has operated fewer stores every year since 2012 according to Business Insider. Best Buy's website states it has 956 stores. That's down from 977 stores in 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY29ycG9yYXRlLmJlc3RidXkuY29tL2hvdy13ZXJlLWNyZWF0aW5nLWEtbW9yZS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1wbGFuZXQtdG9nZXRoZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How We're Creating a More Sustainable Planet Together,"For decades we’ve strived to create a more sustainable world for the communities we serve because our customers and employees expect it and the planet demands it.

To do our part we’ve set two ambitious environmental goals:

Reduce carbon emissions in our operations by 75% by 2030 (over 2009 baseline) and become carbon neutral by 2040.

Reduce carbon emissions for our customers by 20% by 2030 (over 2017 baseline) helping them save $5 billion on utility costs over the life of the ENERGY STAR products they buy.

We’ve made significant progress in our operations and in helping customers reduce their emissions and we’re committed to doing more.

“Sustainability is at the core of what we do at Best Buy” said Tim Dunn Best Buy’s head of environmental sustainability. “This is a critical time for climate action and we are committed to making great strides in reducing our carbon footprint and helping our customers do the same.”

Here are a few examples of ways we’re working toward our goals.

The Climate Pledge accelerates our carbon reduction efforts

In 2020 we signed The Climate Pledge a commitment to be carbon neutral across our business by 2040 — a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050 and years ahead of the United Nations’ Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

To achieve the goals outlined in the pledge we will continue to launch and manage sustainability programs that touch every facet of our business. Since 2009 we have been working to reduce our carbon emissions and have decreased our environmental impact by 55% through a variety of initiatives including the introduction of a Geekmobile fleet comprised of hybrid vehicles and helping our customers recycle more than 2 billion pounds of electronics and appliances.

Helping customers live more sustainably

In 2019 we set our first goal to help our customers save energy through products sold at Best Buy. Our commitment to helping customers live more sustainably has lead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to name us an ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year for seven years in a row.

Additionally we launched a sustainable product category with products focused on helping customers reduce their carbon footprint. Our environmental work has landed us at No. 1 on Barron’s prestigious list of 100 Most Sustainable Companies for the second time. We’ve also been recognized on the CDP Climate A List where we ranked in the top tier of companies fighting climate change.

An investment in solar energy

With a goal to be carbon neutral by 2040 we made our biggest commitments yet to renewable energy in 2020.

First we unveiled the Best Buy Solar Field in Martin South Carolina. It will produce 174000 megawatt hours of clean electricity annually for the local power grid – the equivalent of powering 260 Best Buy stores for an entire year.

We also invested in the Little Bear Solar Project in Fresno California which will produce 480000 megawatt hours of electricity annually enough to power 715 Best Buy stores annually with clean energy.

The bees of Best Buy

Bees and other pollinators are crucial to our food system and are responsible for pollinating more than one-third of the world’s crops. That’s why we’ve partnered with groups in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to sponsor two beehives each buzzing with about 70000 honeybees.

The University of Minnesota Bee Squad manages our hives year-round. The bees and their wooden hives are located at Minnesota Independence College and Community (MICC) across the street from our corporate campus in Richfield Minnesota.

It is part of our mission to positively impact the world and build a more sustainable corporate campus. Here’s all the buzz about the bees.

Introducing our eco home consultations

Technology has become an essential part of our everyday lives at home especially with the ongoing pandemic changing how we work and learn. This month we’re excited to introduce a new offering: eco home consultations.

Our Home Experts are ready to help customers find the right products for their space sustainable lifestyle and budget. From how to conserve energy to cutting down your water usage or reducing your food waste our experts can help find ways to reduce a household’s carbon footprint while saving customers energy and money.

Loving family man & friend was born in Cambridge MN on January 30 1980 and passed from this world on February 7 2021. Ryan's life touched many and brought much goodness into the world - to his wife Jennie and children Norah and Everett his St. Louis Park community and neighbors his team members at Best Buy and through his volunteer work at Courage Kenny. Ryan radiated love for his family. He revealed to his children the beauty of the world around them. On trips to the North Shore they spent hours looking for agates and learning how to skip rocks on the surface of the lake. Ryan built sandcastles with Norah and Everett on the beaches of Anna Maria Island took them fishing on Basswood Lake and worked with them on the family's farm in Frazee. He gave Everett and Norah an example of a man who was patient loving and kind. His cherished Jennie who he knew since 6th grade was the spiritual and temporal love of his life. The Three Flames of Love-intimacy commitment and passion-guided their marriage. Music was his other love. Growing up in Cambridge Ryan would fall asleep listening to Bach on the radio. He was a fan of Metallica. He loved Neil Young and Leadbelly. While driving to work he would listen to Paul Butterfield steering with one hand and playing along on the blues harp with the other. Performing on stage with his band Grateful Red Ryan channeled his energy and joy through harmonica trombone and vocals to enthusiastic audiences. He also loved more intimate settings playing guitar and singing with a small group of friends. Music brought him a deep spiritual connection with others. Ryan was a voracious learner always striving to become better at the things he loved-from teaching himself to play guitar to home construction projects like a meticulously crafted playhouse to cooking and coffee brewing to fitness and weightlifting. Trained as an engineer and with the heart of an artist Ryan put into practice the ideas of an author whose books meant so much to him the physicist Carlo Rovelli: ""The way to think about the world is that of change not of permanence. Not of being but of becoming. "" Ryan made his community of St. Louis Park healthier and safer. He helped keep freight trains from being re-routed through the city advocated for improvements to a faulty water treatment plant and founded with Jennie an annual family-friendly 5K fun run that emphasizes fitness inclusion and community. At Best Buy where he established himself as a leader he was admired by the teammates with whom he felt privileged to work. The people who surrounded him every day and the drive and creativity they exchanged with each other brought him fulfillment and a sense of daily accomplishment. And at Courage Kenny where he taught adaptive snowboarding his patience kindness and care were received with gratitude by both students and other instructors. Ryan will be remembered as a man who strived to express himself as fully and authentically as possible who craved connection with others and lifted others up who leaned into life and its beauty and who saw and loved people for who they truly are. Ryan is preceded in death by his mother Cindy. He is survived by wife Jennie Edstrom and his children Everett and Norah; father Mike (Susan Wong); brothers Garret Edstrom (Danielle) and Justin Llanas (Jim); and many other beloved relatives and friends. Celebration of life will be held at a later date.

COMP based its recommendation on data showing that the first three patients with sickle cell disease ended up “without recurrence of previous SCD symptoms” following treatment with BIVV003 in the Phase I/II PRECIZN-1 trial (NCT03653247).

“Increases in expression of HbF [fetal hemoglobin] have also been reported in accordance with the assumed mechanism of action” the committee added.

The three patients had 52 weeks 13 weeks and 29 days of follow-up respectively following treatment with BIVV003.

“OH. MY. GREGOR. (and Rosalind)” exclaimed Fyodor Urnov PhD director for technology and translation at the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California (UC) Berkeley who was not connected with the study in a tweet on Friday that referred to genetics pioneers Gregor Mendel and Rosalind Franklin.

Investors signaled their enthusiasm for Sangamo’s news by sending its shares up 11.55% on Friday to $13.23 from $11.86 a closing price unchanged from Wednesday.

“Seems promising”

“Though relatively early follow-up the benefit observed seems promising” Maury Raycroft PhD equity analyst at Jefferies and two colleagues observed Friday in a research note.

Sangamo and Sanofi are not the only developers to report positive clinical data for new treatments against SCD in recent months. In January CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals reported positive results for their CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited therapy candidate CTX001 in a patient with SCD and a patient with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) according to data from a pair of Phase I/II trials that was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Another developer of an SCD treatment Bluebird Bio temporarily and voluntarily suspending two clinical trials assessing its LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD; bb1111) following reports that two participants in the earlier-phase study developed blood cancers—one of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the other of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

Earlier this month however Bluebird said its BB305 lentiviral vector (LVV) was “very unlikely” to have played a role in the patient with AML. The company continues to investigate the MDS case.

BIVV003 is an autologous cell therapy that incorporates gene editing of a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells using Sangamo’s zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. The genomic modification occurs within an endogenous BCL11A enhancer sequence.

According to the COMP committee the first patient was of HbSS (homozygous genotype) and on hydroxyurea 500 mg daily for several years and had frequent hospitalizations due to 10 severe vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) including hospitalizations within the past two years before being enrolled in the study.

The second treated patient also had a HbSS genotype and a complex medical history of numerous VOCs and had received chronic red blood cell exchanges since she was seven years old. The third treated patient also had a previous history of chronic red blood cell transfusions and a VOC in the two years prior to enrollment COMP reported.

“Significant benefit”

“Although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product containing autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transfected with zinc finger nuclease mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB-mRENH2 will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition” the COMP concluded according to the minutes of its meeting.

“The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical observations supporting a reduction in vaso-occlusive crises as well as long term effects that may obviate the need of frequent treatment” COMP added. “The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.”

The three treated patients were among six recruited for the PRECIZN-1 trial an open label multicenter study for which Sangamo and Sanofi expect to recruit a total of eight adults with severe sickle cell disease. The study is designed to assess the safety tolerability and efficacy of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using BIVV003. The study’s estimated primary completion date is November 2023.

In a separate statement Wednesday Sangamo and Sanofi said they expect to submit updated data from the PRECIZN-1 study for presentation at a medical meeting later this year. At that time the companies said they will also provide an update on another Sanofi-partnered clinical trial assessing another ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy candidate being developed by the two companies for a blood disorder ST-400 in beta thalassemia.

Sangamo and Sanofi are partnering in an exclusive worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize zinc finger nuclease-mediated gene-edited cell therapies for the treatment of beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

The partnership was launched in 2014 by Sangamo and Biogen. When Biogen spun out its global hemophilia business in 2017 the spinout company Bioverativ took over Biogen’s portion of the collaboration before being acquired by Sanofi a year later for $11.6 billion. Sanofi continues Bioverativ’s obligation to conduct the BIVV003 Phase I/II clinical trial and subsequent worldwide clinical development manufacturing and commercialization of products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlbmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL2phbnNzZW5zLW11bHRpcGxlLXNjbGVyb3Npcy1kcnVnLXNuYWdzLWZkYS13aW4tYWZ0ZXItYmVzdGluZy1zYW5vZmlzLWJsb2NrYnVzdGVyLWluLXBoYXNlLTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janssen's Multiple Sclerosis Drug Snags FDA Win after Besting Sanofi's Blockbuster in Phase 3,"Janssen’s Multiple Sclerosis Drug Snags FDA Win after Besting Sanofi’s Blockbuster in Phase 3

Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects 2.3 million people globally with 1 million in the US alone. It occurs when our immune system attacks the myelin sheath a fatty substance that insulates our nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. The demyelination affects quick and effective neuronal communication thereby disabling the central nervous system. Vision problems muscle weakness numb sensations and cognitive issues are some of the common symptoms.

Relapse is often the most significant challenge with Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) being the predominant form Other forms include primary progressive MS (PPMS) secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) that denote patients who exhibit MS-like symptoms but isn’t diagnosed yet.

A New Entrant in an Already Crowded Market

On March 19th the USFDA approved yet another MS drug—Janssen’s Ponvory (ponesimod). The oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator received the agency’s nod for treating relapsing forms of the disease RRMS SPMS and CIS. Ponvory has now entered a market crowded with pharma giants namely Novartis Biogen Roche Bayer Pfizer Merck Sanofi Teva and GSK (See Table 1 & 2).

Table 1: FDA approved MS drugs since 2010

Table 2: FDA approved MS drugs on or before 2010

“Every person with multiple sclerosis is affected differently given variability in both the underlying disease and emerging symptoms. Continued innovation in this space is critical and we’re committed to meeting patients’ evolving healthcare needs” said Mathai Mammen M.D. Ph.D. Global Head Janssen Research & Development Johnson & Johnson. “We are proud to offer PONVORY as a valuable new option for people with MS that may help them gain better control of their disease.”

Strong Trial Data Surpassing Established Therapy

The FDA approval is an outcome of positive results for Ponvory which was pitted against Sanofi’s billion-dollar drug Aubagio (teriflunomide) in Phase 3 OPTIMUM trial comprising of 1133 participants. Superior showing in annualized relapse rate (ARR) a measure of the average number of relapses that trial patients experience in a year was the primary endpoint.

Results from the two-year study period showed that 20mg of Ponvory significantly reduced annual relapses by 30.5% as compared to 14mg of Aubagio. Besides 71% of patients treated with Ponvory had no confirmed relapses as opposed to Aubagio’s 63%. Ponvory also delayed disability progression and registered benefits over Aubagio in standard assessments of MS pathology and disease burden as measured by MRI scanning of the brain and spinal cord. The drug was well-tolerated over multiple clinical studies spanning more than 10 years. Upper respiratory infection hepatic transaminase elevation and hypertension were some commonly observed side effects.

“In the pivotal study ponesimod demonstrated superior clinical efficacy in reducing annual relapses and MRI activity compared against teriflunomide another oral MS therapy. Those results combined with a favorable side effect profile make ponesimod a useful treatment option for people with relapsing MS” said Robert J. Fox M.D. Staff Neurologist at Cleveland Clinic and member of the ponesimod Advisory Board.

Ponvory is the first and only FDA-approved oral disease modifying therapy studied in a head-to-head trial against an established oral comparator drug Janssen said in a statement.

Early in 2019 Chris Snow began to feel numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers on his right hand. Then muscles in his right forearm started to waste away.

Snow an assistant general manager with the Calgary Flames thought he had pinched a nerve in his elbow while working out at the gym. That May he had an electromyogram a procedure in which needles are inserted into neural pathways to see how muscles react. He expected to be told he needed surgery.

The results were inconclusive so the next month he repeated the test.

It was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a fatal disease of the nervous system that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord causing loss of muscle control.

The diagnosis struck him and his wife Kelsie like a sledgehammer. He was told he had perhaps six months to live at the outside maybe 18.

“It is absolutely the worst news you can receive” Chris says. “It is a complete no-hope scenario.”

Kelsie was in a small room with no wall hangings at a Calgary medical clinic when she heard the news. She felt like she was going to vomit. At the time he was 37 and she is two years younger. They have two young children.

“The conversations we had after that were all about how to live without him how to talk to the kids about him when he was gone” Kelsie says as she chokes back tears. “That week was horrible. I don’t know how we survived.”

After putting the kids to bed one night she came down the stairs and collapsed on the floor.

“I had never felt hopeless before” Kelsie says. “It was pure desperation.”

However the prognosis for Snow was not accurate. It is 21 months later and he continues to work fulltime for the Flames. He has weakness in his right arm hand and face and eats with the help of a feeding tube. But when it comes to his job he says “There is no change from the life I led before.”

Several days a week Kelsie ties his skates and Chris plays shinny at an outdoor rink in their neighbourhood.

“If you were to watch when I am out there you wouldn’t know I have ALS” he says.

The game he and his buddies play requires no netminder. A goal is chalked up each time someone bangs a puck off a post or crossbar. Chris holds his stick with the help of a special gripping device. With it he jokes he shoots better than ever.

“Every time I hit a post or crossbar I yell” he says. “It is a reminder that I am healthier than I am not.”

Within a few weeks of being diagnosed Snow began to receive a drug called Tofersen as part of a Phase 3 clinical trial. The drug specifically targets SOD-1 his genetic mutation of ALS. It is the most aggressive form of the illness which is often called Lou Gehrig’s disease after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it 81 years ago.

Although one’s brain remains clear ALS affects control of the muscles needed to move speak eat and breathe. Victims become trapped within their own bodies.

Chris has been given 25 doses of Tofersen so far first through a trial and then through a study financed by Biogen the biotechnology company that manufactures it. He will receive Tofersen for four years at no cost because it has orphan status which means there is no other drug that is comparable. It is administered through a spinal tap in his lower back. The procedure is extremely uncomfortable.

“I can take a needle” he says. “I am being given a life-extending medication.”

Tofersen arrested the progression of his illness for nearly nine months. Then in April of last year his smile began to droop. By December chewing became difficult and he started to choke when he ate solid food.

Those were gut-wrenching setbacks.

“Any month where there was no change felt more and more like the drug may be the answer” Kelsie says. “When that happened it was like he was diagnosed all over again. The drug definitely was working but not all the way.

“We have had to grieve and mourn at every step over what we have lost.”

He and Kelsie remain hopeful. The life expectancy for someone with ALS SOD-1 is seven months once symptoms begin to appear. His first appeared in the spring of 2019 and then he had none for nearly a year.

“Any doctor I have seen says there is no doubt I would not be here without the trial” Chris says.

“I have been given a gift and extra time – either a little or perhaps more than that.”

“ALS has grabbed hold of Chris’ body and stolen parts of it away and it has done the same to my spirit.” – A post by Kelsie Snow on her blog Kelsie Snow Writes from Jan. 1 2021.

When they met Chris Snow was a journalist who covered the Red Sox for The Boston Globe and Kelsie Smith was an intern in the newspaper’s sports department. He was 23; she was 21.

One night a fellow intern invited her to meet him and Chris for a few beers. She comes from a small town in South Dakota and knew few people in Boston so she joined them that evening at the White Horse Tavern a pub in the neighbourhood where he grew up.

Chris and the other intern had gone to school together at Syracuse University. They relived old times – and completely ignored Kelsie.

“Within five minutes I might as well not have been there” she says.

At one point their conversation turned to women.

“He kept putting his foot in his mouth” Kelsie says of her future husband. “He was not too smooth.”

There was something she liked though.

“He had a beautiful smile and blue eyes” she says.

When she returned from Boston for her final year studying journalism at the University of Kansas they began a long-distance relationship. She was invited back for another internship the next year and she and Chris began to date.

“I thought ‘Oh great! We’re going to spend the whole summer together’” she says.

Shortly after she arrived back in Massachusetts he accepted a job offer to become the director of hockey operations for the Minnesota Wild. He is a data and statistics expert and had once briefly written about the NHL’s Wild for the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

She visited him in Minneapolis a month later. He had purchased a condo and wanted her to see it.

“We walked in and there was a ring on the kitchen counter” Kelsie says. “I am sure he said lovely things but I don’t remember most of them.”

The one thing she recalls clearly is that he said “This is our home and I can’t promise we will be here forever but I can promise we’ll be together forever.”

Kelsie was speechless but nodded yes. Then he said “This is where I need you to verbalize something.”

They were engaged and when her internship concluded she moved to Minneapolis to be with him. She had no job but rather quickly landed a position covering the Minnesota Twins for the St. Paul Pioneer Press.

They were married on a bitter cold day in December of 2007.

As they had become serious Chris told Kelsie about his family history with ALS. His father died from the same genetic mutation of ALS that he has at 68 years old. Two of his uncles were claimed by it at 52 and 48 a cousin at 28.

“I was young and I loved him already and it seemed so far away” she says. “I didn’t understand the odds.”

In 2011 he was hired as director of hockey analysis for the Flames and the Snows moved to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Their son Cohen was born the following year. Their daughter Willa followed three years after that. He was eventually promoted to assistant GM.

Brad Treliving the general manager in Calgary knew Chris’s family history too.

“We talked about it a lot” Treliving says. “Prior to the diagnosis symptoms were creeping in but we hoped it was something else. “When I heard it was ALS I felt physically ill. It took my breath away.”

Treliving told Chris not to worry about his work responsibilities. He told him to go home and take care of himself and his young family.

“He is like a little brother to me” Treliving says. “I was trying to protect him.”

Chris fought him.

“After having lunch a few times I told him ‘This is not working for me’” Chris recalls. “I said ‘You have to ask me to do my job. If there are issues and I can’t do it trust me that that I will tell you.’

“In the early stages I did not want to be alone with my thoughts.”

“When you go from no hope to real true hope you feel high. You feel like you’ll never stop appreciating every single breath you take. You feel like life is brand new. And you feel desperate – utterly desperate – to hold onto that hope.” – From Kelsie Snow’s blog on Dec. 23 2019.

In late June of 2019 Chris and Kelsie Snow travelled to Florida to meet Dr. Michael Benatar an ALS researcher and the chief of the neuromuscular division at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine.

Dr. Benatar knows the Snow family’s history because Chris’s late father participated in a research study there. Dr. Benatar administered another electromyogram and put Chris through a series of motor-skill tests and gave him a mental-acuity exam.

“I think you are in the early stages of ALS” the doctor told him.

Within hours Dr. Benatar found a spot available for him in a Phase 3 clinical trial in Toronto at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Before the day was through Chris was accepted in it.

“It was obvious Dr. Benatar and his associates were hopeful” Kelsie says. “These are doctors who have had every patient die of ALS. They are not in the business of peddling false hope. To see they felt positive meant everything in the world to us.”

On their first day at Sunnybrook Dr. Lorne Zinman the director of its ALS and neuromuscular laboratory told them “We are here to make history.”

“When you have no expectations and you get a glimmer of hope it is an incredible thing” Chris says. “I think I am one of the most fortunate people ever diagnosed with ALS because I have a chance.”

He received his first dose of Tofersen in the summer of 2019 and the most recent on March 5. He gets one each month. At the beginning he had to travel to Toronto to receive them. Once COVID-19 appeared arrangements were made for them to be administered to him in Calgary.

Chris and Kelsie remain confident because Biogen is working on two improved versions of the drug.

“They will find more efficient doses if I can stick around for another three to five years” he says. “Trials are coming fast and furious.”

The couple took to Twitter to talk about his illness shortly after he was diagnosed. In December of 2019 she began to document their life with ALS on her blog Kelsie Snow Writes. Recently she started a podcast called Sorry I’m Sad in which she talks about their grief loss and the importance of hope.

When others would prefer to face mortality privately they chose to go public.

“This disease runs in my family now” Kelsie says. “It is part of my life forever. I wanted people to know Chris. He is an amazing resilient person. When other people turn to flight from fright Chris rises up.

“We have a platform and can lend faces to it. There are two ways to approach this: Go internal or say ‘I won’t go quietly.’ It feels right for me.”

Chris continues to work every day. He has learned to throw with his left hand so he can pitch batting practice to Cohen who is now nine. He taught himself to write left-handed also. Occasionally he needs to sign a contract with a Flames player. At Christmas he wrote a card to Kelsie.

The details: Brian Deese director of the National Economic Council was paid $2.3 million in salary last year to serve as BlackRock's head of sustainable investing. Deputy national security adviser Jonathan Finer was paid nearly $730000 as a senior vice president of private equity firm Warburg Pincus.

Deese also appeared to earn another $2.4 million from his vested restricted shares in BlackRock. He had served as one of Obama's senior advisers and helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate accord.

Finer received another $430000 from Warburg in carried interest — the profits earned by managers of venture capital hedge and private equity funds. He had served previously as State Department chief of staff and director of policy planning.

They were not alone in finding riches in the private sector during Donald Trump's presidency.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki Obama’s former White House communications director made nearly $580000 through her private consulting group.

She also received a communications consulting fee exceeding $5000 from Jeff Zients currently Biden's counselor and COVID-19 response coordinator and another from Lyft.

Susan Rice who served as Obama's national security adviser and now is director of the Domestic Policy Council made over $305000 from exercising Netflix stock options last August. She was appointed to Netflix’s board of directors in 2018.

She also received from $100000 to $1 million in dividends from stocks in Enbridge a Canadian energy company building an oil pipeline in northern Minnesota that opponents want the Biden administration to stop.

The figures are reported in broad ranges.

Julissa Reynoso Pantaleon the U.S. ambassador to Uruguay under Obama and now first lady Jill Biden's chief of staff took in nearly $1.5 million through last December as a partner at law firm Winston & Strawn.

Other Biden aides joined them in taking substantial pay cuts to return to government service.

White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain made just over $1.8 million as executive vice president of D.C.-based venture capital firm Revolution.

Stuart Delery Biden's deputy counsel made $3.7 million through January as a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher.

Some of the people who helped the president win the 2020 race also gave up hefty compensation packages to serve in the federal government.

Biden senior adviser Mike Donilon  who served as counselor to Biden during the Obama administration made over $4.3 million last year as a managing member of the consulting firm MCD Strategies.

Deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon also received a severance and deferred compensation package from the firm Precision Strategies — which she co-founded — that totaled about $425000.

The big picture: Although several of Biden's closest advisers made millions through forging new ties to corporate interests after leaving Obama's White House their wealth pales in comparison to the net worth of many super-wealthy Trump confidantes.

Gary Cohn held stock and cash payments valued at about $300 million as president of Goldman Sachs before becoming Trump's former White House economic adviser.

Former Trump administration chief strategist Steve Bannon reported up to $13 million in assets in 2017 mostly in real estate.

President Joe Biden's closest advisors have ties to big business and Wall Street with some making millions of dollars in their careers leading up to entering the White House new financial disclosures show.

The senior Biden aides listed in the disclosures include chief of staff Ron Klain deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon senior advisor Mike Donilon White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeffrey Zients and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese.

These disclosures show that many of the president's closest aides have deep ties to the business world and have made more money in their past corporate careers than previously known.

These disclosures were provided by the White House to CNBC early Saturday morning after requesting the documents a day earlier. None of these positions were confirmed by the Senate. Many of these advisors have previous ties to Biden's campaign or former President Barack Obama's administration.

A White House spokesperson did not return a follow up request for comment.

Deese was previously the Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock before becoming the head of the National Economic Council. While at the investment firm Deese's disclosure shows he made over $2.3 million in salary and bonuses. His disclosure also suggests that through BlackRock's restricted stock plan Deese could have made an additional $2.4 million.

Klain who was an executive at the venture capital firm Revolution before joining the White House was listed as having a salary of $1.8 million. He started at the company in 2005.

O'Malley Dillon who ran Biden's campaign before following him to the White House was a co-founder of the consulting firm Precision Strategies. The founders of the firm are credited with helping reelect Obama in 2012.

O'Malley Dillon's new financial disclosure gives a glimpse into the corporate advisory work she did for the firm before coming to the White House. The filing lists Gates Ventures as a client of O'Malley Dillon's while she was at Precision Strategies.

According to PitchBook Gates Ventures is a venture capital firm founded by billionaire Bill Gates. The current deputy White House chief of staff also advised the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative the philanthropic arm of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan.

Other corporations that saw her guidance include General Electric and Lyft. O'Malley Dillon's deferred compensation and severance from Precision is listed as being over $420000.

Donilon was a managing member of MCD Strategies a media consulting firm prior to his role in the White House. His filing shows that he made over $4 million in income while leading his consulting firm. Donilon lists the Biden campaign and Democratic National Convention Committee as two of his clients.

Zients was the CEO of the Wall Street investment firm Cranemere before becoming a lead advisor to the Biden White House on the coronavirus pandemic. His financial disclosure shows that he had a combined salary and bonus of $1.6 million. As board member of Facebook the new report shows he made over $330000.

Before Jake Sullivan became Biden's national security advisor he was a senior partner at the consulting firm Macro Advisory Partners.

Enron was an energy company that collapsed in 2001 causing the demise of Arthur Andersen one of the Big Four accounting firms at the time. The book outlines how corporate greed and scandalous activities caused a level of cheating that was unprecedented.

It failed due to a combination of factors that included creative market trades and dodgy accounting practices. But all of that was facilitated by bad leadership — a terrible culture where leaders were motivated to do wrong for high reward.

In the last couple of weeks we have experienced leadership gaffes and corporate betrayals that we might have thought were more indicative of another era. After the disaster of the global financial crisis and the recent pandemic you’d think or hope that shameful shenanigans in boardrooms were over.

But if you thought those days were over you only have to reflect on the past few weeks to know that’s not true. While we know the Davy debacle actually took place a number of years ago I’m sure you’ll agree that the likelihood of similar stories emerging from other companies is inevitable. Human nature is what it is.

But I’m happy to say that this pandemic has certainly shone a light on those great leaders that have empathy for others and the world around them.

Larry Fink is CEO of BlackRock the world’s largest investment management company. In his letter to the CEOs of the companies BlackRock invests in he advised them to be clear about their plans for sustainability. From January to November 2020 investors in mutual funds invested $288bn globally in sustainable assets.

“I believe that this is the beginning of a long but rapidly accelerating transition” he said.

I appreciate some will say he is motivated by return on capital when he also says: “We know that climate risk is investment risk. But we also believe the climate transition presents a historic investment opportunity.”

I’m okay with this. There doesn’t have to be a contradiction between doing the right thing and making money. In this example sustainability is the topic — but he could just as well have been talking about other global issues. It’s the portrayal of responsible leadership that inspired me.

Leaders need followers

Today I also want to spare a thought for great followers namely middle managers.

They often have the toughest job in an organisation. They’re the buffer between the boardroom and the front line. They are the ones who have to execute the strategies on the ground by rallying their troops and keeping them motivated to deliver to a standard on time and on budget.

More often than not in large organisations you can see a co-relation between three sets of data. KPIs customer feedback and employee feedback. For those divisions that score highest in all three much of the recognition can go to the local leader.

Those leaders get direction from their bosses. They make sense of it and they then interpret it in an appropriate way at local level.

In being good leaders they are also being great followers. They take accountability for their brief and just get on with it. But sometimes they also have to stand up and disregard poor direction.

How to be a great follower

When you get good direction from your line manager be a great follower by being accountable and deliver.

In my role over the last 30 years this is the one characteristic that I believe is in short supply. Whether we are leaders managers or whatever we all have a duty to take ownership of our part in the jigsaw puzzle and connect our pieces into the bigger picture.

If you can’t deliver due to obstacles outside your control then find your voice and speak up. Provided your supporting arguments are reasonable and valid you cannot be accused of being difficult. If however it’s a case of ‘you won’t’ then consider if this role is right for you.

If you are unsettled by being asked to do something that is inappropriate stop for a second and think. Measure what you have been asked to say or do against the agreed values of the organisation. This enables you to push back in an objective way rather than with your own subjective viewpoint.

If your company does not have a set of agreed values then rely on a common set of values that include decency respect and honesty. Who can argue against any of those?

I also appreciate that situations like this can be extremely stressful. If you need help find a trusted confidante. But do it quickly rather than procrastinate.

The Last Word

There is a video on YouTube that shows a lone guy dancing at a music festival. He is left on his own for some time until he is joined by the ‘first follower’ after which the crowd forms. In a nutshell while leaders are essential it highlights the important role of great followers. We can’t all be leaders but we can all show up use good judgement and be great followers."

The outfit says it's the ""largest first-time growth equity private fund raised in history.""

We knew this was coming back in the fall of 2019 when we first talked with Jon Korngold the head of the new fund. At the time he was a recent hire having joined that same year from General Atlantic where he spent the previous 18 years of his career including as a managing director and a member of its management committee.

Korngold was also in building mode trying to assemble a team and writing some early checks off of Blackstone's sizable balance sheet. (The company had assets under management at the time of roughly $500 billion; it now manages just north of $600 billion.)

Because a lot has transpired since that conversation including a $2 billion bet on the dating app Bumble that's currently worth a stunning $7 billion -- this atop $2 billion in proceeds from selling shares at Bumble's IPO last month -- we asked Korngold to catch us up on the team what size investments they are making and whether Blackstone views blank-check companies as growing competition. (You can also hear this longer conversation here.)

TC: Brass tacks how many people are now investing this $4.5 billion alongside you?

JK: We've got about 30 people full-time dedicated to Blackstone Growth in addition to the obviously hundreds of if not a thousand people more generally available to us within the Blackstone family. We've got people now in San Francisco New York and in London. It's has a global mandate.

TC: What size checks does your team tend to write?

JK: Our average investment might be $200 million to $400 million.

TC: And how much of this debut fund has been invested already?

JK: In the beginning we were using other pools of capital before this pool of capital was available to us. Now that we've got this we've got a handful of investments and invested a pretty significant portion of our capital already. It's probably north of 25% at this stage.

TC: Do you reserve upwards of half for follow-on funding? How does a fund of this size even work?

JK: Anytime we invest we always expect and hope that we will continue to support our companies throughout. Fortunately we never have a problem of running out of money. But we do reserve a significant portion of it to fund the ongoing growth of the companies.

The good news is many of our companies are already profitable. If you recall from we spoke last time one of the things that we've tried to do is look for companies that are at the upper end of the growth equity spectrum both in terms of some of the maturity of the business and even their growth ambitions where they may have outgrown a lot of traditional growth equity but they haven't yet outgrow Blackstone. As result fortunately we have the luxury of not needing to reserve as much because we think our companies are going to run out of capital. That's never really the problem.

TC: One of your most notable deals was in Bumble into whose parent company you reportedly invested $2 billion at a $3 billion valuation for a controlling stake in late 2019. Given your other options why did you decide to do this deal?

JK: First we knew that dating is not a fad. People will date in bull markets and recessions and we've learned in hindsight in quarantine. Even before the pandemic 40% of all new relationships that started began online. It's become much much more mainstream on the back of mobile phone penetration and it's a global phenomenon.

The second thing we really liked was the opportunity to back [founder and CEO] Whitney Wolfe Herd. She is an exceptional entrepreneur and partner and really embraced the full set of resources that Blackstone was in a position to help give. It's been just a phenomenal partnership.

TC: You've talked in the past about all the might that Blackstone brings to a deal. What did you do for Bumble?

JK: First was cementing Whitney's leadership of the overall company. Historically there were two parts of the business: it was Badoo and Bumble and they were largely run separately [and now] Whitney is the single CEO of both companies together.

The second thing we did was really augment the management team. We brought in 10 C-level executives alongside Whitney -- the majority of the Bumble team is female -- [and] we brought in six independent directors [and now] eight of its 11 board members are women.

We also consolidated the product development teams between Badoo and Bumble and the marketing teams. We meaningfully upgraded the technology infrastructure -- we put in a lot more around reporting and repeatability to make sure the company was going to be a great public entity. We consolidated their real estate footprint [as] they had multiple disparate units in London and Texas and elsewhere and we centralized that to ensure the culture remained much more consistent. And we got the company ready to be public in terms of [Sarbanes-Oxley] compliance and prepping the company as to what to expect as a public business.

We also massively invested in product one of which is video chat. Before the quarantine we introduced video dating before any other platform and that turned out to be a phenomenal boon for our growth across quarantine where video usage was up 80% on the platform.

TC: Did your current investors in the fund benefit from Bumble's success?

JK: Yes they did.

TC: Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) weren't being used much in 2019 when you struck your deal with Bumble. Do you think if they had Bumble might have skipped the Blackstone round and just gone public sooner? Do see SPACs as a threat to your work?

JK: I don't really view SPACs as competitors. It's easy to crap on SPACs but there is a role for them it's no longer the dirty four-letter word it was years ago now that you see many more credible sponsors behind these SPACs.

I do think there will be many more SPACs than good deals to actually invest in especially when the perverse incentive is: you've got 24 months to invest the money [so] it's better to do a bad deal than no deal at all. There is a fundamental misalignment in the current model of SPAC that has led to an arbitrage that we haven't seen in many many many years.

There's a place for them but like direct listings that [prompted people to believe the] IPO model is going to go away the practical reality is that there have been four or five total direct listings in history. So I don't see SPACs displacing IPOs and I certainly don't see them displacing growth equity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJhZGlvLmNvbS9mcmVlL2RhdmlkLWNhbGhvdW4tdG8tZXhpdC1uaWVsc2VuLWJvYXJkL2FydGljbGVfNTUxZmQ5OGEtZjgwMC0xMWU2LWIxMDQtNTNmMDFjMGRlODQ3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Calhoun To Exit Nielsen Board. | Story | insideradio.com,"You have permission to edit this article.

President Donald Trump's plane a Boeing 757 decked out with 24-karat gold fixtures and seatbelt buckles has been sitting unused and in need of repair at a New York airfield according to reports.

CNN on Saturday published pictures of the plane sitting at Stewart international airport an hour outside New York City. It said the plane hadn't been flown since President Joe Biden's inauguration.

The modifications are focused on updating the jets’ structural and mission systems architecture enabling future capability growth for the Navy’s 160 Growler aircraft. Growlers serve a critical role in jamming radar and communications signals of threat forces disabling their ability to detect and track U.S. and allied military forces.

“We’re excited to have the Growler industry team here working on capabilities that will bring the fleet enhanced electronic surveillance enhanced data link and the ability to carry the Next Generation Jammer pod” said Capt. Chris “Needles” Bahner commander Electronic Attack Wing U.S. Pacific Fleet. “We look forward to being a cooperative partner with PMA-265 and PMA-234 at Naval Air Systems Command and the Growler industry team on this exciting work.”

Following contract awards in October 2020 and February 2021 for materials and labor the modification work includes various upgrades for Growler mission systems. The aircraft’s ALQ-218 receiver system will receive the Airborne Electronic Attack System Enhancements modification enabling the Growler to operate in increasingly complex electromagnetic environments.

Additional modifications will expand the Growler’s information pipeline for more rapid and secure data transfer to other aircraft and platforms as well as substantially improve the speed of data processing. Boeing also will prepare the Growler for the Next Generation Jammer which greatly improves the Growler’s electronic attack capability.

“As the world’s premier electronic attack platform we’re starting this program for the EA-18G Growler in solid partnership with the Navy” said Mark Sears Boeing vice president of Fighters & Strike Product Support. “These modifications will position it to meet the threats of today and those in the future.”

The program schedule forecasts that all Navy Growlers will be modified in five years. Full rate modification is expected to start in June 2021. Boeing has positioned people on-site at Whidbey following state local customer and corporate COVID protocols to ensure the program is fully staffed to support the work flow.

The 747-8 was to be the final variant of the category defining Boeing 747 family before its discontinuation was announced in 2020. Initially available in freighter form the 747-8 Intercontinental is the passenger variant featuring an extended upper deck for the first time since the -300 model in 1982. The -8 is also the longest passenger aircraft in service surpassing the Airbus A340-600 before it. However this record will be handed over to the new largest aircraft in Boeing’s lineup: the 777-9 which is now scheduled to enter airline service in late 2023.

Entering the market as a response to Airbus’ A380 ‘super jumbo’ the 747-8 only really saw success as a freighter with only 48 orders placed for the -8i passenger type compared to 107 for the -8f freighter. Airbus had initially planned to build an A380 freighter but cancelled the program early into production of the passenger line. Airbus went on to build 272 A380s – almost double the number of both the combined freighter and passenger variants of the 747-8.

Cargolux was the launch customer for the freighter which was first to fly whereas Lufthansa was the first to operate the Intercontinental. It would be one of only three airline operators of the type alongside Korean Air and Air China with a handful of other -8i airframes being operated as VIP and governmental transports.

Regardless of the planned discontinuation of production the 747-8i will go on to replace the 747-200B-based Boeing VC-25A as the new ‘Air Force One’ the aircraft designed to carry the President of the United States whilst that title is only accurate as the callsign when the President is actually on board. Two unfulfilled orders for Transaero a Russian passenger airline which went out of business in 2015 were selected to undergo the modifications to become the VC-25B. They will be operated by the 89th Airlift Wing of the United States Air Force scheduled to be delivered once modifications are complete in 2024.

It joins a plethora of travel businesses that are remaking themselves whether they are launching financial services or subscription offerings during the pandemic.

Many travel businesses whether it is Trip.com Group in China Traveloka in Indonesia or Despegar in Argentina are refashioning themselves during the pandemic.

For China’s Trip.com formerly known globally as Ctrip it is trying to diversify away from its over-reliance on transactions particularly because the hotel discounting frenzy in China and its dependence on airline ticket sales lead to sub-par commission levels.

In its fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call earlier this month Trip.com officials detailed how they are getting into the content business to get a line into airline hotel and destinations’ advertising budgets.

“We traditionally only made most of our money from commission” co-founder and Executive Chairman Jianzhang “James” Liang told analysts during the earnings presentation. “So it’s really coming out of the sales budgets of airlines and destinations and hotels. Of course as we know they also have a marketing budget and branding budget probably just as large and the same order magnitude and it’s just as large as the sales budget. So this is the area that we hope to through our marketing and platform and our content capability be able to tap into in the near future.”

He said focusing on content creation and travel inspiration will attract new customers for Trip.com Group entice them to engage more frequently and spend more time on the brands’ apps which are seeing increased spending in domestic packages for example.

Getting Into Content Creation and Advertising

The move into content creation and the goal of creating advertising revenue comes after Trip.com Group entered into a joint venture with Massachusetts-headquartered Tripadvisor in late 2019 to share content on their respective platforms. Trip.com Group CEO Jie “Jane” Sun now has a Tripadvisor board position.

Tripadvisor of course has long brought in the majority of its revenue from advertising/media as opposed to transactions. Advertising is a relatively high-margin business compared with transactions.

We are not alleging that Tripadvisor is somehow directing or teaching Trip.com Group the content business. This isn’t a situation of an all-knowing fair-haired Western business teaching a Chinese enterprise which was founded in 1999 and even prior to Tripadvisor a thing or two about the travel business.

There are plenty of logical reasons for Trip.com Group to get into the advertising business and ways to learn about it. There may be many homegrown advertising models in China. Expedia Group too has long had an active media solutions business.

But it wouldn’t be surprising for Trip.com Group given its new strategic partnership to compare notes with Tripadvisor on its longstanding experience in the advertising arena.

Addressing Weaknesses

Here are some of the problems that China’s largest travel agency which has its online platform but also operates thousands of stores particularly in lower-tier cities is addressing with its move into the advertising business:

Skift’s Deep Dive Into Trip.com Group 2020 cited the fact that In May 2017 Trip.com Group disclosed that its net take rate on hotels because of couponing or discounting was relatively small at 8-10 percent. The company also has a dependence on flights which is a great source for new customers but provides low commissions.

Fast-forward to 2020 and you can see from the chart below that although Trip.com Group greatly outpaced Expedia Group and Booking Holdings in gross bookings or the total value of travel goods sold it lagged in revenue despite the relatively robust nature of China’s Covid travel recovery compared with the United States and Europe.

Trip.com Group Had the Largest Gross Bookings Among Its Peers

Company Revenue Net Income/Loss Gross Bookings Trip.com Group $2.8 billion $497 million $61 billion Expedia Group $5.2 billion $2.7 billion $36.8 billion Booking Holdings $6.8 billion $59 million $35.4 billion

In fact Trip.com Group attracted $61 billion in gross bookings in 2020 compared with $36.8 billion at Expedia Group and $35.4 billion at Booking Holdings.

Skift Research’s deep dive into Trip.com Group which used data as of October 28 2020 found that Booking Holdings’ take rate or commission levels were the highest at 16 percent Expedia Group generated 11 percent and Trip.com Group lagged considerably at 4 percent. Hotel commission levels in China are generally much lower than they are in North America or Europe.

So it is likely a smart move for Trip.com Group to address some of these take rate and margin weaknesses by entering the content and advertising business.

Sun explained during the earnings call that many Trip.com users already write reviews and travel journals on its platform arguing that its “strong product and transaction capability allows to make content-to-transaction conversion easy and frictionless.”

Said Sun: “For example our livestream channels delivered the highest conversion rate in travel industry last year. So for these reasons we are confident to see that we will be one of the go-to platforms for users that seek both travel inspirations and values for care in the short-haul and long-haul travel demand.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

A division of Ho-Chunk Inc. purchased the buildings from the family that had controlled them for decades.

Ho-Chunk Capital's purchases include the landmark building that housed Aalfs Manufacturing's corporate offices for much of the 20th century. Built in 1890 the five-story brick-and-stone structure at 1005 Fourth St. has also been known as the Boston Block.

The other buildings acquired house a mix of tenants that include bars offices shops and restaurants. Collectively the structures have 78527 square feet of floor space according to a Ho-Chunk press release.

Dennis Johnson chief investment officer of Ho-Chunk Capital said that Ho-Chunk plans to do some rehabilitation of the buildings while maintaining their historical integrity. Ho-Chunk officials said they hope the current tenants will remain.

""These will be mixed-use buildings. So we'll have a continuation of residential on the upper two or three stories depending on the building and cool restaurant options -- there's already several existing so we hope to retain all of those and add a couple in a couple of the vacant positions that are down here"" Johnson said.

The Aalfs family approached Ho-Chunk about a sale Johnson said. Lance Morgan CEO of Ho-Chunk Inc. said that negotiations with Jack Aalfs began in earnest around a year ago though Ho-Chunk officials had been eyeing the properties as early as five years ago.

Renovations will take place in ""phases"" Johnson said. They plan to rehab one building at a time starting later this year and wrapping up within three or four years. Morgan pointed to Ho-Chunk's reputation for maintaining its properties in as pristine a condition as possible: ""If you know anything about us everything we do we try to do it right and we try to do it first-class.""

""Sometimes you know people think about the tribes they think about the poverty. We struggle with those issues still but our goal is to change the image and the mindset of how people view what we do"" he added.

The renovations will be vertically integrated through Ho-Chunk. Design work for the renovations will be conducted by BluStone an architectural design company and a Ho-Chunk subsidiary. HCI Construction another Ho-Chunk subsidiary will do the construction work in collaboration with BluStone.

Besides the old Aalfs building the other properties included in the transaction are:

-- 1019-24 Fourth St. a brick structure built between 1890 and 1897 that was once the site of John Stevenson's Saloon. It now houses M's on Fourth;

-- 1016-24 Fourth St. the Lee Block a long brick structure built in 1910 or 1911 that's home to SoHo Kitchen and Bar Buffalo Alice Antiques on Fourth and Beth's Flowers.

-- 1010-12 Fourth St. a multi-story brick-and-stonework building dating to 1885 known as the Major Block. Other sources have indicated that design work on the building didn't begin until 1889. The building is home to Major's Sportsbar.

-- 1014 Fourth St. a brick building dating to 1900.

(County property records and a Ho-Chunk press release seem to indicate that 1014 Fourth St. is technically an independent property; however the address 1014 is on the western end of the Lee Block and Johnson said the properties are essentially one in the same.)

The purchase also included some surface parking spaces.

The deal closed March 5 the day of the announcement. Johnson declined to say how much was paid for the properties.

""That'll become public record in the near future"" he said.

Morgan said that Ho-Chunk which is headquartered in Winnebago Nebraska has ""bet big on Sioux City"" in recent years between their ownership of the 10-story glass-clad Ho-Chunk Centre the Virginia Square development on Virginia Street some properties on Pearl Street and now a large chunk of Fourth Street.

""We probably used to own it anyway"" joked Morgan prompting laughter from the crowd. ""I just can't help it.""

Aalfs Manufacturing a large textile manufacturer that was one of the oldest family-owned businesses in Sioux City was sold in in 2018 to Grupo Siete Leguas a family-owned jean and denim producer headquartered in the Mexican state of Durango. Until the sale the Aalfs family maintained ownership of the old headquarters and the neighboring buildings.

The Aalfs family was a central figure in helping revitalize a two-block area long known as “Lower Fourth” into what is today's Historic Fourth District.

""We are grateful we had the privilege to participate in its transformation to 'Historic Fourth'"" Jack Aalfs said in a statement provided by Ho-Chunk. ""The decision to sell our properties was not an easy one so it was important to us to find a buyer that shared our commitment to Sioux City and its history. We believe that Ho-Chunk Capital has demonstrated that commitment and we are excited for the future of Historic Fourth in their hands.""

In 1984 Aalfs completed a major restoration of the Boston Block that exposed the iron columns and the glass window frames which for years had been hidden beneath a modern brick wall. Today the building looks much as it did the day it was built.

Designed by local architect Edward W. Loft in the popular Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style the Boston Block was one of four warehouse-like structures that were built by the Boston Investment Company at the turn of the century.

The Major Block meanwhile was briefly the home of Northwestern College which later became Morningside College as well as the school's College of Law. In later years it housed the Ochsner & Orcutt hardware store. Its upper floors provided lodging that went by various names including the Acme Victory and Major Hotel.

""What a beautiful building beautiful façade again very historic attributes to that"" Johnson said of the Major Block.

Marlborough – Searching for a first job can be a daunting task. But add a pandemic to the mix with many companies temporarily shuttering or even closing for good and suddenly things can get a lot tougher.

Realizing this a group from the Marlborough Regional Chamber of Commerce School to Business Committee and the Marlborough STEM Council have planned a unique Zoom webinar for young people.

Mark Vital the Community Outreach Manager for the Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School (AMSA) will moderate the panel discussion with volunteers from Boston Scientific Sunovion and Cytiva. Titled “The Perfect Career Search (for first time employment)” the event will run via Zoom on March 29 from 9 to 10:30 a.m.

Organizers tailor event around student needs

Prepping this opportunity organizers conducted a survey to find out what the students might be interested in learning as this type of event.

Vital said he was delighted to receive over two hundred responses to that questionnaire from students at AMSA Assabet Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School and Marlborough High School (MHS).

More than sixty-five percent of the surveys requested information on career searches while another large batch asked what factors should be considered when applying to a company.

In addition to responding to those concerns the panel will now also discuss professionalism and the proper etiquette for social media in the workplace among other related concerns.

Registration available online

As students must be at least fifteen to attend this event will be open to alumni of AMSA Assabet and MHS.

“Many of our alumni are getting ready to graduate college very soon and still have no clue about what’s next” Vital told the Community Advocate in a recent interview. “This might be helpful to them as well.”

Students are encouraged to register early at this link and to submit any questions they might like panelists to answer ahead of time. Students may also contact MHS Career Specialists Amanda Chenier Assabet Director of Academics Rob McCann Director of Academics or Vital at AMSA to get the link for the webinar.

by Rajaneesh K. Gopinath Share To

Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects 2.3 million people globally with 1 million in the US alone. It occurs when our immune system attacks the myelin sheath a fatty substance that insulates our nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. The demyelination affects quick and effective neuronal communication thereby disabling the central nervous system. Vision problems muscle weakness numb sensations and cognitive issues are some of the common symptoms.

Relapse is often the most significant challenge with Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) being the predominant form Other forms include primary progressive MS (PPMS) secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) that denote patients who exhibit MS-like symptoms but isn’t diagnosed yet.

A New Entrant in an Already Crowded Market

On March 19th the USFDA approved yet another MS drug—Janssen’s Ponvory (ponesimod). The oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator received the agency’s nod for treating relapsing forms of the disease RRMS SPMS and CIS. Ponvory has now entered a market crowded with pharma giants namely Novartis Biogen Roche Bayer Pfizer Merck Sanofi Teva and GSK (See Table 1 & 2).

Table 1: FDA approved MS drugs since 2010

Table 2: FDA approved MS drugs on or before 2010

“Every person with multiple sclerosis is affected differently given variability in both the underlying disease and emerging symptoms. Continued innovation in this space is critical and we’re committed to meeting patients’ evolving healthcare needs” said Mathai Mammen M.D. Ph.D. Global Head Janssen Research & Development Johnson & Johnson. “We are proud to offer PONVORY as a valuable new option for people with MS that may help them gain better control of their disease.”

Strong Trial Data Surpassing Established Therapy

The FDA approval is an outcome of positive results for Ponvory which was pitted against Sanofi’s billion-dollar drug Aubagio (teriflunomide) in Phase 3 OPTIMUM trial comprising of 1133 participants. Superior showing in annualized relapse rate (ARR) a measure of the average number of relapses that trial patients experience in a year was the primary endpoint.

Results from the two-year study period showed that 20mg of Ponvory significantly reduced annual relapses by 30.5% as compared to 14mg of Aubagio. Besides 71% of patients treated with Ponvory had no confirmed relapses as opposed to Aubagio’s 63%. Ponvory also delayed disability progression and registered benefits over Aubagio in standard assessments of MS pathology and disease burden as measured by MRI scanning of the brain and spinal cord. The drug was well-tolerated over multiple clinical studies spanning more than 10 years. Upper respiratory infection hepatic transaminase elevation and hypertension were some commonly observed side effects.

“In the pivotal study ponesimod demonstrated superior clinical efficacy in reducing annual relapses and MRI activity compared against teriflunomide another oral MS therapy. Those results combined with a favorable side effect profile make ponesimod a useful treatment option for people with relapsing MS” said Robert J. Fox M.D. Staff Neurologist at Cleveland Clinic and member of the ponesimod Advisory Board.

Ponvory is the first and only FDA-approved oral disease modifying therapy studied in a head-to-head trial against an established oral comparator drug Janssen said in a statement.

Appearing on Jason Whitlock’s Fearless podcast Tuesday afternoon Brown reflected on what Tomlin meant to him on and off the field.

“Mike Tomlin…that dude was like my pops to be honest” an emotional Brown told Whitlock. “Ever since I met Mike Tomlin I always knew I’ll have success. I feel like when I went to the Steelers Mike Tomlin once I saw him and talked with him I knew I was going to the Steelers. Mike Tomlin was that father figure for me. Outside of coach. Obviously as a coach and the minutia as a coach he was always challenging me at the utmost to make sure I was better.”

Brown had a winding journey to the NFL. A Florida kid who played his college ball in the MAC at Central Michigan becoming a sixth round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. Scouts questioned his level of competition his slight frame his 4.57 40-yard Combine time.

Pittsburgh took the chance on him late in the draft. He found the end zone on his first regular season touch taking a reverse for a touchdown on a kickoff against the Tennessee Titans. His role as a receiver was limited in the early goings but he made his name known in his debut playoff game. Tied 24-apiece against the Baltimore Ravens Brown made a 58-yard helmet catch down the right sideline on a 3rd and 19 heave from Ben Roethlisberger setting up the game-winning touchdown.

From there his career took off. He finished second on the team in receptions yards and touchdowns in 2011. His breakout year came in 2013 leading the team with 110 receptions for 1499 yards and eight touchdowns. His numbers became video-game like in 2014 leading the NFL in receptions (129) and yards (1698) and in his prime was essentially uncoverable. For six straight seasons he posted at least 100 receptions 1200 yards and eight touchdowns. In NFL history no one else has done it more than four times consecutive or not.

In his now famous interview with The Pivot in 2022 Mike Tomlin acknowledged Brown would never play for the Steelers again but spoke well of him.

“We had nine great years” Tomlin told Ryan Clark Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder. “I appreciate that dude in ways that I can’t explain to y’all that I won’t even bother to attempt to explain to y’all because it sounds like I’m defending him in some way…the nature of our relationship and what we all did together requires no defense.”

The feeling seems mutual.

“That guy Mike Tomlin always had my back always believed in me” Brown said. “So I’m always indebted to Mike Tomlin. He was one of those guys that’s stood in the foxhole for me. And that meant a lot to me.”

But Brown eventually felt like his time was up in Pittsburgh and he made a loud exit forcing the team to trade him. Brown hasn’t said he regrets the move telling Whitlock he was chasing a Super Bowl ring he eventually received with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But had Brown stayed with Tomlin he might’ve gone down as the greatest receiver in NFL history. Instead he’ll be remembered for as much what he did off the field than on it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvdHJhdmlzLXNjb3R0LWFpci1qb3JkYW4tMS1sb3ctb2ctc3AtdmVsdmV0LWJyb3duLWRtNzg2Ni0yMDItcmVsZWFzZS1pbmZv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Travis Scott X Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP ""Velvet Brown"" Rumored To Be Arriving Soon","A new Travis Scott and Jordan Brand shoe is on its way and it looks like the partnership will be hitting the classic Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. still “believes” in his mantra of “Accelerate Change or Lose”—and indicated the doctrinal changes it produced when he was Air Force Chief of Staff played a role in the service’s recent response to Iran’s aerial assault on Israel he said May 7.

Speaking at the Ash Carter Exchange conference in Washington D.C. Brown said he recently spoke with U.S. Airmen who helped respond to Iran’s attack on April 13. U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons shot down dozens of Iranian drones as they were heading toward targets in Israel. While Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles 30 land-attack cruise missiles and 150 drones U.S. Israel and coalition forces intercepted “99 percent” of them U.S. and Israeli officials have said.

“Just amazing work by a very talented group of young people and older people as well” Brown said.

Brown said during his talk with the Airmen “We talked about mission command and how they used parts of our doctrine that we changed back in April of 2021.”

Early on in his tenure as CSAF Brown released Air Force Doctrine Publication 1 or AFDP-1 distilling two volumes of airpower doctrine down to 20 pages. As part of that publication the Air Force said mission command “empowers subordinate decision-making for flexibility initiative and responsiveness in the accomplishment of commander’s intent.”

It was an idea Brown repeatedly returned during his time as Chief imploring Airmen to take action without formal approval from commanders instead acting based on what they believed their commanders’ intent to be. In 2023 the service released another Air Force doctrine publication devoted entirely to the subject dubbed AFDP 1-1.

“While this publication will help build a common understanding of mission command across the force the culture of mission command doesn’t happen just because it is written in our doctrine” Brown wrote at the time. “I believe building confidence in mission command for both leaders and Airmen requires daily execution in simple scenarios ahead of a complex challenge in conflict.”

By trying to accelerate the process of change then Brown added May 7 he hoped he had “broke the inertia to get the momentum going and move things forward.” Helping that push is new CSAF Gen. David W. Allvin who served as Brown’s vice chief whose manta is to “follow through.”

“There’s some things we moved forward and I’m very fortunate but the person who succeeded me was my Vice Chief of Staff” Brown said.

Iran’s attack on Israel “puts the region a little bit more on edge” Brown said and the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to create tension across the Middle East. But the situation has improved for U.S. forces that faced an onslaught of dozens of strikes from Iranian-backed militias.

“We’ve been able to defend ourselves we’ve been able to strike at a time a place of our choosing” Brown said. “I think we sent back in February a pretty strong message. It’s been 90 days since the last time our forces have been attacked. We take force protection very seriously.”

The response in February included dozens of airstrikes against Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and Iranian-aligned groups in Iraq and Syria in retaliation after a drone strike killed three American service members in Jordan."

He worked in construction taught high school worked at a high tech company on a student salary at a small Silicon Valley-startup and somehow crammed in two university degrees including a PhD at the University of Oxford. He faced obstacles challenges and discrimination along the way but worked relentlessly to prove himself and climb the ladder. “Everyone can achieve 80% output but to get to 98% is very challenging. Throughout my entire career I always strived to be above average do more than is expected” he said.

He was born in the northern Arab village of Rameh in the Upper Galilee region to a farmer father and a homemaker mother the seventh out of eight brothers and sisters to a Christian-Arab refugee family who were exiled from their village in 1948. “In high school I excelled in math and science and my family wanted me to study conventional subjects like medicine law or civil engineering. It was unthinkable for someone like myself to dream of computers in the early 1980s” he said. In his high school there weren’t any high-level math courses and Hanna taught himself the material and was one of the first Israeli-Arab students to complete a high-level math program. “The first obstacle was choosing a track. It was challenging to choose an unconventional one since people in the Arab community take fewer risks. There isn’t any financial flexibility so you don’t have time to fantasize. You need to study something promising which will enable you to provide for your family but I chose a non-conventional path.”

After high school Hanna worked as a construction worker for a year and a half until he began his bachelor’s degree studies in mathematics and computer science at Tel Aviv University. After his graduation he struggled to find work in his field and returned to Rameh to teach high school students for three years. He established a computer science track and simultaneously worked on taking additional computer science courses. “I would walk around with a laptop having saved up a lot of money from working in construction to buy it. Other people from the village who purchased a laptop would come to me for lessons on how to use it” he said.

When he was a student at Tel Aviv University he signed up for a job fair and was even invited for an interview with a prominent high tech company but when he arrived they wouldn’t allow him into the lobby and claimed it was a mistake. “I didn’t break down. People warned me it would be difficult and it became clear that the company didn’t hire me because of prejudice” he said. After three years as a high school teacher he was hired by a software company Sader Computers Ltd. to teach Arabic. Four years after completing his degree Hanna tried his luck once again at a job fair at the Technion Institute of Technology and began working at Intel in a student position while working on his master’s degree in computer science at TAU.

“Getting accepted to work at Intel Corp. was a turning point for me. It’s a multinational company with a strong corporate culture of diversity and inclusion and is a company that works according to international practices and is very inclusive. When I joined Intel it even made it into one of the newspapers. I was there along with five other Israeli-Arabs. On Orientation Day we arrived at a hotel and went inside to eat lunch and I sat at a table with my other Arab friends. The waiters thought we were bus drivers it didn’t even occur to them that we were engineers at Intel” he said. He was quickly promoted at Intel in both the managerial and professional tracks. He was twice a recipient of the professional Intel Achievement Award for his technological achievements. “When you’re by yourself at a company in order to be accepted you must excel and not just be ordinary. It isn’t enough to be mediocre. The challenge is constantly to be better than everyone else and I did everything I was asked to. At Intel people would be promoted either through the professional track or the managerial track I had to do both. Making that transition was a constant challenge that accompanied me for a long time.”

During his 17 years at Intel Hanna completed his master’s degree in computer science served in a variety of senior positions and was sent overseas to work out of its Silicon Valley offices in California. He was promoted to Senior Principal Engineer and Formal Verification Group Leader in software development for chip design and testing then began his doctorate at Oxford in 2007 and decided to leave Intel and join a small unknown startup Jasper Design Automation. “I left Intel when I was at my peak and it was a hard decision” he said. My daughters were in school at the time and I thought that if I stayed at Intel I might receive a higher position but I wanted to see the world and develop technologies that would be used all over the world. My team at the time was like an upscale restaurant in a hotel but I wanted people to come for the restaurant not because of the hotel’s name. It was a business that I took a significant part in in both leading the business and technological ends and I took a calculated risk. I didn’t do it early on in my career I waited until I was financially and socially stable more mature and it was the right time to make my dreams come true and do something really big. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the support of my family. My wife pushed me she sacrificed her studies and suffered with me during our relocation but she said I would succeed and I did” he said.

At Jasper Hanna was appointed the Senior Vice President of R&D as well as VP of Research and Chief Architect and after three years returned to Israel to establish his company at the Matam High Tech Park complex in Haifa. “Many eyebrows were raised since we were a startup who was renting an expensive space. I told everyone that if we wanted to make it big we needed to play with the big guys and the site became the company’s main area of operations” he said.

In 2014 four years after he established Jasper’s Israeli branch the company was acquired by U.S.-company Cadence Design Systems for $170 million and Hanna became Jasper’s manager within the U.S. corporation. Three years later Hanna was appointed visiting professor at Oxford and in 2019 was appointed Corporate Vice President of Cadence’s R&D center in Israel in addition to his position as senior VP at the international corporation which leads new technology systems in software development.

Cadence Design Systems is an international company that deals with electronic design develops and provides software hardware and IP solutions to chip and system manufacturers. It employs 10000 people worldwide and in 2020 Fortune Magazine named Cadence as one of its ""100 Best Companies to Work For list"" for the sixth year in a row. In Israel the company has two locations its R&D and sales centers in Haifa and Petach Tikva where Hanna leads the company’s development activities and Adar Segal leads the business operations. In Israel the company employs over 300 people with 60 in Haifa and some 50% of them hailing from the Arab community. Some 33% of its workers are women which is considered to be a very high ratio for a tech company.

""When I began working in tech I was one of the only members of the Arab community but today there are over 8000 Arab engineers in the Israeli tech sector it’s an expanding community. Since I came from a community that was exiled from its home I experienced poverty and suffering so I always had an internal push to give back to my community and empower it. I give lectures on a variety of topics so that the Israeli public can be more inclusive of one another and move forward together. We are all dependent on one another. High tech unites the world there isn’t an ‘Indian’ or ‘Jewish’ stereotype of high tech workers it’s universal. Things are constantly changing and the Arab community’s weight in this sector is growing. In order to overcome obstacles one needs to learn and cooperate. You need a well-rounded personality. High tech is a lifestyle defined by leadership innovation a business vision a technological vision and efficient planning - there are several skills that one must develop to succeed” he said.

As part of his social activities Hanna was appointed the co-chair of Tsofen a public council for promoting the Arab community in the Israeli tech sector along with David “Dedi” Perlmutter. “It’s not just a duty but an honor to promote and support the Arab community in high tech. I am one of the first Arabs to enter this field. When I completed my bachelor’s degree I couldn’t find work but helped many people in the village learn to code or how to use a computer. When I was an Intel I was heavily involved in recruiting additional Arab employees and gave lectures at schools to encourage people to reach out to this sector. My first Tsofen meeting took place at Intel and I helped set it up. Over the years I participated in many activities for students aimed at promoting the Arab sector in high tech” he said.

The third pillar of Hanna’s career was in academia. He spoke of how he always wanted to earn the title of “doctor” but not a medical one and during his work at Intel he was very attached to academia. “At Intel I was responsible for the academic pipeline in Israel and I had connections with many advisers and researchers. I was also responsible for Intel’s annual conference at the Technion where its innovative technologies are presented and during that time a professor at Oxford invited me to pursue my PhD in England. I decided to go for it and began my doctorate in 2005.” Two years after he began his studies Hanna left Intel while still working on his PhD and relocated to the U.S. “I would wake up every day at 4 a.m. work on my doctorate until 8 a.m. and then begin my work day as Technology VP at Jasper. My academic work continued and four years ago I was invited to be a visiting-professor at Oxford specializing in computer science in subjects such as systems design and verification and machine learning” he said.

Hanna’s ambition his hard work and the need to prove himself is embodied in every single step he took over the course of his career. He published articles registered patents and gave lectures at leading worldwide conferences in his field. The secret to his efficiency he revealed is the ability to do many things at once with complete concentration. “There are only 24 hours in a day and for everyone the question is how do you manage that. I work on many things simultaneously and I have a strong ability to zoom in and zoom out to make that direction change and it really helps me in everything I do.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s like the week before Christmas for a tot who can’t wait to open presents.

In this case the present is a return to normal life in Southern Nevada and the sparkling wrapped gifts are the promises that things are going to get better sooner rather than later.

This is what pent-up demand looks like.

The evidence is all around with some indicators on the near horizon and some a little further away.

Trends hinting at Las Vegas’ return have been mounting over the past few weeks as COVID-19 case numbers fell.

Encouraging trends

Experts say the availability of vaccines should help make more Americans comfortable returning to destinations like Las Vegas.

“As more and more people are vaccinated more and more people are going to feel comfortable traveling and feel comfortable in crowds” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

The change of heart comes just after the travel industry’s U.S. economic output was estimated to have lost $1.1 trillion in 2020 according to a recent report from the U.S. Travel Association.

But many people — including those who have not yet been vaccinated — view the dropping COVID-19 case numbers as a green light to travel again. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still advising Americans to delay their vacation plans but tourism experts say many have a desire to travel that outweighs concerns about catching the virus.

“Everything is going in a better direction and there’s a lot of pent-up demand” said Debi Nutton a gaming consultant and former Wynn Resorts Ltd. executive.

Higher room rates

And as more visitors fill Las Vegas’ resorts the city is starting to return to some sense of normalcy.

Room rates shot up over the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament. Hotel rooms at Palazzo Linq and Planet Hollywood are available seven days a week again. Buffets and dayclubs — two major taboos at the height of the pandemic — are returning albeit with amended operations. Fans are back at Golden Knights games again. Nearly 40 shows are performing on the Strip.

The list goes on.

Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority President and CEO Steve Hill said the problem many entertainment venues are facing now is that to maintain social distancing crowds are greatly reduced and many shows including Cirque du Soleil performances need a full house to be profitable.

“Elimination of social distancing will be key to filling entertainment venues” Hill said.

“We think as we head into summer the opportunity to open up attendance to 100 percent should be there with the caveats that we want to make sure we don’t have some completely left turn with a variant and obviously in order for that to take place the vaccine rollout needs to continue with at least the pace we’re at now.”

Gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization said all of the trends that have been building up over the past few weeks are a sign that Las Vegas is on track to return to its former glory.

“In their own small individual way (these indicators) lead to a slow thoughtful building up of momentum and return to people actually coming to Las Vegas to enjoy themselves in greater numbers” he said.

“(These are signs) that point toward Vegas getting a little bit closer to what Vegas was in terms of America’s favorite place to come and enjoy yourself.”

Greater capacity

Loosened restrictions have helped open the doors for returning visitors. Restaurants and casino floors are allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity up from 25 percent a few weeks back and certain large gatherings that had been capped at 20 percent can fill up to half of their capacity.

“With Gov. Sisolak’s loosening of the capacity restrictions I think that has made (casino) companies even more confident that the recovery will continue” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

He added that even though booking windows are still short “Strip operators are just becoming more enthused about what the summer could look like.”

The positive trends seem to have come at an opportune moment. The tourist corridor’s newest property Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is set to open next week pool season is kicking off at resorts across the valley and the city is potentially just months away from seeing major conventions return.

“I think the COVID-related news has been positive of late and people are starting to travel again” said Nehme Abouzeid founder and president of marketing consultancy LaunchVegas LLC.

“My friends in entertainment tell me advance tickets are selling well” Abouzeid said. “The warm weather is arriving and the pools here look inviting. Quite rightly Vegas never stopped marketing itself to the world since we knew that while COVID was going to be serious and protracted it would still be a relative blip and that our core industry would have to find a way back. People still longed to come here — nothing went wrong structurally with consumer demand for Vegas; they were simply responding to the pandemic.”

The sense of optimism surrounding Las Vegas tourism is refreshing but experts warn that the city still faces a long road to recovery with possible bumps along the way.

For one weekday visitation is still struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels. Strip occupancies today hover between 70 and 90 percent but midweek rooms are typically only 40 to 60 percent full.

Those numbers aren’t expected to fully bounce back until the city sees the return of international visitors and meetings and convention bookings.

Truist gaming analyst Barry Jonas said in-person conventions are expected to return this summer but he expects a “more lagged” recovery for midweek business travel relative to the weekend leisure travel.

“We’re certainly starting to see a return of Las Vegas tourism” Jonas said but “the improvements are more pronounced on the weekends.”

Threat from variants

Another surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases could impede recovery. Some health experts worry about yet another spike in cases as variants of the virus continue to spread across the country.

That could lead to resorts facing strict operating restrictions again.

“While we are thankful that the destination is bouncing back well we need to be mindful that one slip in the numbers could reverse the trend as we saw last November when the governor imposed the cut in capacity” said Brendan Bussmann of Global Market Advisors.

The rapidly changing numbers in both reduced cases and vaccinations has resulted in some organizations having to speed up their plans to accommodate the pent-up demand.

Hill told a Nevada Commission on Tourism recovery subcommittee Thursday that the LVCVA and its advertising consultant R&R Partners is considering bumping up a paid advertising and marketing campaign to attract leisure travelers.

“We will evolve to telling our own message again … the governor’s decision to open up vaccinations to everyone on April 5 is also a signal for us to speed up from what we intended to do toward the end of April probably to the middle of April” Hill said.

“The trends on the leisure side have followed the health numbers almost exactly. As things have gotten better the interest in travel and the bookings we are seeing both now and in the future are really good showing a lot of improvement” he said.

There are other indications some of the long-term indications are looking good.

The Life is Beautiful music and arts festival scheduled for downtown Las Vegas Sept. 17-19 sold out 50000 passes in record time hours after they first went on sale.

World of Concrete approved

Organizers of the World of Concrete a major citywide convention that routinely draws 60000 people to Southern Nevada announced Wednesday that they had received permission from the Nevada Department of Business and Industry to stage their show from June 8-10 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Hill and other tourism leaders in the state had pointed to World of Concrete as the likely first major show to return to the trade show fold.

“The entire industry was watching to see if the World of Concrete could happen” Hill said. “The fact that it did has resulted in three shows approved in the last 24 hours following that.

“This will be the first major show to take place across the United States” he said. “Even though other states have been open to doing it those shows have not been able to move forward because of the health situation and getting exhibitors to commit to come and attendees to attend regardless of what the states’ protocols or rules were those major shows have not happened.”

And conventions can also be important to leisure travel.

“I think people are desperate to get out of their houses and go anywhere” said Pam Robinson chairwoman of the Commission on Tourism’s recovery subcommittee. “When people come for conventions they often add a day to their trips.”

Conventions and trade shows are big drivers of tourism for Southern Nevada. Executives for nearly every publicly traded Las Vegas-based company that have convention facilities — MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Inc. Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. among them — remarked during their fourth-quarter earnings calls how strong their convention calendars are looking for late 2021 2022 and 2023.

“We’ve been wandering in the abyss for almost a year now … and you can clearly see the light shining through at this point in Las Vegas” Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said during a February call with investors.

“We feel very good that we’ve seen the bottom in Vegas and in the business and that we’re only going to keep getting better.”

Anticipating eventual high demand the LVCVA tended to its convention infrastructure.

The organization months ago committed to having its new $987.1 million West Hall and its $52.5 million underground people-mover completed in time for the 2021 CES show. When the Consumer Technology Association operators of CES announced in July that it was canceling an in-person show the LVCVA went ahead and completed construction.

Trade shows that had been canceled or postponed began scrambling for available dates to stage their shows.

The LVCVA also moved ahead with its plan to purchase the Las Vegas Monorail Co. out of bankruptcy. Hill said the 3.9-mile elevated electric transit system is critical to moving conventioneers to shows when they return. As a result the LVCVA expects the monorail to resume operations around the Memorial Day weekend.

What could go wrong

While the Las Vegas reawakening shows blue skies in most areas there are still some reasons to doubt everything will go smoothly and many questions remain unanswered.

Clark County officials are hopeful that between 60 percent and 70 percent of its residents will get their vaccinations by the end of May. What if they don’t? What happens if the COVID-19 variants spread and the public has doubts that any vaccination would be effective?

Worse what if vaccinations aren’t effective against newly discovered variants?

While tourism leaders are confident that conventions and trade shows will come back strong what will attendance look like? Will a show that normally draws 50000 people see only 25000?

That’s one of the worries for shows that typically attract an international audience like CES. While Nevada and the United States are on track for more visitation there isn’t much they can do about travelers from Europe Asia and even Canada.

Nevertheless experts are optimistic for Las Vegas’ future.

“We don’t know what’s going to happen. … We may see some stops and starts” UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said. But “I think this is the beginning of a long-term recovery.”

Bussmann concurs.

“As long as this trend continues it bodes well for the long term recovery that will include the business and MICE (meetings incentives conferencing and exhibitions) customer coming back to Las Vegas” he said. “With World of Concrete set for June let’s hope the trend continues to allow this event to come off what has historically been one of the largest gaming shows in the destination. Assuming this happens and we have no set back it could make for a nice third and fourth quarter of bringing business back to Las Vegas.”

Encouraging numbers

The seven-day average for new cases reported in the U.S. was 53200 as of Friday according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a sharp decline from the seven-day average peak of 249389 in January.

The drop comes as more Americans are getting shots in arms; as of Friday about 16 percent of U.S. adults had been fully vaccinated.

The vaccination rate is expected to build as more age groups become eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Starting April 5 anyone 16 and over in Nevada will be able to get their shots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nLzI1MWstdGFibGUtZ2FtZS1qYWNrcG90LWhpdHMtaW4tbGFrZS10YWhvZS0yMzEwMTM3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$251K jackpot hits in Lake Tahoe; Multiple wins in Las Vegas | Casinos & Gaming | Business,"The lucky guest who chose to remain anonymous hit a straight flush on the first hand dealt.

STORYLINES

Bertans to miss approximately two weeks with calf strain

The Wizards will take the court Sunday night without Davis Bertans who is expected to miss approximately two weeks with a right calf strain. Bertans suffered the injury against the Jazz on Thursday night left the game in the first quarter and did not return. Bertans is averaging 10.8 points per game on 38.2% from three this season and had hit multiple 3-pointers in 21 of his last 22 games excluding Thursday’s game against the Jazz in which he played just four minutes.

As a team the Wizards are relying less on threes as the season progresses. The percent of field goal attempts taken from 3-point range has declined from 36.9% in January to 35.7% in February and now down to 33.2% through eight games in March. On Thursday the Wizards shot 7-17 (.412) from deep becoming just the second team since the start of the 2019-20 season to score 130-plus points in a game while making seven or fewer 3-pointers (regulation only). Washington scoring without relying on high-volume 3-point shooting could be key to staying afloat with Bertans out of the lineup.

“We’re definitely going to miss his shooting” Wizards head coach Scott Brooks said after practice on Saturday. “Even when he doesn’t shoot the ball he draws a lot of attention. We can do a lot of stuff – other guys can get opportunity when he’s in the game. But next man up. (Isaac) Bonga is going to get some opportunities and there might be another guy or two that has to be ready.

Wizards and Nets renew wild season series

Sunday night’s game will mark the third and final matchup of the season between the Nets and Wizards and the latest installment of what has been one of the most entertaining series across the league this year. Washington has won both prior matchups but by only four combined points.

In their first meeting the Wizards topped the Nets 123-122 on a game-winning dunk from Thomas Bryant with 14.9 seconds left on the clock. Both Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving had looks on the other end but the Wizards held on. Bradley Beal finished with 27 points and 10 rebounds while Russell Westbrook totaled 24 points and 10 assists including 13 points in a fourth quarter that featured 12 lead changes and five ties. That back-and-forth affair however had nothing on the teams’ second meeting of the season.

On January 31 Washington and Brooklyn played in what is the still highest-scoring game in the NBA this season. With the Wizards down 146-141 with eight seconds left Beal rushed down the court and converted on a pull-up three to cut the lead to two. Garrison Mathews stole the ensuing inbounds pass and quickly found Westbrook who knocked down the game-winner 3-pointer with just 4.3 seconds left in the game giving Washington an improbable 149-146 win. According to ESPN Stats & Info in the last 25 years Washington’s comeback marked just the ninth time in 23507 chances that a team has come back to win from a five-point deficit in the final 10 seconds of a game. Just as they did on Thursday against the Jazz Beal and Westbrook combined for 78 points including 37 points in the fourth quarter.

That's the three-letter word that my family repeatedly said over and over again during our two-night stay at the Omni Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods. Built in 1902 this hotel boasts not only history but also luxury. And with a massive two-year expansion just completed you truly will never want to leave.

We are a ski family and since this hotel is across the street from the family-friendly Bretton Woods mountain — which is also owned by the hotel — we opted to visit during the winter months. But for non-skiers or those looking for a retreat other times of year this hotel offers something for every New England season.

Based in New Hampshire it is the perfect driving getaway for anyone that lives in the Northeast or a 1.45 to 2.5-hour drive from three different airports: Manchester NH (MHT) Portland ME (PWM) and Boston MA (BOS).

The Omni Mount Washington Resort is truly a bucket list hotel — whether you are traveling with your family as a couple or with a group of friends. Its character is unlike any hotel I've seen before and every design and decor has a historical meaning. The hotel dates back to 1902 and was built by Joseph Stickney who spared no expense. Back then about 50 trains a day would arrive in Bretton Woods bringing visitors from Boston New York and Philadelphia. The hotel — and surrounding hotels which are no longer standing — were a summer retreat for the wealthy who would explore the area by horse and carriage. Over the past century the hotel has hosted three U.S. presidents and even Thomas Edison — among many other notable guests.

Today the character from the early 1900s still exists throughout the hotel — with turn-of-the-century decor and high ceilings. Walking around the hotel is an activity in itself — especially for history buffs. With many rooms and spaces you can get lost in the hotel — admiring the charm — for quite some time. The hotel was created for relaxation so on top of the meeting rooms and many restaurants you'll also find many quaint areas to plop down on a chair and admire your surroundings — both inside and outside. The Cave is also a space you can't miss (although currently closed) an old Speakeasy from the prohibition days.

The hotel just recently went through a massive expansion where they added 69 new luxury rooms and suites as well as more meeting space and outdoor verandas. Part of the expansion was also the addition of the Rosebrook Lodge which is at the top of the mountain at Bretton Woods.

The rooms

With the recent expansion of the property you can now book a room in the newer Presidential Wing or one of the older historical rooms — the property offers 269 different rooms in total. We stayed in one of their deluxe rooms on the original side of the property and thought it was absolutely perfect for my family of four — especially since we weren't in the room much. We also loved that rollaway beds are allowed in the deluxe rooms which gave us more space for sleeping.

If you prefer to stay in the more modern Presidential Wing rooms are approximately $50 to $100 more than the historic rooms — for a similar size type. Many of these rooms do offer a balcony so if that is something that's important to you you'll want to consider one of these.

I was able to take a sneak peek at one of the suites in the Presidential Wing and if you have the budget for it I must admit that they are luxurious. The 1000 ft. square feet rooms are extremely elegant with the same historic — but modern-day — charm.

Or if you are looking for a quaint inn you can also opt to stay at the Bretton Woods Arm Inn at Mount Washington. This 34 room property is on the same grounds as the larger Mount Washington Resort giving you the same access to all the amenities and activities the resort has to offer. The benefit: Room prices are slightly less expensive. The (slight) disadvantage: It's about a 5-minute walk outside to get to the main resort.

Of course this upscale hotel comes with a high price tag but if you can go during shoulder season — April or November — you'll possibly be able to find a discounted rate. And since this is an Omni hotel if you are a frequent Omni guest and part of their loyalty program you can always redeem one of your earned free night awards for a stay at this property.

Activities

With freezing temperatures on our first day while at the hotel our time on the mountain didn't last long. Fortunately though we were able to keep ourselves fully occupied with the many activities inside the hotel.

From the moment we arrived our kids begged to go to the arcade so that was our first stop after we took off our ski boots. The arcade is small but the perfect size for entertainment without breaking the bank. Games cost 50 cents apiece and with $5 in hand we were able to get a solid 30-minute of playtime.

Next stop was the toy shop. While I wouldn't usually put this on an activities list what made it unique is that they have a Build-a-Bear-style set up where kids can stuff their own furry friend. Although slightly gimmicky it's a favorite of the kids and is definitely a cute souvenir to bring home.

We then made our way to the outdoor fire pits which have a fire going during the evening hours. With massive grounds there are multiple fire pit areas — perfect for a single family or a large group. In the shop at the hotel you can purchase a s'more making kit as well. On a winter evening there truly is nothing better than sitting out by the fire roasting marshmallows. Hint: Stop by the bar beforehand to grab a hot chocolate to go.

During a normal year — without a pandemic — the hotel also offers many kid-friendly programs. While we didn't get to experience these activities during our stay at other times there's everything from arts and crafts and storytelling to lawn games and a family movie night. There are even ""camp"" programs which are supervised activities to give mom and dad some time to themselves — or a trip to the 25000 square foot spa.

The pools: inside and outdoors

Of course my kid's favorite post-skiing activity was to relax in the pool. If you want to take a dip in the pool you have two options: an outdoor heated pool — yes it is open even during the winter months — or an indoor pool with a hot tub. During the summer months there's also a kids pool right nearby the outside heated pool.

We personally loved the option of the outdoor heated pool. Swimming outside with the snow-capped mountains in the background is quite unique. We also felt that this was the ""safer"" option due to social distancing. The outdoor pool area is also brand new as part of their recent expansion project.

Onsite activities

While the winter and summer months (through Columbus Day weekend) are the two most popular times of year to visit this property you'll find activities all year round. With many more activities available than listed below here is just a sample of ways to spend your day:

Winter activities

Even if you don't ski or snowboard there are plenty of opportunities to play in the snow here in the winter.

Tubing

Right outside of the hotel near the Nordic Center you'll find a single-lane tubing hill. Rent a tube — $12 for the hour although no one is actually clocking your one-hour time — and spin your way down the hill. Although there's nothing fancy about the tubing center — no magic carpet to take you to the top or multi-lanes to race against a family member — my kids had an absolute blast. Just make sure to make reservations in advance as time slots do sell out fairly early.

Winter fat tire bikes

Also located at the Nordic Center you can rent front suspension Fat Tire bikes — available in both adult and children sizes -- to peddle across snow-covered trails. While we didn't check out this activity since my 4-year old can't ride a bike just yet we did see many families enjoying the trails. Bikes can be rented for the full day half day or just for a two-hour time period.

Kids snowmobile park

I've heard a lot of hype about the kids' snowmobile park at Bretton Woods but unfortunately due to COVID this year the park was closed. Fingers crossed however for this activity to be back in action for the 2021-2022 season — I can't wait for my kids to try it out on a return visit.

Sleigh rides

Go back in time and experience how guests used to arrive at the resort in the past. You can even select from a one-horse or two-horse drawn sleigh.

Nordic skiing and snowshoeing

If you are looking to try out something other than Alpine skiing Bretton Woods offers 1770 acres of Nordic trails — just a stone's throw away from the resort. At the Nordic Center you can rent nordic skis (or snowshoes) and even sign up for lessons.

Spring/summer/fall activities

Although we visited during the winter the Mount Washington hotel is extremely popular in the warmer months. With many outdoor activities and hikes there's plenty to do during the spring summer and fall.

Canopy tour

If you are looking for some adventure this canopy tour offers nine ziplines two sky bridges and three rappels. You'll start at the top of Rosebrook Canyon making your way down to the base of Bretton Woods. This is a three-hour tour where you'll be able to see the beautiful White Mountains in the background. Although the canopy tour is not starting up again until April 2021 this activity typically runs 12-months a year.

Gondola rides

In Dec. 2020 Bretton Woods completed construction on the beautiful Rosebrook Lodge which offers unbelievable views of Mount Washington. With the 8-passenger gondola you can take the scenic ride up to the top of the mountain to enjoy the lodge and experience the scenery. The two-story lodge also offers outdoor seating which reminded me of skiing out West.

Gondola rides are available 12 months a year — even in the winter months without needing ski boots strapped on.

Mountain climbing

Want to go mountain climbing? The hotel offers guided rock climbing tours for kids and adults. You'll take the chairlift up the mountain and start your climb on the West Mountain peak of Bretton Woods. This is a three-hour tour and there are routes for every ability (even if you've never rock climbed before).

However if you'd prefer something a tad simpler there's a climbing wall inside the base lodge at the mountain. While this is currently closed due to COVID I was able to see the space myself and it looked pretty cool — especially since you can climb 365-days a year (when it's open). An incredibly fun activity even while you are taking a mid-day break from skiing.

Disk golf

Instead of playing traditional golf — there's a golf course at Bretton Woods — play nine-holes of disc golf a perfect family activity — even with young kids.

Mountain biking

For mountain bikers you have two choices: take your bike up the lift for an alpine route or start right near the hotel on the cross-country trail. Bike rentals are available as well.

There's even a brand new pump track to rip around some dirt.

Bretton Woods ski resort

With 464 skiable acres — including 62 trails 35 glades and three terrain parks— Bretton Woods is the largest ski resort in all of New Hampshire. It offers a true upscale resort feel — similar to what you might receive while skiing out West — with breathtaking views of Mount Washington. Bretton Woods is one of those unique East Coast mountains that offers a few mid-mountain lift options which allows you to stay away from the base of the mountain as much as possible. This is helpful in managing crowds although due to social distancing rules this year where just one party is allowed on each lift or gondola ride we experienced a decent wait in the lift lines on Saturday of our trip. Fortunately though the next day (Sunday) we experienced no wait to get on the lifts even though it was the better ski day. This has unfortunately been quite common this year at most mountains due to not being able to fill each chair.

A huge perk of Bretton Woods is that there's terrain for every skill level from the top of the mountain. Once you've passed the magic carpet ride there's no need to stick to the beginner section of the mountain since there are long-wide green's from the top. This allowed my entire family — including my 4- and 7-year old -- to take the 8-passenger gondola to the top of the mountain and find trails that allowed us all to ski down together.

From the top you'll also find long windy trails which allows you more time skiing and less time on the lift. With great snow and minimal wind it's an East Coast ski destination that has a little something for any skier/rider.

Bottom line

My family has skied at many resorts in the Northeast (and out West) and this is by far one of our favorite family-friendly ski resorts in driving distance. The Mount Washington Hotel experience combined with some skiing at Bretton Woods (or any of the other many activities) is a fantastic getaway for folks that are visiting the Northeast or want to do a weekend away. The combination of a historic hotel modern amenities outdoor activities and breathtaking views of Mount Washington offer a little something for everyone here young and old and the fun is all accessible without the need of a car once on site. As far as getaways go this is one worth embracing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9sZWFndWVzL2NvbGxlZ2Utc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvbWFyY2gtbWFkbmVzcy1kYWlseS1pbmRleGluZy0xMjM0NjI1MzEyL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9sZWFndWVzL2NvbGxlZ2Utc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvbWFyY2gtbWFkbmVzcy1kYWlseS1pbmRleGluZy0xMjM0NjI1MzEyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,March Madness Daily: Indexing the NCAA’s Corporate Sponsors,"Despite increasing signs of the NCAA’s unpopularity within the halls of government and the corridors of social media the Indianapolis-based organization that regulates major college sports is still attractive to some titans of industry. Currently the association boasts corporate partnerships and sponsorships with 19 different companies—17 of which are publicly traded and comprise a total market cap of $1.86 trillion.

These NCAA sponsors include Wall Street giants like AT&T—an NCAA title sponsor and the parent company of Turner Sports which shares broadcast rights of March Madness with CBS—and General Motors the owner of Buick the association’s “official SUV.”

This week a group of prominent college sports reform organizations united under the banner of “The Coalition for College Athlete’s Advocacy” issued a call for a social media boycott of the NCAA’s sponsors after none responded to questions about “the injustices that permeate the college sports ecosystem.”

As of late Saturday a Change.org petition launched by the group was still looking for its 500th signature.

Politics aside Sportico looked at how a balanced portfolio of the NCAA’s publicly traded sponsors would have fared since official NCAA sponsor UBER started trading on the NYSE in May 2019 trying to answer another NCAA sponsor’s (Capital One) eternal question: What’s in your wallet?

The answer: Returns are fairly mediocre it turns out. While the S&P 500 has risen 34.1% during this period our index of these 17 NCAA sponsors only grew 22.4%.

Sportico will be publishing one short business highlight every weekday (and on some weekend days) during the three-week NCAA tournament.

The Rostock Germany-based cruise line plans to sail with the AIDAperla to the Canary Islands starting March 20 which will be the first ship sailing that week.

Although this is a delay from March 6 due to the restrictions from the lockdown that has paralyzed daily life in Germany with 90% of the guests from Germany the line had little choice.

The German cruise line has now scheduled four ships to be sailing in European water in the week following March 20 in an all-out effort to have ships sailing as soon as possible:

AIDAperla: The 3286 passengers 125572 GT AIDAperla will be sailing on March 20 on a voyage from Gran Canaria towards Madeira Tenerife Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.

The 3286 passengers 125572 GT AIDAperla will be sailing on March 20 on a voyage from Gran Canaria towards Madeira Tenerife Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. AIDAstella: The 2700 passengers 71304 GT AIDAstella will sail on March 20 on an 8-day voyage from Mallorca calling into Rome Livorno two days in Marseille Barcelona before returning to Mallorca.

AIDA- Lots of Planning- Not Many Cruises

AIDA Cruises has been planning and scheduling cruises since the beginning of the pandemic. The cruise line has been unlucky at best since the start of the pandemic. The line first interrupted the cruise season last year in mid-march.

Scheduled alternative cruises to the Baltic with sea days only could not be done while the cruise line had to stop an entire cruise program in Italy due to the lockdowns in Italy and Germany. Last but not least the cruise line was caught up in a massive cyberattack at the end of December.

The cruise line had to cancel its scheduled New Year Eve trips onboard the AIDAperla and the AIDAmar both in the Canary Islands while the head office in Rostock was also affected as even the phone lines were down.

The hope is therefore that the cruise line could now proceed with all the scheduled voyages. It would be a big deal not just for AIDA and Carnival Corporation but for the entire cruise industry.

It would mean a vast improvement over where the industry stands now. It would also send a clear signal to the cruise industry if all goes well.

Here's What You Need to Know: The 1984 collision was far from being the only incident.

It was common throughout the Cold War for NATO and Soviet submarines to stalk surface ships and other submarines in order to gather intelligence and work out tactics for sinking the vessels in the event the conflict escalated into a shooting war.

More than once these undersea stalkings went awry. Collisions damaged ships and subs on both sides. In 1984 the Soviet Victor-class attack submarine Petropavlovsk struck the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk.

The New York Times covered the March 21 1984 collision. “Naval officers said the Kitty Hawk which carries 85 planes was in the Sea of Japan about 150 miles east of South Korea in joint naval exercises with South Korean forces” the Times reported.

From the Times:

They said the carrier which was steaming at 15 knots with its navigation lights on knew that a submarine had been shadowing the ship. ''They play cat and mouse with us all the time'' said one officer. Others said that Soviet submarines appear to test American antisubmarine devices. Reports from the Kitty Kawk said sailors had felt a shudder apparently as the submarine rose to the surface and struck a glancing blow. Initial reports said the submarine was not running with navigation lights as required by international rules. A submarine must give way to a surface vessel when surfacing and is obliged to follow those rules when on the surface.

Wire-service UPI explained that the carrier accompanied by eight escorts “apparently ran over the stern of the submarine as it was surfacing.”

“A submarine's sonar is blind at its stern because of the sound of its own engines and Pentagon officials indicated the Soviet boat's skipper was unaware of the presence of the carrier when he attempted to surface.”

Capt. David Rogers Kitty Hawk’s skipper was on the bridge at the time of the collision and felt a “noticeable shudder a fairly violent shudder” according to the U.S. Navy’s official website.

As the Navy described it:

He and the starboard lookout saw the outline of the sub’s sail moving away from Kitty Hawk the sub failing to display navigation lights. Aircraft Nos. 615 and 616 SH-3Hs [from squadron HS-2] inspected the unlit submarine via AN/PVS-5A night-vision goggles and sonobuoys without noting serious damage. Kitty Hawk and her screen stood by to render assistance–the carrier stopping–attempting to contact cruiser Petropavlovsk the Soviet task force flagship by flashing light. Petropavlovsk did not respond however and the sub remained (apparently) seaworthy. Rear Adm. Richard M. Dunleavy Director Carrier and Air Stations Program later noted that during the previous three days the sub was detected by helos launched from Battle Group Bravo “and killed more than 15 times” the Victor I initially being sighted on the surface 50 nautical miles ahead of the carrier’s intended course before submerging on [May 19 1984]. Responsibility for the collision lay with the Russians who placed themselves “in a very hazardous position.” “The reason behind the Soviet submarine captain’s slip in judgment is the only mystery here” reflected Rear Adm. James D. Watkins [chief of naval operations]. “He showed uncharacteristically poor seamanship in not staying clear of Kitty Hawk. That should cause concern in Moscow.”

“The naval officers said there was no evidence of nuclear leakage from the submarine” the Times continued. “Naval officers said the Kitty Hawk had received only a superficial dent and had resumed maneuvers.”

“The Sea of Japan has long been the scene of near-collisions and collisions” the newspaper added. “In the late 1960s Soviet destroyers frequently sailed close to American ships and occasionally collided.”

The Kitty Hawk scrape wasn’t the most serious collision involving a submarine during the Cold War. Ten years earlier in 1974 a Soviet attack submarine struck the U.S. Navy ballistic-missile sub James Madison while both nuclear-powered vessels were submerged off the Scotland coast.

Kate Hudson from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament told The Guardian that the 1974 incident which became public only in 2017 exposed the “enormous risks” of nuclear weapons. “The history of nuclear weapons is a history of near misses accidents potential catastrophes and cover-ups.”

TASS news agency reports that the general director of the shipyard in Murmansk was arrested in connection with the embezzlement of funds during the repair of the aircraft-carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov.

""He was arrested for two months by the decision of the Oktyabrsky District Court of the city of Murmansk"" the source said.

Earlier a law enforcement source said that about ten searches were carried out in the joint-stock company ""10 Order of the Red Banner of Labor Shipyard"" as well as at the places of residence of a number of its senior employees. The reason was the criminal case opened against the general director of the enterprise who is suspected of embezzling about 45 million rubles allocated for the repair of the Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov cruiser.

In recent years Russia has been investing heavily in upgrading its navy. The heavy aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov is the largest ship and the only aircraft carrier of the Russian Navy. It is part of the Northern Fleet and can carry 26 aircraft and 24 helicopters on the flight deck and in the under-deck hangar. It has been used regularly by Russia for power projection in the Mediterranean and other parts of the world. Technical problems with the ship have however also sometimes caused some embarrassing moments.

Named after a former head of the Soviet navy the Admiral Kuznetsov has been plagued by years of technical problems and is often seen belching smoke. Media reports in the past suggested that the vessel's steam turbines and turbo-pressurised boilers have been reported to be so unreliable that the carrier is accompanied by a large ocean-going tug whenever it deploys in case it breaks down. There are also flaws in the water piping system which causes it to freeze during winter. To prevent pipes bursting the water is turned off to most of the cabins and half the latrines do not work.

It seems however that even when it is under repair the troubles of the Admiral Kuznetsov are not over.

Advanced systems and designs developed by the “carrier alliance” of Babcock BAE Systems and Thales to deliver the UK’s two Queen Elizabeth-class vessels could be exported to the north-east Asian nation as the UK steps up efforts to reap the financial benefits of constructing the 65000-tonne ships. The two ships will cost taxpayers about £6.5bn.

Industry sources said officials from the Department for International Trade have begun informal discussions with Korean counterparts about areas of technology the country could be interested in. Any deal would have to meet strict controls designed to protect UK national security.

However in January Defence Secretary Ben Wallace spoke with his Seoul counterpart about closer co-operation on military matters.

In 2019 Korea announced a 290 trillion won (£180bn) defence spending spree over five years that included adding an aircraft carrier capable of handling F-35B jets though it envisaged a smaller vessel than the Queen Elizabeth class which also operates advanced fighter jets.

The Royal Navy carriers have pioneered automated systems which reduce the number of crew they need making them more efficient."

Smith,"The 110'x33' linehaul towboat Gretchen V. Cooper built by Blakeley BoatWorks (BBW) was delivered to Cooper Marine and Timberlands (CMT) this month.

BBW and CMT located in the port of Mobile Ala. are wholly owned subsidiaries of Cooper/T. Smith. The company said the new towboat which has a maximum 8'6"" working draft is the U.S.’s first linehaul towing vessel powered by a Tier 4 Caterpillar high-speed engines with selective catalytic reduction.

Currently Tier-4 diesel engine standards are the strictest Environmental Protection Agency emissions requirements for new engines found in inland marine vessels. Tier-4 compliant engines significantly reduce emissions of particulate matter or black soot and nitrogen oxides to near zero levels. The engines are designed to save fuel and reduce emissions by more than 86% for large applications like marine vessels.

The new towboat is powered by two Caterpillar C3512E 3400-hp Tier 4 diesel marine engines operating at 1800 RPM and coupled to Twin Disc MGX-5600 gears.

The Cats are connected to Southeastern Propeller 88""x74""x9"" 4-bladed stainless-steel propellers to provide thrust through twin J&S Machine Works 9"" ABS Grade two propeller shafts with Cutlass shaft bearings Thordon rudder bearings and Kemel shaft seals. Gulf Coast Air and Hydraulics supplied the steering system for the two 9"" main and four 8"" flanking rudders.

Hydra Force LLC provided a pair of Quincy reciprocating air compressors with ventilation fans provided by Donovan Marine. Schuyler Maritime LLC supplied varying sizes of rubber fendering around the perimeter of the vessel and push knees.

Thompson Caterpillar also supplied electrical power with two Cat C4.4 Tier 3 generators with RW Fernstrum keel coolers throughout.

Stone Construction provided a Mitsubishi mini-split HVAC system in all interior spaces with Blakeley BoatWorks providing all custom woodwork and interior finishes. Bozant supplied aluminum and rubber-framed windows.

On deck Donovan Marine supplied a pair of Patterson 40-ton deck winches. Blakeley BoatWorks installed all electronics communications and an alarm system.

The towboat has a capacity of 44200 gals. of fuel and 10000 gals. potable water. The vessel is outfitted with six crew staterooms housing eight crewmen 4 1⁄2 baths and a full galley arrangement.

“Our customers expect Blakeley BoatWorks and Cooper Marine & Timberlands to drive industry innovation and our building and operating one of the industry’s most environmentally friendly towboats marks our unwavering commitment to always exceed their expectations” Angus R. Cooper III president Cooper/T. Smith said in a statement. “Naming a boat after my wife Gretchen meant that we couldn’t just settle for building a standard towboat and therefore the Gretchen V. Cooper will be one of the most powerful towing vessels operating on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway and will lead the way for a new industry standard for reduced emissions on towboats.”

Cooper Marine & Timberlands has a fleet of 20 towing vessels and more than 400 hopper barges. CMT has one of the country's largest fleet of dry bulk gantry and floating derrick cranes. The company’s marine footprint includes the Tennessee-Tombigbee River system Ohio River Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Illinois River Arkansas River Cumberland River Black Warrior River Tennessee River Tombigbee River Mobile River and Mississippi River. CMT’s stevedoring operations include two deep-draft bulk cargo terminals at the port of Mobile and numerous inland marine terminals throughout Alabama and Mississippi.

“The ongoing investments that CMT is making across our fleet best ensures that our customers will continue to receive the safest most environmentally friendly and highest level of service in our region” said James Fowler managing director of marine and stevedoring operations for Cooper Marine and Timberlands and executive vice president for Blakeley BoatWorks. “As was true when BBW built some of the nation’s first subchapter M new construction towing vessels and now as we deliver a new linehaul with the latest and most advanced carbon reduction technology BBW eagerly stands ready to deliver on our industry’s newest and most challenging jobs.”

Blakeley BoatWorks is a full-service shipyard that specializes in small vessel repair barge repair and new vessel construction. It is equipped with a 1900-ton floating dry dock 660-ton Marine Travelift and four covered fabrication shops.

“Our team is proud to be part of the construction of the Gretchen V. Cooper” said Swathin Kannalath managing director of Blakeley BoatWorks. “Delivering one of the first Tier-4 linehaul vessels in the country presented an exciting challenge for the Blakeley team and we delivered with this vessel meeting not only the highest industry standards but also exceeding our customer’s expectations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFnZy1uZXQuY29tL25ld3MvY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXItdXBkYXRlLWNvbGQtcGxhbmVyLWxpbmUtdXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caterpillar update cold planer line-up,"Third upgrade of Cat cold planers designed to enhance operation and reduce owning and operating costs

FIVE years ago Caterpillar brought a fresh line-up of cold planers to market and have been continuously working on improvements to the product line ever since. Now in the third update since their introduction the Cat PM620 PM622 PM820 PM822 and PM825 half-lane cold planers include numerous improvements based on customer feedback to enhance operation and reduce owning and operating costs.

The 470kW (630hp) PM620 and PM622 are powered by the well-known Cat C18 engine whilst the heavier and more powerful PM820 PM822 (pictured) and PM825 are powered by the same C18 engine with a twin-turbo setup to deliver 597kW (800.6hp) – up to 27% more power than the PM620 and PM622.

All five models meet US EPA Tier 4 Final EU Stage V and Korea Tier 4 Final emissions standards and are optimized to reduce fuel burn with a high-capacity cooling system that keeps the engine at ideal temperatures for optimal fuel efficiency and lower emissions.

New expanded LED lighting enhances night-time and low-light operation. The new wide-dispersion LED work lights come as standard and provide an improved well-lit work area for ground crew. LED perimeter lights can also be added to further illuminate the rotor chamber cutting path and work areas around the machine for increased visibility.

New entry/exit lighting provides illumination to the ladder and operator platform when the machine is shut down whilst the forward-folding canopy option now features dimmable LED strip lights mounted to the underside of the canopy to further improve visibility on the operator platform. When the canopy is lowered the lights continue to illuminate the intuitive operator-friendly controls.

The integrated Cat GRADE with grade and slope system takes the guesswork out of producing accurate and repeatable cutting results and includes automated features like obstacle jump and programmable cut transitions to aid in milling precision. Cat cold planers can also be enhanced with full 3D milling operation.

The robust cutting system is designed to withstand the toughest applications and built to last with heavy steel construction and reinforced alloys to resist abrasion. Available in a wide variety of spacings the durable Cat System K rotors deliver high-performance with efficient material flow and an effective cutting pattern. Kicker paddles are reversible for extended life whilst the tapered dual-retention toolholder design eliminates the need for retaining bolts pins or setscrews reducing replacement time by up to 50%.

A reliable tracked undercarriage system with well-engineered track geometry provides high tractive effort and better load distribution when milling deep cuts or through hard materials whilst high-capacity conveyors provide efficient removal of milled material with optimum discharge control. The belt also reverses for faster clean-up while magnetic vinyl covers provide quick access to inspect the rollers for wear and optional dust-ventilation and spray-bar systems maximize dust removal.

Cat milling machines are designed with long maintenance intervals large service doors and power hood for walk-in access to critical components and systems. Track pads are easy to replace whilst track chains and other undercarriage components are maintenance-free up to 4000 hours.

Longer-lasting conveyor flashing improved rotor-drive access a corded pendant for the rotor turning device and an added wear shoe for the inboard ski are just a handful of the many other improvements included in this latest product update.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVyZWFjdG9yLmV1L3lvdS13b250LXdhbnQtdG8tc2xlZXAtbmV4dC10by10aGlzLXBpa2FjaHUtY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXItcGx1c2hpZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You won't want to sleep next to this Pikachu caterpillar plushie,"HQ

In mid-March trunks of dead coconut trees could be seen scattered along either side of National Highway 60 in Chau Thanh District in Ben Tre dubbed the ""coconut kingdom"" of Vietnam. With 74000 hectares (182800 acres) it accounts for half the country’s coconut farming area.

In many groves trees stand with withered tops leaves gray and ragged.

Pushing a cart into his grove in Huu Dinh Commune that had been over 40 years old Vu Ngoc Hue picks pieces left from the trees that have been chopped down to use as firewood.

In July last year leaves and buds started drying up in a neighbor's grove. At first the owner thought the trees were affected by coconut bugs and simply sprayed pesticides. But it did not work and the disease quickly spread to the entire garden within a month and then to Hue and other farmers' groves.

As locals have found out it takes around two weeks for a tree to be completely destroyed from the time symptoms are first detected.

Hue has lost 5000 square meters of coconut trees to the caterpillar.

Pointing to the top of a sick tree Hue said that when a coconut tree is sick or old and does not produce good fruits farmers chop it down to get the cu hu from inside the trunk at the top. In southern Vietnam it is a specialty used in salads.

But the black-head caterpillar completely destroys treetops and there is no way to get the cu hu.

Hue said: ""Normally I earn VND1 million ($43) a month from selling coconuts. Chopping them down breaks my heart but I don't have any other choice.""

Huynh Duong Thai deputy chairman of Huu Dinh said the commune has more than 760 hectares of coconut and 66 hectares have been damaged by the caterpillars making it the worst affected locality in Ben Tre.

Farmers and researchers from some universities have tried both chemical and biological methods to destroy the pest but so far nothing has worked.

Huynh Quang Duc deputy director of the province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said the caterpillar Opisina arenosella Walker is a coconut pest originating in India and Sri Lanka and has been reported in 16 countries.

In Ben Tre it was first detected in Binh Dai District and has within eight months spread to 150 hectares in five districts and Ben Tre Town the capital.

The department has not been able to find out how the pest first intruded.

What makes this caterpillar more dangerous than others is that its larva stage lasts 40 days compared to just 10-14 days for other pests and during this period it subsists exclusively on coconut fronds thus completely destroying the tree.

The province has worked with experts to try and put an end to the pest.

Various methods have been explored in other countries but an effective solution has evaded them and destroying infected trees to prevent the caterpillar from spreading remains the only option.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlLzIwMjEvbWFyLzIwL3RhcmRpZ3JhZGVzLW5hdHVyZXMtZ3JlYXQtc3Vydml2b3Jz0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvMjAyMS9tYXIvMjAvdGFyZGlncmFkZXMtbmF0dXJlcy1ncmVhdC1zdXJ2aXZvcnM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tardigrades: nature's great survivors,"On 11 April 2019 a spacecraft crashed on to the Moon. The Israeli Beresheet probe was supposed to land gently in the Mare Serenitatis a huge plain of basalt rock formed in a volcanic eruption billions of years ago. It would have been the first privately funded mission to land on the Moon. But owing to a last-minute instrument failure Beresheet did not slow down enough and slammed into the surface at 500 kilometres per hour.

From the Moon’s point of view this was a failed alien invasion. Beresheet was carrying animals called tardigrades which look like stunted microscopic caterpillars. They may not seem like an obvious candidate for interplanetary travel but tardigrades are famed among biologists for their ability to survive conditions that would kill almost any other animal. It is possible that some of them survived the crash.

Don’t worry we haven’t seeded the Moon with new life. The tardigrades were sent out in an inactive state and that is how they will stay: they cannot become active again without water something the Moon is notoriously short of. Eventually the extremes of temperature and searing solar radiation will kill them all – but it may take a surprisingly long time.

How did tardigrades become so resilient that they can survive being transported through space and possibly endure even a high-speed lunar crash? What is their secret and could we ever use it ourselves? Perhaps most profoundly why did they evolve to be so tough when most animals didn’t?

Tardigrades are not hard to find. Go outside on a damp day and find a patch of wet moss or lichen. If you have a microscope handy you may well be able to find tardigrades puttering around in the water. They look like a cross between a woodlouse and a caterpillar shrunken to microscopic size.

Despite their size we have known about tardigrades for a long time. They were first described by the German naturalist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773. He called them “little water bears” because of the way they walked. The name tardigrade (which translates roughly as “slow stepper”) was bestowed on them a few years later by the Italian priest-turned-biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani in his book Opuscoli di Fisica animale e vegetabile (“Booklet of Animal and Vegetable Physics”).

They can survive being frozen to a degree above absolute zero. They can be heated up past the boiling point of water Thomas Boothby

Despite their tiny size they are complex animals. “They’re built of maybe 1000 cells but they’re just as complex as a cockroach or a fruit fly” says Nadja Møbjerg at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. That includes mouthparts for puncturing algal cells and other food sources.

Tardigrades also have very variable reproductive strategies says Lorena Rebecchi of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy. While some have males and females others are hermaphrodites while still others reproduce by parthenogenesis or “virgin birth”.

However none of these details is as famous as tardigrades’ extraordinary resilience. Thomas Boothby at the University of Wyoming in Laramie lists the threats they can endure: “They can survive being dried out. They can survive being frozen down to about a degree above absolute zero which is the temperature at which all molecular motion stops. In their dry state they can be heated up well past the boiling point of water. They can survive thousands of times as much radiation as we can. And they’re the only animal we know of that can survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of outer space.”

The basic story of tardigrades’ survival has been clear ever since Spallanzani studied them. He encountered them when he took sediment from a gutter and added water to it. What had previously looked like a bunch of lifeless grains became vigorously swimming tardigrades.

When Spallanzani’s tardigrades dried out they shrivelled up shrinking to about a third their normal size. They stopped moving stopped breathing stopped doing pretty much everything. They became tiny immobile lumps. Scientists call this their “tun” state. Tardigrades can stay in tun for years only to revive when they encounter water again.

The tun state challenges the popular idea that there is a hard line between life and death. A tardigrade in tun is not doing any of the things we associate with being alive but it is not dead either.

This can sometimes be misinterpreted says James Fleming of the University of Oslo Natural History Museum in Norway. “Something that has been bandied around a lot in popular media is the idea tardigrades can live for hundreds of years” he says. In reality tardigrades only have a few weeks of active life. The interval between when a tardigrade is born and when it dies might be very long but only if it spends most of that time in this “super-hibernation” to escape an environmental threat. “Really it’s best to think of it as a lifespan of a few weeks but not necessarily consecutive” says Fleming.

Entering the inactive tun state clearly offers a way for tardigrades to survive. If conditions become too dry too cold or too radioactive they can shrivel into a tun and wait it out. But most animals cannot do anything of the sort. Even if we humans could survive losing most of the water from our bodies – which we absolutely cannot – we would still die: DNA and other key molecules in our cells would become damaged so when we rehydrated we would find that nothing in our bodies worked.

Something must be happening inside tardigrades’ bodies to preserve them in the tun state.

In the late 20th century the American biologist John Crowe and the Danish researcher Hans Ramløv both homed in on one key molecule: a sugar called trehalose. In tardigrades and other animals that can survive being dried out such as nematode worms trehalose often accumulates as the water leaves their bodies and it is destroyed when they rehydrate.

“Trehalose is an important molecule” says Rebecchi. In particular it seems to be good at preserving the outer membranes of cells which might otherwise be ruptured as they dry out or if the animal becomes so cold that ice crystals form inside it.

“At high levels trehalose forms these super-viscous environments that kind of slow everything down” says Boothby. “While damage might still accumulate it will only do so slowly – so provided the tardigrade does not have to stay in tun too long it should be OK.”

A tardigrade in the tun state is not doing any of the things we associate with being alive but it is not dead either

Boothby adds that tardigrades also use other “mechanisms of stress tolerance”. In 2017 his team showed that some tardigrades make unusual proteins which preserve the innards of their cells. “They start filling up the cells of the tardigrade” says Boothby. “You can think of that as like turning the inside of a cell from water into honey.” Eventually the cells start to resemble glass.

This ability depends on the three-dimensional structure of the proteins. All proteins are long molecules like chains which are twisted into pretzel shapes. Most proteins have a handful of preferred shapes that their chains like to fold into but the tardigrade proteins do not have preferred shapes and instead just flop around seemingly at random. Only these “intrinsically disordered proteins” can form the glass-like substance.

“It slows down all these biological processes that are going on inside the cell” continues Boothby. That includes slowing down damage. For instance most proteins do need to be the correct shape to work. Being surrounded by water helps them to do that. “If water is removed from the system most proteins unfold and break” he says. “By creating this super-viscous environment inside the cells these tardigrade disordered proteins actually slow down processes like well-folded proteins unfolding and breaking.”

Intrinsically disordered proteins from tardigrades are so good at protecting biological material we might find them useful for storing medicines such as vaccines. One bottleneck in the fight against Covid-19 is that many of the vaccines need to be kept cold. But it should be possible to preserve them at room temperature using intrinsically disordered proteins. “We are actively working on that” says Boothby. He explains that the proteins have evolved to protect tardigrade cells not vaccines so his team is making small tweaks to optimise them for this new purpose. “We have patents out on these things and have some partnerships” he says. “If all goes well hopefully we will see this technology out soon.”

Even intrinsically disordered proteins are not the whole story. There is also a protein called damage suppressor (Dsup) which was identified in 2016 by Takekazu Kunieda of the University of Tokyo and his colleagues. Dsup binds to DNA in the cell protecting it from damaging chemicals.

“We don’t know how the protection works but the protection works anyway” says Simon Galas of the University of Montpellier in France.

Last year Galas’s team published a study of tardigrades in the tun state which revealed that structures resembling the ramparts of a castle form outside their cells. “This species can synthesise a specific structure that surrounds every cell of the tardigrade that can protect the tardigrade for desiccation but only desiccation” says Galas.

There is more to come predicts Boothby. “There are almost certainly a myriad other mechanisms and tricks that these organisms are using to protect themselves” he says. Intrinsically disordered proteins seem to be good at protecting other proteins and Dsup protects DNA but there are many other substances and structures inside tardigrade bodies that must be preserved.

Indeed some of tardigrades’ abilities remain almost entirely mysterious. For example in 2020 researchers found a new species that can resist intense doses of ultraviolet radiation. It seems to do this by fluorescing but it’s not clear what the fluorescent substance is or how it works. If it can be identified the team suggest it could form the basis of a new kind of sunscreen.

Studies such as these point the way to an explanation for how tardigrades are so resilient but they don’t tell us why. If such resilience is possible why is it only these peculiar little animals that have it? The answer may lie in tardigrades’ evolutionary history.

Researchers think they have the basics of the story. Like the other major animal groups tardigrades originated in the sea. Millions of years later along with other groups such as insects they began venturing on to land. But there they encountered a problem: becoming dried out.

Other land animals such as reptiles evolved waterproof skin so that they did not easily lose their body water but tardigrades never did. “They don’t have a skin that allows them to hold on to their water when they go on land” says Møbjerg. Instead they evolved the tun state a way to become dormant when conditions become difficult.

On this view tardigrades first evolved resilience to desiccation to survive on dry land. Their strategy was to enter a dormant state with their cells and organs packaged away by protective chemicals. This inadvertently also made them resilient to other stressors including cold and radiation because temporarily halting all biological processes works just as well for those situations too.

If this is correct tardigrades’ near-invincibility is a kind of accident. An accident that worked so well that they can even preserve themselves in outer space."

Much of the credit goes to media and entertainment companies particularly those focused on streaming.



“The last six months obviously activity has been slow regardless of the submarket but Hollywood heading into stay-at-home and lockdown was bolstered significantly by Netflix who has made no bones about the fact that they will be back to the office as soon as it is safe to do so” said Jennifer Frisk a senior managing director at Newmark Group Inc.



Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. International Director Carl Muhlstein agreed.



“The center of the city is alive from Culver City through Hollywood into Burbank. A lot of leasing activity. A lot of names of companies of stocks you want to own. The real estate has not really been affected in that swatch of Los Angeles compared to other submarkets” he said.



CBRE Group Inc.’s Blake Mirkin added that content producers and auxiliary companies were looking at creative office space near the studios which was faring better than traditional office product.



Limited space



Experts agree that the amount of sublease space available in Hollywood is far lower than in other markets.



Mirkin said that since April 2020 there has been a 17% increase in sublease space in Hollywood compared with a 70% increase in West L.A.



“Hollywood has done okay. Mostly because the majority of the absorption that took place in the last two years was Netflix related and they have not put any space on the market” said Josh Bernstein a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield Inc.



Although Quibi and some coworking companies put sublease space on the market Bernstein added that there was still not a large amount.



Most new construction in Hollywood had been preleased prior to the pandemic meaning there was not an influx of new space in the area.



Market experts said there is not enough sublease space to affect direct rents. But that doesn’t mean landlords aren’t offering concessions to entice tenants into the buildings. Concessions allow landlords to keep rents high while offering tenants other bonuses to move in.



“We have seen increased concessions” Frisk said. “We’ve seen increased free rent. We’ve seen increased beneficial occupancy. We’ve seen increased tenant improvement allowances.”



Bernstein said concessions were happening across all markets.



Anticipating demand



During the fourth quarter a large number of leases in Hollywood and around the county were short-term renewals but some experts are hopeful other companies will sign leases soon too.



“By the end of fall or early winter of this year with the vaccine rollout continuing to be more prevalent and people getting more comfortable that demand is going to come back pretty much across the board from smaller and bigger users” Bernstein said.



“The last 30 days have definitely been the busiest that we’ve been for the last 12 months” he added.



However he said many companies are looking for a deal and want a place that is already built out rather than a shell that they have to put work into.



And tenants beyond entertainment companies are interested in the area experts said.



“We’ve had a lot of fashion-related administrative offices. Since they no longer make clothes in downtown L.A. a lot of fashion names are considering moving west to be closer to the influencers of Hollywood the ad agencies the restaurants” JLL’s Muhlstein said.

With the coronavirus driving down deal volumes by 23 percent last year across APAC CBRE landed major deals in Japan and Singapore that helped it take the top spot.

“This incredible result is testament of our strong client relationships as well as local market knowledge and cultural insights across Asia Pacific” said Greg Hyland CBRE’s head of capital markets for Asia Pacific. “We will continue to sharpen our platform adapting and innovating to better service our clients.”

While not included in the scope of the rankings longtime regional champ JLL leveraged its connections with major institutions to lead the way in brokering investment into the region from other parts of the globe while also notching significant volumes of hotel and sale-and-leaseback deals in the region.

Stacking Up Deals

CBRE which brokered the most commercial deals globally for the 10th consecutive year led the way in Asia Pacific in part due to its involvement in mega-deals such as Blackstone’s JPY 300 billion ($2.7 billion) buyback of a portfolio of Japanese rental apartments from mainland Chinese insurer Anbang. Completed in May that sale was the largest property deal ever in Japan.

Also adding to CBRE’s win total was its brokering of Singaporean property investment manager Peakstone’s A$530 million ($411.6 million) purchase of an office block at 45 Clarence Street in Sydney as well as the S$280.9 million ($211.9 million) sale of Mediacorp’s hilltop Andrew Road site in Singapore to a Perennial Real Estate-controlled entity.

CBRE topped RCA’s global rankings across most property types including office industrial retail apartment and development site sales. The agency called attention to its industry-leading market shares of 22.7 percent in global office sales and 30 percent in global logistics and industrial sales.

Closed Borders Open Markets

With cross-border investment by Singaporean and Hong Kong institutions dropping markedly in 2020 according to RCA JLL was able to draw on its connections with investors in North America and Europe to maintain its position shepherding capital heading into Asia Pacific.

Among the large inbound deals that JLL helped to broker last year was the acquisition of a A$300 million Melbourne office project which was acquired by a fund backed by British Columbia’s Quadreal Property Group in February 2020.

The Canadian institution made that purchase of Victoria Place in Melbourne through a fund managed by ARA Asset Management.

JLL also struck gold by fostering sale-and-leaseback arrangements that allowed corporates to monetise their real estate holdings during the pandemic including grocery retailer Aldi’s A$648 million sale of a set of Australian warehouse assets to fund manager Charter Hall. In total the firm notched $800 million in sale-and-leaseback transactions around the region last year.

“As many continue to re-evaluate their business models and look to maximise working capital during this time of uncertainty real estate is viewed through a different lens whereby it can provide both a source of immediate cash flow and tenancy flexibility” Jeremy Sheldon head of markets for JLL Asia Pacific explained in an earlier interview as the company saw its business brokering sale-and-leaseback deals leap.

The Chicago-based firm also scored major wins in the Aussie market after brokering $4.8 billion in deals worth $10 million or more and it also performed well in Singapore through its role in Alibaba’s $1.2 billion acquisition of a 50 percent stake in the AXA Tower among other deals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2h2aWxsZXBvc3QuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL3NwcmluZ18yMDIxLzIwMjEtaW4tY2hhcmdlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50L2FydGljbGVfMWY0ZTU4YzItODIxNC01NmViLWI3NGMtNWM2OTk4NzZhOGVjLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 In Charge – Development | Spring 2021 | nashvillepost.com,"You have permission to edit this article.

The Governor's Economic Development and Tourism office said in September there's been a ""tremendous increase"" in companies reaching out since the pandemic hit with 237 relocation or expansion projects currently in the works.

Oracle moved its headquarters to Austin Texas late last year. Tesla is also building its new Gigafactory there and Apple will house its second-largest campus in Texas' capital city. This Big Tech influx has raised chatter about Texas potentially becoming a business hub that could rival Silicon Valley.

CBRE and Charles Schwab relocated their headquarters from California to the Dallas area in recent months and Hewlett Packard Enterprise is headed to Houston. Texas has also attracted wealthy individuals like Joe Rogan Elon Musk Dropbox CEO Drew Houston and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

But it's not just big businesses and the wealthy who are moving to Texas. In 2020 Texas added more residents than any other state. This comes as California's population and job growth have slowed to a trickle.

Watch the video above to hear from those moving to Texas and longtime Texans about the reasons behind the trend and what it could mean for the state's future."

NEW Cooperative is constructing a $11 million port along on the Missouri River near the small Monona County town of Blencoe.

The NEW Cooperative Port of Blencoe will become the northernmost port on the nearly 760-mile span of the Missouri from St. Louis to Sioux City.

Officials with the Fort Dodge-based co-op say they hope to complete the project in the next two months.

When finished the port will have the capacity to load and unload six to nine barges at a time.

As a test run the co-op hopes to receive its first two barges hauling fertilizer by mid-April before the construction is all finished operations manager Frank Huseman said. The barges are currently in New Orleans waiting for the opening of navigation seasons on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.

The co-op will then load the barges with soybeans and possibly corn and send them back down the river Huseman said.

By May and June the port is expected to be a buzz of activity with crews loading and unloading barges until the end of the navigation season in the late fall.

Each barge will have the capacity to haul 50000 bushels of grain. Plying the river with 72 barges per year eliminates the need for 80000 semi-trailer trucks of grain NEW Cooperative General Manager Dan Dix said.

The port gives the co-op direct access to export markets and provides a third option for transporting grain beyond the current rail and trucks.

""Iowa farmers need every advantage they can get"" Dix said prior to a groundbreaking ceremony in September. ""Years of low commodity prices droughts tariffs and most recently the derecho have devastated Iowa producers. This project is designed to bring some much-needed help to an industry so vital to us all.”

Because water navigation is more cost-effective than truck or rail the barge terminal will allow the co-op to reduce its freight expenses Dix said.

""When you talk about transportation costs the most economically feasible is the waterways"" Gov. Kim Reynolds said at the Sept. 9 groundbreaking ceremony. ""For our farmers to be able to utilize the Missouri River to export their goods internationally opens up a whole new world.""

Co-op officials also are in talks with other businesses in the region interested in using the terminal to transport their products from wind turbine blades to dried-distillers grains.

Iowa Economic Development Director Debi Durham cited the potential for more economic growth through the future development at the 30-acre site of the port which will initially create a dozen jobs.

The Monona County Board of Supervisors successfully applied for a state RISE grant of over $1 million to pave a gravel road from Blencoe pop. 224 to the port which is west of Interstate 29.

Proponents say barges are good for the environment and vehicular traffic safety because it takes more trucks off crowded highways like Interstate 80 reducing accidents and harmful emissions.

With a few exceptions barges have not traveled as far north as Blencoe in over 15 years. The once-thriving barge industry in Sioux City disappeared in the early 2000s after a combination of the degradation of the river bed drought economic recession low commodity prices and political infighting over management of the river led shippers to turn to rail and trucks.

NEW Cooperative which has over 5500 members and 40 locations throughout western and northwestern Iowa started planning its rural Monona County port two years ago Dix said.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers which manages the Missouri assured the co-op it would maintain a 9-foot-deep 300-foot-wide channel Dix said.

Missouri River barge traffic has declined significantly since the mid-1990s. Prior to that time the Big Soo Terminal in Sioux City averaged around 160 barges per year. By 2004 no barges docked at the terminal the first time that had happened since the Mighty Mo was straightened and deepened in the early 1960s.

Barge traffic in the most northern reaches of the river has been sporadic since then. In 2014 barges transported the largest heaviest equipment to CF Industries' new fertilizer plant at Port Neal as part of a $2 billion expansion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivwFodHRwczovL3Npb3V4Y2l0eWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3NwZWNpYWwtc2VjdGlvbi9sb2NhbC9pbmR1c3RyeS9wcm9ncmVzcy1tZXRyby1zaW91eC1jaXR5LWJ1aWxkZXItYnJvd24td2VnaGVyLWpvaW5zLWZvcmNlcy13aXRoLXNpb3V4LWZhbGxzLWZpcm0vYXJ0aWNsZV9iMGZmOTY4MS0xYTZlLTU1NTYtYWE3MC0yOTJiNGMzZjdhMTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROGRESS: Metro Sioux City builder Brown Wegher joins forces with Sioux Falls firm,"NORTH SIOUX CITY -- Brown Wegher Residential and MBW Construction & Engineering well-known construction and contracting firms headquartered in North Sioux City have merged operations with the Sioux Falls-based Journey Group.

Tim Brown CEO of Brown Wegher said merger talks began in May and were finalized on Dec. 31.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

""It was a mutual consultant that was working for both companies and just recognized a real fit for us"" Brown said. ""We've been thinking through succession planning for a few years with the goal of -- Rick (Wegher) and I are both in our late 50s and we wanted to make sure that Brown Wegher Construction (and MBW Construction) we wanted to make sure that those two entities had a bright future after we hit an age that we can't support it.""

Brown said that Weger maintains a ""significant ownership piece"" in Brown Wegher Residential while Brown maintains an ownership stake in MBW along with Tyler Manker (whose last name is the ""M"" in MBW).

Staffers at MBW and Brown Wegher are expected to remain in their current roles.

""It wasn't a merger to create cost savings so our entire staff is staying on board and doing the same things they want to do"" Brown said. ""It was an opportunity for more significant growth and succession planning.""

The Journey Group in Sioux Falls was incorporated in 1910 and was the builder of several older Sioux Falls landmarks including the Orpheum Theater and the Boyce-Greeley Building as well as O'Gorman and Lincoln high schools and numerous other projects according to the firm's website.

In a statement the Journey Group wrote that Brown Wegher's companion business entities ""have a long-standing history a strong customer base and similar culture and values as Journey.""

Wegher Construction was founded more than 30 years ago by Rick Wegher and some partners while Brown Construction was founded by Tim Brown and was perhaps best known for work in Lakeport Commons the shopping center at the intersection of Sergeant Road and South Lakeport Street that opened in 2005.

Brown Construction ran into some difficulty during the 2007-2008 financial crisis which hit the construction industry hard.

In 2011 Brown and Wegher combined to form Brown Wegher Construction. Wegher serves as president of the firm which now goes by Brown Wegher Residential.

Last spring Brown Wegher launched MBW Construction & Engineering which focuses primarily on work at food processing facilities manufacturing facilities refrigerated warehouses commercial development and the like.

Brown Wegher was the contractor in several prominent projects in metro Sioux City including the extensive remodel of the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce building in 2019 and the BoDean's wafer-baking plant in Le Mars as well as several projects in Dakota Dunes an upscale community in extreme southeast South Dakota. The firm has built numerous homes in Dakota Dunes as well as other communities in the region.

MBW has carved out a niche in food processing and cold storage construction primarily in Siouxland. The firm's clients have included Tyson Foods Smithfield Foods CF Industries empirical Foods and Cloverleaf Cold Storage. Nationally it's been involved with projects from Philadelphia to Phoenix.",,,,,,,,,

The Governor's Economic Development and Tourism office said in September there's been a ""tremendous increase"" in companies reaching out since the pandemic hit with 237 relocation or expansion projects currently in the works.

Oracle moved its headquarters to Austin Texas late last year. Tesla is also building its new Gigafactory there and Apple will house its second-largest campus in Texas' capital city. This Big Tech influx has raised chatter about Texas potentially becoming a business hub that could rival Silicon Valley.

CBRE and Charles Schwab relocated their headquarters from California to the Dallas area in recent months and Hewlett Packard Enterprise is headed to Houston. Texas has also attracted wealthy individuals like Joe Rogan Elon Musk Dropbox CEO Drew Houston and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

But it's not just big businesses and the wealthy who are moving to Texas. In 2020 Texas added more residents than any other state. This comes as California's population and job growth have slowed to a trickle.

Comment on this story on the Chipotle the global chain of Mexican grill restaurants is set to takeover the premises formerly occupied by Byron Burger on Chiswick High Road. The company specialises in tacos and Mission burritos that are made to order in front of the customer. The Chiswick outlet will be the group’s first outside central London. A planning application for work on 227-229 Chiswick High Road has been submitted by the company for work at the site including the repositioning of the front door. It is expected that this work will be complete in May with the company planning a summer opening. The chain was founded by Steve Ells on July 13 1993 in Denver Colorado and had 16 restaurants when the McDonald’s Corporation became a major investor. By the time McDonald’s sold its shares in 2006 there were 500 branches of Chipotle and it continued to expand to over 2000 locations with 45000 staff. The first Chipotle restaurant in Europe was opened in London in 2010 but expansion in the UK stalled and the group had only seven restaurants in the capital by June 2015 with all but one of them in the City of London or the West End. The company had previously put the slow growth in the United Kingdom down to British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods although other chains with a similar offering have expanded here during that period. Jacob Sumner Chipotle’s European Operations Director said “Chipotle is helping to cultivate a better world by serving responsibly sourced classically-cooked real food with wholesome ingredients without artificial colours flavours or preservatives. ""We are excited to bring Chipotle’s real food to the Chiswick community with our new restaurant opening on Chiswick High Road this summer. As the first Chipotle restaurant located outside of central London it will offer an amazing open-fronted dining room as well as a convenient walk-up window for guests picking up digital orders.”

CB,Chubb Limited,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9ycHQtaW5zdXJlci1jaHViYi1uZWVkcy1wYXktMDYwMDAwNDcwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RPT-Insurer Chubb needs to pay up to bulk up with Hartford,"(Repeats story published on Friday.)

By Alwyn Scott and David French

NEW YORK March 19 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd's $23.4 billion bid for Hartford Financial Services Group Inc would catapult it well up the rankings of U.S. property and casualty insurers if it is willing to sweeten its offer enough to clinch the deal equity analysts said.

Chubb on Thursday offered to buy Hartford for $65 per share in cash and stock a premium of about 13% to its stock price the previous day.

In combining forces Chubb would significantly boost its footprint among small commercial businesses where Hartford is a leader. Building scale in that sector is critical because small businesses tend to pay small premiums said analyst Paul Newsome at Piper Sandler in Chicago.

Hartford Financial or ""The Hartford"" as it is known dates back to 1810 when it was founded as the Hartford Fire Insurance Co.

Some analysts said the offer undervalued Hartford and suggested the price could rise to more than $29 billion. Other acquisitions in the sector have fetched prices that were 151% to 176% of book value compared with Chubb's bid at 144% of Hartford's book value.

""We view the $65 per share as too low"" Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan said in a note arguing Hartford could command more than $80 a share.

The combined company could book about $51 billion in net premiums earned in 2022 a key revenue metric for insurers Greenspan estimated.

That would make Chubb bigger than Progressive Corp which analysts expect will report about $48 billion in net premiums earned in 2022 according to Refinitiv.

The P&C insurance market has been hit by claims associated with the COVID-19 pandemic including payouts to some business for losses caused by lockdown measures.

This comes on top of terrible wildfires in western states the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record and civil unrest which have all raised claims by policyholders and pushed losses onto insurers.

While a potential deal would be the largest in the P&C space since Chubb was created by ACE Ltd's $28.5 billion purchase of Chubb in January 2016 this part of insurance has seen a steady flow of smaller acquisitions.

Transactions such as MetLife Inc selling its car and home insurance business to Farmers Group part of Zurich Insurance Group AG reflect how those with smaller operations are exiting the sector in the face of fierce competition.

The deal is unlikely to encounter regulatory challenges given how fragmented the P&C industry is Newsome said. Chubb has a narrow advantage as the largest writer of commercial lines policies ahead of Travelers Companies according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Adding eighth-ranked Hartford would give the combined entity an 8.4% market share overall.

In personal lines insurance a joint Chubb-Hartford would be the 11th-largest writer S&P Global figures show. Ranking by net premiums written would put Chubb-Hartford just below fifth-ranked Liberty Mutual Insurance Co based on 2020 results according to AM Best.

If Chubb does not pay up for Hartford others might be more willing. William Hawkins at Keefe Bruyette & Woods wrote in a note that Allianz SE and Zurich could offer $87 and $84 a share respectively while still accruing benefits to earnings.

Allianz and Zurich declined to comment.

The deal also appeared likely to spur more activity.

""Every significant-size insurance company is going to ask themselves 'If Chubb thinks they need scale what about me?'"" Newsome said.

“People got nervous when CVS bought Aetna” William R. Peelle Jr. president of the board of trustees at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford said. “We’ve been through this time and time again. The one thing that Hartford does worry about is every time you move the CEO out of Hartford to another city we’re not going to get the same amount of attention.”

The Hartford which traces its roots in Hartford back 200 years and employs thousands at its headquarters in Asylum Hill confirmed last week that larger rival Zurich Switzerland-based Chubb Ltd. had approached the company March 11 with a $23 billion buyout offer. An acquisition agreement has not been announced and it is not definite that one will come together.

A potential acquisition by Chubb whose U.S. headquarters is in New Jersey raises the specter of both the loss of a Hartford headquarters but corporate and administrative jobs that overlap between the two property-casualty insurers. The possibility of losing jobs in the merger in Hartford comes as the pandemic is expected to change just how many workers will return regularly to offices in downtown Hartford.

Workers in and around downtown are an essential part of the economic ecosystem of the city frequenting shops restaurants and sporting events. Corporate employees also are potential tenants for new downtown apartments.

David Souder associate dean of graduate programs at UConn’s School of Business said a possible Chubb acquisition of The Hartford would differ from CVS Health Corp.’s 2018 takeover of Hartford-based Aetna Inc. another major insurer with deep roots in the city.

Aetna the Hartford-based health insurer was acquired by owned by Woonsocket R.I-based CVS Health Corp. in 2018.

The combination of CVS and Aetna brought together two different businesses — a pharmacy chain with a health insurer — that didn’t make for a lot of overlap. That isn’t the case with Chubb and The Hartford which while focusing on different insurance segments are basically in the same business Souder said.

In such instances cutting jobs to save expenses is typical Souder said.

“You’re going to change something” Souder said. “It doesn’t have to be bad for the area but it makes sense that’s where everyone’s eyes are.”

The Hartford employs 18500 with 6100 in Connecticut.

Founded in 1810 the insurer — taking its name from its birthplace city — has made its headquarters on Asylum Hill on the edge of downtown. The insurer’s original Neo-Classical Revival-style building remains a distinctive landmark with its two-story Ionic portico low central dome.

Hartford’s Corning Fountain in Bushnell Park also is topped with a stag the trademark logo of The Hartford Financial Services Group.

The Hartford’s trademark logo — a stag crossing a river — dates to at least 1861 when it appeared on a policy insuring Abraham Lincoln’s home in Springfield Ill.

“Even the stag on the Corning Fountain equates to their symbolic pedigree” said Tyler Smith Hartford architect and the son of the late Aetna chairman Olcott Smith. Smith was referring to the fountain in Hartford’s Bushnell Park

The era of “The Bishops” — a group of high-powered business executives in the city who invested and influenced the city’s path forward — has been over for decades. The expansion of businesses in an ever-widening global marketplace continues to unfold and quicken its pace.

Even so Smith said he is convinced that where companies are headquartered fosters sharper attention on that area.

“I did get the feeling that when the home offices were in Hartford there was sort of a collective sense that this was my community and I was going to be fully engaged in it” Smith said. “My gut tells me that is a hard concept to maintain if your corporate headquarters are somewhere else.”

Souder said it is possible that if Chubb acquires The Hartford it could still maintain a significant presence in Hartford much the same way as Travelers Cos. now does even though its headquarters is out of state. Downtown Hartford is Travelers’ largest employment site across the company.

Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin praised The Hartford as the model of a corporate citizen ranging from millions of dollars in investment in Asylum Hill and their involvement in the Boys and Girls Club to their apprenticeship and partnership with downtown Hartford’s Capital Community College.

In 2017 The Hartford’s chief executive officer Christopher Swift joined with the CEOs of Aetna and the Travelers to give Hartford $50 million over five years as it faced fiscal and budget turmoil.

“The leadership of The Hartford including Chris Swift and much of his senior team have been personally actively committed to building a stronger Hartford in partnership with the city” Bronin said.

Bronin who once worked for The Hartford said he would be watching how Chubb’s offer to The Hartford plays out but he declined to comment directly on it.

The Hartford Foundation for Public Giving a major philanthropic organization in Greater Hartford said it believes The Hartford will remain active in the community.

“As the region’s community foundation the Hartford Foundation is optimistic that the company’s deep commitment to this community will continue regardless of any decision its Board of Directors might make about a potential merger or acquisition” Jay Williams the foundation’s president said in a statement.

The headquarters of the Hartford Financial Services Group.

While some Wall Street analysts poked holes in the potential merger others said there were real reasons for serious consideration but that Chubb would have to raise the stakes on what it is willing pay. Chubb has disclosed it is offering $65 a share valuing the deal at about $23 billion.

Cathy Seifert an analyst at CFRA Research said in a note to investors Friday that a combination “makes sense” bringing together The Hartford’s robust insurance for small businesses with Chubb’s large commercial franchise.

“We also see [The Hartford’s] diverse executive team adding to [Chubb’s] breadth and depth of managerial skill” Seifert wrote. “But we think Chubb will have to raise its offer and we caution that this negotiation process may not be smooth.”

On Friday just a day after the acquisition talks were disclosed some employees of The Hartford already were considering their options should a deal go through.

Denis Horrigan partner and co-founder of Connecticut Wealth Management in Farmington said his firm has already been in touch with executives of The Hartford who are clients “and have had some conversations” about their financial plans if a Chubb acquisition goes through.

“There are a lot of people in their 50s whose net worth increased significantly on paper” he said referring to the sharp rise in The Hartford’s share price on news of Chubb’s interest. “They might retire or take on a new challenge in life and not deal with the headaches a merger brings on.”

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is working with multiple law enforcement agencies to track down the man.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZXBpc2NvcGFsbmV3c3NlcnZpY2Uub3JnLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvc2FuLWZyYW5jaXNjby1jaHVyY2gtb2ZmZXJzLXNwYWNlLWZvci1zYWNyZWQtc2xlZXAtc3VwcG9ydC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1ldmVyeS13ZWVrZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,San Francisco church offers space for 'sacred sleep' support services every weekday,"[Episcopal News Service] Every weekday at 7 a.m. the Episcopal Church of St. John the Evangelist in San Francisco California opens its nave to people who need a safe place to rest – what it calls “sacred sleep.” Those who come are unhoused neighbors in the city’s Mission District and they find a place of welcome without judgment.

“We love having our space open almost recklessly open for the neighborhood” the Rev. Kevin Deal St. John’s vicar told Episcopal News Service. Serving its community “has been part of the DNA of St. John’s almost since its inception 164 years ago.”

St. John’s provides space for more than just sleeping through its partnership with the Gubbio Project a nonprofit organization that serves unhoused people with “safe compassionate respite during the day” according to its website.

The project takes its name from an Italian town where according to legend St. Francis of Assisi brokered a truce between a hungry wolf and frightened townspeople. The nonprofit was founded in 2004 and moved into space at St. John’s in 2017.

Lydia Bransten Gubbio’s executive director since 2021 told ENS that the legend embodies what her organization is about. “When people come together with mutual need we find commonality and can work together” she said.

Their response shines a light not only on homelessness in general but on how communities across the country seek to address it. Homelessness has been on the rise across the United States since 2017 and cities have grappled with how where and even if to provide shelters or housing. A lawsuit against Grants Pass Oregon for its decision to fine homeless people for sleeping outside on public property made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments on April 22.

According to the Associated Press one-third of the country’s unhoused population live in western states like Oregon and California. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing’s 2022 Point-in-Time count found more than 7700 unhoused people in the city with more than 4000 of them unsheltered. The 2024 count is due out this summer.

While unhoused people have existed in America since the 17th century their needs have grown more acute than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic Bransten said. Homeless people in San Francisco who weren’t gravely disabled or seniors “were basically left out on the street” and with shelters closed encampments sprang up so people could find some safety in being together. There were few services available and many people watched others die of an overdose. “There was a lot of trauma in those years” she said.

“The result is a community of people who are distrusting who are more ill and fentanyl addiction collided with COVID in a way that has been debilitating for that community” she said.

A recent assessment of homeless people living in the Mission District found that before COVID 68% of them were employed and had housing she said. Immigrants make up a large portion of the area’s population and many lost their jobs as office building cleaners or restaurant workers during the pandemic. Loss of a job often meant loss of housing.

Now when St. John’s opens its doors each weekday about 35 people come to sleep and over 100 more arrive for the supportive services Gubbio offers. With no pews in the nave it’s easy to set up cots with blankets and people are welcome to bring their belongings and their dogs inside with them. Couples can arrange their cots to be near each other which usually isn’t permitted in shelters Bransten said. “The only rule is to just stay peaceful” she said.

In other parts of the building people can get a cup of coffee or see one of the nurses who provide foot and wound care. The city’s Department of Public Health’s street medicine team provides health screenings and follow-up appointments. Gubbio’s harm reduction specialist who also is a treatment counselor provides clean needles and other paraphernalia so those using drugs can do so safely.

“That provides an entrée to a conversation with a person who is struggling with drug use” Bransten said. Recovery from addiction always is the end goal but “we need to keep them alive long enough and love them enough until they are ready to love themselves into recovery.”

Bransten said that St. John’s offers a space for Gubbio’s clients that is both sacred and safe. “Not all sacred spaces feel safe” she added. “A lot of people have experienced a level of spiritual violence and St. John’s is an incredibly healing community.”

Deal and some of his parishioners provide pastoral care to those who come to the church for Gubbio’s services and many of them now attend worship services at St. John’s something Deal says he loves. “We don’t think of them as people from Gubbio” he said “they are just folks in the St. John’s community.” He said that because people are familiar with the church and think of it as their space they feel comfortable coming back on Sunday.

Bransten said St. John’s building itself helps the people Gubbio serves. “The beauty of the space is key to the way we’re able to create an environment where people feel welcomed where they feel like it’s peaceful it’s beautiful and it’s for them.”

“This is exactly who the beauty of God’s house is intended” Deal said. “It’s not for the people who have everything. The beauty of God’s house is for the people who are down and out.”

Studi tentang cinta merupakan kajian yang multidisipliner meliputi bidang psikologi neurosains neurobiologi endokrinologi biologi molekuler humaniora filsafat sastra bahasa agama tasawuf dan disiplin ilmu penunjang lainnya

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Peradaban dan kejayaan suatu bangsa dibangun berdasarkan literasi sejarah geopolitik ekonomi budaya bahasa agama spiritualitas humaniora kesehatan teknologi sains. Induk dari pengetahuan adalah filsafat. Intisari dari filsafat adalah Cinta akan kebijaksanaan dan kebaikan. Jadi tidaklah berlebihan bila peradaban bangsa dibangun berpondasikan cinta.Cinta adalah ""emosi"" dan perasaan yang dapat dijelaskan melalui pemahaman aktivitas otak dan sistem persarafan yang terkait dengan cinta. Dikaji dari perspektif atau pendekatan manapun pertanyaan tentang cinta pastilah menemukan jawabannya. Jawaban itu nantinya akan memunculkan pertanyaan lagi. Hal itu tidaklah aneh mengingat kompleksitas cinta.Studi tentang cinta merupakan kajian yang multidisipliner meliputi bidang psikologi neurosains neurobiologi endokrinologi biologi molekuler humaniora filsafat sastra bahasa agama tasawuf dan disiplin ilmu penunjang lainnya. Oleh karena multiperspektif maka pembahasan cinta di artikel ini berfokus hanya pada aspek psikoneurobiologi. Tentunya disiplin ilmu lain berfungsi sebagai komplementer.Segitiga cintaPsikolog Robert Stenberg mengemukakan teori segitiga cinta. Teori ini menjelaskan aspek interpersonal dari cinta. Segitiga memiliki tiga sudut melambangkan tiga aspek cinta yakni perasaan suka (intimacy) infatuasi alias kegilaan (passion) serta cinta hampa (keputusan atau komitmen).Perpaduan antara passion dan intimacy melahirkan cinta romantis. Kombinasi antara passion dan komitmen mencetuskan cinta bodoh (fatuous love). Akulturasi antara intimacy dan komitmen menimbulkan cinta harmonis (companionate love). Penyatuan aspek intimacy passion dan komitmen memunculkan cinta sempurna (consummate love).Seperti ""emosi"" lainnya cinta dikendalikan oleh faktor-faktor endokrin. Beberapa faktor teridentifikasi berperan penting dalam cinta romantis seperti testosteron serotonin kortisol vasopresin beragam hormon lainnya faktor pertumbuhan saraf serta dopamin. Sistem ""reward"" dopamin berinteraksi dengan beragam hormon lainnya seperti oksitosin dan vasopresin.Cinta romantis melibatkan jejaring berkenaan dengan dopaminergik termasuk beberapa area di otak seperti globus pallidus nukleus kaudatus putamen area tegmental ventral serta area terkait emosi seperti hipokampus insula medial dan singulat anterior.Ketiga area otak yang disebutkan terakhir berperan meregulasi perasaan dihargai-dicintai sekaligus bertanggung-jawab atas perkembangan cinta.Cinta bermula dari hubungan. Sebutlah semisal pertemuan perkenalan pertemanan persahabatan atau sekadar kebetulan. Hubungan ini juga memiliki stadium seperti romance akomodasi tantangan/penolakan kepercayaan utuh eksplorasi seksual stabilitas komitmen dan kokreasi. Stadium hubungan menuju ""kebahagiaan sejati"" itu juga dapat dirumuskan singkat menjadi 6C yakni choice (pilihan) commitment (komitmen) celebration (perayaan) compassion (keampunan) cocreation (kokreasi) dan courage (keberanian).Dalam terminologi Urdu -- disertai padanan dalam istilah bahasa Inggris -- terdapat tujuh stadium cinta; hub (attraction) uns (infatuation) Ishq (love) aqeedat (reverence) ibaadat (worship) junoon (obsession) dan maut (death).Dari terminologi ini jelaslah bahwa ada seseorang yang rela mati atas nama Cinta. Sebab Cinta memang bersinonim dengan kematian.Dalam terminologi Yunani kuno (Greek) ada 10 stadium Cinta. Pertama porneia. Identik dengan lapar akan cinta. Kedua pothos. Maksudnya keberlekatan posesif atau cinta miskin. Ketiga mania atau pathe. Maknanya cinta bernafsu penuh gairah godaan bujukan rayuan. Keempat eros. Artinya cinta seksual energi kehidupan (in-love-ness).Kelima philia. Intinya cinta persahabatan. Keenam storge. Bermaksud penghormatan kelembutan hati kehalusan budi. Ketujuh harmonia. Berarti cinta harmoni kebaikan keseimbangan keselarasan. Kedelapan charis. Bermakna cinta religius penghambaan. Kesembilan eunoia. Ini serupa dengan perayaan ungkapan syukur rasa terima kasih. Ke-10 agape. Ini adalah puncak Cinta alias cinta yang membebaskan (unconditional love).Stadium hubungan Cinta yang menarik dibahas adalah pernikahan. Meskipun tidak semua cinta berakhir dengan pernikahan. Di dalam pernikahan sepasang sejoli akan merasakan dan mengalami stadium romance realitas kekuatan perjuangan menemukan jatidiri rekonsiliasi respek mutual dan Cinta. Stadium pernikahan ini bermula dari dependen menjadi interdependen hingga independen.Cinta memiliki beberapa fase. Pertama gairah birahi nafsu syahwat renjana. Istilah kerennya lust-passion. Pada fase ini beberapa organ tubuh berperan penting. Misalnya: otak primitif yakni sistem limbik mengendalikan ketertarikan seksual dan ikatan interpersonal. Hormon seks memroduksi testosteron dan estrogen memperkuat hasrat seksual.Menariknya kortisol yang dikenal sebagai hormon stres ternyata meningkat saat seseorang jatuh cinta. Ini membuktikan bahwa jatuh cinta itu hakikatnya peristiwa yang menimbulkan ketegangan jiwa dan kegoncangan mental.Kedua daya tarik (attraction). Di fase ini hormon yang berperan adalah adrenalin dopamin dan serotonin. Adrenalin memberi energi ekstra pada sejoli yang sedang kasmaran sekaligus pemicu hilangnya selera makan dan insomnia (gangguan tidur) di malam hari.Dopamin mengendalikan hasrat kebahagiaan dan penghargaan. Sehingga membuat para pe(n)cinta mengharapkan kehadiran sang Kekasih. Serotonin bertanggung-jawab atas kebahagiaan kenyamanan dan kesejahteraan. Perubahan kadar serotonin membuat seseorang kehilangan konsentrasi melamun serta berperilaku obsesif.Ketiga perlekatan keintiman. Bahasa asingnya attachment. Di fase ini oksitosin dan serotonin berperan penting. Oksitosin berfungsi sebagai ""hormon cinta"" sebagai daya pikat daya ikat dan daya lekat dengan sang kekasih. Sedangkan kadar serotonin di fase ini berangsur-angsur normal. Kondisi stres di fase pertama digantikan oleh kepercayaan keamanan dan empati.Studi neurosains dan biologi molekuler berhasil mempertautkan cinta dengan sistem limbik yang terdiri dari lobus temporal hipotalamus amigdala dan hipokampus. Komponen fungsional sistem limbik ini merupakan komponen penting dari proses emosi motivasi dan memori.Hipotalamus juga berperan dalam cinta romantis karena ia memiliki kecenderungan untuk terikat dengan mamalia melalui sekresi neuropeptida oksitosin dan vasopresin. Produksi hipotalamus (berupa dopamin oksitosin vasopresin) berperan penting saat seseorang jatuh Cinta. Amigdala mengatur ketakutan dan stres. Kelenjar pituitari di otak meregulasi berbagai hormon dan mensekresikan ke tubuh.Berdasarkan pindai otak (brain scan) beberapa area di otak berperan penting dalam perasaan cinta. Daerah itu terkenal sebagai ""otak Cinta"". Misalnya: nukleus akumbens (kegilaan cinta) area tegmental ventral (cinta baru dan area penghargaan) nukleus raphe (pencinta jangka panjang area pemberi kenyamanan) ventral pallidum (kegilaan cinta setelah 20 tahun terkait dengan kasih sayang).Riset lain berhasil membuktikan keterlibatan nerve growth factor (NGF) dalam cinta romantis. NGF adalah suatu neurotrofin yang penting dalam keberlangsungan hidup neuron dan perkembangan sistem persarafan terutama di stadium awal cinta romantis pada orang yang mengalami euforia dan ketergantungan emosional.Seseorang yang sedang tidak jatuh cinta atau memiliki hubungan persahabatan jangka panjang memiliki kadar NGF yang lebih rendah dibandingkan dengan seseorang yang baru saja memiliki kekasih. Kadar NGF di tubuh secara langsung berkorelasi dengan intensitas perasaan romantis.Konflik di dalam rumah tangga terkadang muncul akibat perbedaan bahasa cinta di antara suami istri. Begitu pula saat berpacaran. Mengalah terkadang bukan solusi terbaik meskipun berpisah juga bukan resolusi terbaik. Pemahaman bahasa Cinta mutlak diperlukan bagi seseorang untuk memahami apa yang diinginkan pasangannya. Ada setidaknya lima bahasa cinta.Pertama ""quality time"". Intinya memberikan waktu berkualitas. Pasangan dengan bahasa cinta ini memerlukan momentum khusus untuk hanya berdua dengan pasangannya meskipun hanya 15 menit. Bisa hanya ngobrol berdua bercanda atau tertawa bersama berjalan kaki berdua atau makan malam berdua dengan cahaya temaram lilin.Kedua kata afirmasi. Maksudnya memberikan pujian. Pasangan dengan bahasa Cinta ini terkadang memberikan apresiasi berupa chat romantis kartu ucapan. Balasan yang diharapkan amat sederhana: cukup didengarkan atau ucapan terima kasih.Ketiga aksi pelayanan. Maknanya memberikan pelayanan. Pasangan dengan bahasa Cinta ini umumnya membuktikan Cinta bukan dengan ucapan melainkan tindakan nyata. Misalnya: membantu memasak mencuci piring mengepel lantai membawakan barang. Banyak kesalahpahaman karena pasangan seperti ini tidak dapat memuji kekasihnya alias tidak romantis.Keempat hadiah. Caranya dengan memberikan hadiah. Pasangan dengan bahasa cinta ini umumnya akan sering memberikan kejutan di hari spesial. Bisa memberikan kado di hari ulang tahun memberikan perhiasan sebagai tanda cinta dan hadiah lain yang dirasakan spesial bagi kekasihnya.Kelima sentuhan fisik. Ini berarti memberikan sentuhan. Pasangan dengan bahasa Cinta ini seringkali memberikan kecupan pelukan ciuman atau sentuhan sebagai ungkapan cintanya.Cinta merupakan sebuah pondasi peradaban. Keajaiban dan keberuntungan dapat diciptakan dari pikiran jernih dan hati yang penuh cinta kasih. Dari sinilah dimulai perubahan suatu peradaban. Dari satu individu mampu menggerakkan satu keluarga.Keluarga ini menjadi teladan dan panutan yang menginspirasi masyarakat. Harmonisasi di kehidupan bermasyarakat menjadikan suatu bangsa menjadi jaya unggul maju sejahtera.Bila kondisi ini terjadi di semua bangsa di dunia maka secara bertahap peradaban akan menjadi cemerlang. Singkatnya melalui cinta mari kita bersama mencerahkan peradaban.*) dr Dito Anurogo M.Sc adalah mahasiswa studi S3 di IPCTRM Taipei Medical University Taiwan pendidik di FKIK Universitas Muhammadiyah Makassar Dokter Rakyat di Kampus Desa Indonesia penulis produktif berlisensi BNSP dewan pembina/penasihat/pendiri/pengurus/anggota di sejumlah organisasi/komunitas berskala Internasional hingga regional).

American alternative hip hop artist Aaron Smith better known as Shwayze and Grammy nominated record producer Cisco Adler will reunite for the first time in years for a virtual performance event on April 20 presented by NoCap. Tickets as well as VIP packages are available here.

The setlist for the virtual show solely features songs off their 2008 chart topping self-titled debut joint album. The show will be shot in Malibu California starting at 6:30 PST. The show will immediately follow with a VIP smoke session and Q&A.

The duo’s scorching summer hits off their debut album were undeniable and far reaching. Songs like “Buzzin” and “Corona and Lime” both peaked within the top 50 of the Billboard Charts during their respective runs. Back in the Summer of 2008 the two were the headliners for the Warped Tour. Some of Shwayze and Cisco Adler’s hilarious misadventures were the focus of a reality television series on MTV called “Buzzin’” which helped propel the artists to household name status. NoCap is the brainchild of Cisco Adler along with an all-star list of partners in the music and tech industries. It has developed to become both a platform and promoter of premium livestream concerts which gives fans around the world access to incredible performances with an unlimited capacity.

‘I cannot think of a better landing spot for ShieldX than Fortinet ... I know this transaction has the potential to be incredibly good for all involved’ ShieldX CEO Ken Levine wrote on LinkedIn late Friday.

Fortinet has quietly purchased cloud and network security startup ShieldX to give customers a more comprehensive view of end users workstations and OT devices.

The Sunnyvale Calif.-based platform security vendor closed its acquisition of San Jose Calif.-based ShieldX March 10 a Fortinet spokesperson told CRN but the company hadn’t publicly announced the deal. ShieldX CEO Ken Levine posted about the Fortinet transaction on LinkedIn late Friday which followed a Monday LinkedIn post on the deal by Dave Karp ShieldX’s SVP of product management and marketing.

“I cannot think of a better landing spot for ShieldX than Fortinet” Levine wrote on LinkedIn Friday. “I know this transaction has the potential to be incredibly good for all involved.”

ShieldX’s relationship with Fortinet started at the February 2020 RSA Conference according to Levine. He said on LinkedIn that the Fortinet team was an “absolute pleasure to deal with even if appropriately tough on some matters!!”

Fortinet is not disclosing how much it paid for ShieldX according to a company spokesperson.

“After 18 months at ShieldX I can say with certainty that … this was as smart and as talented and as passionate a team one could wish to be part of” Levine wrote on LinkedIn. “Adding [in] an exceptional board and advisors it was a privilege to be CEO.”

The combination of Fortinet and ShieldX has created an integrated offering to address lateral movement prevention as well as the convergence of OT campus and multi-cloud data center segmentation ShieldX wrote on a blog posted to the company’s website March 8. ShieldX said it can extend perimeter security and campus segmentation with east-west lateral movement prevention.

The joint company can better protect data and applications across all environments thanks to the combination of Fortinet’s network security and ShieldX’s customer visibility and controls the company said. Fortinet’s threat intelligence and alerts combined with the analysis of traffic flowing east-west in the data center should lead to faster response times according to ShieldX.

ShieldX said it can autogenerate security policies for proper segmentation as well as provide context and quantify risk for all assets communicating with applications. The company said its patented microservices architecture allows the platform to elastically scale security while recording all changes in a report to ensure compliance.

The company said its unsupervised machine learning can generate security policies based on the risk score associated with vulnerabilities in the application structure. ShieldX said it can also automatically prevent exploits from attacking the vulnerabilities through deep packet inspection as well as the automated creation and deployment of security policies.

This is Fortinet’s third deal in the past eight months and comes three months after the company bought Panopta for $34 million to automate management of servers containers applications databases cloud infrastructure and virtual appliances. The company also bought Opaq for $8 million in July to strengthen distributed network protection from data centers and branch offices to remote users and IoT devices.

ShieldX was founded in 2015 raised $34 million of outside funding and employs 43 people down from a high of 64 employees in April 2019 according to LinkedIn and Crunchbase. The company closed a $25 million Series B round in December 2017 led by Bain Capital Ventures and followed that with an August 2019 investment for an undisclosed amount from Thomvest Ventures.

The company has a number of high-profile board members including FireEye Founder Ashar Aziz former Symantec President and COO Michael Fey former Palo Alto Networks President Mark Anderson NTT Security CEO Matthew Gyde and Aspect Ventures Co-Founder Theresia Gouw who lead the firm’s early investments in Cato Networks Exabeam and Forescout.

The same month Thomvest invested Levine joined Shield X as CEO following nearly five years leading Waltham Mass.-based data protection vendor Digital Guardian. “It did not take long for me to recognize that ShieldX is where I wanted to be if the founders and board would have me” Levine wrote on a ShieldX blog at the time of his arrival.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuZ2Vlay5waC8yMDIxLzAzL2tpbmctb2YtZmlnaHRlcnMteGl2LXVsdGltYXRlLWVkaXRpb24tcmV2aWV3LW9uZS1zb2xpZC1wYWNrYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,King of Fighters XIV Ultimate Edition Review | One Solid Package,"The initial trailer for King of Fighters XIV Ultimate Edition had me a little baffled. They had just announced the next entry to the King of Fighters series but then they decided to market this game as a way to “Rekindle your fighting passion as we inch closer to KOF XV”. Regardless if you do decide to play this game the King of Fighters XIV Ultimate Eddition is the base game with all the DLC content in one solid package. This brings the character roster up to a total of 58 characters while also adding 10 DLC costumes and some Playstation Themes.

Training with your favorite character

Many of the characters you may have seen previously like Terry Bogard or Mai Shiranui though the game’s roster spans the series long history while still introducing new characters into the mix. If this is your first time with the series deciding on who to pick from a roster of 58 characters may be daunting especially considering the characters are fully rendered in 3D as opposed to the traditional 2D sprites. Many of the 3D characters feel a bit stiff and are not as expressive as their 2D counter parts. However the transition to 3D does allow for more detail on the character models.

One must be forewarned when trying to learn this game though especially if your used to combat systems from other games. Button mashing here does not work. The most beginner friendly move is Rush which is you just tapping a series of Light Punches (LP) for a combo and if you have a meter to burn finishes with a special. However pulling off longer and more complex combos requires a deeper understanding of a character’s move list and timing. That’s why I would recommend to try picking your three favorite characters that you will be spending quite sometime to master.

The game does provide a few modes which can help. Tutorial is a great way to start as it teaches you most of the combat mechanics that can be applied across all characters. At first getting used to the controls and timing may seem daunting at first. With practice you can start getting into the rhythm of chaining combos and specials.

As you start to have a feel for the controls you can enter the Mission mode Trials. This mode is where you can choose a specific character and learn their special moves and abilities. Then training mode is where you can go next to learn and experiment more to learn the characters.

The Tournament

Story mode in this game is fairly basic. It revolves around Antonov who is the new boss character and the host of the King of Fighters tournament for the game. Sure it may have a few cutscenes and a hint of a looming dark threat but there are only a few interactions between specific characters and they are mostly just generic banter. Though there are some interactions that occur which could only be understood by veteran players. Still don’t expect something at the level of other recent fighting games.

It starts off with you picking your roster of 3 characters. You then proceed through three versus three battles till you reach the final boss for a total of 10 stages.

Speaking of stages there are 22 stages each with their own theme and referencing a different part of the world. The only stage that made me take pause to look at what was happening in the background was the Railroad stage. The battle takes place on a moving train and I kept getting distracted by the faces craved into the mountains that pass by. Another example is the city circuit–this was probably based of the Monaco circuit but I never saw any sign of race cars. Small things like that are what I believe is lacking and makes some the stages feel sort of generic. But then if you look at Dream World which is an amusement park theme there are a lot of details to take in.

Versus mode

Most fights will usually be in the series format of three versus three battles. Though if you’d like a to focus more on one-on-one matches the game provides that option as well. When fighting against the CPU the difficulty can be adjusted. Should you prefer to broaden your horizon you could try tackling the online mode to challenge other players. Your experience may vary as it may depend on the geographical location of your opponent and/or who ever has the slower connection.

DLC

I don’t usually agree with the concept of locking franchise established characters behind an additional paywall. However since the ultimate edition comes with all DLC it doesn’t really apply. I feel that they could have added a few more costumes though Eespecially when most of the characters have remained largely the same in terms of looks. The PlayStation themes are a nice touch and they look good but I think the developers time might have been better spent on more costumes.

Final Verdict – 7/10

The King of Fighters XIV Ultimate Edition is a great package. Whether your playing the series for first time or a returning veteran there is a slight learning curve. However once you are able to pull off an awesome chain of combos and specials with your favorite characters there is plenty of fun to be had. With a huge cast of characters to master I can imagine hours of replayability for those looking for a challenge.

Normal maintenance doesn't require disassembly especially if you clean the PS5 occasionally and follow some common-sense rules.

This article covers how to clean your PlayStation 5 including a safe procedure to remove dust and dirt as well as tips for how to keep your PS5 clean in the first place.

How to Clean a PS5

If you've scored a PS5 chances are you'll want to keep your new console in tip-top condition for as long as is possible. Luckily cleaning a new PS5 and keeping it clean is easy and all you'll need to do is spend a few minutes on maintenance a month.

To safely and efficiently clean your PS5 have a pair of soft preferably microfiber cloths the strongest isopropyl alcohol you've got and some canned air ready.

Any cloth can work but you want to make sure you're wiping down your console with something that won't leave a residue. Similarly with isopropyl alcohol any strength will do but the stronger the alcohol the easier it'll wipe away dirt.

If you have a catastrophic accident a simple cleaning may not be enough and you might have to take your console out for repair because the hardware inside could be damaged as well as dirty.

With your console powered down and unplugged use canned air to carefully blow out any dust and debris from the console's ports and the back fan exhaust. Splash some alcohol on a cloth and gently wipe down the entire console. Isopropyl alcohol particularly the strong variants can irritate the skin so be careful and make sure to wash your hands after cleaning. With the second dry cloth wipe down your console again. Depending on your brand and strength of isopropyl alcohol if the alcohol dries naturally it can leave streaks and smudges. While paper towels will work just fine for this they can leave behind bits of fuzz or dust. If you want a truly shiny PS5 try using a lint-free cloth. The DualSense controller can be identically wiped down with alcohol and then a dry cloth to clean it too. Sometimes cleaning your controller with alcohol can help unstick sticky buttons if you ever run into that issue.

For better or worse worship may never be the same after the coronavirus.

Nearly every religious tradition has gone virtual — sermons and some sacraments went online; baby blessings confirmations baptisms weddings and funerals were streamed; mask-wearing became ubiquitous; most singing was discontinued; and Communion practices were transformed.

Priests and pastors became adept at speaking into a camera rather than to a congregation. Rituals that used to include a large group now are done individually if at all. Or they were adapted to comply with the restrictions prompted by the virus.

Drive-thru confessions. Livestreamed Bible studies. Do-it-yourself sacrament meetings. Google Hangout prayer groups.

As some of the public safety requirements ease up believers wonder: Which pandemic procedures will remain and which pre-COVID-19 traditions will return?

Some Utah religious leaders have offered a glimpse at how their faiths have been transformed and what future worship may look like.

Baptists

Pastor Corey Hodges of The Point Church in Kearns says he has read research that indicates maybe a third of most evangelicals won’t come back in person after the pandemic.

That shows the importance of online streaming which his church will continue Hodges says and “may beef up.”

When his church wasn’t meeting in person Hodges made a video instructing members how to do Communion on the first Sunday of the month at home. In the video he would “administer the official rhetoric” he says then those watching would take the “elements” — bread and grape juice — by themselves.

When some congregants returned for services administrators “sanitized the elements and placed them in trays” Hodges says so people could grab them as they entered the church and take them to their seats.

Hodges still addresses viewers at home because in-person services are livestreamed as well.

At the same time the residual effects of the year’s deprivations have caused members to be more aware of the loss of togetherness.

“We have taken the communal aspect of our faith for granted” the pastor says. “COVID has made us embrace that more — appreciating more hugs and wanting to be together.”

Catholics

Even before the pandemic the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City had invested some $50000 to set up a streaming system for Mass says the Rev. Martin Diaz and that made it possible to go online soon after the church discontinued services last March.

Within a couple of months the diocese added hours for “adoration of the blessings” which is a “private prayer” practice so when members couldn’t come to Mass they could meet privately with a priest while social distancing. Many would also go to confession at the same time boosting the numbers for the two practices.

Both will continue says Diaz rector of downtown Salt Lake City’s Cathedral of the Madeleine.

When in-person Masses resumed in May with small groups sitting 6 feet apart attendees had Communion brought to them in their seats rather than having them approach the priest. Handshaking during the sign of peace was discontinued.

By summer Communion likely will return to its traditional practice the priest says “but will anyone drink wine from the same chalice?”

The diocese will continue livestreaming Mass Diaz says. “It gives a great comfort to people who are sick get busy or just can’t come. People watch from around the world.”

Some members of the diocese — serving Utah’s 300000-plus Catholics — now regularly view Masses in other places including the Vatican.

“God always brings good out of evil” he says. “We are working to bring good out of this pandemic’s evil.”

Latter-day Saints

Last March The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints suspended weekly services worldwide shut down its temples and returned thousands of missionaries to their home countries.

Most temples have partially reopened and some in-person Sunday services have resumed with limited numbers although a fair portion of members still watch online. The sacrament part of the service though cannot be viewed virtually so cameras are clicked off while the in-person attendees partake and those watching (who are authorized) take it at home.

Some missionaries are now being called to countries outside their own but many still do their language training at home and their proselytizing on the internet from their apartments.

“The church has learned a great deal during this period and is looking at which elements will remain following the pandemic” says church spokesperson Doug Andersen “but no specific changes have been announced.”

Apostle Dieter F. Uchtdorf told missionaries in a recent digital devotional that technology will continue to be a prime contacting and teaching tool.

“When restrictions to our missionary work ease again don’t just go back to the old ways. Go back to the future” he urged the global force. “...Don’t neglect proven principles and practices from before the pandemic. But learn add and adapt technological advances that the Lord has provided to accomplish his work.”

(Photo courtesy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Apostle Dieter F. Uchtdorf and his wife Harriet greet missionaries from a recording studio on Temple Square during a devotional in February 2021.

Steve Evans founder of the Mormon blog By Common Consent says temple changes “are a little harder to guess at.”

Physical contact “is probably more important for some aspects of the temple” Evans says “and I would guess those will return as soon as possible.”

A bigger question: “How many people will return to meetings after having been absent for so long?” he asks. “I fear that congregations will never return to the same levels of attendance they were pre-pandemic.”

At the same time technology has provided an opening for a lively independent community to offer supplemental discussions.

Last spring Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought an independent quarterly publication offered a weekly Sunday gospel study program on the church’s “Come Follow Me” curriculum “with a diverse set of scholars and teachers up through the end of 2020” says Dialogue Editor Taylor Petrey. “In October 2020 we added a monthly fireside to the schedule.” At the start of 2021 Dialogue switched to biweekly Sunday lessons while keeping the monthly virtual fireside Petrey says

“We plan to continue this programming indefinitely even after COVID.”

To be clear though these online offerings are not meant as substitutes for worship services Petrey says but rather to “draw on our amazing network of experts to provide additional content.”

Meanwhile a “huge” number of Latter-day Saints began “opting in to classes beyond their local wards and branches” he says “regularly tun[ing] in to lessons taught by friends or gravitat[ing] toward charismatic teachers outside their ward boundaries as word spread about where to find meaningful lessons.”

Petrey is optimistic about “the possibilities for meaningful Sunday worship and gospel study that have been opened up by these new conditions” but worries Latter-day Saint communities “would suffer if people did not also contribute to their local congregations.”

In an ideal world “the insights people gain from exposure to a range of ideas and teachers can enrich all of our church experiences” he says “not just replace them with those we happen to like better.”

Hindus

Virtual worship has not been good for the next generation of Utah’s Hindus says Indra Neelameggham a longtime member of the community.

Being in a religious minority she says has made it important to their collective identity to come together physically at the Sri Ganesha Temple in South Jordan.

Some say that if they have to watch a priest consecrate the shrines online Neelameggham says they might as well watch the same ceremonies from India.

But Hinduism is a sensory religion in which worship includes “incense flowers chanting and the sound of the bells” she says. “You can’t smell on the computer or feel the marble on your feet.”

Before the pandemic the Hindu community had two priests but one of them went back to India and then couldn’t return. Because of online streaming she says the temple authorities think they might be able to manage with just one.

“It was hard enough to build a temple in a foreign country” Neelameggham says. “Now it will take a little bit of effort to build [temple-going] back up.”

Still she is resigned to the changes brought by technology.

Faith is about a “particular dialogue between you and God” Neelameggham says. “That’s still happening — even on Zoom calls.”

Jews

Switching to livestreaming services from Salt Lake City’s Congregation Kol Ami was “a controversial move that had been debated for years” says Rabbi Samuel Spector. “However now that it is here [because of the pandemic] many want it to stay.”

It is a “welcome tool” for homebound hospitalized members and far-away congregants or for people unable to travel to “life-cycle events” Spector says. “We have yet to make an official post-pandemic decision but it is receiving tremendous support.”

Virtual services are “not ideal” he says. “But it provides a way for people to be connected to their community and faith.”

Still the rabbi adds “it doesn’t beat being together.”

Methodists

Online worship is “here to stay” says the Rev. Rebecca Dunagan of Trinity United Methodist Church in West Valley City. “That genie is not going back in the bottle.”

And she believes that is a good move.

“Church is a lumbering dinosaur slow to change” Dunagan says. “This crisis created the ability to change like nothing else has.”

“Virtual church” has increased accessibility to services now including shift workers and the less-mobile elderly she says. It has also pushed churches to focus less on the physical space and maybe several could even share buildings in the future.

This will give religious groups a chance to be “good stewards of resources” the pastor says since a lot of churches sit empty six days of the week.

“As a pastor I hope people come back to the building and continue to value getting together” Dunagan says. “Part of communion is ‘table fellowship’ which can’t be replicated.”

Dunagan was transferred to Utah from Fort Collins Colo. in July so she has never worshipped physically with her congregants. She is eager to meet them in person.

Meanwhile Trinity is looking at how to expand its presence to more online platforms.

For years mainline Christian denominations have seen a decline in attendance and needed to figure out how to reverse that trend Dunagan says streaming online might be part of the solution.

Muslims

(Francisco Kjolseth | Salt Lake Tribune file photo) Imam Shuaib Din of the Utah Islamic Center in Sandy holds 10-minute prayers with increased spacing in May 2020.

Utah Muslims expect that this year’s 30-day Ramadan observance which begins April 12 will be “dramatically better than last year’s” says Imam Shuaib Din of the Utah Islamic Center in Sandy. “We had let go of our rental place because we were not hosting in-person services and our new mosque was not yet completed.”

The mosque was finished in June weeks after Ramadan 2020 ended. Small groups have been meeting there for Friday services since then Din says which include a temperature check mask-wearing and social distancing.

The imam has continued — and will continue — his Friday sermons virtually. Islamic leaders have ruled that mosque members can listen to sermons at home but they can’t do the prayers.

For those he says “you have to come in personally.”

The pandemic has “forced us out of our comfort zone” Din says and made us much more “tech-savvy” and “creative.”

Presbyterians

First Presbyterian Church in downtown Salt Lake City was “kicked in the pants into livestreaming worship” says the Rev. Steve Aeschbacher. “And it has really been a blessing.”

It’s been a great help to allow “homebound and traveling members to participate in worship” he says “as well as to reach out to our neighbors.”

Eventually social distancing in worship and not passing the offering or Communion will disappear Aeschbacher says. “It will be interesting to see if some small groups choose to stay on Zoom (maybe the people are physically far apart or have trouble traveling) while others return to in-person meetings.”

He adds: The idea of engaging our older population in a deeper way is exciting.”

The church’s “understanding of worship has changed. We realized that we can to some degree worship together virtually” Aeschbacher says. “It is much better than not worshipping at all.”

At the same time “we all have a deeper appreciation for the importance of presence. Being physically together is powerful and meaningful. We appreciate God’s presence to us through our neighbors in worship” the pastor says. “We have been reminded that worship is fundamentally different from consuming a movie or a TV show. It is something we do together not something we watch others do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWdyZWVuLWdyb3VwLXRyeWluZy10by1tYWtlLWJpZy1wbGFzdGljLXBheS1mb3Itc2NvdXJnZS1vZi1wb2xsdXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,California Green Group Trying to Make Big Plastic Pay for Scourge of Pollution,"The Earth Island Institute is attempting a novel legal gambit that attempts to hold companies that rely on plastic packaging responsible for the vast amounts of plastics ending up in the oceans and along beaches saying those companies have misled the public about the efficacy of plastic recycling to protect their bottom line.

(CN) --- If you leave Los Angeles by boat and head due west for the Hawaiian Islands about halfway you will reach The Great Pacific Garbage Patch a collection of floating trash comprised primarily of discarded plastic.

The rotation gyre of discarded rubbish has grown exponentially increasing ten-fold every single decade since 1945 to its present dimensions of 600000 square miles or roughly the size of Alaska. It weighs an estimated 87000 tons.

Despite images conjured in the press the giant floating garbage patch is difficult to detect. It was only discovered in the 1990s. You can’t spot it from satellites and it’s even difficult to espy from a boat.

Its relative inscrutability is due to the fact that it is composed primarily of plastic which continues to break down into smaller and smaller particles eventually lingering in the environment as microplastics. But plastic products which are nonbiodegradable never completely vanish.

Instead the microplastics accumulate in the ecology and often end up in the digestive systems of wildlife accrue in large oceanic gyres like The Great Pacific Garbage Patch or wash up along pristine beaches the world over sullying the ecological and aesthetic components of some of the globe’s most scenic places.

While many of the solutions proffered by various organizations focus on the technological innovations that make clean-up possible there is an environmental organization that has undertaken a novel approach to combating the scourge of global plastic pollution.

Earth Island Institute a Berkeley Calif.-based environmental nonprofit sued a collection of the world’s largest food beverage and consumer goods companies saying their use of millions of tons of plastic packaging has resulted in polluted oceans waterways and beaches.

“This is the first of what I believe will be a wave of lawsuits seeking to hold the plastics industry accountable for the unprecedented mess in our oceans” said Josh Floum Earth Island Institute’s Board President. “These plastics peddlers knew that our nation’s disposal and recycling capabilities would be overrun and their products would end up polluting our waterways.”

The lawsuit names Crystal Geyser Water Company The Clorox Company The Coca-Cola Company Pepsico Inc. Nestlé USA Inc. Mars Incorporated Danone North America Mondelez International Inc. Colgate-Palmolive Company and The Procter & Gamble Company as defendants.

But the novel legal theory at the heart of the case delves deeper than merely suing the above-named companies for plastic production; instead the Earth Island Institute has predicated its complaint on the little recycle symbol the companies place visibly on each plastic product.

“The misrepresentation claims are premised on the fact that when consumers see the recycle symbol on the plastic packaging they think that when they put it in a little blue bin it will be recycled” Noor Rahman an attorney for Earth Island told Courthouse News in a recent interview. “But 90% of the time it can’t be.”

Rahman said the general public is likely unaware that less than 10% of the plastics that are collected for the purpose of recycling are actually used as material to make recycled products most likely because the companies in question have been successful at marketing recycling as an environmental solution to single-use plastics.

“The way they’ve marketed their products has resulted in the mass proliferation of excessive volumes of plastic” Rahman said.

The problem has only increased since the advent of the coronavirus.

During the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 plastic manufacturers made about 129 billion face masks and 65 billion pairs of plastic gloves every month. Gloves and masks ended up in the ocean in large amounts where marine mammals and fish easily mistake the spindly items for jellyfish and other prey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGNwb3N0LmNvbS9hbWMtZ2VvcmdldG93bi1yZW9wZW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMC's Georgetown Theater Reopens March 26 After A Year of Closure,"AMC Georgetown 14 is scheduled to reopen on March 26 together with other locations of the theater chain around the country and the region after remaining closed for around a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fourteen rare penguins have been successfully moved from the Curraghs Wildlife Park in the Isle of Man to a new home in Northern Ireland.

The waddle of Humboldt penguins included 10 chicks hatched in 2020 and four that hatched the previous year as part of an internationally recognised breeding program.

The move that has been months in the making comes after the Curraghs Wildlife Park enjoyed a record year for the South American species which is classed as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

General Manager Kathleen Graham said: ‘We are thrilled that they have arrived at their new home at the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry and proud to do our bit to expand the captive population.

‘A move like this would be challenging at the best of times but the added obstacles of the ongoing pandemic and Brexit have made the planning particularly complex but seeing pictures of them in their new pool made it all worthwhile.

'It has been a real team effort and I would like to thank everyone involved.’

The penguins have now moved into a brand new salt water pool and will continue to be part of the European Endangered Species breeding program.

Geoffrey Boot MHK Minister for the Department of Environment Food and Agriculture who manage the Park said: ‘I must congratulate everyone that has helped to make this possible in such difficult times.

‘Not only does our Wildlife Park protect species and contribute to breeding programs but through fundraising efforts it delivers direct help in the wild – where it is most needed.’

Last year the Curraghs team has raised more than £2000 to help with projects in the wild where numbers are possibly as low as 12000 and in decline.

Celebrating International Women’s Month the Coca-cola company and its partners said the goal of the 5by20 initiative has been exceeded as the company has enabled the economic empowerment of more than six million women around the world of which 34 per cent representing over 2 million of those women enabled by the 5by20 program live and do business in Africa.

“This International Women’s Day we celebrate surpassing our goal to reach five million women but we know that there is still work to be done” says Patricia Obozuwa Vice-President: Public Affairs Communication and Sustainability Coca-Cola Africa.

“Women entrepreneurs continue to face major hurdles hindering their successes and we acknowledge that our work must therefore continue particularly given the significant socio-economic disruption created by the pandemic in so many communities around the world” Obozuwa said.

5by20 aimed to assist women entrepreneurs across the Coca-Cola value chain – agricultural producers suppliers distributors retailers recyclers and artisans – overcome challenges when establishing and growing their business. By providing access to business skills financial services assets and support networks of peers and mentors women entrepreneurs are enabled to overcome social and economic barriers and succeed as entrepreneurs while also helping create sustainable communities.

The Coca-Cola Foundation has funded the 5by20 initiatives and the Coca-Cola system has worked with several partners to implement over 300 programs in 100 countries to provide women entrepreneurs with business skills training mentoring networks financial services and other assets to help enhance their businesses and lives as well as provide more for their families.

Over the last 10 years the company has worked with countless partners who helped bring aspirations to life. Partnerships with organisations such as UN Women Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Women Enterprise Fund (WEF) Department for International Development (DFID) USAID International Finance Corporation (IFC) MercyCorps TechnoServe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Hand in Hand Southern Africa and several other regional and local partners were critical to the success of the 5by20 program.

BY CHIEDZA KOWO

BEVERAGES blue chip Delta Corporation has achieved its plan to expand its multiple brands’ footprint into Manicaland province after a key regulator approved a transaction to take over Mutare Bottling Company (MBC) for an undisclosed amount.

The deal gives Delta’s sparkling beverages franchise fresh growth impetus through forays into a region that has seen investor interests rise since diamond multinationals moved to exploit the resource about a decade ago.

The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE)-listed Delta produces soft drinks under licence from the Coca-Cola Company.

The MBC transaction had already attracted market interest since it was announced last year with researchers at Inter Horizon Securities predicting that it potentially laid the foundation for a 700% growth in revenue during the full year to March 2021.

The deal marks a grand step in Delta’s ambition to mount bases in strategic markets possibly giving it leverage to enter the nearby Manica province in Mozambique.

“Delta Beverages is pleased to announce that following the approval of the transaction by the Zimbabwe Competition and Tariff Commission the Coca-Cola Company has extended its sparkling beverages franchise arrangements to cover Manicaland province” the firm said in a market update.

“This cements the agreement between Delta and Mutare Bottling Company who were operating in this franchise territory for Delta to purchase the operating assets of Mutare Bottling Company. This transaction provides an opportunity for the group to provide its range of products across the entire Zimbabwean market. Our customers and consumers in Manicaland will have access to the wide range of the Coca-Cola Company’s brands and packs. This also allows the optimal utilisation of the existing assets including the Mutare bottling plant and the distribution footprint. The transaction will not result in any job losses” said Delta.

For Delta this is no small deal.

Zimbabwe’s biggest beverages firm is facing stiff competition from Indian billionaire Ravi Jaipuria’s Varun Beverages which operates the Pepsi franchise in Zimbabwe.

Varun entered the market a few years ago after setting up an operation in Zambia.

Its operation in Harare is still relatively small compared to Delta but its aggressive pricing model could be unsettling the giant which has to flex its muscles to ward off the competition.

Around the time Pepsi was making its Zimbabwean ambition felt the giant located an opportunity to kill off competition in the vast province before Pepsi made the first steps.

Manicaland presents growth opportunities for food and beverage players after significant rises in employment levels riding on the resumption of mining in key diamond operations.

The MBC acquisition follows the extension of Delta’s sorghum beer division’s footprint into Zambia and South Africa.

In an analysis on the deal released late 2020 IH Securities acknowledged Delta’s aggression saying added volumes at MBC would boost revenues.

“We expect revenue to increase by 696% to $3338 billion in FY21 (financial year 2021) from $419 billion in FY20 driven by volume recovery and continued price adjustments. Delta’s ability to defend aggregate volumes despite the environment has been premised on effective product mix management that has enabled the business to capture the consumer at a variety of pricing points within the value chain” said IH.

“This will continue to be the focus going forward as management seeks to continually adapt product offering to the changing dynamics in consumer spend. Delta has made several acquisitions over the past couple of years to extend the company’s footprint in the region. Of note is the extension of the sorghum beer division in Zambia and South Africa via National Breweries and UNB respectively while the sparkling beverage segment will extend its nationwide footprint via Mutare Bottling Company. Management highlighted that they would continue on the lookout for more acquisition opportunities. We expect consumption to pick up as the situation ‘normalises’ in the region.”"

(CN) --- If you leave Los Angeles by boat and head due west for the Hawaiian Islands about halfway you will reach The Great Pacific Garbage Patch a collection of floating trash comprised primarily of discarded plastic.

The rotation gyre of discarded rubbish has grown exponentially increasing ten-fold every single decade since 1945 to its present dimensions of 600000 square miles or roughly the size of Alaska. It weighs an estimated 87000 tons.

Despite images conjured in the press the giant floating garbage patch is difficult to detect. It was only discovered in the 1990s. You can’t spot it from satellites and it’s even difficult to espy from a boat.

Its relative inscrutability is due to the fact that it is composed primarily of plastic which continues to break down into smaller and smaller particles eventually lingering in the environment as microplastics. But plastic products which are nonbiodegradable never completely vanish.

Instead the microplastics accumulate in the ecology and often end up in the digestive systems of wildlife accrue in large oceanic gyres like The Great Pacific Garbage Patch or wash up along pristine beaches the world over sullying the ecological and aesthetic components of some of the globe’s most scenic places.

While many of the solutions proffered by various organizations focus on the technological innovations that make clean-up possible there is an environmental organization that has undertaken a novel approach to combating the scourge of global plastic pollution.

Earth Island Institute a Berkeley Calif.-based environmental nonprofit sued a collection of the world’s largest food beverage and consumer goods companies saying their use of millions of tons of plastic packaging has resulted in polluted oceans waterways and beaches.

“This is the first of what I believe will be a wave of lawsuits seeking to hold the plastics industry accountable for the unprecedented mess in our oceans” said Josh Floum Earth Island Institute’s Board President. “These plastics peddlers knew that our nation’s disposal and recycling capabilities would be overrun and their products would end up polluting our waterways.”

The lawsuit names Crystal Geyser Water Company The Clorox Company The Coca-Cola Company Pepsico Inc. Nestlé USA Inc. Mars Incorporated Danone North America Mondelez International Inc. Colgate-Palmolive Company and The Procter & Gamble Company as defendants.

But the novel legal theory at the heart of the case delves deeper than merely suing the above-named companies for plastic production; instead the Earth Island Institute has predicated its complaint on the little recycle symbol the companies place visibly on each plastic product.

“The misrepresentation claims are premised on the fact that when consumers see the recycle symbol on the plastic packaging they think that when they put it in a little blue bin it will be recycled” Noor Rahman an attorney for Earth Island told Courthouse News in a recent interview. “But 90% of the time it can’t be.”

Rahman said the general public is likely unaware that less than 10% of the plastics that are collected for the purpose of recycling are actually used as material to make recycled products most likely because the companies in question have been successful at marketing recycling as an environmental solution to single-use plastics.

“The way they’ve marketed their products has resulted in the mass proliferation of excessive volumes of plastic” Rahman said.

The problem has only increased since the advent of the coronavirus.

During the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 plastic manufacturers made about 129 billion face masks and 65 billion pairs of plastic gloves every month. Gloves and masks ended up in the ocean in large amounts where marine mammals and fish easily mistake the spindly items for jellyfish and other prey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2Zpcm1zLXJlc3BvbnNpYmxlLW5lYXJseS1oYWxmLXBoaWxpcHBpbmUtcGxhc3RpYy13YXN0ZS1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Only 3 firms responsible for nearly half of PH's plastic waste – report,"This is AI generated summarization which may have errors.

The #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement renews its call for the government to impose a nationwide ban on single-use plastics

Global movement #BreakFreeFromPlastic said fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies Universal Robina Corporation (URC) Nestle and Colgate-Palmolive were the top 3 corporate plastic polluters in the Philippines in 2020 as shown in the Philippine version of the 2020 Brand Audit Report.

The 3 corporations’ packaging waste accounts for 46% of the total of 38580 plastic items collected. Of this 6350 plastic items from URC were collected 6168 from Nestle and 5580 from Colgate-Palmolive.

The report also said 91% of the total collected plastics were non-recyclables particularly sachets. “This figure proves that recent efforts by FMCGs to boost their so-called recycling efforts are completely useless in addressing plastic pollution in the Philippines” the groups in the movement said in a statement on Saturday March 20.

Local members of the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement include the EcoWaste Coalition Greenpeace Interfacing Development Interventions for Sustainability and Project Mariknows.

“The local results of the 2020 brand audit show not only the extent of the plastic pollution that local communities have to deal with but more importantly they also reveal the faces behind the pollution: corporations that until now have refused to own up to their responsibility by peddling false solutions to the plastic problem and remain opaque in their plastics reporting” Greenpeace campaigner Jefferson Chua said.

A brand audit refers to the counting analyzing and documenting of plastics brands and companies responsible for the plastic waste that end up in ecosystems beaches and urban centers. The audit took place from August to September 2020. In the Philippines a total of 915 volunteers participated in 17 clean-up sites.

Call to ban single-use plastics

The groups also raised concern over companies’ continued reliance on “false solutions” to the plastic problem such as banning plastic straws and stirrers instead of investing in measures to phase out plastic production.

“These corporations have been consistent top polluters as well for the past two years and have done nothing substantial to tackle plastic reduction at its source. Instead they pursue programs that unfairly pass the responsibility to consumers” Chua said.

Rather the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement says the passage of a comprehensive single-use plastic ban is an “essential policy tool” to stop plastic pollution.

There have been a lot of proposals made to tackle the country’s waste problem – from bills that seek to ban plastic straws and bags in restaurants and stores to proposals to prohibit single-use plastics. But the country’s waste management system remains inefficient.

“While individuals and local government units are doing their part the 18th Congress needs to step up its efforts by passing a comprehensive law banning single-use plastics in the Philippines. This policy can significantly advance other local efforts to preserve and protect our environment” said Patricia Nicdao policy and advocacy officer of EcoWaste Coalition. – Rappler.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTEzNDMxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plastic waste pollution still a global concern: group,"WORLDWIDE PROBLEM.

MANILA – A group of environmental advocates is urging the government to institute measures to address the country's problem of plastic wastes.

Members of Break Free from Plastic (BFFP) are seeking a nationwide ban on single-use and problematic (non-recyclable) plastic products.

""Impose accountability and liability on corporations for the waste on packaging and end-of-life of their products"" the group also said in its Philippine Brand Audit Results report released this week.

BFFP cited the need to implement mechanisms for fostering growth and innovations in eco-friendly and alternative product packaging and delivery systems.

There's also a need to impose ""hefty"" penalties on corporations and individuals failing to address waste and pollution as well as not adhering to clean production standards the group continued.

""Support cities and communities in their programs to ban or regulate the use of single-use plastics and packaging products"" the group said.

BFFP raised the urgency for such measures noting that results of its 2020 brand audit showed only about two percent of plastic waste collected in the country can be considered recyclable materials.

""The biggest bulk at 98 percent is single-use plastics that are not recyclable and have no economic value"" the group said.

Recyclable material is ""any waste material retrieved from the waste stream and free from contamination that can still be converted into suitable beneficial use or for other purposes"" according to Republic Act (RA) 9003 (Ecological Solid Waste Management Act).

Newspapers ferrous scrap metal non-ferrous scrap metal used oil corrugated cardboard aluminum glass office paper and tin cans are among recyclable materials noted RA 9003.

Recycling plastics ""has never been the solution"" the group said.

""The real long-term response to the plastic waste problem is to regulate the production and use of this problematic product"" it said.

The group’s members have been spearheading brand auditing a citizen action that involves counting analyzing and documenting plastic types brands and companies responsible for the plastic waste that end up in ecosystems beaches and urban centers.

Its 2020 Philippine brand audit showed eight companies have been the top plastics polluters in the country during the past three years: Nestle Colgate-Palmolive Unilever Proctor and Gamble Universal Robina Corporation Monde Nissin Corporation Nutri-Asia Inc. and Liwayway Holdings

The 2020 Philippine brand audit covered 38580 pieces of branded plastic waste items recovered from 17 sites the group added.

By adopting this theme FDI is hoping to “motivate people to value and take care of their mouths and understand that by doing so they can also help protect their general health and well-being.”

World Oral Health Day is observed on March 20.

This year free dental check-ups oral health counselling and preventive procedures will be carried out at the community space adjacent to the Harbour Centre running along the Nubukalou Creek.

The Fiji Dental Association and the Fiji Dental Students Association are partnering with the School of Dentistry and Oral Health Fiji National University Colgate Palmolive (Fiji) Limited Wrigleys Oral Health Care Program and the Suva City Council to deliver this service.

Four key messages are being put forward as part of the “Be Proud of Your Mouth campaign:

1. Oral health is one of the main pillars of overall health and well-being

2. Managing risk factors for oral diseases can also help avoid other health conditions

3. Most oral health conditions are largely preventable and can be treated in their early stages

4. Universal Health Coverage: every person everywhere should have access to the health services they need without the risk of financial hardship when paying for them

Keeping these in mind the Fiji Dental Association together with the Fiji Dental Students Association would like to help you:

1. Look after oral health for overall health.

2. Protect your mouth while you’re on the go.

3. Learn good oral health habits.

4. Take charge of your oral health.

5. Learn more about eating a balanced low sugar diet.

6. Practice good oral hygiene routine.

7. Visit the dentist regularly.

We urge everyone in the greater Suva area who has not had access to a dentist this past 12 months to come over for a free check-up this Saturday from 9am to 4pm.

We will be there to empower encourage and provide personalized information about your oral health.

Let us all be responsible and take ownership of our oral health and retain the “Bula Smiles” for which we are globally famous for.

The associations would like to work with the media outlets to promote the “Be Proud of Your Mouth” message.

We have several dentists who can speak in vernacular too and are available on Friday early morning for radio station interviews."

The skyscraper was unveiled in 2014 just six years after the completion of the first Comcast Center tower. Designed by Foster and Partners and developed by Liberty Property Trust the building features a structure clad in glass and metal with angled beams and a frosted lantern that lights up at night.

The search for an architect had likely started right after Liberty Property Trust had acquired the site on August 19 2011. Soon after their selection Foster and Partners produced early sketches and models by April 2013.

The design showed a tall blocky tower split in three sections presenting one of the main elements of the current design. By the next month another model showed a change with the outer sections with curved sections protruding from the tower with the north section rising higher and the central structure becoming thinner when viewed from the north and south.

The next iteration showed the north and south sections at the same height and rose higher than before. The concept was topped with a large structure on the west side topped with a thin spire. The following version shows the elevator banks cooling towers and lantern centered along the north and south profile with the east and west faces of the lantern pushed into the structure. This version would have had a shorter roof height and more metal cladding on the east and west faces.

The following iteration shows the elevator banks cooling towers and lantern placed where they are today. The tower has a thinner lantern and the elevator banks rose higher. The next design after that shows a taller spire giving the top a dominating look though it also has a lower rooftop.

Compared to the last design the following version is very similar only eliminating the extra metal cladding on the corners of the office section of the skyscraper. The next version shows a final roof height of 911 feet and a finalized shape for the skyscraper.

The next design is the version that was first unveiled in 2014. The tower had a thinner lantern and the elevator banks were flush with the roof line. But at the time of the unveiling it seems that the design was unfinished as interiors were not done designing and the tower eventually had some slight revisions.

The final design was shown featuring the lantern being thickened from the north and south view. The lantern was originally shown with standard glass covering the structure but in the final design frosted glass covers the cross-braced structure. The elevator banks now extend one floor above the roof. The section under the roof and terraces was shown to have gradient glass that had dark glass and the bottom as it fades up to frosted white. The base also has angled cuts.

The bright feature on top is reminiscent of One Liberty Place and the other towers that broke through heights once thought unreachable. By now the tower has been open for nearly two years now with a beacon that crowns the expanding skyline. We can only wonder what building will pass the Comcast Technology Center in height next and how it will fit into the Philadelphia skyline.

Kennedy Boulevard is the first of a two-tower complex which had drastically changed the Center City skyline when it passed the height of One Liberty Place becoming Philadelphia’s tallest building. The structure was completed in 2008 and stands 974 feet and 58 stories tall with a concrete core and steel floors. The exterior features high quality mirror-like glass a departure from the traditional masonry style that Robert A.M. Stern Architects is known for as seen in limestone-clad towers such as The Alexander at 1601 Vine Street and 30 Park Place in New York City.

The history of the tower starts with Comcast looking for space in the city in the late 1990’s. The site where One Meridian Place just to the southwest of City Hall was being demolished at the time was the site of a proposed skyscraper dubbed Center City Tower which would have been a supertall standing 1050 feet high. But in 2000 rumors went around and the next year an announcement came that Liberty Property Trust and Robert A.M. Stern Architects were teaming up to build a skyscraper at 17th and John F. Kennedy Boulevard. Originally the tower was planned to stand 750 feet tall with every floor plate clad in limestone. A design prior to the finalized one shoed the same shape as the one that stands today but with a roughly 30-foot-tall pyramid on top bringing the structure’s height to 962 feet.

In January 2005 the final design was unveiled at the groundbreaking of the tower and the building officially opened on June 6 2008. By now the tower has adorned the skyline for over a decade and the skyscraper still makes a significant impact with its 1.3 million square feet of space. The high-rise is often said do look like a USB flash drive while others deride the design as “lazy” compared to the late 80’s towers as “just a glass box.” Regardless the building gave the Philadelphia skyline a modern look that changed the appearance of the city.

But the journey ended in disaster for many birds. As they flew through the city they became confused by the artificial lights of Philadelphia’s downtown skyscrapers. On the morning of Oct. 2 volunteers found over 1000 dead and injured birds that had collided with buildings and glass.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vYXJ0c2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzAzLzIxL3V0YWgtcG9seWdhbWlzdHMtcmV0dXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah polygamists return in Season 3 of 'Seeking Sister Wife' on TLC,"Recently 4-year-old Sadie Winder’s parents overheard her talking to her youth soccer coach.

“She’s pointing over at us and we can hear her saying ‘That’s my mom Tami. And that’s my mom Sophie’” said Sophie Winder who’s in a polygamous relationship with Colton Winder and his first wife. “Before we would be mortified. Like — oh crap what’s going to come of this?

“But now she’s able to just be who she is. She doesn’t have to worry about it. And honestly the coach didn’t think twice about it. I would like to think that we’ve normalized it enough that we don’t have to worry about those type of situations ever again.”

The Winders who live in the St. George area think their decision to be a part of the TV series “Seeking Sister Wife” has gone a long way toward that normalization. It’s the reason they signed on for Season 2 which aired in early 2019 and stayed on for Season 3 which begins Monday on TLC — 6 p.m. on Dish and DirecTV; 9 p.m. on Comcast.

“There has been a lot of negativity in the media associated with a belief in plural marriage” Colton said. “And we felt like this would be a good opportunity for us to put more of a positive face on it.”

All three of the adult Winders come from mainstream backgrounds in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and they readily admit that they weren’t completely open about their turn to polygamy at first.

“The norm for polygamists in Utah is just to keep your head down and stay out of the spotlight” Colton said. “And wear prairie dresses and hold hands” Sophie added.

The Winders break both those stereotypes. No distinctive apparel and — after a lot of discussion and prayer — they went public on a cable television show.

“We hadn’t been out in public” Tami said. “I mean even some of our family still didn’t know that we were living this way at that point. So I felt a lot of personal anxiety as well.”

Their immediate family members knew before the show but “extended family members and maybe more distant friends” found out when their episodes started airing. “And I think there were definitely people in our hometowns that didn’t know” Colton said.

And the family did not know about “Seeking Sister Wife.”

“I think most of them were probably reasonably OK with us being polygamous” Colton said. “I think some of them had a problem with us being open polygamists. Coming from a mainstream LDS background there’s definitely kind of this sense for some people of shame. That we’ve turned back to this archaic practice and we’re just not living right.”

And that was one of the things that factored into their decision to be on the show. “It took a lot of time for us to kind of overcome that mentality — that we didn’t just need to live our lives in the shadows” Colton said.

Change in Utah’s polygamy laws

A year after the first season of “Seeking Sister Wife” aired the Utah Legislature voted to decriminalize polygamy. It’s an infraction now not a felony. And the Winders lobbied for that on the show and at Utah’s Capitol.

“I like to think that maybe it made an impact” Colton said. “And that was our biggest reason for wanting to be on television — to try and make an impact for our community and try and improve our situation here at home in Utah.”

Sophie said that when she entered the marriage she was “fully prepared to be a closet wife — one that wasn’t public wasn’t known about because of the laws of Utah.” But since the change “it feels like a burden is lifted off of my shoulders because it was so horrible in that first year of marriage when nobody knew that we were married.”

Colton called the legislation “a huge blessing. Because it’s going to allow people to be more open. For families that are in abusive situations it’s going to make them hopefully feel more comfortable seeking assistance.”

Different kinds of polygamy

The Winders are one of five polygamous families in “Seeking Sister Wife” and they are the only ones who consider themselves Mormon fundamentalists. “For us this lifestyle is religious” Colton said.

That’s not true of all the other families.

“In Utah it’s really easy for us to forget there’s a bigger picture of polygamy than just what we have here in our state” Colton said. “There’s different iterations of it out there. And we just choose to try to respect everybody. … If other people choose to live it for reasons that are not religious that’s their choice.”

When the various families met at the end of Season 2 Sophie felt “a camaraderie” with them despite their differences. Tami found that “even though we were living polygamy for different reasons we all have a lot of common.”

Learning to be on TV

You don’t have to tell the Winders that they came across as somewhat stiff in their first season on “Seeking Sister Wife.” They know.

“I don’t think I ever got over the awkwardness of looking into a camera” Colton said. “Or not looking into a camera” Tami interjected.

(Reality show cast members are not supposed to look into the camera of course.)

But one of the reasons they agreed to return for another season was they thought they could do better the second time around. That they could continue to share their lives “without the awkwardness of figuring it all out from the first season” Sophie said.

“We felt more comfortable with how production did what they did. And so we were able to be more of our natural selves and share more about the growth of our family and coming together into one home and what that looks like.”

What’s coming this season

• In Season 2 Tami lived in one house and Sophie in another with Colton going back and forth. In Season 3 they all move in together. “Obviously there’s going to be some growing pains with that” Colton said.

• Fertility is a big issue. And there’s an addition to the family — Sophie gave birth to Ephraim in April 2020.

• And the title of the show is “Seeking Sister Wife” so — not surprisingly — the Winders are looking for Wife No. 3 and focusing on a woman named Kimberley. Not only is there the awkwardness of dating there’s the strain of four-way dating because Wives No. 1 and No.2 are involved. On top of that they’re doing it while the cameras are rolling.

“That” Sophie said “put our first date on steroids.”

“It’s definitely hard to meet someone for the first time in person while you’re being filmed” Tami said. “I think we were all really stressed.”

But they “don’t really consider it dating” Colton clarified reiterating that “this is a very religious lifestyle for us. … But with three people already in the relationship considering adding a fourth that definitely adds a lot of dynamics.”

That applies to everything in the Winders’ lives Tami said. “Even us deciding what to do for …”

“Dinner” Colton interjected. “Holidays” Tami continued as they all burst into laughter.",,,

The new Michigan health department order allows 20% capacity inside these outdoor venues up substantially from previous limits. But Gov. Gretchen Whitmer acknowledged Friday case rates overall are going up pointing especially to transmissions tied to youth sports.

""This uptick in numbers is serious and we all have to take this seriously. We are so close"" Whitmer said.

“But the big unknown factor here is can we 10 million Michiganders continue to take this seriously until we get to about that 70% (vaccinated) number and that’s what’s so crucial.”

Opinion:Governor should let more Tigers fans into Comerica Park

Column:Michigan high school athletes aren't doing one thing and it could cost them the season

Dr. Joneigh Khaldun the state's chief medical executive said at least 315 cases between January and the end of February are tied to youth sports. Outbreaks associated with K-12 students surpassed those tied to long-term care facilities for the first time during the pandemic she said.

The state is on the verge of another wave Khaldun warned.

""I'm concerned about our current numbers"" Khaldun said. ""I know it's getting warmer vaccines are rolling out and people are tired of this pandemic. But we are not out of the woods yet and we could potentially be at the beginning of another surge in Michigan.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CNN on Thursday that he believes Whitmer and Michigan need to consider holding off on removing any additional COVID-19 restrictions. He said it's understandable that people want to return to normalcy but the pandemic trends in the state are concerning.

""She's a really good governor I know. I think she's done some really good things. But I am telling them 'Just hold off for a bit' "" Fauci said.

""When you get the overwhelming majority of your population vaccinated the chances of there being a surge are miniscule. So just hang in there. Don't turn the switch on and off. Pull back gradually not all at once. ...That's not a good idea.""

In response Whitmer spokesman Bobby Leddy said the state will continue to take incremental steps to reopening while continuing to follow safety guidelines.

""To continue operating safely we must also provide businesses schools and communities the resources they need to keep people safe as they return to normal day-to-day activities. We will remain in close contact with our nation’s top health experts on best practices until we eliminate COVID-19 once and for all"" Leddy said.

The new order outlines strict new sports regulations that will take effect at the start of April.

""Beginning on April 2 2021 gatherings for the purpose of sports practice and competition involving persons age 13 to 19 are prohibited unless all such persons participate in a testing program as specified in the MDHHS publication entitled Interim Guidance for Athletics issued March 20 2021"" the order states referring to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Khaldun said these guidelines are important for the state to identify new cases and prevent spread.

Outdoor stadiums must establish an effective infection control plan in order to expand capacity to 20% Khaldun said. This includes:

Limiting groups sitting around each other to six people

Staggering entering and exiting for some fans

Wearing masks whenever a fan is not eating or drinking

Collecting contact information for all fans in order to potentially perform contact tracing. To make this easier the state is suggesting venues do not offer same-day ticket purchases.

For the Tigers and Comerica Park the previous seating limit was 1000. Now it'll be closer to 8200.

""We truly appreciate the ongoing partnership with the governor’s office and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services"" said Chris Granger group president Sports and Entertainment Ilitch Holdings.

“As the season progresses we look forward to continued coordination with public health and medical experts government officials and Major League Baseball to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all Detroit Tigers fans.”

When the state relaxed some restrictions on gatherings indoor dining and other activities earlier this year health officials expected to see more cases. But they hoped personal responsibility and increased vaccination rates would help stave off another pandemic wave.

In the last month essentially all of Michigan's COVID-19 trends have steadily headed in the wrong direction — including vaccination rates.

Khaldun said the current case rate is 173 cases per million up 77% since mid-February. The test positivity rate is 6.2% up 177% since mid-February.

As of Thursday Michigan had the seventh-highest case rate per 100000 people in the country over the last seven days. The current seven-day average matches rates from late October numbers that eventually prompted the state to implement a host of new restrictions in the fall.

Deaths which had dropped precipitously in the last month have started to level off. Hospitalizations are on the rise again.

At the same time Michigan dropped to 36th in the county in terms of vaccinations per 100000 residents. Only Indiana has fared worse in terms of the states surrounding Michigan according to the CDC.

The state has vaccinated more than 2.1 million people so far. That's more than 26% of the 16 and older population the state wants to vaccinate by the end of the year. But the per capita rate has slipped a bit.

Expanding vaccine eligibility to anyone 50 and older starting Monday — and all those 16 and older starting April 5 — is expected to ramp up vaccination rates in the state. That does depend on the state receiving enough doses to satisfy demand a consistent problem for every state in the country.

Eight CVS pharmacies began offering some vaccines across Michigan on Friday. And by Wednesday a massive vaccination clinic at Ford Field in Detroit expects to be able to vaccinate 6000 people a day.

Whitmer also renewed her push for Michigan lawmakers to work with her on appropriating billions in federal COVID-19 relief. The Legislature recently approved a pair of bills representing more than $600 million in tax relief for businesses funds for non-public schools and more.

But the governor has previously vetoed these funds. She has repeatedly objected to putting tax dollars into an unemployment fund traditionally filled by businesses and her state budget director said one of the bills was crafted in a way to give large businesses that fared well during the pandemic a big tax boost.

The governor has yet to explain in detail why she vetoed the education funding as GOP lawmakers have repeatedly noted.

“I would welcome legislators to spend some energy in this space because we're deploying these dollars right now to ramp up our antigen testing which is now necessary for our kids who want to participate in sports and necessary for a resumption of normal activities and normalcy."" Whitmer said.

""We need to deploy these resources and that I think is the most pressing issue that we hopefully can find some common ground on because people in Michigan need us to.”

Gretchen Whitmer and the state health department thousands of new fans would be allowed into Comerica Park on the Detroit Tigers opening day April 1 2021.

The new rules would allow for the first time since 2019 thousands of fans to cheer on the Tigers. Outdoor stadiums with fixed seating would be allowed to hold up to 20% capacity with certain COVID-19 mitigation plans in place.

The Tigers would be allowed to have 8200 seats filled on opening day - 20% of its 41083 - up from the 1000 originally allowed under the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. Tickets would go on sale for non-season pass holders at 10 a.m. March 25 on Tigers.com. Season pass holders would be able to get their tickets a few days ahead of time.

Attendees at Comerica Park games would be spaced strategically according to the Tigers website ""so they are socially distanced from other groups of seats."" Masks would be required and touchless mobile tickets and cashless transactions would be used.

Anyone attending a Tigers game would need to fill out a Gameday Wellness survey within 24 hours of the game according to the team's website. Confirmation of completion of the survey would be required for anyone entering the park.

For Tigers officials would be required to build an infection control plan in line with Michigan health department share it with the public send the plan to the local and state health department and administer a testing program for players.

It's not just the big leagues impacted by the governor's new orders. After a jump in cases connected to youth sports kids aged 13-19 in school contact sports will need to start getting tested weekly.

“We’re actually already testing many sports teams and working with schools to test. So it is feasible. We do have many antigen tests” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun Chief Medical Executive with the Michigan health department said.

With Michigan's cases back on the rise Khaldun said Michigan could potentially be at the beginning of another surge.

“How this plays out depends on what we all do collectively to protect ourselves and our families” she said.

The new health department changes would go into effect on Monday March 29 and would last until April 19.

On Monday some state Republicans called for the governor to open the stadium to more spectators. On the same day the governor's office and the Detroit Tigers announced separately they had been collaborating with one another for weeks on a potential increase in capacity at Comerica Park.

The new face of the organization — manager AJ Hinch — has no loyalties.

With two years of MLB experience the 26-year-old is determined to get to Comerica Park. But Alexander understands he must earn his spot with two methodical techniques: pitch-to-contact and overwhelming the strike zone.

MANAGER'S INSIGHT: The art of elevated fastballs and attacking weaknesses

""I had to show my value as a pitcher"" Alexander said Sunday. ""Obviously I don't throw hard. We have a lot of hard throwers a lot of impressive arms. I had to prove I could get outs just as effectively as those guys.""

The speed of Alexander's fastball is nothing to boast about. It sits around 89-91 mph. Meanwhile fellow left-hander Gregory Soto can pump his fastball at 101 mph and possesses closer potential. Lefty Derek Holland who is trying to swipe a roster opening as a non-roster invitee is hitting 95 mph with a surplus of strikeouts.

COVID CONCERNS: Spencer Turnbull 'unlikely' to be cleared before Tigers leave spring training

Depending on how the roster shakes out Hinch and general manager Al Avila and might have to choose between Holland and Alexander. That doesn't necessarily mean they're going to pick the player with the hardest fastball.

Alexander's forte is his command.

During Saturday's outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates Alexander only needed 19 pitches to cruise through two innings. He gave up two hits but the longest at-bat lasted a mere five pitches. He held the Pirates scoreless and generated one strikeout.

These situations are making Hinch's job difficult.

""This is a compliment to him but it's been hard to get him enough work because he's getting through his innings in seven eight nine pitches"" Hinch said Friday. ""I mean it's the perfect pitch efficiency. He's a Swiss Army knife type of pitcher which is why we love him in that hybrid role.""

This spring Alexander has logged nine innings across five games with a 3.00 ERA and six strikeouts. However the most important number is the walks: The left-hander has yet to allow one.

Across 14 games (two starts) and 36⅓ innings in 2020 Alexander picked up 34 strikeouts compared to nine walks. He set a major league reliever record with nine consecutive strikeouts.

FIXING THE ISSUE: Why Julio Teheran looks like his old self with the Tigers this spring

He struck out 47 batters and walked just seven through 53⅔ innings in 2019.

""I've gotten into a lot of trouble in the past with throwing too many strikes"" Alexander said. ""There's a big difference between throwing strikes and throwing quality strikes. I throw a lot of strikes. When I get into trouble is when I don't throw quality strikes heaters right down the middle. Sometimes I forget I just can't throw everything down the middle.

""I've had to learn and I've gotten better at it that I can throw balls and it's OK to walk people in certain situations. It's been a process.""

[ If Akil Baddoo keeps raking Tigers' AJ Hinch won't rule out five outfielders ]

Alexander wants his development to occur in the majors either as a starter or reliever. For now the Tigers are more interested in him coming out of the bullpen because he can eat innings without exhausting his arm.

If the Tigers keep Rule 5 draft pick Akil Baddoo which seems likely they'll have less flexibility with the bench and pitching staff. It's safe to assume Alexander had the inside track on one of the bullpen jobs entering camp because of his history with the organization.

Even as Holland a 12-year MLB veteran emerges as a strikeout-heavy option and righty Michael Fulmer could get relegated to the bullpen Alexander — a second-round pick in 2015 — will continue to focus on finesse over power.

And the left-hander is only getting wiser on the mound.

""I've gotten people out with 88 (mph) at every single level"" Alexander said earlier this spring. ""I've been able to put the ball wherever I want at every single level. If you can hit your spot wherever that may be I think no matter what you throw you're in a good spot.""

The image of the Italian chef on the ravioli cans has become a familiar sight to several decades of youth. However what many people don’t realize is that the chef pictured on the cans – unlike other stereotyped brand mascots such as Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben – was a real person who had a presence in Milton Pa.

Hector Boiardi (nee Ettore Boiardi) started the Chef Boyardee brand with brothers Mario and Paul in 1928 in Cleveland Ohio. By 1938 production moved to Milton where the canned and boxed Italian meals are still produced today. It is Hector's image that appears on the pasta packaging.

Hector and his family became a visible presence in Milton the next three decades as the once ailing industrial town had been revitalized with the factory's presence.

Anna Boiardi granddaughter of Mario and great-niece of Hector remembers visiting Milton often as a child. Now a cookbook author and television producer who lives in Florida Anna credits her love of cooking to her great-uncle and the rest of the Boiardi family. It started out with her trying one of the family products.

""When I was a kid my favorite favorite thing was the Chef Boyardee pizza kit"" Anna said. ""Other kids had the EZ Bake ovens.""

Anna who was born in Italy but grew up in New Jersey remembers having big family dinners with Hector uncle Paul Boiardi who still lives in Milton and the rest of the Boiardi family.

During her trips to Milton Anna's dad would take her to the Chef Boyardee factory. ""My dad would take us there all the time and I met people who worked with my grandfather"" Anna said. ""My grandfather died before I was born so I felt like I got to know about him through talking with the employees at the factory.""

""As a kid I didn't have a sense of how popular the brand was"" Anna said.

Boiardis come to America

The story of the Boiardi brand begins more than a century ago in Piacenza Italy where Hector was born in 1897. Hector along with brothers Paul and Mario immigrated to the United States as children. Hector quickly became a rising star in the culinary world. He and his brothers obtained jobs in the culinary department at the Plaza Hotel in New York.

""They grew up in kitchens. That was their education"" Anna said of the Boiardi brothers.

Within a year Hector was promoted to head chef. At the time fine dining in America did not include Italian cuisine according to Anna. ""In the early 1900s Italian food was not as ubiquitous as it is today. The fine foods were mostly French"" Anna said. Hector began putting Italian foods on the menu.

His cooking successes later took him to The Greenbriar Hotel in West Virginia where he oversaw catering for the wedding reception of President Woodrow Wilson according to the Chef Boyardee website.

Opening of Boiardi factory

By 1924 Hector's dream of opening a restaurant came true in Cleveland Ohio. He and his wife Helen opened Il Giardino d’Italia restaurant. The name meant “Garden of Italy” according to the Chef Boyardee website.

The restaurant soon gained popularity and became known for its delicious foods. ""Their patrons would ask them how to make sauces or asked about bringing pasta home. They started making tomato sauce and put it in old recycled milk bottles to sell"" Anna said. ""One of their customers was a truck driver and they asked him to take it through the country. He did and people loved it.""

By 1928 the Boiardis' small restaurant could not keep up with meeting the demand for sauce so he bought a factory building in Ohio to increase production. Hector eventually thought of a way to distribute his products more widely and efficiently.

“He came up with an idea to come up with a kit of spaghetti for women” said Cindy Inkrote president of the Northumberland County Historical Society. “Everything that is there was all self-contained. You got the pasta the sauce the cheese.” The packaging for the meal kits featured Hector's image and the slogan ""Just 12 minutes to prepare.""

The Boiardi name was quickly becoming recognizable by 1929. The name for products was changed to the phonetic spelling of Boy-ar-dee to make it easier for customers to pronounce. “It was an Americanized spelling” Inkrote said. Many immigrants at the time had their names Americanized. “It’s all about how people are assimilating into the culture.”

As production grew Hector and his brothers decided in 1938 to move operations to Milton Pa. an agricultural area that was several hours away from New York City and other major East Coast markets. The Susquehanna River was nearby and available for processing of the tomatoes. The Boiardis bought an abandoned silk mill in Milton and set up shop there with Hector as company president and Mario and Paul as vice-presidents.

“He moved here for easy access to tomatoes and as the concept grew they had easy access to real estate” Inkrote said. “The tomatoes were grown here and in the factory within 10 minutes.”

To keep up with demand for the Milton factory the Boiardi brothers had to ask farmers to convert their crops to tomatoes Anna said.

The Boiardi family also grew mushrooms close the factory at a location off Route 254. Inkrote said it was important to the Boiardis to use local ingredients.

The demand for the meal kits and canned pasta continued to grow during World War II. “And as women entered the workforce more and more needed sustainable quick meals"" Inkrote said.

""They also were the largest importer of Italian parmesan cheese at the time"" Anna said.

World War II efforts

The Milton factory on Marr Street which is still in the same location today worked around the clock during World War II to produce rations that went to American soldiers. More than 100 employees worked at the factory at this time.

The Chef Boyardee factory had to compete with other companies for the contract to produce the rations for the troops. ""The American diet at the time was mostly meat and potatoes"" Anna said.

Hector who was president of the company at the time spent many hours planning and figuring how to make make the foods so that it could be shipped overseas. ""My uncle Hector moved his bed into the office with a chalkboard. On the chalkboard he figured out the chemistry to make it work"" Anna said.

Hector started a What’s Cookin’ newsletter for his employees which featured a Chef Speaks column with his thoughts on the war effort. “Our soldiers will not let us down and we cannot afford to fail them” Hector wrote in the March 12 1943 issue. “It is up to us to make sure that every soldier like the one pictured in this issue gets plenty of good nourishing food. That is our job and no one can over-rate its importance.”

Pull Quote ""In times of uncertainty people turn to things that comfort them."" --Anna Boiardi

The local community applauded his war efforts and he was awarded a Gold Star the highest civilian honor by the United States War Department. A ceremony was held in Milton to honor the Boiardis and they received a pennant for the Army-Navy E award. That pennant is on display today at the Chef's Place community and event space in Milton.

""They honestly wanted to give back to a country that they felt had given them so much"" Anna said of the Boiardis' war efforts.

Boiardi factory sold; family still strong presence in Milton

By 1946 the Boiardis sold the Milton factory to American Home Foods for $6 million. However they still maintained a strong presence in Milton and Hector remained a consultant for the plant up until 1978. Hector continued to live in his Upper Market Street mansion in Milton until moving out of the area in the 1960s. Many local people remember seeing him around town as a jovial and welcoming person.

Anna recalls her great-uncle Hector as being ""one of the kindest most gentle people you ever met. He was soft spoken well mannered always impeccably dressed elegant and social. He was just lovely honestly.""

""Hector Boiardi was the kind of guy who would walk down the street and say hello"" said George Venios a Milton historian who runs the revitalization group T.I.M.E. (The Improved Milton Experience).

Though Anna didn't get to know her grandfather Mario Boiardi she recalled hearing he was an animal lover. ""He couldn't pass a stray animal and not bring them home"" Anna said.

During her trips to Milton as a child Anna would sometimes go out to eat with the family at a hotel restaurant there. She recalled that Hector did not ask the restaurant to change things with the food or the way they did service. ""He had a real respect for working people and chefs"" Anna said.

There are still people living in the area today who worked at the Milton plant and remember Hector and his brothers according to Venios. ""They were very family-oriented and they were friends with many people here.""

Venios added that the residents of Milton ""are very proud"" that the Boiardis built their iconic brand there. ""It's been on our minds to do something recognizing Hector probably one of our most famous residents ever.""

Paul Boiardi son of Hector's brother Mario remains the sole Boiardi in Milton and is a well-known presence there. Over the years Paul 86 has attended events and ""loves to talk about the family legacy"" according to Venios. ""Paul is a very very lighthearted and fun person to be with."" Paul was not available to come to Chef's Place for an in-person the day NorthcentralPa.com visited Chef's Place.

The Boiardi brand today

By 1996 American Home Foods turned its food division into International Home Foods. The company continued to produce the Chef Boyardee product line in Milton. In 2000 ConAgra purchased the company and remains the owner today.

Though Hector passed away in 1985 at the age of 87 his legacy still lives on in Milton. Venios runs Chef's Place in Milton which serves as a Boiardi musuem as well as an event venue.

Pictures of Hector his brothers and the Chef Boyardee factory in the 1940s and 1950s adorn the walls. Vintage packages and cans of Chef Boyardee's most popular products -- beefaroni ravioli Pizza Maker kit -- are on display on shelves along the walls. The space which is on Front Street on the second floor of the Moose Family Center has an art deco decor style. ""It's art deco due to Hector coming here in 1937"" Venios said.

In the same spirit of giving back that the Boiardi brothers had Venios partnered with Penn State Cooperative Extension to bring in cooking classes for kids at Chef's Place. The venue also held adult cooking classes until COVID-19 slowed things down last year. Venios is hoping to begin these classes again soon.

To help meet food needs during the pandemic Chef's Place held a drive-through tomato plant giveaway last summer. Tomato plants were chosen because they were the main crop that the Chef Boyardee plant used as well as for the fact that a renewed interest WW II Victory Gardens was reviving. People planted Victory Gardens during the war to not only supplement rations but boost morale.

""This year we're going to have a tomato plant giveaway with 2400 plants on Saturday May 8"" Venios said.

All the activities at Chef's Place are made possible by generous donations from the ConAgra Brands Foundation. ""ConAgra has been very good to us. Fortunately they understand it's a very big part of our community"" Venios said.

93 years and counting

The Chef Boyardee brand has weathered many changes since its conception in 1928. It has survived through the Great Depression several wars and more recently COVID-19. The beginning of the pandemic last year actually boosted sales of the pre-packaged Italian meals. ""The factory worked around the clock during the shutdown"" Venios said.

People stocked up on non-perishable food items at the grocery store as supplies dwindled. The pandemic was a scary time for many people and they sought things that would comfort them. Anna said ""food is really comforting to people.""

Many turned to nostalgic brands from their childhood such as Chef Boyardee which was something they ate in happier times. ""In times of uncertainty people turn to things that comfort them"" Anna said.

Anna is still amazed at the depth of knowledge the Boiardi brothers had when it came to running a large-scale food business. No one knew back in the late 1920s that Hector's idea of producing a spaghetti kit would still be around today.

""The company is 93 years old. That's quite an achievement"" Anna said.

The Redmi Note 10 Pro is the high-end model in the series. It is known as Note 10 Pro Max in India while in the rest of the world it is known as the Note 10 Pro. It comes with a new elegant design and major upgrades over its predecessor. The Note 10 Pro is truly an all-rounder. If you ask me “Where does the Note 10 Pro compromise to get the price this low?” Well it would have been a tough one to answer. But today we have got the answer thanks to a YouTube video showing the durability test of the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max/Note 10 Pro.

Water Test

Gupta Information Systems first do the water test of the Redmi Note 10 Pro. In this test the device is submerged in water for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes the device is taken out. It boots up and the display works perfectly. However when the SIM slot is removed a lot of water is seen there. The water went to the device from the sim slot and after a few minutes Note 10 Pro turns off automatically. It does not boot up; the display stops working and it just vibrates.

After some time Note 10 Pro turns on automatically. It survives the water test but if you have a Redmi Note 10 Pro then you now know that you have to keep the device away from water. A lot of water was present inside the Sim Slot and this time it might have got lucky but this much water could have killed the device.

Scratch Test

First of all let me tell you the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the front as well as the back. On the front the display starts scratching at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7. The scratch resistance is the same on the rear side. The camera module is glass however the LED cover is plastic. The frame of the device is also plastic.

Drop Test

The device is first dropped from waist height from all four corners and it survives. The device also survives when it drops from the rear side. However when dropped from the front side the display cracks and it stops working. That’s a major fail considering a very low height. The back panel cracks after it dropped from a higher height.

Bend Test

At this point the device was completely cracked. To protect the hands the YouTuber covered the display with a screen protector. The YouTuber bents the Redmi Note 10 Pro while applying the pressure from the screen. And the Note 10 Pro bends into two parts just like a foldable phone. It is an epic fail at the end of the video the YouTuber suggests not to keep the Note 10 Pro in your back pocket as it can bend very easily.

Costco (COST 1.96%) and Home Depot (HD -0.47%) share many similarities as investments. Each company dominates its niche of the retail industry and each has a long track record for generating solid returns for shareholders. Both just experienced record growth years in 2020 due to the pandemic.

But which one looks likely to be the better investment in 2021 and beyond?

Comparing growth rates

While both companies gained market share during the past year the edge goes to Costco in the growth department. Its comparable-store sales gains consistently outpaced national peers like Walmart (WMT 1.25%) in recent quarters. Costco's February revenue for example grew by 14% in the core U.S. market after adjusting for gasoline price swings.

Walmart's Sam's Club has been expanding at a slower pace with net sales up 8.7% for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. The warehouse giant's success also shows up in its renewal rate which recently edged up to a record 91%.

Home Depot's latest results look closer to average for its peer group by comparison. It grew sales by 20% in its fiscal 2020 while Lowe's (LOW -0.10%) notched a 24% gain. The home improvement retailer is also opening stores at a slower pace with just 5 new locations added in 2020 compared to the 21 that Costco is planning for the current fiscal year.

Profits and cash returns

On the other hand Home Depot is the clear winner when it comes to profits and cash returns. It boasts a higher operating profit margin than Costco and dominates Lowe's and most other national retailers on this score.

Home Depot promises to deliver more cash to investors as well. Management targets an annual return of 55% of earnings to shareholders compared to 35% for Lowe's. That commitment supported a 10% hike in Home Depot's dividend for its March distribution. In contrast while Costco sporadically issues large special dividends its regular payout commitment translates into a 0.9% annual yield at current share prices the lowest in its stock cohort.

The outlook

Home Depot's stock has fared much better since the start of the pandemic which likely flows from the fact that investors are expecting no big slowdown in its sales as the threat of the coronavirus recedes. Sales will likely grow modestly in 2021 management forecast in late February as earnings grow following the prior year's spike. The housing market is booming across the country and factors such as income growth the age of housing stock and home prices all suggest further robust gains ahead.

In contrast business in Costco's portion of the retail world could be in for a relatively sluggish period as demand slackens for bulk quantities of consumer staples like paper towels and laundry detergent. Tens of millions of Americans might soon ease back into their pre-pandemic shopping habits of visiting several stores more often to get the various items they seek rather than seeking to consolidate their shopping trips as much as possible. That could further pressure the warehouse giant's sales over the next few quarters.

Valuation and bottom line

Yet that potential slowdown appears to already be baked into Costco's stock price which participated in the wider market's surge over the past 12 months. You can now buy shares of the warehouse retailer for about 0.8 times annual sales. That's less than half Home Depot's valuation by the same metric and below the 1 times sales you'd have to pay to buy shares of Target (TGT 1.30%).

Costco is more expensive on a price-to-earnings basis though as investors are paying over 30 times annual earnings for the stock. That premium is partly thanks to the chain's unusually low profit margin.

On the other hand cash returns are the best reason to prefer Home Depot even at its premium valuation. You get a bigger dividend commitment and are likely to benefit from aggressive stock buybacks over the next few years by holding the home improvement leader.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMzYxNDg4L2hvdy1yaWNoLWlzLXRoZS1jb3N0Y28tY2VvLWFuZC13aGF0cy10aGUtYXZlcmFnZS1wYXktb2YtaXRzLWVtcGxveWVlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Rich Is The Costco CEO And What's The Average Pay Of Its Employees?,"How Rich Is The Costco CEO And What's The Average Pay Of Its Employees?

Jim Sinegal is the co-founder and now-retired CEO of American membership-based big-box retailer Costco. Despite building one of the largest retail chains in America Sinegal consistently earned less than the average salary of CEOs and has called it ""wrong"" to have massive disparities between employee and executive pay according to Business Insider. During his leadership tenure Sinegal introduced many of Costco's strategies to keep overhead costs as low as possible including its minimalistic retail spaces limited inventory and total lack of pricey advertising. To this day this money allocation strategy has allowed for higher wages across the entire staff.

Born into a working-class family in Pittsburgh Jim Sinegal worked his way through various grocery chains before founding one of the most profitable retailers in the nation. He co-founded Costco with Seattle-based attorney Jeff Brotman in 1983 (via Britannica). During his 35-year career at Costco HQ the humble Sinegal was publicly praised for his generosity frugality and going out of his way to help his employees succeed and be happy. So how much was he paid as CEO? Sinegal earned a $350000 salary during his tenure at Costco – which was far less than the industry average of $1 million for Fortune 100 CEOs at the time.

When Sinegal went into retirement in 2018 he owned over $263 million in Costco stock (via The Seattle Times). Craig Jelinek is the current Costco CEO. He succeeded Sinegal who stepped down in 2012. Jelinek had worked with Sinegal since his early days at FedMart.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvY29zdGNvLXNlbGxpbmctcG90dGVkLWxhdmVuZGVyLXRyZWVzLTIxMTUzMTU5OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Is Selling Potted Lavender Trees That Will Make Your Patio Smell Like a Spa,"Spring is officially here which means we’re going to be savoring every minute in the sun (and outside of our homes) as much as possible.

After all if we’re not really traveling anywhere at least we can turn our outdoor spaces into the relaxing oasis we deserve. Raise your hand if you’re right there with us shopping for patio furniture and decor gas fire pits and pretty plants. To that end we sat up and took notice when we saw that Costco is selling heavenly potted lavender trees — and we couldn’t be more in love.

Costco fan account @costcosisters found the sweet-smelling plants captioned their post: “Cute little lavender trees in a water reservoir planter!💜” Not only is a lavender tree the perfect way to welcome the spring season with its purple flowers but the scent sure to make you feel as if you were in an aromatic spa. Or in France.

This is a serious upgrade from the aromatherapy diffusers many of us currently own and these lavender trees will look just as beautiful on your patio as they will smell. Ah we can see it now. Us with our eyes closed taking a nap on a lounge chair or swinging hammock and breathing in the scent… total bliss!

Although Russell didn’t write about it there’s another reason he’s not about to retire — to Monte Carlo or elsewhere. He’s addicted to being a financial guru. He’s addicted to reading all those newspapers to sifting through all that information to trying to master the endlessly challenging puzzle of the market. Russell says he’s often wondered how many man-hours are applied to the stock market every week. “It’s unbelievable! Millions of hours trying to figure this thing out.”

The Times-Reporter

UHRICHSVILLE Part of the Westside is a lot cleaner as a result of a cooperative effort of city government the Twin Cities Kids’ Coalition Inc. and CSX Transportation.

CSX demolished abandoned railroad buildings on W. First and Packer streets on Monday at the urging of Mayor Mark Haney and kids' coalition founder and president Wendy Mann.

""It looks a lot better"" Haney said. ""It's one less place where we have people that are dealing or doing drugs issues like that.""

He gave credit to Mann for researching the ownership of the property to allow them to contact the right people to resolve the problem.

She started research a year ago.

Mann originally thought R.J. Corman owned the space but learned that it was actually owned by CSX headquartered in Jacksonville Fla.

Haney said the abandoned rail station still had a wood-burning stove and a safe. When he visited the site to take pictures he found evidence that people had been inside -- there were food and beverage cans -- but no drug paraphernalia.

CSX representatives visited the eyesore in the fall after Mann made the initial contacts Haney said.

""We both were able to make phone calls"" he said. ""She did a lot more of the legwork than I had to. She made my job a little easier. When a resident can get that far to where I don't have to do much other than talk to the railroad and discuss our worries and concerns it's a great thing.""

Haney said the city got help from Randy Orben CSX resident vice president for public affairs.

The mayor said the buildings were a problem before he took office in 2020

""We were happy to see it come down"" Haney said. ""That's the first of many. We hope that the residents will step to the plate like she did and take a little pride in the 922 down here and step up and be willing to help us out in that way.""

Mann said she continues to work with absentee property owners by informing them about the conditions of the homes they rent. She hopes to see more success in improving the appearance of the community as happened when the railroad demolished the remnants of its station

""This is such a great step in the right direction for having a positive community"" Mann wrote on Facebook. ""Change is not easy but to fix where we are we need a change. We are very excited to work on future projects.""

The Belleview Police Department was told that the northbound 214-car CSX train was en route from Tampa to Waycross Georgia carrying auto transport freight.

Police said the pickup was eastbound on CR 25. The crossing gate was down but the man whose name was not provided by police drove around it. The train hit the back of the pickup. Officials did not estimate the train's speed at the time of impact.

James Lucas Marion County Fire Rescue spokesman said his agency was assigned the call at 11:11 p.m. Friday and arrived at 11:16 p.m. The two people who were in the pickup refused medical treatment.

The man and woman who were standing not far from the mangled truck as the investigation continued declined comment to a Star-Banner reporter at the scene.

BPD officials said the driver will be ticketed for driving around a railroad crossing.

Next day kids said there’d be no trace of you; like you disappeared in thin air.

Nobody questioned how kids knew that. Nevertheless it helped make the mystique of the tunnel scarier … In the middle all you can see is a tiny light on each end. There are noises too; made by the the rats and other animals like raccoons and possums. And the animals don’t like the kids disturbing their sanctuary.

This afternoon during a press conference Minister of Home Affairs Wilfred Abrahams announced that in order to effect sweeping changes at the GIS the new board appointed includes Rev Dr Lucille Baird (chairman) Dr Carl Ward (deputy chairman) members Stephanie Chase Rev Lennox Boyce Cheryl Moore Kwame Bradshaw a sitting magistrate and the Superintendent of Prisons or his nominee.

In addition children’s advocate and UNICEF representative Faith Marshall-Harris and Dr Adrian Cummins have been retained to help effect changes at GIS.

“We are going to strip the institution and rebuild that institution properly” he said.

“I would like to turn a new page and start a new chapter in the oversight and management of the Government Industrial School in Barbados. As I said before we will be calling on Mrs Faith Marshall-Harris UNICEF and Attorney Dr Adrian Cummins in leading the process in transformation in the structure and management of the facility under the new Board of Management of the Government Industrial School” Abrahams added.

He added that with the new thinking that will be reflected in both the Child Protection legislation as well as the Child Justice Bill the new board has been charged to develop policies and programmes that reflect the philosophy that children have rights and deserve to be nurtured.

“To this end I will be meeting with the new Board of GIS next week to impress upon them the need to work with UNICEF in reformatting and relooking the emphasis and priorities of that institution. I have personally not ruled out a name change or even a deemphasizing of the institutional care. These are among the recommendations I would like to see emanating from the new Board under the chairmanship of Rev Dr Baird and in consultation with UNICEF and Faith Marshall-Harris.

“There is a lot that plagues the institution and for us to move forward we have to clear all of that. We have to regain the trust of the public of Barbados which has been shaken by this incident. All outstanding complaints that have not been investigated are to be investigated” he said.

The Minister explained that the reason the new Child Justice Bill has not been debated in Parliament is due to delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic along with reservations from Cabinet that there is a need to closely develop the Child Protection Legislation.

Abrahams also said that the Ministry of Education has pledged its support to working with the Board and its advisors to tailor the curriculum to make it relevant to the current generation of children to give them the best chance possible on completing the residential programme.

“Being in any state facility is a difficult experience but we must do our best not to make it more challenging than it needs to be less we damage the lives and crush the spirits of those we are intending to help”.

The Minister said he has apologized to the mother and grandmother of the 14-year-old child who was photographed in the cell. He added that he has confidence in the staff at the GIS who have acted on the guidance and practices outlined at a policy level.

“In the past 48 hours I have spoken to persons associated with this unfortunate saga and we have all agreed that we should move to put this incident behind us and move forward with a common sense of progressive purpose in the furtherance of the welfare and well-being of our children . . .

“I am satisfied that we have been making tremendous progress in relation to overcoming the difficulties that we face at GIS. The situation is not ideal but we have to work with what we have and we will do better by our children and the wards under our care” Abrahams said.

When asked if the girls at the institution would be relocated pending the completion of the investigations Abrahams said this would be a knee jerk reaction that does not have to be taken at this time.

He made it clear that it would be reckless for him to say the wards would be transferred when he was aware of the particular circumstances in relation to the students.

“I am not prepared to make a blanket decision in relation to anyone or even the running of the facility at this point in time. We need to consider each situation on its merit” he said.

Minister Abrahams also pointed out that he has been in contact with former wards of the GIS who have shared both positive and negative experiences regarding their time spent at the institution with him.

“I made a specific point of not reaching out to anybody who an investigator or the board might be looking to investigate their complaints. I do however once things have settled plan to speak to everybody” (AH)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpL2RlbGhpLW5vLWZ1bmRzLXRvLW1haW50YWluLWl0LW5pY2hvbHNvbi1jZW1ldGVyeS1zbG93bHktZmFsbHMtaW50by1kaXNyZXBhaXItNzIzNjQ3Ni_SAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9kZWxoaS9kZWxoaS1uby1mdW5kcy10by1tYWludGFpbi1pdC1uaWNob2xzb24tY2VtZXRlcnktc2xvd2x5LWZhbGxzLWludG8tZGlzcmVwYWlyLTcyMzY0NzYvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delhi: No funds to maintain it Nicholson Cemetery slowly falls into disrepair,"A plant has come out of the cracks on James Cummins’ grave in Nicholson Cemetery at Kashmere Gate. The 26-year-old telegraph master was killed by lightning on July 28 1874 in Delhi leaving behind “a widow and infant daughter to bewail their loss”.

A few steps ahead a neem tree stands between two graves obscuring them with dry yellow leaves that are hiding broken marble and bricks sinking into the ground.

At the northern end of the cemetery dotted with broken headstones wilting and overgrown vegetation is the grave of Alexander William Murray.

A lieutenant in the 42nd Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry Murray “fell whilst encouraging his men to follow his own brave example on 14th September 1857” during the Siege of Delhi.

Bougainvillea vines droop over pieces of red sandstone on his grave that are falling apart exposing the cement underneath.

A recent documentation of the cemetery by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) a non-profit found over 2400 historical graves dating back upto 1857.

“Almost 99% of graves are in very poor condition here” said Ajay Kumar project director at the Delhi chapter of INTACH. “It may be bitter but this place and the graves here are still part of our history.”

On August 15 2022 India will complete 75 years of Independ-ence for which celebrations have already begun in Delhi 75 weeks in advance. The Central government has formed a committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to plan activities for marking the occasion.

Nicholson Cemetery’s establishment is linked with the Indian Mutiny of 1857 which is considered the first war of Independence. The cemetery came up when the need for a burial place increased in Delhi which was captured by rebel troops from Meerut and witnessed a series of battles over the summer of 1857. It was conquered again by the British in September 1857 as per INTACH.

The cemetery is named after Brigadier-General John Nicholson who was wounded during the storming of Kashmere Gate and died a few days later on September 23 1857. His grave is near the entrance protected by an iron grill and maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

Other historical graves in the cemetery do not have the ASI’s protection tag the reason behind which was not answered by a spokesperson of the agency and have therefore suffered significant damage overtime due to neglect.

In 2018 INTACH started making a detailed project report for restoration of the place funded by the British Association for Cemeteries in South Asia (BACSA). The estimated total cost of the project came up to Rs 5.8 crore. As a pilot about 8-10 graves were restored said Kumar from INTACH including that of Imre Schwaiger an art-collector from Hungary his wife Nelly and their son Leonard who were buried together.

Seven thick volumes of books detailing each grave the repairs required and how the project should be taken forward was also made. However lack of funds has now brought operations to a close.

BACSA’s website states that the estimated project costs are beyond its resources. Denis Love projects coordinator at BACSA said “We and INTACH are considering further work and are in touch with the Delhi Cemeteries Committee. BACSA is a small UK charity supported by its members… in the case of the Nicholson Cemetery any further conservation will depend on the generosity of more donors.”

Swapna Liddle convenor of INTACH-Delhi said “The cemetery is an important cultural place and has a huge potential for tourism. Cemeteries also serve as a public space which is something we should recognise.”

Besides the historical graves which includes British soldiers and civilians the 8.8 acre Nicholson Cemetery is also a resting place of Indians which include many recent burials. These graves are segregated from the old section and are maintained from the funds provided by families of the deceased to the Delhi Cemeteries Committee.

Eugene Ratnam secretary of the Committee said they cannot take up restoration of the historical graves on their own due to financial limitations except clearing the vegetation once in a year on All Souls’ Day.

He said the British High Commission has taken initiative in the past to better maintain the cemetery but over time the measures on ground have reduced. He also said that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on request of surviving family members of British personnel buried here have relocated a few graves to the Delhi War Cemetery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWN0cmFja2VyLmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMS1rb2xrYXRhLWtuaWdodC1yaWRlcnMta2tyLWZ1bGwtc2NoZWR1bGUtd2l0aC12ZW51ZS1kYXRlLW1hdGNoLXRpbWluZ3MtYW5kLXBkZi1kb3dubG9hZC_SAYIBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3JpY3RyYWNrZXIuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIxLWtvbGthdGEta25pZ2h0LXJpZGVycy1ra3ItZnVsbC1zY2hlZHVsZS13aXRoLXZlbnVlLWRhdGUtbWF0Y2gtdGltaW5ncy1hbmQtcGRmLWRvd25sb2FkLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IPL 2021: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) Full Schedule with Venue Date Match Timings and PDF Download,"Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will be eyeing an improved outing in IPL 2021 after failing to do well in IPL 2020. Throughout the season the two-time champions struggled for consistency and eventually finished at the fifth spot. They missed out on a playoff spot due to their poor net run-rate (-0.214) as they finished the season with 7 wins and as many losses.

The likes of Varun Chakravarthy and Eoin Morgan did well but the failure of big names like Sunil Narine Dinesh Karthik and Andre Russell cost the team big. KKR’s season was also marred by several other incidents like Karthik stepping down as the captain after seven games and Narine getting suspended for a suspected bowling action.

Morgan was later named as the captain but he too could not make the team perform well consistently. But hopes will be high from the England star in the upcoming season. Narine also returned to action later but was from his best. He also failed to make an impact as an opener as KKR were compelled to try out several combinations at the top.

Ahead of the new season KKR bought some experienced players like Shakib al Hasan Karun Nair and Harbhajan Singh in the auction and would be hoping that their long wait for a third IPL title comes to an end. The likes of Shakib and Harbhajan know what it takes to win the IPL and their experience will come handy for the Kolkata-based outfit which has not won the tournament since 2014.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether CVS Health's current trading price of US$73.18 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at CVS Health’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

View our latest analysis for CVS Health

What is CVS Health worth?

Good news investors! CVS Health is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that CVS Health’s ratio of 13.33x is below its peer average of 23.93x which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Healthcare industry. Another thing to keep in mind is that CVS Health’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its industry peers a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon and once it’s there it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.

Can we expect growth from CVS Health?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. CVS Health's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 34% indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? Since CVS is currently below the industry PE ratio it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider which could explain the current price multiple.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CVS for a while now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet which means it’s not too late to buy CVS. But before you make any investment decisions consider other factors such as the track record of its management team in order to make a well-informed investment decision.

So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. You'd be interested to know that we found 1 warning sign for CVS Health and you'll want to know about this.

“People got nervous when CVS bought Aetna” William R. Peelle Jr. president of the board of trustees at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford said. “We’ve been through this time and time again. The one thing that Hartford does worry about is every time you move the CEO out of Hartford to another city we’re not going to get the same amount of attention.”

The Hartford which traces its roots in Hartford back 200 years and employs thousands at its headquarters in Asylum Hill confirmed last week that larger rival Zurich Switzerland-based Chubb Ltd. had approached the company March 11 with a $23 billion buyout offer. An acquisition agreement has not been announced and it is not definite that one will come together.

A potential acquisition by Chubb whose U.S. headquarters is in New Jersey raises the specter of both the loss of a Hartford headquarters but corporate and administrative jobs that overlap between the two property-casualty insurers. The possibility of losing jobs in the merger in Hartford comes as the pandemic is expected to change just how many workers will return regularly to offices in downtown Hartford.

Workers in and around downtown are an essential part of the economic ecosystem of the city frequenting shops restaurants and sporting events. Corporate employees also are potential tenants for new downtown apartments.

David Souder associate dean of graduate programs at UConn’s School of Business said a possible Chubb acquisition of The Hartford would differ from CVS Health Corp.’s 2018 takeover of Hartford-based Aetna Inc. another major insurer with deep roots in the city.

Aetna the Hartford-based health insurer was acquired by owned by Woonsocket R.I-based CVS Health Corp. in 2018.

The combination of CVS and Aetna brought together two different businesses — a pharmacy chain with a health insurer — that didn’t make for a lot of overlap. That isn’t the case with Chubb and The Hartford which while focusing on different insurance segments are basically in the same business Souder said.

In such instances cutting jobs to save expenses is typical Souder said.

“You’re going to change something” Souder said. “It doesn’t have to be bad for the area but it makes sense that’s where everyone’s eyes are.”

The Hartford employs 18500 with 6100 in Connecticut.

Founded in 1810 the insurer — taking its name from its birthplace city — has made its headquarters on Asylum Hill on the edge of downtown. The insurer’s original Neo-Classical Revival-style building remains a distinctive landmark with its two-story Ionic portico low central dome.

Hartford’s Corning Fountain in Bushnell Park also is topped with a stag the trademark logo of The Hartford Financial Services Group.

The Hartford’s trademark logo — a stag crossing a river — dates to at least 1861 when it appeared on a policy insuring Abraham Lincoln’s home in Springfield Ill.

“Even the stag on the Corning Fountain equates to their symbolic pedigree” said Tyler Smith Hartford architect and the son of the late Aetna chairman Olcott Smith. Smith was referring to the fountain in Hartford’s Bushnell Park

The era of “The Bishops” — a group of high-powered business executives in the city who invested and influenced the city’s path forward — has been over for decades. The expansion of businesses in an ever-widening global marketplace continues to unfold and quicken its pace.

Even so Smith said he is convinced that where companies are headquartered fosters sharper attention on that area.

“I did get the feeling that when the home offices were in Hartford there was sort of a collective sense that this was my community and I was going to be fully engaged in it” Smith said. “My gut tells me that is a hard concept to maintain if your corporate headquarters are somewhere else.”

Souder said it is possible that if Chubb acquires The Hartford it could still maintain a significant presence in Hartford much the same way as Travelers Cos. now does even though its headquarters is out of state. Downtown Hartford is Travelers’ largest employment site across the company.

Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin praised The Hartford as the model of a corporate citizen ranging from millions of dollars in investment in Asylum Hill and their involvement in the Boys and Girls Club to their apprenticeship and partnership with downtown Hartford’s Capital Community College.

In 2017 The Hartford’s chief executive officer Christopher Swift joined with the CEOs of Aetna and the Travelers to give Hartford $50 million over five years as it faced fiscal and budget turmoil.

“The leadership of The Hartford including Chris Swift and much of his senior team have been personally actively committed to building a stronger Hartford in partnership with the city” Bronin said.

Bronin who once worked for The Hartford said he would be watching how Chubb’s offer to The Hartford plays out but he declined to comment directly on it.

The Hartford Foundation for Public Giving a major philanthropic organization in Greater Hartford said it believes The Hartford will remain active in the community.

“As the region’s community foundation the Hartford Foundation is optimistic that the company’s deep commitment to this community will continue regardless of any decision its Board of Directors might make about a potential merger or acquisition” Jay Williams the foundation’s president said in a statement.

The headquarters of the Hartford Financial Services Group.

While some Wall Street analysts poked holes in the potential merger others said there were real reasons for serious consideration but that Chubb would have to raise the stakes on what it is willing pay. Chubb has disclosed it is offering $65 a share valuing the deal at about $23 billion.

Cathy Seifert an analyst at CFRA Research said in a note to investors Friday that a combination “makes sense” bringing together The Hartford’s robust insurance for small businesses with Chubb’s large commercial franchise.

“We also see [The Hartford’s] diverse executive team adding to [Chubb’s] breadth and depth of managerial skill” Seifert wrote. “But we think Chubb will have to raise its offer and we caution that this negotiation process may not be smooth.”

On Friday just a day after the acquisition talks were disclosed some employees of The Hartford already were considering their options should a deal go through.

Denis Horrigan partner and co-founder of Connecticut Wealth Management in Farmington said his firm has already been in touch with executives of The Hartford who are clients “and have had some conversations” about their financial plans if a Chubb acquisition goes through.

“There are a lot of people in their 50s whose net worth increased significantly on paper” he said referring to the sharp rise in The Hartford’s share price on news of Chubb’s interest. “They might retire or take on a new challenge in life and not deal with the headaches a merger brings on.”

As one of the first models to shatter glass ceilings for plus-size women Ashley Graham is responsible for an endless well of my gratitude. She looks damn fine and more importantly advocates for people of all sizes to feel good about themselves as hard as traditional beauty standards (and jeans) can make it. Graham walks the unfiltered walk in all things so when she posted a shot of her skincare favorites to Instagram this week I screenshotted that baby for future reference.

The spread of six items reveals some expected inclusions like St. Tropez Self Tan Purity Bronzing Water Face Mist since Graham just partnered with the brand. Also present was a hyaluronic acid serum from Mario Badescu Avya's non-foaming cleanser extremely pricey eye masks and the star of today's show: A $10 body moisturizer with reviews that rival those for the $115 eye treatment.

Graham's ""favorite"" sticker-endorsed Flamingo Deep Nourishing Cream grabs over 400 five-star reviews on the brand's website where the shaving-focused brand has created a handful of moisturizing essentials. The brand's background means that it's no ordinary moisturizer but an all-over cream that gently speeds cell turnover for your closest shave (and softest skin even if you haven't picked up a razor in many months. Ahem).

Shoppers compare the consistency to Charlotte Tilbury's $64 Magic Cream given the matching decadent lusciously whipped texture. ""I have dry and aging skin and this makes my skin soft and supple"" one person says as another writes that they're giving it to several of their friends since ""we're all senior citizens who refuse to give up."" Love it.

Those with naturally dry flaky skin write that post-Nourishing Cream they feel as if they've gotten a facial their ashy skin ""breathing a sign of relief"" with every use. It maintains that buttery softness for 48 hours even through Wyoming's dry air — and multiple people write that it's even more moisturizing than Gold Bond their previous go-to.

Someone else christens it a ""miracle in a jar"" and a shopper with eczema echoes that the Nourishing Cream ""has been working miracles"" for their super-sensitive skin. Those with psoriasis offer the same praise: Their skin is thankful for the lotion. The enthusiasm makes sense since Flamingo says the formula is dermatologist-tested. Cane sugar-derived squalane hydrates with a dose of moisture while white willow bark provides a gentle source of exfoliating salicylic acid and shea butter reinforces the skin's barrier.

""Best product ever"" a last person writes. ""My skin has never felt so good. I'm hooked."" For $10 that's an addiction to savor."

The 58-year-old doesn’t burnish his bold-names cred working the social circuit where other executives hobnob.

In the long history of General Electric its chief executives have come up through the ranks and in modern memory embodied managerial archetypes tuned to their times: Jack Welch the celebrity CEO who built a sprawling conglomerate and Jeff Immelt the torchbearer for digital transformation.

Instead Culp is a genuine throwback a guy who got his start on the production line in this case the family welding shop and became an evangelist for the exacting Japanese philosophy centered around an unrelenting improvement in business practices — a philosophy that helped revolutionize the manufacturing world over the past half century.

It is called kaizen and to learn about it Culp became that rare Harvard MBA who chose to cut his teeth in business learning from the Japanese how to more perfectly make air conditioners. Really.

“He would rather be walking through the factory than talking to the chamber of commerce” said Bill Stromberg chief executive of investment giant T. Rowe Price who has known Culp for three decades and considers him a mentor. “That hands-on approach is what makes him great.”

Culp is by many accounts stabilizing a once-mighty company that had big ambitions when it moved to Boston in 2016 to be among the whiz kids with their laptops sitting in coffee shops and soaking up visions for a day when software not the heavy-metal hardware of trains planes and power plants ruled the business universe.

But the move masked a deeper need within GE. It had in the view of many critics become a bloated corporate behemoth that had lost its vaunted discipline and overindulged in deal making. Soon it would be hemorrhaging money and amputating entire divisions.

The troubles suggested that GE whose roots run to inventor Thomas Edison wasn’t so much in need of finding new ways to make money as getting back its manufacturing mojo.

If GE was going to survive and thrive in the Internet Age the way it had in the previous century it needed a back-to-basics taskmaster someone who could remind the company of how it once got so dominant — by making things well and making them efficiently.

The part it would seem was written for Culp.

Yet he fills his role without being a cyborg or grim disciplinarian at a company in the throes of billions of dollars in cost-cutting. Rather Culp is what close friend Kevin Sharer called a “joyful warrior.”

“When I say ‘joyful’ it’s a role model leader who by his actions words and examples leads and inspires people to do things they didn’t think were possible” said Sharer the former CEO of biotech behemoth Amgen. “When I say ‘warrior’ the thing Larry is fighting is the past the last decade of failure and he’s fighting the status quo and the belief that things can’t change.”

Over 6 feet tall with wavy salt-and pepper hair Culp comes across as measured but friendly smiling with ease. He may live and breathe by “kaizen” but he’s not all work and no play; when he stepped down from his previous job running another manufacturing company he said he hoped to spend more time fishing. He can be intense but those around him say he is not the intimidating type. He is known at GE not as an alpha-male boss but as a leader who knows how to listen.

The old GE was about putting the smartest people at the center of the company. Culp’s GE focuses on making customers happy and on rigorous attention to what’s happening on the factory floor.

In 2019 his first full year as GE chief executive Culp was on the road most of the time often visiting factories from Ohio to South Carolina. He is the old-school operations guy who would sometimes show up in jeans to talk shop with machinists and technicians. At some plants it was the first time workers had ever met the global company’s CEO.

He honed that “how things work” fascination as a boy growing up outside of Washington D.C. where he hung out in the welding shop his grandfather founded and later his parents would run. His first paying job was hauling heavy equipment there. His management career has been defined by just two employers both of them industrial conglomerates: Danaher Corp. and GE.

“I’m not somebody that likes to run the business from my desk” Culp said in an interview with the Globe.

In 2018 Culp was enjoying what he calls his “so-called retirement” from Danaher. He was teaching leadership and strategy at his alma mater Harvard Business School and working as a senior adviser for Bain Capital. He bought a home in Beacon Hill. Then he was recruited to the GE board by the man whose job he would ultimately take CEO John Flannery. Culp said he probably would have turned down the offer to join the board had he not been in Boston already.

In business school circles Culp is a bit of a cult figure the subject of case studies on how he transformed Danaher into a major player in medical testing and dental equipment. He spent almost a quarter century there becoming CEO at the age of 37 in 2001. On his watch the Washington company increased revenues and its market capitalization five-fold by perfecting the kaizen lean manufacturing philosophy most prominently associated with Toyota.

“Larry had an extraordinary career at Danaher and was really one of the architects of what was called the ‘Danaher System’ which is consistent with what he’s doing at GE” said John Connaughton co-managing partner at Bain Capital. “He brings a lot of structure and discipline.”

There is a lot of rhetoric in the business world about creating a highly efficient customer-driven organization. On this Culp is the real deal. Listen to him as he described why he spent time in Japan learning to build air conditioners so he could “understand what a maniacal emphasis on waste elimination with an eye towards serving the customer is really all about.”

“For some folks lean is a set of tools. The tools are important but lean is much more than that. It’s really a way of life” Culp explained in a virtual event in October. “Lean is a means to an end — that end being a stronger set of businesses a stronger GE and a better more vibrant culture.”

The irony here is that GE was long the standard-bearer of the tightly-run American corporation notorious for its brawn and dominance in its markets and on Wall Street for always beating its profit estimates. Welch was the world’s leading proponent of another management philosophy Six Sigma that also preached a gospel of constant improvement in work processes. GE was famous for the way it schooled up-and-coming managers and executives and even used its college-like campus in New York state to develop them.

But the company that has laid claim to the lightbulb the washing machine electric stoves power plants jet engines and the television network that first made Donald Trump a media star went astray — badly.

Its massive GE Capital arm source of so much profit in the glory years had never fully recovered from the 2008 recession. When GE decided to sell off most of the Capital businesses in 2015 it held onto some of its liabilities a move that would weigh heavily on the balance sheet after the firm relocated to Boston from Connecticut.

Governor Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh joined GE chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt and Ann Klee vice president of Boston Development and Operations for a groundbreaking for the company's new headquarters in Fort Point in 2017. Pat Greenhouse

Then there were the ill-timed acquisitions of Baker Hughes which services oil and gas producers and the energy business of French conglomerate Alstom just before big downturns in their industries. Immelt had also committed to spending more than $1 billion to turn GE into a software titan. The GE of Welch and Immelt behaved as if it could wring profits from any kind of product or business but that hubris came with a cost.

GE struggled to meet its earnings targets and Immelt was out. Flannery who had run the health care division found himself in charge in mid-2017 and immediately was under pressure to radically rethink GE’s size maybe even break it up completely.

One by one the dominos fell mercilessly including those old liabilities from GE Capital which forced the company in 2018 to take a $6.2 billion charge and reserve billions more to shore up its old long-term-care insurance operations. At rapid-fire pace GE moved to divest some businesses such as lighting and trains and cut costs and employees to preserve cash in the face of a mountain of debt. Its stock price plummeted and then in humiliating fashion GE was drummed out of the Dow Jones industrial average where it was the last original member.

The body blows landed as GE was planning a sleek headquarters campus along Fort Point Channel the company’s launch pad into its next century.

The final straw for Flannery was a $23 billion charge in GE’s struggling power business. After just 14 months he was out and in October 2018 Culp became the first outsider to run the company since it was founded in 1892.

“He understood he could be called he didn’t expect to be called and he didn’t want to be” said Sharer who was on the faculty of Harvard Business School with Culp. “To me it’s a national service. It’s an important company for America.”

In his short tenure Flannery pursued an aggressive paring of the company’s portfolio. Culp continued in that vein reducing GE’s dividend to a nominal amount and jettisoning a new tower in Fort Point in favor of a more modest headquarters there. Culp also launched a boot-camp-style exercise to root out fat and waste to streamline the manufacturing process and make it more responsive to customers’ needs and schedules.

Drawing on his time in Japan Culp peppers meetings with talk of lean principles such as “genba” (where the real work happens) and of course “kaizen” (continuous improvement). GE in its annual report describes the process that unfolded under Culp as a “ruthless prioritization of work to improve safety quality delivery and cost.”

Importantly for Culp this self-examination begins on the factory floor.

Case in point: At the company’s gas turbine plant in Greenville S.C. the team found the production process had become overly complicated. One critical and expensive part traveled a serpentine path around the factory floor traveling more than three miles over 85 days to complete the machining process. Workers found that if they rearranged the shop floor and replaced some old machines they could reduce the travel distance to 165 feet in a straight line.

Along with other lean ideas the Greenville plant in 2020 cut overall production time for a turbine roughly in half to less than 40 weeks. Inventory levels went way down saving hundreds of millions of dollars in tied up capital. Under Culp similar “Lean Action Workouts” have been held at GE locations around the world.

“We’re an industrial company which means the way we design the way we manufacture the way we service our products is where we win or lose” Culp told the Globe.

Under Culp GE seemed to find its footing in 2019. Then the pandemic hit. The abrupt shutdown of global travel decimated a GE cash cow: the jet engine business. Almost immediately Culp had to cut roughly 25 percent of GE’s aviation workforce.

But by the end of 2020 Culp had stabilized GE’s cash flow. Then on March 10 he announced a $30 billion deal to peel off the company’s aircraft leasing business.

The GE of today is down to just four manufacturing segments: power which makes turbines for traditional electric plants; renewables such as wind turbines; health care which includes imaging machines such as MRIs; and aviation where GE has its biggest footprint in Massachusetts the jet engine plant in Lynn.

When GE decided to move to Boston in 2016 it had revenues of $117 billion 333000 employees and about 500 factories worldwide. Today two CEOs later the number of factories has been cut in half the workforce is at about 174000 and annual revenues are at $80 billion.

In August Culp agreed to a two-year contract extension and received a one-time stock grant that won’t vest for another three-plus years. That award could eventually be worth more than $200 million but only if the share price averages at least $16.68 for 30 straight days by August 2024.

Its stock now trades in the $13 range around where it was when Culp became CEO but roughly double its price last summer in the depths of the pandemic.

Culp is in his own words far from done.

“If we were over at Fenway the scoreboard would be no further along than the middle of the third” Culp told the Globe. “There’s so much in front of us.”

But he’s yet to win over a key audience: The GE union for workers at the Lynn plant feels the CEO is neglecting some of the company’s domestic factories. The Lynn plant still has a punch-press system dating to 1943 one of numerous outdated machines throughout the plant said union local president Adam Kaszynski.

“We know Culp knows how to invest in a plant to make it more profitable efficient productive but we aren’t seeing it here” Kaszynski said. “We’re fighting for every scrap of investment.”

In Boston civic and business circles Culp remains a sight unseen and few expect him to emerge after the pandemic.

“We in the business community don’t see him very much at all but we understand why” said Mary Jo Meisner the former Boston Foundation executive who focused on civic leadership and now consults to CEOs. “We want the company to stabilize and stay here.”

GE’s troubles have caused some worries about the depth of the company’s commitment to Boston. However like Immelt Culp sees value in being in a hub for innovation talent.

“The company being in Boston is just a glove-fit for what we’re trying to do” he told the Globe. “Boston’s hard to beat. We’re happy to be here.”

Culp does share a particular abiding passion with Bostonians: He is a lifelong Red Sox fan adopting the team as a kid growing up outside Washington in the 1970s while playing on a Little League team called the Red Sox.

Like many CEOs Culp likes to use sports analogies. He recently summed up his approach to steering organizations through a tough situation this way: “We simply got to get Dave Roberts to second base.”

The reference is to that celebrated moment in the 2004 playoffs against the Yankees when pinch-runner Roberts stole second setting off a chain reaction that resulted in the Sox winning their first World Series in 86 years.

Culp in many ways is sweating the small stuff to achieve what seems like the impossible — a company restored to something like its old health and international stature.

“Boston has a lot of comeback stories in sports but I think those are relevant” Culp said in a talk for the Boston College Chief Executives Club in November. “There’s always something that can be done to improve the trajectory of things. That’s what we do as leaders hopefully just find a way to take that next step and encourage folks to sometimes steal second base and we’ll take it from there.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kent Taylor’s cause of death

Taylor committed suicide after battling “post-COVID-related symptoms including severe tinnitus” his family said in a statement according to the Louisville Courier Journal . Tinnitus is an experience of ringing buzzing roaring clicking hissing or humming in the ears unrelated to any external sound according to the Mayo Clinic .

“Kent battled and fought hard like the former track champion that he was but the suffering that greatly intensified in recent days became unbearable” the family’s statement added. “But in true Kent fashion he always found a silver lining to help others. Most recently he committed to fund a clinical study to help members of the military who also suffer with tinnitus.”

Five products were recently introduced at an ag media event at the Intelligent Solutions Group (ISG) test farm near Bondurant Iowa (about 15 miles northeast of Des Moines).

The products included the John Deere 9 Series tractors; John Deere 8 Series tractors; John Deere 400 Series and 600 Series sprayers; Hagie sprayers; and John Deere planters.

John Deere specialists explained that these huge pieces of equipment are set up for easy connectivity from the operator to advisors that may be located miles away. The cabs in the tractors and the sprayers are very similar so the operator can feel as comfortable driving one as the other.

The MY22 John Deere planter is paired with an 8RX tractor as an “evolutionary planting solution.”

“What I really want you to know is that now we are integrated – the new cabs and all. It really makes it easy for operators that have a full Deere fleet in their operation” said Kaylene Ballesteros product marketing manager for See & Spray Technology.

“An operator can get into a John Deere Hagie sprayer get into a combine get into a tractor and really feel like they are in the same cab” she continued. “That makes it a lot easier user-experience and from a training perspective – improves and speeds up the learning curve.”

JDLink connectivity integrated StarFire 6000 GPS receiver Generation 4 Command Center display are factory installed in all of the equipment that was introduced. AutoTrac is installed in the tractors and sprayers.

The similarities in the John Deere lineup aren’t limited to digital/computer technologies either.

John Deere is offering similar cab designs in their newest farming equipment. Some of those features include large captain’s chairs with more headroom a good-size trainer’s seat and many all-day comforts.

Tractor and planter pair

John Deere is offering the industry’s first factory-installed integrated tractor and planter and liquid fertilizer solution.

For farms that want to plant a lot of corn in a day the new 8RX tractor is available with two 500-gallon ExactRate tanks that are mounted on the back of the tractor. A new MY22 planter offers 600 gallons of liquid fertilizer capability.

Seed tank capacity is 130 bushels and has been increased 30 percent over previous models. The John Deere 1775NT planter is available with tracks that replace the wheels on the center frame of the planter. This reduces compaction.

“A John Deere ExactRate fluid-transfer-equipped planter is designed to work seamlessly with 8RX tractors fitted with the ExactRate tractor tanks to provide additional fluid-carrying capacity and to allow you to apply high rates of nitrogen at planting without sacrificing planting efficiency or increasing soil compaction” said Kevin Juhl marketing manager for John Deere.

To plan the planting operation and monitor planting performance farmers/advisors can use the John Deere Operations Center.

“The Operations Center lets you monitor your farm from anywhere analyze machine and agronomic data and share information with your trusted advisors while making decisions” Juhl said.

See & Spray Technology

Advance spraying technology is now available as an option on John Deere 400 and 600 Series sprayers. See & Spray Select uses camera technology to detect color differentiation in the field. It is ideal for farmers who keep fallow acres.

As the sprayer moves through the field its cameras detect only green plants within fallow ground and triggers an application on those plants. The cameras can identify plants as small as a quarter-inch in width.

See and Spray Select has a similar hit rate to broadcast spraying while applying 77 percent less herbicide on average.

“Fallow ground spot-spraying is only the beginning of the John Deere See & Spray journey as we help farmers transition from field to zone to row and now to individual plant spraying” Ballesteros said. “John Deere continues working on future solutions that will meet additional customer needs beyond See & Spray Select.

“These solutions will focus on providing value for both pre- and post-emerge applications in crops such as corn soybeans and cotton” she added.

John Deere Days and Demos

Organizers at the media event said equipment will be sent out to dealers so customers can have a chance to use it in their own field conditions.

It’s entirely up to COVID-19 pandemic rules to determine if and when John Deere will introduce equipment at various farm shows this summer.

John Deere promoters encourage farmers to talk with their dealers about any equipment. In addition there are some awesome YouTube videos of all of the equipment available by simply typing in the name of the series such as John Deere Series 9 tractors. Other videos of the MY22 lineup will show up next to the YouTube video for additional information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8veW91YXJlY3VycmVudC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yMS9hLWZhbWlseS1vcGVyYXRpb24tcmV5bm9sZHMtZmFybS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtY29udGludWVzLXRvLWV4cGFuZC_SAWhodHRwczovL3lvdWFyZWN1cnJlbnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjEvYS1mYW1pbHktb3BlcmF0aW9uLXJleW5vbGRzLWZhcm0tZXF1aXBtZW50LWNvbnRpbnVlcy10by1leHBhbmQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A family operation: Reynolds Farm Equipment continues to expand • Current Publishing,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='youarecurrent.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines gets high marks from flyers thanks to its (typically) reliable operations great customer service and myriad flyer-friendly initiatives which most recently includes the airline's policy of blocking middle seats for a longer period than any other airline during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent years the airline has made a big push to renew its fleet with state-of-the-art business-class cabins which started in 2017 with the introduction of Delta One Suites on board the airline's Airbus A350 aircraft. Since then Delta has worked to bring the rest of its fleet more or less in line with the standard set by the Suites product introduced on the A350.

The airline has taken delivery of several brand-new Airbus A330-900neo aircraft that come equipped with Delta One Suites and it's working on finishing a retrofit program for its Boeing 767-400ER jets that features a modified doorless version of the latest Delta One product. And it completed a retrofit program of its entire Boeing 777 fleet not long before it made the decision to retire that aircraft entirely due to the coronavirus pandemic. And on all of its newly delivered and retrofit widebody airplanes it has installed a new premium-economy product known as Delta Premium Select.

Still though there is some fragmentation in Delta's fleet which means not all premium experiences are created equal with the airline. Make sure to continue reading so you know which Delta premium seats are best and which ones you should avoid if possible.

1. Delta One Suite

As of late 2017 the Delta One Suite became the king of the hill in terms of Delta aircraft seats. They're arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration and provide ample space and privacy thanks to the sliding door found at each suite. Since their introduction other products have come onto the scene from airlines like ANA of Japan and Qatar Airways but Delta's suites remain a top option for long-haul flying. You will find Delta One Suites on the carrier's Airbus A350 and Airbus A330-900neo aircraft.

Where to find them: Due to irregular flight schedules and massive cuts in international capacity it's been difficult to pin down where exactly Delta One Suites-equipped aircraft are flying. However things are starting to stabilize and it looks like we'll begin to see more-regular service introduced as countries begin to lift travel restrictions. As a general rule you can expect to find Delta One Suites on flights from the carrier's hubs in Atlanta (ATL) Detroit (DTW) and Seattle (SEA) to both Europe and Asia.

2. Delta One on the Boeing 767-400ER

While Delta's retrofit Boeing 767-400ERs (764) don't technically feature Delta One Suites the new Delta One product is about as close as you'll get without having a sliding door. Flyers can expect thoroughly modern design entertainment systems lighting lavatories and more. The updated Delta One product for the 764 is essentially an updated version of the Thompson Vantage seats it has installed in its 767-300 aircraft meaning seats are on the narrow side and there isn't a ton of storage to speak of. However it still represents a massive upgrade over the previous version with its tiny IFE screens creaky seats and hardly any privacy.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Where to find them: The 764s can generally be found on flights from Delta's hub at New York-JFK to Los Angeles (LAX) and various destinations in Europe as well as some flights from Atlanta (ATL) to cities in deep South America including São Paulo-Guarulhos (GRU) and Santiago de Chile (SCL). We expect to see more destinations served by the 764 as Delta adds cities back to its international route network.

The easiest way to determine whether or not your flight will feature the new interior is to peek at the seat map. You'll want to find 764 (as opposed to 76D) aircraft and seat maps will show 34 Delta One seats as opposed to 40 on the old variant. The new 764s have a Premium Select cabin too while the old version lacks that cabin entirely.

3. Reverse Herringbone

After Delta One Suites and Delta One on board the 764 Delta's reverse-herringbone seat is the next-best option for premium flyers. This 1-2-1 configuration affords a good amount of privacy personal space and storage. The one downside of this product is that the physical aspects of the IFE system are outdated with small and somewhat laggy screens.

Where to find them: The reverse-herringbone seat is exclusively found on Delta's Airbus A330-200 and -300 fleets. Currently they're flying on various international routes from across Delta's hubs.

4. Thompson Vantage

The Thompson Vantage seat found on Delta's Boeing 767-300ER aircraft (all of these jets are set to be retired by 2025) is the least-desirable all-aisle-access business-class product the airline offers. The seats are not very private and when the bed is fully flat you feel very close to the floor of the plane. Furthermore the IFE screens are woefully small and laggy and can be very frustrating to operate and see especially in bright light.

Where to find them: These non-retrofit Boeing 767s can be found on various international flights including destinations in northern South America like Lima (LIM) and Bogotá (BOG). You'll have this product if the flight is marked as operated by a 767-300 or you can tell by looking at the seat map. These aircraft have 40 seats up front versus 34 in the new variant.

5. Boeing 757

Arranged in a 2-2 configuration these seats go fully flat and sport an in-flight entertainment screen USB ports and power outlets. While these seats aren't private in any way and there is limited storage they're more than adequate on relatively short hops including transcontinental routes

Where to find them: Delta's 757s equipped with the Delta One cabin regularly fly between New York-JFK and San Francisco (SFO) as well as some other longer domestic flights and even some short transatlantic routes to Europe.

6. Delta Premium Select

Delta introduced its take on a premium-economy product (it calls it Premium Select) at the same time it debuted the Delta One Suite. Each seat comes with its own footrest power port adjustable headrest and a large IFE screen. On Airbus A350s the seats are arranged in a 2-4-2 configuration on the A330-900neos it's a 2-3-2 configuration and on the 764 you'll find a 2-2-2 configuration.

Where to find them: Delta Premium Select can be found on board the Airbus A350 and A330-900neo as well as the Boeing 767-400ER.

7. Delta Domestic First Class

While Delta's domestic first class is nothing to write home about it's comfortable for short hops and most domestic flights. And Delta announced early last year that it will introduce a new version of its domestic first-class product on its forthcoming Airbus A321neos.

Most of Delta's domestic first-class seats have seatback IFE monitors which is more than can be said for some of its U.S. competitors. In general you can expect a similar experience across the majority of its domestic fleet but there are slight differences among aircraft types with regard to seat width and recline.

Remember though when it comes to choosing a domestic plane seats aren't everything. For those seeking a complimentary upgrade you're better off choosing a plane with a higher ratio of first-class seats.

Where to find them: On most routes within the US as well as some shorter international routes to Mexico the Caribbean and Canada.

How to Book

If you're looking to book an award ticket in any of these seats there are thankfully a few options. While SkyMiles aren't highly valued per TPG's own valuations you can of course book premium flights with Delta through its own loyalty program. Unfortunately you can expect sky-high award rates for the overwhelming majority of its flights in premium cabins.

If that's the route you want to pursue though remember you can boost your SkyMiles balance by applying for one of Delta's cobranded credit cards (terms apply):

Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card: Earn 65000 bonus miles after you spend $2000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership. Offer ends 8/2/23.

Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card: Earn 85000 bonus miles after you spend $4000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership. Offer ends 8/2/23.

Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card: Earn 85000 bonus miles after you spend $6000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership. Offer ends 8/2/23.

You'll likely get more value for your hard-earned miles if you book flights through one of Delta's partners however. Two of your best options are Virgin Atlantic's Flying Club and Air France-KLM's FlyingBlue.

Related: Unlock incredible value with Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Virgin Atlantic recently devalued its award chart for Delta-operated flights increasing the price of awards to Asia by as much as 175%. Thankfully though it reversed course on significantly changing redemption rates for flights between the U.S. and Europe.

If you are considering booking a Delta One flight through Virgin Atlantic remember the program is a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards so it's relatively easy to boost your balance. Not only that but both Amex and Citi offer occasional transfer bonuses meaning you'll need even fewer points than normal to book awards.

FlyingBlue on the other hand is a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards and Capital One Rewards (at a 2:1.5 ratio).

However you'll only be able to use these miles to book saver-level awards on Delta so expect extremely limited availability. Second you will typically pay more taxes and surcharges on these tickets than using Delta SkyMiles.

Bottom Line

Delta's been working hard to modernize its fleet and give premium flyers a truly premium experience at the pointy end of the plane. Its new and retrofit aircraft provide a thoroughly modern experience with features that flyers expect in 2021 and these products really can compete with some of the best in the world. However there is still some variation in the airline's fleet and knowing which aircraft to seek out and which to avoid remains an important ""to-do"" on the checklist before booking a ticket.

Delta Air Lines has announced an ambitious expansion to its summer flying schedule. The airline is expanding service at popular outdoor destinations to help match leisure travel demand. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has to lead most tourists to flock to destinations that allow for wide open outdoor spaces. Over the winter airlines focused expansion on ski destinations such as Montrose/Telluride and beach destinations like Miami but for the summer expansions are focusing on forest areas and the northeast coast.

Mountain Trips on the West Coast

In the west the airline will be expanding existing service in the following mountain destinations; Bozeman MT. Glacier Park MT. Missoula MT. Jackson Hole WY. Fresno CA. Rapid City SD. and Reno NV. The new routes will provide better connections to Delta’s hubs on the east coast and the west coast. The destinations were targeted due to their proximity to nearby mountains and national parks providing open spaces travelers have been favoring.

From Bozeman daily flights to Los Angeles and Seattle will begin May 5 and May 28 respectively. Thrice weekly service to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport will begin May 7 before becoming daily on May 28. Saturday-only service from Detroit begins the following day on May 29. The new flights are in addition to the existing service to Atlanta Minneapolis and Salt Lake City.

Glacier Park will add daily flights to Los Angeles on May 28. The following day weekend service will commence to Atlanta and Seattle. Missoula will see weekend-only service from Los Angeles beginning May 8 and from Atlanta beginning May 29. Both cities already have daily service to Salt Lake City and Minneapolis.

Jackson Hole will see service to five new cities in the expansion. Beginning May 29 daily flights to Atlanta will begin becoming twice daily on Saturdays only. The day prior daily flights will begin to Minneapolis and Los Angeles. Rounding out the expansion in Jackson Hole Saturday-only flights to Detroit will start May 29 and weekend service to Seattle will start the same day. Currently Delta only serves Jackson Hole from its Salt Lake City hub.

Rounding out the west coast Fresno will add a Saturday-only flight to Seattle beginning May 29. Rapid City will gain weekend service to Atlanta on May 8 becoming daily on May 29. The same-day weekend service to Detriot will also start. And finally beginning May 8 Reno will gain weekend service to Seattle.

Quiet Beach Spots on the East Coast

On the east coast Delta is focusing on expanding weekend service to water destinations and leisure stops. The following destination will see new service from primarily Delta’s northeast hubs; Hilton Head Traverse City Myrtle Beach Wilmington NC. Norfolk Savannah and Asheville NC. Hilton Head Myrtle Beach and Savannah will see Saturday only service to Boston beginning May 8. In addition Norfolk will also gain Saturday service to Boston on May 8 becoming daily on May 28.

Wilmington and Asheville will both gain daily service to New York’s LaGuardia Airport starting May 5. Traverse City will gain the biggest haul of new destinations of the east coast additions. Beginning May 5 daily flights to New York’s LaGuardia and Minneapolis will start. Flights to LaGuardia will be seasonal while Minneapolis becoming thrice daily starting Memorial Day weekend. In addition the northern Michigan city will gain daily service to Atlanta starting May 29.

Northeast Growth

In the northeast Delta is targeting both the beaches and the mountains. Starting May 5 Bangor ME will see daily flights to Boston followed by Saturday-only flights to Atlanta starting May 8. Additional Saturday service to Detriot will also begin on May 8. Burlington VT will get daily service to Atlanta also starting May 5.

Delta will also be expanding service to the islands off of Cape Cod. Beginning May 28 flights from Nantucket to New York’s JFK International Airport will be operated twice daily instead of daily. In addition Saturday and Sunday service to LaGuardia will start May 29. Martha’s Vineyard will also gain double daily flights to New York’s JFK International Airport.

Resuming International Service

As well as adding domestic service Delta is restarting several international routes to the Caribbean. Starting June 5 the following routes will restart; Grand Cayman St. Kitts Roatan and Bonaire. Grand Cayman will resume daily flights to Atlanta and Saturday only flights to New York’s JFK International Airport. St. Kitts will regain Saturday-only flights to Atlanta and New York’s JFK. Both Roatan and Bonaire will restart thrice-weekly service to Atlanta.

The expansion by Delta matches other airlines’ ambitious plans for the upcoming summer season. Travelers are still favoring leisure outdoor destinations for trips and business travel has still not recovered and will likely be slow to return. Early in the year the airline already announced expansion plans to Alaska for the upcoming summer. This latest announcement matches those plans to the lower 48 of the United States.

Delta’s expansion is focusing on improving connectivity through the airline’s hubs. Many destinations will now have connecting options on both coasts offering more options for travelers. The airline is hoping that by providing more options travelers will be more likely to choose them for their leisure travel. Other airlines are making similar moves across their networks but for now Delta appears to be the most aggressive in its expansion plans.

Connecting flight options from Bangor just got a little easier.

Delta Airlines just announced they will now have a daily Bangor to Boston flight starting May 5th after adjusting schedules due to coronavirus.

In a statement released Friday Delta said ""New England's scenic views and outdoor adventures to places like Acadia National Park offer a diversity of experiences for leisure travelers which is why Delta is adding more flights to four destinations in the region.""

Bangor International Airport Director Tony Caruso is thrilled.

""We are excited that Delta is adding service to three great destinations"" said Caruso. ""Daily Boston service provides our community a great destination and connection hub and bringing back Atlanta and Detroit service will be popular with our travelers.""

""We know not everyone is ready to travel just yet but when they are they can be assured that BGR is prepared to make their journey as safe as possible"" said Caruso.

Delta is also adding a Saturday service from Atlanta and Detroit starting May 8th.

BGR has seen service return after a long year of adjustment due to the COVID pandemic.

Delta had suspended service to Bangor last July due to coronavirus. That changed March 2 2021 when Delta returned offering a daily flight to and from New York's LaGuardia Airport.

""We're thrilled to return to Bangor and once again offer the superior customer experience reliability and connectivity that Delta is known for"" Delta Director of Sales Charlie Schewe said in a release at the time. ""And through our Delta CareStandard customers can also expect the highest levels of cleanliness more space and safer service from the moment they check-in.""

JAN 14th STORY ON SERVICE RETURNING TO BANGOR

Bangor International Airport Director Tony Caruso was ""thrilled.""

""We are thrilled to see Delta back in the market and are hopeful that more flights will be added to their schedule in the near future"" Caruso said. ""COVID-19 has significantly impacted all aspects of daily life for everyone but we are making every effort to ensure passenger and employee safety.""

The new routes are a sign business continues to remain brisk in Bangor after a tough 2020.

Caruso said the 2020 low numbers were very close to the rest of the industry around the country during the pandemic."

YouFarm develops a Farming Investment Platform

The small farmers’ inability to provide collateral to financial institutions prevents them from receiving loans and investments. As a result farmers often end up borrowing from the informal sector. This places a huge financial burden on farmers as well as prevents them from producing at the maximum capacity. To solve this problem startups develop crowd farming platforms that open a collateral-free revenue stream for farmers.

South African startup YouFarm develops a collateral-free farming investment platform. The startup’s platform uses a token system to allow small investors to transfer finances to farmers. Accordingly the investors become eligible to receive a share of the farmer’s earnings from produce sales. The platform unlocks access to financial help for small farmers. It increases farmers’ production capacities and creates an income stream for small investors.

Growpal facilitates Fishery Funding

Small-scale fisheries are an essential element of the global seafood industry. However the lack of capital and infrastructure prevents them from effective commercialization of their products. To facilitate the development of small-scale aquaculture startups develop digital solutions that link investors fish farmers and consumers.

Indonesian startup Growpal develops a fishery funding platform that connects investors fishery owners fish cultivators and buyers. The startup’s platform allows investors to choose the funding recipient transfer funds and monitor the project remotely. Additionally the platform facilitates funding distribution providing fishery asset valuation and ensuring transparency throughout the investment process.

EZ Farming advances the Agricultural Value Chain

Even though most of the uncultivated arable land lies in Africa agricultural development on the continent struggles. The lack of access to fair markets and pricing information limits the profits of African small farmers thereby hindering development in the sector. Therefore startups build digital platforms that amend the agricultural value chain in the region by connecting smallholder farmers to financial and commercial channels.

US-based startup EZ Farming provides a crowd farming platform for agricultural value chain development in Africa. The platform empowers smallholder farmers in the region by providing access to micro-investments advanced technology and alternative commercialization channels. Moreover the platform allows investors to acquire farmland property managed completely by EZ Farming and receive a major share of the profits.

Farmcrowdy provides Agricultural Finance

The lack of financing for smallholder farmers usually restricts their ability to secure the equipment and innovations necessary for effective and efficient farming. This leads to lower yields poor produce quality and reduced profits. To help farmers modernize production processes startups build digital solutions for agricultural finance. In addition to helping raise equipment investments these solutions offer data analytics market knowledge and marketing services.

Nigerian startup Farmcrowdy develops a crowd farming service that provides technological and financial reinforcement to smallholder farmers. The startup helps farmers secure the land and insurance plant seeds finance equipment and cover produce logistics. Additionally Farmcrowdy bolsters farmer’s decision-making with market and yield predictions carries out market research as well as provides event and digital marketing.

Portugrow secures Crowdfunding for Medical Cannabis

As countries around the world lift recreational and medical marijuana regulations the demand for the product is increasing. However the cultivation of quality good manufacturing practice (GMP)-certified medical cannabis requires substantial financial investments. As a result to meet the rising demand startups apply crowd farming principles to cannabis cultivation.

Dutch startup Portugrow develops a crowdfunding platform for medical cannabis cultivation. The platform allows investors to purchase individual plants monitor their development and receive profit from their sales. PORTUGROW allows small investors to contribute to the development of the European medical cannabis market help patients in need of the medicine and establish a passive revenue stream.

Like the name suggests the company uses a ‘switching’ infrastructure to connect the different banks in Nigeria and provides the technology now used for ATM cards. From a time when the company had only 3 banks on its network Interswitch has grown in the last 19 years and now has 11000 ATMs across different banks on its network.

How the journey started

A young graduate working in Telnet Mitchell Elegbe was worried by the several inconveniences Nigerians had to go through to carry out financial transactions. From making long and stressful journeys to the banks waiting in long queues missing transaction deadlines and increased loss of cash to criminals that was certainly not the easiest of times to be an adult. Some opted for bank drafts to avoid carrying cash to travel and I remember accompanying my mother to the bank a couple of time to buy a bank draft to pay my school fees.

Many people had to join long queues at the banks on Friday evening to withdraw enough cash for the weekend and this naturally meant that weekends became work hours for criminals. The most frustrating part of it was that the bank branches did not have any software connecting them so customers had to continue withdrawing money from the exact branch they opened the account even when they needed to make long business trips. Even the highway became a playfield for robbers.

The young Elegbe who had only worked two years after his National Youth Service Corps came up with the Switch idea but the plans did not materialise as many traditional players were not interested in buying the switch software.

Not deterred by this little glitch Elegbe went ahead to establish Interswitch an organisation which would use the Switch software to address the problem. This time he got the support of Accenture and also got buy-in from some banks to raise a part of the start-up capital. Getting a Chief Executive to head the company was the next hurdle to be crossed as Elegbe recalls that most of the capable hands then available were expatriates “who expected to earn more than the company’s capital”.

In search of cheap labour he had to take up the task even though he had very little experience thus resigning his job at Telnet. The shareholders and the sponsoring company (TELNET) had their concerns at first but they gave Insterswitch a shot and under Elegbe’s leadership the company pushed through the uncertain years to become what it is now. Eight years later after starting Interswitch the company was valued to be worth N26 billion (over $170 million) giving massive returns to early private equity holders. The company’s network grew steadily from 7 banks to 13 and then an ATM consortium and Globacom a mobile telecommunications provider up till this point when it has almost all Nigerian banks and 11000 ATMs on its network.

Though Elegbe had no shares at the outset his impressive performance earned him and his team some equity in the company in the coming years.

“So you have somebody who invested N10 million in this business going away with N2.6 billion after eight years. That to me was real value” Elegbe said. When you help solve big problems Mitchell says you’re bound to be well rewarded.

Mitchell Elegbe is now the Group MD & CEO Akeem Lawal is Divisional CEO Switching & Processing Group while Mike Ogbalu is CEO Verve International.

In 2019 Visa bought a fifth of Interswitch at a valuation of $1billion making Interswtich Africa’s first fintech unicorn.

Interswitch is the owner of Verve an international debit card and Nigeria’s most used payment card which is said to account for over 70% of the 25 million cards in circulation in the country. The company also owns Quickteller an online payments platform; Retailpay a mobile business management platform; Interswitch S&P the first Nigerian in-country interbank transaction switching and third party processing for all card brands; and Smartgov an identity management and e-payment infrastructure for state governments. Interswitch now serves almost all the state government of Nigeria and is present in several other African countries including Kenya and Uganda.

Just last month the group announced the launch of Quickteller Business – a new comprehensive corporate solution focused on empowering businesses of all sizes to facilitate payments and manage transactions from anywhere in the world– through one simple integrated platform. The platform added to its launch offer a three-month zero transaction fee incentive for SMEs that sign up immediately.

Buy-ins acquisitions and buy-outs

Interswitch has had several achievements over the years and some more distinct than others. Two-third of the company was sold to a consortium led by Helios Investment Partners in 2010 and barely a year after Interswitch took a 60% stake in Bankom in Uganda.

In 2013 the payment processing company entered into an agreement with Discover Financial Services and in September 2014 Interswitch acquired a majority shareholding in Paynet Group an East-African payments provider.

In 2015 Interswitch launched a $10m investment fund for African start-ups in the payments sector and has since then strategically invested in other African startups in the payments services.

Interswitch has also acquired VANSO a mobile-focused technology provider to banks. This new acquisition has VANSO’s mobile banking SMS and security business lines being fully integrated into Interswitch’s digital commerce and technology operations in Nigeria and across Africa.

The IPO that never was

It was in 2016 the Interswitch first hinted at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange and /or the Nigerian Stock Exchange as part of options to create possible exits for its backers but that listing never happened due to “unfavourable economic situation”.

By July 2019 it was reported that Interswitch had resumed its IPO plans and enlisted JPMorgan Chase & Co and Standard Bank Group to work on the potential IPO that was expected to value the company between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. This listing was expected to come through by 2020 but it is believed that the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic issues which plagued 2020 may have altered the company’s plans.

A recent statement from the CEO says that Interswitch will continue with alliances in line with its growth plans but an IPO might not be in immediate view. According to him an IPO may be considered when private equity investors want an exit out of the business.

In place of the earlier expected IPO the company announced the listing of N23 million bond on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) in February 2020. The bond is to run at a fixed interest rate of 15% for a tenure of 7 years.",,,,,,,,,

Needless to say the golf wasn't going great but it was a minor issue compared to what was happening several miles away at a Little Panda restaurant in Lubbock Texas

Leading up to that Monday in March a group of friends and I went to Little Panda every single Monday for lunch. Starting all the way back in August when school had started and for the following eight months we ate at Little Panda on Slide Road. Then while me and my friends were at the golf tournament and unable to be at Little Panda the building collapsed.

After the collapse there were six ambulances and 45 firefighters who responded to get everyone out of the rubble. The collapse was concentrated in the dining room so none of the staff was injured.

Sadly there were people in the building when it fell including 23-year-old Tara Wilson who died and nine others who were injured.

The terrible accident described by one Lubbock TV station as a ""lunchtime tragedy"" spawned several lawsuits and made others with the same style of building as Little Panda do some serious renovations.

If you don't remember or weren't living in Lubbock at the time of the accident the building was an old Taco Bell complete with the bell-shaped wall across the roof.

The building was later demolished and eventually the lot was turned into a Dollar General I think but it's been a long time.

Maxx opens in Alliance,"ALLIANCE Dozens of shoppers chattered excitedly early Sunday morning as they headed into T.J. Maxx.

The retailer opened its newest location at 2642 W State St.

""This is the highlight of our year!"" 64-year-old Alliance resident Cindy Knepp said.

She and Susan Meece 63 of Alliance arrived at the department store shortly after 8 a.m. The retired teachers were excited to go inside and see what the new T.J. Maxx had to offer.

""We've been waiting on pins and needles counting down the days"" Meece said. ""We're just so happy that Alliance has finally got another retail store.""

The 21052-square-foot store is located in the West State Square plaza between Walmart and Carnation City Mall. The plaza also houses Sally Beauty Dollar Tree Verizon and Sleep Outfitters.

The store has been in development for more than a year. Alliance approved plans for occupancy in late 2019 but construction on the building's 10000-square-foot addition experienced multiple delays amid the pandemic.

T.J. Maxx replaced two retailers in the plaza. Rue21 closed its Alliance location permanently and EmbroidMe relocated to 2213 W. State St.

Knepp and Meece were thrilled to see T.J. Maxx move into the city because it provides them with another shopping option in Alliance. They prefer to shop locally and hope to see more retailers come to the area.

""I would love to have a Target"" Knepp said.

Similarly Mount Union professor Sheryl Mason 52 of Alliance said the new T.J. Maxx location will be convenient for shoppers.

""My daughters and I really enjoy shopping at T.J. Maxx typically in Canton"" she said. ""So I'm excited to have one closer by.""

Mason hopes the city will continue to see business growth and development particularly with the Carnation City Mall.

Alliance has plans to redevelop the mall property by placing it into a tax incremental financing program that would exempt the owners from some property taxes.

Under the proposal the city would take temporary ownership of the mall before transferring it to Fairmount Properties a Cleveland-based developer that intends to redevelop it into a ""supercenter retail facility.""

""I think it's appealing to our college students too as well as those of us who live in the area. It's nice to not necessarily need to go to Canton or Boardman to get some of these stores"" Mason said.

Alliance Director of Planning and Development Joe Mazzola said T.J. Maxx will contribute to the city's retail landscape and complement other clothing stores in the area.

""It adds to the already significant mix of local and national retail operations"" he said.

Headquartered in Framingham Massachusetts T.J. Maxx operates more than 1200 stores worldwide including a location at 3963 Everhard Road NW in Plain Township.

""Our newest store in Alliance will offer an ever-changing selection of high-quality on-trend and brand-name merchandise at the amazing prices T.J. Maxx is known for"" T.J. Maxx public relations supervisor Katie MacLeod said. ""Our buyers create a unique mix that offers value for styles in every department and we’re excited to bring this experience to a new neighborhood.""

The retailer's hours are 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday.

The Oakland California native was apprehensive about moving Utah. After living in Salt Lake City for nine months James has decided to return to the Bay Area.

SALT LAKE CITY — As a senior at University of California Berkeley Frances James was apprehensive when Goldman Sachs tapped her for a job as an analyst at the company’s offices in Utah.

She knew the move from Oakland to Salt Lake City in July would be a significant cultural shift but she wasn’t prepared for just how momentous it would be. James is Filipino and Black and identifies as Black.

“The thing I noticed first from that first day coming out of the car was that no one looked like me” James said.

Many of Utah’s largest employers are trying to bring more racial and ethnic diversity to the workforce hoping varied viewpoints will enrich companies and communities.

They’re not getting as far as they’d hoped.

Utah remains overwhelmingly white a “shock factor” that often stuns newcomers and makes it difficult for them to feel at home according to executives civic leaders and those who moved to the state for career opportunities. Civic and business leaders have joined in a push to help make all feel welcome and to retain minorities in the workplace.

The art of intentionality

“Since about 2013 (Dominion Energy) started aggressively hiring diverse candidates” according to Craig Wagstaff senior vice president of Western operations for the Virginia-based natural gas and electricity supplier in 16 states. “(As) a benchmark in 2013 about 27% of our new hires (nationwide) were diverse at that point. In 2020 that number had jumped to 50%.”

While the company’s national efforts have been successful revamping the workforce in states like Utah can be a bit more difficult due to the natural makeup of its population he said.

“One of the things we felt was important is to try to ensure that we train our hiring managers and supervisors and most of this training would focus on unconscious biases that they maybe didn’t even realize they have” he said.

He said the effort included participating in major recruiting events across the country and hiring diversity recruiting specialists to help create workforces that mirror the communities Dominion Energy serves he added.

Dominion has aligned itself with organizations like the Society of Hispanic Engineers the Society of Black Engineers and the National Society of Women Engineers. Wagstaff said the company is dedicated to providing opportunities to a broad cross section of qualified applicants any time it lists an open position.

“We encourage all of our hiring supervisors and managers that when they do have a position they’re filling to ensure they have some diversity in that pool for consideration” he said. The company also has a scholarship program geared toward minority student interns.

To help in its retention efforts the company has developed employee resource groups to give workers a way to make connections and develop a sense of belonging.

“It’s about inclusion and having more of the interaction of professional development amongst employees (because) employee inclusion is just absolutely critical for retention” Wagstaff said.

At Lehi-based Carrus — an online training provider for the allied health care industry — employing a diverse workforce is important to serve its target audience comprised primarily of people of color and women explained CEO Misty Frost.

“In order to best serve our audience and really understand exactly what it is they need and help them achieve the success that they’re looking for we really need to be very conscious about being plugged into not only what we care about in our culture but being sensitive to the culture of our learners and really supporting people where they’re at” she said.

For companies it’s incumbent they provide ongoing awareness training to create an environment that exhibits inclusivity and intentionality.

“It’s really important for leadership to continually beat the drum and they need to do it in meaningful ways by the actions they take. You can’t just talk about it once a month and (say) we care about diversity and then you don’t do anything about it” Frost said. “Are you reviewing your hiring practices how you write your job descriptions how you’re interviewing people are all the people who are interviewing sensitive to the issues?”

Casting a wide net to develop more diversity

Getting people from diverse backgrounds to take good jobs and come to the Beehive State is one thing but getting them to feel like Utah can be their new long-term home is another.

“People will move to a new state for economic opportunity. So for people of color when they get to Utah they maybe last three to four years” according to Sui Lang L. Panoke senior vice president for diversity equity and inclusion at Zions Bank. “Then they start to think ‘I don’t know if I could really build a life here raise my children start a family. If I really feel integrated into the community.’ And so we lose that (talent).”

She added that because retention is very important to businesses and their bottom lines having high rates of employee turnover can be costly not only in a financial sense but also as it relates to innovation and productivity.

“We need to get this retention thing down. That’s the piece that we struggle with. Recruitment — we’re definitely making great strides in that arena and it’s working” she said. “But it’s the retention piece (we need to work on). How do we get people to stay? People stay because of the culture. People (also) leave because of the culture.”

While some organizations foster an “amazing inclusive culture” in the local community — 15 minutes down the street people feel isolated.

“You don’t feel like you belong in that culture” Panoke said. “It has to be a business partnered with government that public-private partnership committed to driving home a culture that is really going to move the needle on retention.”

Currently 1 in 5 Utahns identifies as a minority she said. In Zions Bancorp. the proportion of minorities within the workforce is about 15%. She said the goal of the company is to reflect the makeup of the local population.

“It starts with listening learning and then leading” she said. “That’s where especially white people in the Beehive State need to start.”

Diversity equity and inclusion starts at home

Minority business leaders are echoing the sentiments of employers like Dominion and Zions about the need to focus attention on recruiting candidates from the state’s growing minority population.

The head of the Utah Black Chamber of Commerce noted that the number of African Americans in the Beehive State has jumped significantly in recent years.

“When you think about the Black population’s growth here we’ve been talking about 2% (overall) for the last six years” said James Jackson III founder of the Utah Black Chamber. Utah’s population grew steadily in the five-year period ending in 2014 he noted but the percentage of Black Utahns remained stagnant he said “and the reason why is attrition.”

Statewide 4 in 5 Utah residents are white census data show while 14.4% are Hispanic and just 1.5% are Black according to 2019 census estimates the most recent available.

Jackson said often after a few years African Americans choose to leave Utah because they don’t feel comfortable being such a huge minority at work and in the community.

Jackson said companies should make an effort to provide employees of all backgrounds the opportunity for advancement to the highest levels of their companies.

“I was speaking with a Black professional last summer who was part of a tech company. He was one of our mentors for our Leadership Pathway Program the goal of which is to increase diversity in leadership in business in government and within other organizations” Jackson said. “Ironically he ended up getting promoted to a chief technology officer position out of state. He said he would have stayed here but there were no C-suite opportunities here for him so he was shipping out.

“We have to do a better job of continuing the pipeline not only out of high school or college but from entry to midlevel from midlevel to senior level from senior level to the executive level — that pipeline has to continue.”

That includes the right mentoring and the right opportunities for the proper pay Jackson said. Those steps are something Utah could better ensure take place by appointing a statewide officer over diversity in business he said.

In the meantime Jackson’s organization has teamed up with other diverse business chambers in the state and with Salt Lake City on an initiative to help those new to Utah feel at home whether they’re looking to find a social network a place of worship or cultural events they might not otherwise learn about.

Living Color Utah still in its early stages provides an online guide and events aimed at those of different ethnicities plus LGBTQ people and transplants.

Ben Kolendar director of the city’s Department of Economic Development said it became more clear that Utah’s capital city has work to do after a corporation that was considering coming to Utah chose Atlanta instead citing Utah’s lack of diversity.

“That stung. And it started some conversations with some partners of ours and got the ball rolling on a lot of things that you see playing out now” Kolender said. “It wasn’t just that we weren’t diverse enough but also that we hear from some of our local companies that retention can be tough.”

To help Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall is hiring a chief equity officer a senior adviser that will help the city chart a path forward and her employees are working on an equity master plan.

It’s an idea that Rep. Sandra Hollins Utah’s lone Black state lawmaker welcomes.

“I think that’s that’s what we all need to be looking at doing how do we go about making this our community a better place for it and more welcoming to everyone?” Hollins said.

When Hollins moved to Utah from her home state of Louisiana roughly 30 years ago the difficulties she encountered ranged from finding a sense of community in the overwhelmingly white state to tracking down hair products for African American women.

It took about two years to adjust but Hollins found a home at Cavalry Baptist Church in Salt Lake City and in an African American women’s sorority organization and the right hair care items have become more widely available as Utah has slowly diversified.

“For newcomers it’s difficult for them and that’s what I’ve heard from a lot of people. They just feel that they there’s no way for them to fit in” Hollins said.

A significant adjustment

Before taking her job with Goldman Sachs James a Southern California native had done her research about the Beehive State’s history demographics and politics but the difference when she arrived in Utah was startling all the same.

In just the first few weeks she encountered employees at stores who were reluctant or refused to help her. Others in public stared at her hair and her Black Lives Matter T-shirt.

One worker in a Salt Lake City home improvement store refused to help James and her 15-year-old brother find a drill leading her brother to ask her “Why was that man so mean to us? Was it because we were Black?

“I’m used to it” James said. “I’ve dealt with microagressions and macroegressions and blatant racism to my face before but it really was hurtful to know that my little brother had to confront this in a new state that we had been in for three days.”

She’s met others through the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and advocated for a successful 2020 ballot measure Hollins proposed to eliminate slavery from the state constitution. The initiative’s success signaled process but James said she struggled to make sense of the voters that voted against it.

“As a Black person new to the state I thought who’s in favor of slavery?” she recalled.

EUCLID Ohio — Editor's note: the video in the player above is from a story published on March 16 2021.

The Euclid Fire Department (EFD) is issuing a grim warning to parents today after a devastating apartment fire complex Saturday.

According to a Facebook post EFD was dispatched to 26801 Brush Avenue last night around 10:30 p.m. with 16 uniformed firefighters sent to fight a blaze.

Officials say that all occupants and residents were able to successfully evacuate the building and crews were able to identify the two bedrooms on the second floor as the problem area.

Despite progress EFD called in backup from Willowick Wickliffe Richmond Heights and South Euclid due to the intensity of the fire.

Firefighters were finally able to extinguish the fire by 11:02 p.m. and determine that the cause of the fire was accidental and the blaze started after a child was playing with a lighter.

""The bedding was the first item ignited and quickly spread to the contents eventually involving the entire 2nd floor and a small portion of the attic space. Adjacent units sustained significant smoke damage"" EFD said on Facebook. ""Early damage estimates are $200000 to the building and $25000 to contents.""

The department is now warning parents and families with small children to warn their kids about the dangers of fire.

""This is the third serious fire in five weeks caused by young children playing with lighters in Euclid. Keep matches lighters and other ignitable substances in a secured location out of your child’s reach. Only use lighters with child-resistant or childproof features.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvcmtib2F0LmNvbS9zaGlwYnVpbGRpbmcvYmxha2VsZXktYm9hdHdvcmtzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLXRpZXItNC0xMTAtbGluZWhhdWwtdG93Ym9hdC10by1jb29wZXItdC1zbWl0aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blakeley BoatWorks delivers 6800-hp linehaul towboat to Cooper/T. Smith,"The 110'x33' linehaul towboat Gretchen V. Cooper built by Blakeley BoatWorks (BBW) was delivered to Cooper Marine and Timberlands (CMT) this month.

BBW and CMT located in the port of Mobile Ala. are wholly owned subsidiaries of Cooper/T. Smith. The company said the new towboat which has a maximum 8'6"" working draft is the U.S.’s first linehaul towing vessel powered by a Tier 4 Caterpillar high-speed engines with selective catalytic reduction.

Currently Tier-4 diesel engine standards are the strictest Environmental Protection Agency emissions requirements for new engines found in inland marine vessels. Tier-4 compliant engines significantly reduce emissions of particulate matter or black soot and nitrogen oxides to near zero levels. The engines are designed to save fuel and reduce emissions by more than 86% for large applications like marine vessels.

The new towboat is powered by two Caterpillar C3512E 3400-hp Tier 4 diesel marine engines operating at 1800 RPM and coupled to Twin Disc MGX-5600 gears.

The Cats are connected to Southeastern Propeller 88""x74""x9"" 4-bladed stainless-steel propellers to provide thrust through twin J&S Machine Works 9"" ABS Grade two propeller shafts with Cutlass shaft bearings Thordon rudder bearings and Kemel shaft seals. Gulf Coast Air and Hydraulics supplied the steering system for the two 9"" main and four 8"" flanking rudders.

Hydra Force LLC provided a pair of Quincy reciprocating air compressors with ventilation fans provided by Donovan Marine. Schuyler Maritime LLC supplied varying sizes of rubber fendering around the perimeter of the vessel and push knees.

Thompson Caterpillar also supplied electrical power with two Cat C4.4 Tier 3 generators with RW Fernstrum keel coolers throughout.

Stone Construction provided a Mitsubishi mini-split HVAC system in all interior spaces with Blakeley BoatWorks providing all custom woodwork and interior finishes. Bozant supplied aluminum and rubber-framed windows.

On deck Donovan Marine supplied a pair of Patterson 40-ton deck winches. Blakeley BoatWorks installed all electronics communications and an alarm system.

The towboat has a capacity of 44200 gals. of fuel and 10000 gals. potable water. The vessel is outfitted with six crew staterooms housing eight crewmen 4 1⁄2 baths and a full galley arrangement.

“Our customers expect Blakeley BoatWorks and Cooper Marine & Timberlands to drive industry innovation and our building and operating one of the industry’s most environmentally friendly towboats marks our unwavering commitment to always exceed their expectations” Angus R. Cooper III president Cooper/T. Smith said in a statement. “Naming a boat after my wife Gretchen meant that we couldn’t just settle for building a standard towboat and therefore the Gretchen V. Cooper will be one of the most powerful towing vessels operating on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway and will lead the way for a new industry standard for reduced emissions on towboats.”

Cooper Marine & Timberlands has a fleet of 20 towing vessels and more than 400 hopper barges. CMT has one of the country's largest fleet of dry bulk gantry and floating derrick cranes. The company’s marine footprint includes the Tennessee-Tombigbee River system Ohio River Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Illinois River Arkansas River Cumberland River Black Warrior River Tennessee River Tombigbee River Mobile River and Mississippi River. CMT’s stevedoring operations include two deep-draft bulk cargo terminals at the port of Mobile and numerous inland marine terminals throughout Alabama and Mississippi.

“The ongoing investments that CMT is making across our fleet best ensures that our customers will continue to receive the safest most environmentally friendly and highest level of service in our region” said James Fowler managing director of marine and stevedoring operations for Cooper Marine and Timberlands and executive vice president for Blakeley BoatWorks. “As was true when BBW built some of the nation’s first subchapter M new construction towing vessels and now as we deliver a new linehaul with the latest and most advanced carbon reduction technology BBW eagerly stands ready to deliver on our industry’s newest and most challenging jobs.”

Blakeley BoatWorks is a full-service shipyard that specializes in small vessel repair barge repair and new vessel construction. It is equipped with a 1900-ton floating dry dock 660-ton Marine Travelift and four covered fabrication shops.

“Our team is proud to be part of the construction of the Gretchen V. Cooper” said Swathin Kannalath managing director of Blakeley BoatWorks. “Delivering one of the first Tier-4 linehaul vessels in the country presented an exciting challenge for the Blakeley team and we delivered with this vessel meeting not only the highest industry standards but also exceeding our customer’s expectations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53a3ljLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY2xldmVsYW5kL29uZS1kZWFkLWFub3RoZXItcmVzY3VlZC1mcm9tLWNsZXZlbGFuZC1ob3VzZS1maXJlLzk1LTgyYjUwNzRiLTlhNmMtNGYyYy04ZTA3LTgzMGUzMjNjZTcxZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elderly man killed in Cleveland house fire W. 123 Street,"The fire is under investigation.

Last March when markets cratered as the coronavirus spread Domino’s held up reasonably well. Sure it saw a brief decline during the market-wide sell-off but already coming off of a spike in February 2020 shares were pretty close to where they were at the start of the year.

And with lockdowns providing carry-out restaurant chains a windfall strong results helped push the stock well above its pre-COVID price levels. Now though as vaccine optimism rises “stay-at-home” restaurant plays are fading in popularity among investors.

DPZ stock may have bounced back a bit after its late February correction (partly due to a disappointing earnings release) but don’t expect the pullback to end here. Although shares aren’t necessarily going to fall completely back to their early 2020 prices as growth slows and more compelling opportunities present themselves there’s going to be less interest in this stock.

Domino's Stock And Slowing Growth

Late last month the pizza chain released quarterly results. With both revenue and earnings falling short of expectations shares dipped on the news.

Wall Street analysts expected $1.39 billion in sales for the quarter. Instead the top line came in at $1.36 billion. Sell-side consensus called for $3.89 per share in earnings but the company posted adjusted earnings of only $3.46 per share.

While results were up from the prior-year quarter they still missed investors’ expectations. As mentioned above in the weeks since its pullback we’ve seen DPZ stock partially recover.

Yet with the outlook calling for slowing growth shares may have room to fall. How much further? Given its slightly higher valuation relative to similar names expect only a modest pullback from here.

Slight Pullback Possible But Nothing Dramatic

As its growth slows and investors focus more on restaurant recovery plays it’s going to be hard for Domino’s Pizza stock to resume its prior upward trajectory.

It should be noted though that the situation here differs from other restaurant stocks that thrived during 2020. A good example is Chipotle (CMG) which has clearly gotten ahead of itself valuation-wise.

Yet with significant growth projected for the coming year Chipotle likely has enough to keep its stock price steady. However with DPZ’s sales and earnings growth set to fall back into the single-digits this stock might not be able to grow into its valuation.

Story continues

Instead expect valuation contraction. Fortunately though not to a severe degree. With a forward P/E ratio that is only slightly higher than similar names like McDonald’s (MCD) additional pullbacks may be minimal.

What Analysts Are Saying About DPZ Stock

According to TipRanks DPZ is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys and 7 Holds. At $414.24 the average analyst price target suggests 14% upside potential. (See Domino’s stock analysis on TipRanks)

Bottom Line

As investors become more interested in bidding up recovery plays restaurant stocks that thrived during the pandemic (such as Domino’s) will likely fade in interest.

And unlike some other names which have high levels of growth potential to keep their share prices stable this company’s slowing growth doesn’t offer that opportunity.

So where’s DPZ heading from here? Expect another pullback though likely nothing dramatic. But more importantly don’t expect shares to make another move higher anytime soon.

About 300 students participated in the Domino Effect Cereal Drive Challenge in partnership with Samaritan Community Center Principal Dan Cox said.

Samaritan Community Center is a nonprofit group serving Northwest Arkansas families in need for 19 years.

Students participating in the event lined the school's halls with 1010 cereal boxes and watched as they toppled like dominoes counselor Whitney Macechko said.

The boxes spanned 1227 feet of halls Cox said.

The challenge encourages students to donate food to help prevent area children from going hungry so they can focus on school and get better grades said Shaylan Dillon Samaritan Community Center marketing manager.

""It's a domino effect"" she said. ""That's what we're trying to show.""

The cereal boxes were collected through a food drive at the school this week Cox said.

Maggie Duffy an 11-year-old fifth-grader said it was crazy to watch the boxes topple and to see how many were donated.

""I learned it's really important to help people out in need"" she said. ""You can make a difference bringing in just one box of cereal.""

Evening Star Elementary in Bentonville and Northside Elementary in Rogers also participated in the challenge Friday said Shannon Green Samaritan's food drive coordinator. More schools are planning their own events in April and May.

Twelve schools plan to participate Dillon said.

Cereal producer Kellogg's donated more than 3000 boxes to the center in support of the challenge and to help local families in need Green said. Kellogg's Frosted Flakes mascot Tony the Tiger joined students for the events at all three participating schools Friday she said.

Cereal producer Post Consumer Brands also plans to donate a to-be-determined amount of cereal and to participate in future challenges as well she said.

Bellview relied only on donations from students to complete its challenge Macechko said.

The need for food has increased dramatically in the region during the covid-19 pandemic she said. The center served 7609 families in 2019 compared to 18766 in 2020 an increase of 147% Dillon said.

Some 60% of Rogers' more than 15000 students qualify for free and reduced lunch said Ashley Siwiec district communications director.

The event didn't present any challenges for participation during the covid-19 pandemic Cox said.

""This was the best thing we could have done during the pandemic because it doesn't involve anything other than kids bringing in boxes"" he said. ""It's really been a great thing to do because the kids have just been dying to do something fun.""

This is the first year the center has featured the challenge but it will be offered annually if it continues to be a success Dillon said.

Principal Dan Cox records a live stream as cereal boxes topple Friday at Bellview Elementary School in Rogers. Several Rogers schools are helping the Samaritan Center by collecting boxes of cereal to feed the hungry. Bellview filled their halls with the cereal boxes to create a domino effect.

Neither do I but the head of U.S. Southern Command claims this is actually a thing.

“The Chinese Communist Party’s insidious and corrosive and corrupt influences at work globally and in this region” Navy Adm. Craig Faller said at a March 16 Pentagon news conference.

Faller’s comments raise a few questions. First of all: Why do military leaders always single out the “Chinese Communist Party” when describing China’s nefarious activities? There is no other party in China so it’s redundant to mention that the country is run by communists – unless the John Birch Society is somehow represented in the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau.

Secondly: How would Americans be put at risk if China became a hegemon in the Western Hemisphere? Is the U.S. military concerned that if we don’t stop the Chinese from encroaching in Paraguay the Godless communists will not stop until they’ve conquered Peoria Illinois?

Being a professional jerk I asked Faller if SOUTHCOM was concerned that if China made inroads in Venezuela other South American countries would fall like dominoes – a reference to the Cold War “Domino Theory” about how communism spreads.

“I don’t know – don’t really know or understand the part of your question Jeff on the domino analogy” Faller replied.

Faller argued that China is trying to exert more control on water and food resources in the Western Hemisphere so they can “use that leverage in international forums to push towards China’s view of a rules-based world order.”

I’m not exactly sure what that means but it doesn’t have quite the ring of “Better dead than Red!”

Before any of you accuse me of being “woke” please understand that I am no fan of communism. But I’m also not so terrified of communist subversion that I suspect fluoridation is a plot to sap and impurify our precious bodily fluids.

That brings us to the elephant in the room: Is the U.S. military being paranoid about China’s growing influence south of the border? Since there is no easy way to ask that question I put it directly to defense officials by asking: “If I were to describe SOUTHCOM and DOD’s position toward China as ‘paranoid’ would I be wrong? Why?”

In response a Defense Department spokesperson repeated the Pentagon’s mantra that China is the strategic pacing challenge globally and the Defense Department supports monitoring all current and potential risks to U.S. security in South and Central America including Chinese political and economic engagement with countries such as Venezuela.

Moreover China’s increasing economic power in Latin America and the Caribbean risks undermining transparency and the rule of law in the Western Hemisphere the spokesperson said.

Another reason Americans should care about China’s increasing influence in the Western Hemisphere is their security – and the security of the United States – is linked to the wellbeing of Latin American and Caribbean countries a SOUTHCOM spokesperson said.

China’s investments and loans in critical infrastructure and commodities in South America and elsewhere in the hemisphere are siphoning money from local companies the spokesperson said. China’s increasing access to maritime cyber and space infrastructure also poses increasing risks to the United States as well as its allies and partners.

Even though not all of China’s activities are malign Beijing is actively working against the United States in the region in part by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro the spokesperson said. That’s why the United States imposed sanctions on China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation last year for restricting internet service in Venezuela and conducting digital surveillance on Maduro’s political opponents.

All of those comments are much more toned down than what Faller said when he indicated that Chinese investments in ports around the world could be part of its strategy to establish new bases for its growing fleet of warships.

“We look with growing alarming concern at the expansive massive blue water navy that China is using and question the intent and use of that Navy going forward” Faller said. “So I absolutely think that they’re on a march to do what they need to ensure the communist party stays intact. And I ask the question why would they be looking at so many ports including deep water ports in this hemisphere?”

My God. He’s right. If the Chinese can send their warships to South America what’s to stop them from sailing right up the Potomac and claiming Washington D.C. as their summer residence?

Please forgive me for sounding so dismissive but the Pentagon’s rhetoric reminds me of the 1967 movie Battle Beneath the Earth about a Chinese general’s plot to dig tunnels underneath the United States and explode nuclear weapons below American cities.

“They’re crawling under us I tell you” one character says. “Just like ants.”

Now just because the Pentagon may be overhyping the threat China poses to the United States doesn’t mean that the Beijing regime is warm or cuddly. In June 1989 People’s Liberation Army tanks crushed pro-democracy protestors in Tiananmen Square and not a single Chinese leader has been prosecuted for murder.

China is currently strangling the remnants of representative government in Hong Kong showing that its methods have become more subtle over the past 30 years but no less effective.

It is also worth noting that China’s foreign policy involves bending leaders around the world to its will said Patrick Cronin Chair for Asia-Pacific Security at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington D.C.

“China would like to win friends and influence people to help rewrite global rules and institutions to make them more agreeable to China’s interests” said Cronin who added that the United States neglects the Western Hemisphere at its own peril.

However China’s activities in South and Central America do not pose a direct military threat to the United States he said.

Rather China’s efforts in the Western Hemisphere are part of its global strategy to dominate commerce and communications at physical and informational choke points he said.

Long story short: The final battle against communism is likely not going to be won or lost in South America. If the Pentagon is really looking for a fight to the death it should start combating the spread of QAnon and other conspiracy theories within the ranks. Those types of lies pose a much greater threat to our democracy than China.

But to make sure that China is not trying any funny stuff in Latin America or the Caribbean I am publicly volunteering to go on a six-month fact-finding mission in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic to make sure the People’s Liberation Army is not trying to interfere with our precious alcohol supply.

As the hospitality industry remains mostly closed while the coronavirus pandemic continues many of us have been turning to the trusty takeaway.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month confirmed the government's roadmap out of lockdown which aims to see the country restored to normality with all restrictions lifted by June 21 - if the government's four key tests are met.

Bars and restaurants are allowed to reopen from April 12 for outdoor service only but that doesn't mean we'll be turning our backs on takeaways anytime soon.

With that in mind we decided to pit popular takeaway Domino's against budget-friendly supermarket Aldi.

Aldi's 'fakeaway' Carlos range aims to hit that takeaway craving for a fraction of the cost but does it compare to the experts at Domino's?

Domino's

We ordered two pizzas from Domino's a large original cheese and tomato (£16.99) and a medium cheese and tomato with added mushrooms (£16.49).

For our sides we opted for potato wedges (£4.99) and vegan nuggets (£5.99).

The pizzas though expensive were delicious. Domino's nailed the perfect balance of pizza sauce to cheese ratio and didn't scrimp on the flavour. The sauce was zingy and rich while the cheese was delightfully gooey.

The dough tasted fresh and indulgent. The crust was soft enough to enjoy without the need for a dip though the included garlic dip did give it a little edge.

The potato wedges were lightly spiced and perfectly cooked - fluffy but still with a bit of a bite though the price is a bit steep for what you get.

The vegan nuggets were unfortunately very dry while the breadcrumb casing was flavourless leading to an unsatisfying and bland experience.

Our total bill came to £44.46 although there was an offer for 40% off when you spend £40 or more taking it down to a much more reasonable £29.67.

Aldi

Aldi's Carlos range has a few items to choose from though no nuggets or wedges to compare to Domino's.

The popular discount retailer's full Carlos takeaway range which includes two pizzas a side and dessert cost just £6.25 which is more than £34 cheaper than the equivalent from takeaway giant Domino's.

We opted for two Carlos stuffed crust cheese and tomato pizzas (£1.59 each) and garlic pizza bread (89p) taking our total bill to £4.07. If we'd paid full price for our Domino's Aldi's version would have been a whopping £40.39 cheaper.

But how did the taste measure up?

The pizza dough was a lot tougher and drier than Domino's and you could tell it had come from the freezer aisle though it was still enjoyable.

The cheese in the stuffed crust was really disappointing though it didn't taste of anything and was a bizarre texture almost like a cheese sauce than real cheese.

The flavour of the sauce was a good rival to Domino's as it was tangy and generously applied to the pizza base. The cheese though didn't bake as well and wasn't as satisfying as Domino's.

The garlic bread was unfortunately incredibly greasy and a little sickly to eat.

The verdict

For us Domino's pizzas are far superior when it comes to taste - but they are overpriced when there are no offers available.

Our Domino's pizzas tasted freshly made whereas Aldi's were much drier and tougher and you could tell they had been frozen.

Aldi comes out on top by a mile though when it comes to price.

If you're keen for a weekend takeaway to indulge in but you don't want to break the bank then definitely opt for Aldi's budget-friendly offerings.

The 'fakeaway' will definitely satisfy those pizza cravings and still hit the spot while saving you plenty of cash to splash out on other treats.

If you're happy to splurge a little and taste is the most important thing to you then Domino's is the winner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hlYmxvZy5jb20vcGl6emEtaHV0bmV3c3RhbGdpYS1wYWNtYW4tYm94LWFyLWdhbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pizza Hut Releases Limited Edition PAC-MAN Box That Can Be Used to Play an AR Game - TechEBlog,"

DOV,Dover Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1jcmFzaC1zdXJ2aXZhbC1raXQtMy1zdG9ja3Mtd29ydGgtYWRkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock Market Crash Survival Kit: 3 Stocks Worth Adding Now,"These stocks can add stability during turbulent times.

As we saw earlier this month volatility is a dynamic beast that can lay dormant before reawakening when you least expect it. Former Fool contributor Morgan Housel covers the concept of surprises that lead to volatility in his book The Psychology of Money. Housel quotes Stanford professor Scott Sagan who said ""things that have never happened before happen all the time."" To Housel forecasting when the next crash will come or what it might look like isn't as important as accepting that volatility exists and positioning your portfolio accordingly.

With that we asked some of our contributors which companies are worth buying even if the stock market crashes again. They like Dover (DOV 0.06%) Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL -0.30%) and Univar Solutions (UNVR).

An industrials stalwart seems like a good fit for that survival kit

Scott Levine (Dover): Forget batteries and a radio. When it comes to preparing for a stock market crash it's critical for investors to fortify their portfolios with stocks that can weather the downturn -- stocks like Dover.

Over its nearly 75-year history Dover a diversified industrial manufacturer has withstood numerous market declines and has still provided market-beating returns for investors. Over the past 20 years for example the S&P 500 has risen 412% while Dover has soared nearly 600%.

Experienced investors however recognize that just because the stock has excelled in the past doesn't mean it's guaranteed to perform equally well in the future. So why is Dover a viable option for investors fretting over a potential market crash? For one the company is adept at prospering during in difficult economic environments. Last year for example Dover achieved impressive free cash flow growth. While many other companies struggled with the challenges wrought by the global pandemic Dover generated $939 million in free cash flow representing a 24% increase over the $758 million it generated in 2019.

Investors will find that Dover seems poised to succeed in 2021 as well. During the company's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings presentation management reported the company ended the year with $1.8 billion in backlog a 21% year-over-year increase. In addition management forecasts 2021 revenue will grow about 8% to 10% compared to the $6.7 billion it booked in 2020. Earnings presumably will also rise -- the company expects 2021 EPS of $5.42 to $5.62 -- a notable increase over the $4.70 it reported in 2020.

But wait there's more. Dover's recognition as a Dividend King provides another compelling reason why investors would be wise to pick up shares before the next market crash. Management remains committed to returning cash to shareholders -- the company has increased its payouts foe 65 consecutive years -- suggesting that investors who find themselves in the midst of market volatility can find comfort in receiving some cash thanks to Dover's dividend while they weather the storm.

Black gold at its finest

Daniel Foelber (Texas Pacific Land Corporation): Energy was the single worst-performing sector in 2018 2019 and 2020. Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL) was one of the only oil stocks that kept pace with the market during that three-year stretch. This year is different. Energy has so far been the best performing sector thanks to higher oil prices. Shares of TPL are up a staggering 135% in the past three months. So how has TPL been able to outperform other oil stocks during both bad times and good times? Own a bunch of land with a lot of oil.

TPL owns 880000 acres of West Texas oil-rich land which is about 4.5 times bigger than New York City. The way it acquired this land has nothing to do with oil but rather the 18th century railroad industry. Oil pipeline infrastructure and utility companies pay TPL to use its land for a variety of reasons. Use increases as oil prices rise. And oil prices are rising as demand picks up faster than expected. Oil prices are now at their highest levels in over a year which adds a mighty incentive for West Texas producers to complete more wells.

Despite lower oil prices TPL was able to generate over $300 million in revenue and $207 million in operating cash flow last year. In 2020 it distributed over 97% of that cash flow to shareholders in the form of special dividends.

With no debt over $300 million in cash access to upside and virtually no downside risk TPL as a business seems like a no-brainer. The question becomes whether to buy this business at its current price or wait for a pullback. Investors worried about a stock market crash can take solace knowing that TPL owns tangible assets that will generate income no matter Mr. Market's mood.

Univar Solutions: Self-help helps

Lee Samaha (Univar Solutions): This specialty chemicals company is worth buying because its growth prospects largely come down to internal execution and its valuation (based on hitting its targets) is very cheap. In fact it's so cheap that it could appreciate even given a general market sell-off.

Management plans to achieve a 9% earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin before the end of 2022 its so-called ""S22 Program."" Note that doesn't mean an EBITDA margin of 9% in 2022 overall but it does imply a figure of 9% or above for 2023.

Given that the analyst consensus for revenue in 2022 is $8.85 billion it implies at least $800 million in EBITDA in 2023. That would put Univar on an enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) or EV-to-EBITDA valuation of 6.7 times in 2023.

Not only does that look very cheap in 2023 but the company's near-term valuation looks attractive too. Management expects free cash flow of $250 million to $300 million in 2021 putting the company on a full-year price-to-FCF multiple of between 12 times FCF and 14.5 times FCF. For reference Univar's adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.7% in 2020.

To get to its S22 Program targets management plans to reduce its cost base streamline its operations and invest in digital technologies to improve operational performance. Meanwhile the company is integrating its transformative acquisition of Nexeo Solutions and continuing to refocus the business toward specialty chemicals distribution while selling non-core businesses.

CEO David Jukes said on the recent earnings call that the ""S22 program is tracking very well toward delivering higher divestment proceeds growth and 9% EBITDA margins by year-end 2022 through global and functional excellence"" and if the company can get there then the stock could appreciate considerably.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2% to 13377.54 as the 10-year Treasury yield retreated. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 3940.59 breaking a two-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 103.23 points or 0.3% to 32731.20.

Shares of Tesla added 2.3% as rates fell and as Cathie Wood's Ark Invest put out a new price target on the stock which calls for it to quadruple in four years. Apple Microsoft and Netflix all gained at least 2% while Amazon and Facebook climbed more than 1% each.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to around 1.68% after touching a 14-month high last week (1 basis point equals 0.01%). The move higher in rates in recent weeks has raised concerns about valuations on growth and tech stocks.

""After the reopening exuberance fades and interest rates level off investors will rotate back into large cap technology stocks with strong free cash flow recurring revenues and increasing user penetration"" said Richard Saperstein chief investment officer at Treasury Partners.

Industrials got a boost after the New York Times reported that President Joe Biden is eyeing an infrastructure deal with as much as $3 trillion spending to boost the economy. Most Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs were expecting around $2 trillion on infrastructure spending. Shares of Caterpillar traded into the green following the news and closed the session 0.3% higher.

The major averages rebounded from a losing week when a jump in bond yields pressured the high-growth stocks which had led the indexes back from their pandemic-sparked sell-off last year. The Dow and S&P 500 fell 0.5% and 0.8% last week respectively breaking two-week winning streaks. The Nasdaq lost 0.8% during the same period.

Still optimism about the markets and the economic recovery has been growing as vaccines roll out across the country with the pace of Americans getting shots climbing in recent weeks.

U.S. trial data released Monday showed the Covid vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness and 100% effective against severe disease and hospitalization.

Many on Wall Street believe bond yields' rebound to pre-pandemic levels shouldn't be too alarming given the magnitude of the economic recovery from pandemic-triggered recession.

""We believe the recent rise in nominal government bond yields led by real yields is justified and reflects markets awakening to positive developments on the faster-than-expected activity restart combined with historically large fiscal stimulus – all helped by a ramp-up in vaccinations in the U.S."" Wei Li global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVhdHNoZWV0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2xlYXZlLWl0LXRvLWJlYXZlci11bmxpa2VseS1wZW9wbGUtamVycnktbWF0aGVycy1vcGVuZWQtYW5zd2VyZWQtaGlzLXRvbnktZG93cy1mYW4tbWFpbC5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Leave It to Beaver': The Unlikely People Jerry Mathers Said Opened and Answered His and Tony Dow's Fan Mail,"'Leave It to Beaver' stars Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow got a lot of mail. Find out the unexpected party that opened and answered it all.

When the classic television series Leave It to Beaver began airing in 1957 it made instant stars out of its child actors Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow.

According to Mathers an immediate result of their fame were bags and bags of fan mail.

And these were the unexpected personnel handling all those messages from fans.

Mathers and Dow are as close as real-life brothers

Although several of the show’s cast members have died in the years since the beloved family comedy went off the air Mathers and Dow haven’t allowed the years to distance them. The friends keep in touch and appeared on Today in 2017 to mark the show’s 60th anniversary.

As Mathers said “We’re good friends. Anything goes on in our families we know about it.” To which Dow interjected “He’s still a squirt though.”

Mathers’ mother was responsible for his successful career

Jerry Mathers’ mom supported him throughout his acting career which began at the age of 2 when she was approached by a clothing catalog company representative while shopping with her son. The rep felt Mathers would be a perfect model for her company. His mother was at first reluctant to sign her son up. However as Mathers told the Television Academy Foundation in 2006 she was ultimately wooed as any mother of a growing child would be by the prospect of free clothes.

“A lady came up to her and said ‘Your little boy looks just like the family in our catalog. Would it be possible for him to be a model for our catalog?’” he recalled. “‘We could pay him and he could keep all the clothes that he would wear.’ My mom said ‘You know he could probably do that.’ So that’s actually how I started” Mathers said laughing.

Here’s who handled the stars’ fan mail

As mentioned the boys began receiving fan mail almost as quickly as the show aired. Their “PR firm” on the show handling their correspondence? Their moms of course.

“When I was working as an actor because I was a juvenile I had to have her pretty much come with me full time to the studio” Mathers said. “She didn’t work [outside the home] but it really was a lot of work.”

The actor described how his mother threw himself into his career so much so that along with co-star Tony Dow’s mother the two women handled the huge amount of fan mail their sons received regularly.

“Her and Mrs. Dow both when we were doing Leave It to Beaver spent most of their days answering fan mail” the actor shared. “We would get those big mail bags we would get sometimes four or five mail bags a week between Tony and myself of fan mail.

“People don’t realize what a big project fan mail is. Especially at that time without computers if [the fans] wanted something you had to write them back. So it was quite a project especially with that kind of volume of mail. So her and Mrs. Dow that was not a full-time job but they spent a lot of time doing that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yMS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvY2FuYWRpYW4tcGFjaWZpYy1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1zb3V0aGVybi1tZXJnZXIvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDMvMjEvaW52ZXN0aW5nL2NhbmFkaWFuLXBhY2lmaWMta2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktc291dGhlcm4tbWVyZ2Vy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Railroad megamerger would create the first Mexico-US-Canada freight rail network,"New York CNN Business —

Two of North America’s largest railroad companies announced a merger Sunday that would connect freight customers to Canada the United States and Mexico on a single network for the first time in history.

Canadian Pacific (CP) agreed to purchase Kansas City Southern (KSU) in a deal worth about $25 billion after discounting $3.8 billion of KCS debt that Canadian Pacific (CP) will take on. It would combine two of the industry’s fastest-growing rail companies at a time when online purchases have soared overwhelming ports and delaying shipments.

The companies said in a statement that the deal would help them become more competitive. That could become increasingly important as the USMCA – the revised NAFTA trade deal between the United States Canada and Mexico – takes hold. The combined company would operate 20000 miles of rail employing nearly 20000 people and generating annual sales of about $8.7 billion.

“The new competition we will inject into the North American transportation market cannot happen soon enough as the new USMCA Trade Agreement among these three countries makes the efficient integration of the continent’s supply chains more important than ever before” said Canadian Pacific CEO Keith Creel in a statement.

If the deal is consummated the rail companies would join their networks in Kansas City Missouri giving customers access to Canada the US Midwest the US Northeast the South Central United States and Mexico. The interchange point in Kansas City could remove a roadblock speeding up shipments by allowing some cargo to remain on the same car. Currently cargo being transported from one rival’s network to another may have to be swapped out to a new car to continue on its journey.

Despite the large purchase price the combined company which would be called Canadian Pacific Kansas City wouldn’t climb the rankings of the largest of the top-tier railroads: It would remain No. 6 in the United States by revenue.

Still the companies are predicting a potential antitrust fight. To win approval they noted in their joint statement that the deal wouldn’t remove any independent railroad competition from the market since the two combining companies serve different geographies.

The US Surface Transportation Board regulator would need to bless the deal first. The companies predict that could happen sometime in the middle of 2022."

National notoriety about whether District 65 respects parents limiting acceleration and eliminating geometry in its math program challenges in reopening schools and the persistent problem of a structural deficit – a recent forum for District 65 School Board candidates touched on these and more.

An audience of 175 attended the March 17 virtual forum hosted by Central Street Neighbors Association and attended by all eight candidates: Angela Blaising Joey Hailpern Soo La Kim Elisabeth “Biz” Lindsay-Ryan Ndona Muboyayi Donna Wang Su Katie Voorhees and Marquise Weatherspoon. Mr. Hailpern is seeking re-election. Ms. Lindsay-Ryan and Ms. Kim appointed to the Board in 2019 and 2020 respectively are seeking to retain their seats on the board.

Central Street Neighbors Association President Jeff Smith pressed all eight candidates to give their views on a story in the Atlantic magazine titled “What Happens When a Slogan Becomes the Curriculum” by Conor Friedersdorf. He wrote “A curriculum inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement is spreading raising questions about the line between education and indoctrination.”

A link to the article can be found here:

This is the third year the District has used parts of that curriculum during a week in Black History Month. In the prior two years notice was put on the District’s website and sent to parents but that was not done this year.

By way of introduction to his question he said “District 65 made national discussion this week in the Atlantic magazine for its Black Lives Matter curriculum. And I wouldn’t call it a puff piece. Dr. Beardsley is quoted as saying ‘We’re not in the business of telling kids what to think and to feel.’ But the author says that the district has crossed the line from education into indoctrination.”

QUESTIONS REGARDING RECENT ARTICLE IN THE ATLANTIC

Question: Has District 65 become too ideological? And is it detracting from learning? And specifically I’ve received a number of questions from residents asking is District 65 teaching students that quote whiteness unquote is a bad thing? And should it be?

Ms. Lindsay-Ryan said “It’s I guess fitting that I started this conversation since this is what I do every day with every client is to engage in these conversations. And I think it’s critically important for our kids to be raised as global citizens to have an understanding of honest history to understand all of the contexts of the struggles that are happening in our current times.

Elisabeth “Biz” Lindsay-Ryan

“And I think our Black Lives Matter curriculum as well as our LGBT+ curriculum and our Latinx are not those are full enough like we need to a comprehensive curriculum which is why we’re doing a revamp of the Social Studies program. But as a history major like I had to be fully out of my history-major college experience to learn one thing that was not a whitewashed history. I don’t want that for my kids; I want them to understand the world that they live in. I want them to understand the experiences of other people.

“And I think that there’s there’s a way for us to do that that is honest and allows each of us to understand where I situate us and how that that impacts our interactions with each other that doesn’t have to be punitive. It doesn’t have to be a declaration that there’s something wrong with whiteness but to understand the systemic pieces that dictate and influence all of our relationships and if Evanston wants to be the place that folks say we are this is a critical part of that education.”

To Mr. Hailpern Mr. Smith said “Have we crossed the line and become too ideological? Or is there an impact on other learning?“

Mr. Hailpern said he would start with a quote he contributed to the article “because that also partially is my answer. As a white man I’d be lying if I said there were not parts of the curriculum that made me feel uneasy.

“It is hard to have your child come home and point out to you the privilege you’ve long held but never noticed.

“I feel so good knowing that my children are learning the value community respect and fairness in a way I was never discreetly taught in school. Equity is a journey for some a fight for others. And in a distant hope for too many if this makes the longterm goals in our community more attainable a bit of unease on my white part is acceptable and necessary to me.

“I gave that piece to the author that he put in the article because he was asking great questions. And I think a lot of it comes back to trusting our teachers with our kids. We all send our children to school with teachers who have opinions.

“And what I want is for schools to be less apolitical and more political that doesn’t mean give kids opinions that doesn’t mean impose upon them. That means get them engaged and inspired on topics that really matter to make this world a better place because if it’s going to be better it’s going to be because of our children and the way that teachers nurture them.

“And we shouldn’t be afraid of that. Even if it makes us as adults and me as a white man a little bit uneasy at times.”

To Ms. Su Mr. Smith posed the question: Are we in balance or out of balance with regard to indoctrination versus education?“

Ms. Su said she took offense to the article and called it “poor journalism. There was a lot of anonymous quotes and a bit of a lack of accountability.

Donna Wang Su

“And you know history real history is not what I learned in the books. It is not how it’s been. What I do appreciate with District 65 what it has been doing with its curriculum especially Black Lives Matter that was done in collaboration with teachers. And that’s part of what we need to do more of that collaboration piece.

“I appreciate that there was the LGBTQIA+ equity curriculum. You know it helped bring about conversation in our house that I don’t know how I would have been able to bring it up. And what my kids are learning this new curriculum I’m unpacking myself.

“I grew up in an age where I was told to assimilate keep my head down and try to be as American as possible and my kids are proud to be who they are.

“And I will also say Governor Pritzker just signed into the bill for including African American History into the curriculum is just fantastic. And I’m also in support of the one where we’re going to include hopefully Asian-American history.”

To the next candidate Mr. Smith said “Ms. Kim are we teaching the right thing? Or have we become too political?”

Ms. Kim said “I will echo [Ms. Su’s] assessment of that article. I’ve been reading the Atlantic for a while. And I would just ask all of us to put on our critical thinking hats and take the claims of that article with a huge grain of salt. And I would also echo [Mr. Hailpern’s and Ms. Lindsay-Ryan’s] comments about what we need to do to teach our students real history not the one that watched Eurocentric version that we’ve gotten throughout our childhoods.

Soo La Kim

“And I want my children to ask critical questions and to reflect on where they sit as biracial children in our community. And I saw this great meme today: ‘Diversity is a fact; equity is a choice.’

“Inclusion is an action and belonging is the outcome. And I want all of our students however they identify in the District to feel a sense of belonging. And we can’t do that if we can’t interrogate our racial identities and our racialized history and the inequities that exist because of those systematic institutions that have benefited one group over others.”

To Ms. Blaising Mr. Smith said “I don’t know if you had a chance to read the Atlantic article but one way or the other how do you feel about where the district is at with its approach?”

Ms. Blaising said “I Iargely agree with the author. I think he pointed out a lot of the great things about the curriculum. And he pointed out some of the things that I think do cross the line.

Angela Blaising

“And I think I come at it from a standpoint of you know I grew up in a very white small Midwestern town. I had an adopted brother who was Asian. No family looked like us two sisters who looked like me. And I learned a lot about racism through that experience from sort of the sibling viewpoint.

“I’m a big believer that you have to experience things. And I worry that if you’re telling kids sort of how to think or what to think you’re going to miss that experience.

“So I also just think you have to look at the fact that schools are there to educate. I think a ton of the curriculum is educational particularly the social studies curriculum and the historical correct curriculum. But I think there’s a lot of things that don’t really add to education. And I think especially in the time of COVID we need to be really careful about the time the time we have to teach kids and how we’re using it.”

Mr. Smith asked Ms. Muboyayi “Should we be teaching students especially kindergarteners or younger grades that whiteness is a bad thing?“

Ms. Muboyayi said she had read the article and “I’m going to be very very very honest extremely candid. I was uncomfortable. And the reason why I was uncomfortable is because the way that certain things are being taught in the District is not necessarily from the standpoint point of empathy even though it’s often talked about. … I don’t think if you’re going to teach a child about racism and what is taking place in the past that was negative you do it no matter where you are going to make the child feel uncomfortable and feel bad about who they are.

Ndona Muboyayi

“I think that if you’re going to teach it you should teach it from the standpoint that you want all children to feel good about themselves but then still be able to point out what’s wrong and issue with that article is that my own experience with my daughter when she was at Haven was that one of her teachers was going over genocide in the world.

“But the way that this type of education is being taught in this District is that it’s always white people doing it to other people.

“And I brought up Rwandan genocide. My father’s from the Democratic Republic of Congo where millions of people were slaughtered in the neighboring country and millions of people in Congo have been killed over the past 20 years.

“And they were not white people doing it.

“But because I introduced that those books and articles to the teacher and because it was not white supremacy who had done it he refused to include it in the curriculum. That’s the danger.

“We have people who are ill-equipped to teach fact-based history. And yes I’m fully aware of the wrongs that white people have done in this world. Believe me I’m fully aware.

“But when we’re going to teach our children whether it’s about history about identity about self-worth we need to teach it in a manner where the children understand that you can’t label one group as being all bad and one group as being all good. We have to look at the facts in history even when it comes to children who are 5 years old.”

Mr. Smith said to Ms. Voorhees “Many of us are in Evanston because it is a politically aware place. Have we gone too far in District 65?”

Ms. Voorhees said “That’s exactly what I was going to say. I chose to live in Evanston because of the diversity. And I know a lot of my friends and neighbors absolutely agree with that.

“A very informative book for me at a young age I read Howard Zinn’s ‘People’s History of the United States’ and I got this other perspective of what actually happened in history. And so I’ve always been a huge believer in making sure that real history and values are taught. I read the article as well.

Katie Voorhees

“I think Intersectionality and Critical Race Theory are great – there are a lot of good points. I guess what I do worry about is how do you know in Intersectionality how does the relationship between privilege and oppression maybe get flipped?

“And I do worry that if we use the emotions of guilt and shame and weaponize those feelings you know our kids may not be able to process the complicated nature of these feelings. And will these kids end up having lower self-esteem and feel like they are bad?

“I just want to make sure that we’re lifting up all kids and not demonizing anyone.

“I don’t want that cycle of trauma to continue but in the reverse form. I think that’s a real concern.

“We need to model to our kids how we want to talk to each other. I get concerned if kids are hearing their parents using white supremacy and then kids call other kids in their class white supremacist. I think that’s a very very loaded word.”

Noting that Ms. Weatherspoon had the last word Mr. Smith said “This is an instance on the national radar for this. Where do you weigh in on it?“

Ms. Weatherspoon said “I agree that Evanston is a very diverse community. We don’t want anyone to feel like they are being ostracized for who they are or the color of their skin or who they love or any differences for that matter. I do believe that it is far too late in the game that we’ve now started teaching that Black lives do matter because for so many years that the lives of black people have been diminished.

Marquise Weatherspoon

“But I agree with the fact that the District has included so many different curriculums to speak to the times that we are in right now. And our children will be better humans because of the curriculum that they are learning in District 65 at this point.”

QUESTIONS REGARDING MATH ACCELERATION AND ELIMINATING EIGHTH-GRADE GEOMETRY

Question: Accelerated math for decades has been the gateway to the capstone program of the Evanston School of the campus track at Evanston Township High School. It seems the District 65 is planning to cut back on that and eliminate eighth grade geometry. So it’s a relatively simple question: Is the District doing the right thing or going in the wrong direction on that.

For the RoundTable’s story on the District’s new math program click here:

Ms. Su said “I struggle with this because there’s one answer that I would give you as a parent and there’s a different that I would give you as a candidate.

“I’m going to start with the parent. I have a child who has been pushing for math acceleration. In fact he wrote a letter. And he says he sent it to the School Board. I can’t tell because I don’t have access to the district 65.org where he wrote about his frustrations about not having accelerated math available to him as a sixth-grader.

“In this letter he talked about ‘Are we being prepared for the high school?’ Is this what it really is? He also asked ‘If your child is great at sports do you tell them “You know what you can only go so far because you’re not being fair to the other kids?”

“Or is there other ways around it? Or another thing if your kid is great at art or music you want to encourage that growth. You don’t tell them ‘Slow down because you need to let other kids catch up.’

“Or do you try to support them the best way possible? And I think that’s part of where I stand with math acceleration.

“Is the District doing the right thing or going in the wrong direction here?” Mr. Smith asked Ms. Muboyayi.

Ms. Muboyayi said “My opinion is very similar to that of Donna Wang Su’s which is I do believe that children who do well in accelerated math should have the opportunity to continue to do so. And for those who are not yet capable of doing the work if their parents would like and the children would like to take on the challenge I believe that they should have that right to do so as well.

“I do not think that it’s right that because all children are not in accelerated math at this time that it should be something that should be eliminated. “Because I believe that all children should be able to be challenged through education.

“And having challenge is not a bad thing. I think that challenging yourself helps to increase your knowledge year over year. And I am just very concerned about the way that it’s heading at this point.

Mr. Smith similarly asked Ms. Lindsay-Ryan “Is the District doing the right thing here or going in the wrong direction?

Ms. Lindsay-Ryan said “I think we’re doing the right thing. … I think when we are looking at both a detracting algebra and math acceleration I think there’s a lot of confusion about what we’re talking about.

“And essentially we are trusting our educators. This came out of our middle school teachers saying ‘This doesn’t really make sense the way we’re doing this like for algebra we’re teaching the same book in a high level class and we’re teaching the same book in a regular class. Why don’t we work on differentiation so that everybody can get as far as they can get?’ … So it’s not like math acceleration is not possible anymore. In the new system it’s really about making sure that we’re removing barriers so that there isn’t the racial predictability that has been happening with these programs.”

Mr. Smith asked Ms. Blaising “Do you have a different take on that? Is the District doing the right thing or going in the wrong direction here?“

Ms. Blaising said “My concern is really the concern of sort of what [Ms. Su] said that you do have kids that just may really need that extra math to kind of keep going.

“And so with that it’s a struggle: How do you balance both? There was a very compelling letter to the Board – I think it was in February – from a mom who recited that she was a Black woman at Harvard her first year and hadn’t had access to advanced math and was behind and how hard as a Black woman it was for her to catch up.

“And that really resonated because I think you have to understand that by taking away something you’re also taking it away from Black and brown students not just white students. And that’s really concerning to me is if we’re taking away from those students how are we making it?

“You know how are we going to get them into colleges and make their lives better not harder?”

Mr. Smith asked Ms. Voorhees “Are we going in the wrong direction or the right direction with cutbacks and math acceleration and what I understand to be the elimination of eighth-grade geometry?”

Ms. Voorhees said “I agree with Angela [Blaising] and I don’t think we should cut the Advanced Math. Just as a personal value I think one should never lower standards.

“Instead we should raise more people up to meet the very high standards. And I think we need to prepare more Black and brown kids from a very young age to be prepared for more advanced math. We need more tutoring and more services to just make sure everyone’s on the same page early on. I just I never want to take a challenge away from anyone.”

“Ms. Weatherspoon” Mr. Smith asked “Are we going in the right direction or the wrong direction with regard to math at District 65?”

Ms. Weatherspoon said “I believe that District 65 is doing what is necessary for the children that are not benefiting from it and also giving more opportunity to the children that would benefit from it. I would not agree with totally taking it out because we do need to challenge our students; we need to be able to offer them to be able to think beyond where they feel comfortable so that they can stretch their capabilities and be prepared for [District] 202.”

Ms. Weatherspoon added that one of her sons’ favorite subjects is math and she thought that their peers would help them engage in an accelerated math program. “So I would agree that we should certainly not remove it but keep it and challenge our students.”

Mr. Smith asked “Ms. Kim if you’re on the Board in the coming years is this a policy that you would seek to change in some way or continue the trend that we’re on?”

Ms. Kim said “I encourage everyone to listen to the discussion of math acceleration at the recent Board meeting that Dr. Beardsley and David Wartowski presented and I think it’s very compelling and it’s research based. The issue with math six/seven was that it had a segregated outcome. It was a segregated learning space.

“I don’t think tutoring is really addressing that issue. I think tutoring turns the problem back onto the student instead of looking closely at the system that’s creating these unequal outcomes.

“Also math acceleration isn’t going away. As Dr. Beardsley explained we are doing acceleration by instruction which means again differentiating within the classroom. And if a student is so accelerated that they can skip a grade that is still an option.

“One of the other details that was really telling to me from Mr. Wartowski’s presentation is that only 25% of students who take math six/seven end up taking multivariate calculus at ETHS so it’s a very narrow small percentage. “The other students have multiple accesses to pathways to all the different levels of math. So why not open up that math? Why is math six/seven thought of as the only pathway to those advanced classes? It’s not. So I don’t think we should fetishize this one accelerated class as the only way to achieve math acceleration because it’s not.

“So I would like to see this program math acceleration by instruction implemented and track the progress and see if we can then create better access for all of our students.”

Mr. Smith asked the same question of Mr. Hailpern.

Mr. Hailpern said “For me this is a question about engagement. Acceleration is something that some students do need. And we need classrooms that can meet students’ needs and articulate to parents how they’re doing that.

“In terms of the research base behind the programmatic shifts that are happening Jo Boaler out at Stanford check out youtube.com she’s got a lot of resources that show you what a high ceiling/low floor classroom looks like. These are math tests that talk about the same standard the same skill but do it in highly developed ways but also foundational ways so students within the same learning classroom can cascade their way through and you climb that staircase and develop something earlier in the learning and become more achieved by the end. Something that if you’re in a tracked classroom setting might be capped or might be restricted.

“And that’s what this is about. To what Soo La [Kim] said we’re not eliminating opportunities at the high school for courses; only 4% of kids take MV calc. This is about what we call it. And it was predictable by race which kids were going to be in what class. The teachers came to us at 11 o’clock at night at a June Board meeting on the last day of school and presented to us that we are teaching the same classes under different names with the same textbooks. And this group is white and that group is Black and Brown. And we’d like to change that. And we responded to that. And if parents want to learn more about what this can look like in policy and action “What’s Math Got to Do With It” is a great book that I recommend to people. It’s a quick read. But it also talks about what we as adults understood as a tracking model isn’t what’s best for all kids not just Black and Brown kids.

“But in our elementary setting we have bands of opportunities for kids to learn foundational math skills and in the middle school we want to develop the mathematical practices and thinking during those three years and give them the full three years to develop it.”

QUESTIONS ABOUT OPENING SCHOOLS IN LIGHT OF COVID-19

District 65’s schools were closed for in-person learning this school year until Feb. 16. On that date the District implemented a hybrid model. For more on the model click here.

On March 15 Superintendent Devon Horton formally announced that the District is actively planning to bring back all students for in-person learning for the 2021-2022 school year. For more on this click here.

Question: Mr. Smith asked candidates how they would like School District 65 to go about addressing COVID-19 including reopening the schools repairing damage that has been done and addressing mental health issues.

Ms. Voorhees responded “COVID has really impacted all of our kids and their families. I was just reading an article in the Harvard Gazette talking about the kids whose parents have been more adversely affected as being the ones who are going to have more long-term problems with COVID with the mental health and psychological issues.

“So we’re talking about parents who have lost their jobs or parents who are more stressed out. I see a lot in my own practice parents who are over-relying on substance abuse and kids really have had to fend for themselves. And so when they come back to the schools – now it’s hybrid in the fall I expect that it will be full time – we’re going to need to have lots of supports for these kids. And we need to have an opportunity to bring in more mental health providers to work with the kids.

“My idea is to maybe make District 65 a training site for graduate psychology programs and then they can do their internships working with the kids. That way they get more services for no money which is the price is right.

But also we just have to really focus on teaching the kids self-soothing tools. And specifically we can teach kids to help each other as a community.”

Turning to Ms. Muboyayi Mr. Smith asked “Is there a different way you approach COVID than how the District is doing it now?”

Ms. Muboyayi said “I’ve been following the District from the very beginning. So my children are in the high school at ETHS but I do have many cousins in District 65. And one of the biggest concerns that I had in the beginning was that I did not want what was suggested which was for a specific demographic to go back before everyone else. So I was very concerned about that. But after speaking to a number of parents and also following Dr. Horton’s suggestion which was for the Black and Brown students to return first – and that was because they were being marginalized and because many of them didn’t have access to services – I was on the same page as Dr. Horton.

“But over time I have been listening to parents and what their needs were. A lot of them were happy that there were pods available for their children to go to study places where they can go outside of their homes so that they’re not falling behind and becoming depressed. So I do believe that they’re moving in the right direction right now where the children are being able to go back gradually like my daughter who’s at ETHS she’s now back at ETHS doing in-person distance learning. And I look forward to that same thing at District 65 for the other students.”

Mr. Smith asked “Mr. Halpern is the District getting it all right or is there something in retrospect you would do differently?”

Mr. Hailpern said “No. So I’ve been on the Medical Advisory Board as a board member I was on the Reopening Task Force last summer. I also work in a district that opened our doors at the start of the school year for eight weeks before we shut down. And we’re opening full time on April 5. So I know very well what it takes to open a school and to work with school teams to get it right.

“One of the things that’s a nuance of Board work and obviously having five labor unions is we have to negotiate certain things. And not everything is acceptable to every group. There’s a lot of questions it takes a lot of time in relationships. One of the things that I bring to the table is my ability to stay at the table even in disagreement and to work through things with people.

“And I think it was a fair question in the fall when people were asking for schools to reopen as to why we were being asked to make a Medical Advisory Board when we have public policy experts and public health officials giving guidance to schools that said different. Why would we ask other people to do different? And those were fair questions that we had to sort through.

“We do need to open our schools. We need to open our schools last week more so than we have now. I’m a big proponent about reopening but doing it safely because people that don’t feel safe at work or feel safe in the classroom aren’t available to teach or to learn. And that’s the big thing that we need to make sure that we’re telling that line between the professional responsibility and obligation but also making sure the workplace is safe and the learning environment is safe for everybody.”

“Ms. Blaising” Mr. Smith asked “is the District hitting .300 or .500 or 1.000 on this or is there something you’d do different?”

Ms. Blaising said “I’d probably do just about everything different to be quite honest. I don’t think I’d be sitting here running for the Board if this had gone the way that I was seeing it go at other districts.

“Just to be clear the Medical Advisory Committee came about because of parents. It didn’t come about because of Board members. But most of the emails from parents to Board members were not returned. And some of those were returned with actually incorrect factual scientific information.

“I just think there’s been a really big disregard for science and an over-regard for fear. I think that we’re on the right track but there’s hundreds of middle-schoolers that want and need to go back to school and they can’t even figure out a way to get these kids in the classroom and that is completely unacceptable.

“I know of no other districts anywhere they can’t get kids into middle school at this point. So I think it’s a huge mess. And it’s one of the reasons that I think we have to be really careful in the future goals we tackle. If we can’t get this right it just seems going the extra step and taking on more could lead to other issues down the road.”

Mr. Smith asked Ms. Kim “How would you repair the damage that I think everybody agrees kids are going to have to deal with from a disruptive year?”

Ms. Kim said “I think social emotional learning and academic learning are deeply integrated. So I think we need to pay attention to both and to boost up the social emotional aspects of academics.

“But I just wanted to clarify one thing. Dr. Horton never prioritized by race by Black and Brown you know prioritizing Black and Brown students for return. He explicitly said from the beginning that we were prioritizing free and reduced lunch students McKinney Vento [homeless] emergent bilinguals and those who are not making satisfactory academic progress. Those were the priority groups. So I want to be very clear that that was clarified that that was from the beginning the priority groups and I support that.

“I think we needed to address a crisis that was not having you know the same impact on different communities. It was disparately impacting Black and Brown communities in those in those priority groups. So I think that was a priority and I support that priority.

“But as we open and return to everyone those concerns are still there.”

Mr. Smith said “Ms. Su COVID and the reopening of schools: What do you think?”

Ms. Su said “So similar to Joey I also sat on the Summer Task Force for Reopening Schools. I think that I bring a different perspective as a staff administrator. I’ve worked at Northwestern for the last 15 years mostly in operations. So I’ve seen leadership directors make decisions and change policies. But I’ve been at the ground level implementing them trying to do damage control all of that.

Ms. Su said she saw a lot of different things happen at the District level and added “I think that from school to school communication has been so different. And I think the schools where there is that lack of communication has built this lack of trust. … I’ve heard complaints from several parents that there wasn’t a simple or smooth way for them to submit their concerns and questions … besides just doing a public statement at a Board meeting. So I think we need to fix some of that communication and rebuild that trust.”

“Ms. Lindsay-Ryan” Mr. Smith said “you’ve heard some of the criticisms of what the District has done. Do you agree are they in hindsight and looking forward? What do you think?”

Ms. Lindsay-Ryan said “I think one of the pieces of this discussion is largely about language. I think when we talk about safe reopening of schools I think all of us want safe reopening of schools we just have a different definition of what is safe. It’s not that some of us want schools to stay closed or some of us want whatever.

”So we followed the research that we and I just want to be candid this is probably one of the hardest decision-making processes I’ve ever been a part of in my life because being wrong could lead to death. Right. This was people’s lives were on the line we were making these decisions. And so you know it was critical that we engage all stakeholders in it. As Joey mentioned we have five unions you know and it was probably the hardest one of the hardest points for all of us to navigate through this decision making together. … And we do want to engage with them and have full conversations and figure out how to get our schools open but without cost of life.”

Mr. Smith asked “Ms. Weatherspoon you get the last word. Has the District done it right wrong [or] somewhere in between?”

Ms. Weatherspoon said “Well personally I think that the District was very thoughtful in this process. And as [Ms. Lindsay-Ryan] just said this had to be one of the hardest decisions considering that if any misstep this could have meant the lives of students and the lives of our teachers.

“So I agree with the way that they evaluated the situation and getting advice from medical professionals and allowing school to reopen safely. And what it looks like: Safety for me is now this hybrid approach that is going very well. My children are back in school. They’re back learning. They’re excited about seeing their friends and about being engaged with their teachers.”

QUESTIONS ABOUT DISTRICT 65’S PROJECTED DEFICITS

On Feb. 8 School District 65 administrators presented revised projections that forecast an operating deficit of $1.9 million for the 2021-2022 school year (FY’22) growing to $15 million in FY’26 – if action is not taken to increase revenues or reduce expenditures. For more on this click here.

Question: Mr. Smith said District 202 seems to be able to balance its budget during the pandemic but District 65 seems to be facing current or future deficits despite a hefty property tax increase. “Is the District’s fiscal house in order and if not who’s at fault and what needs to be done?”

Ms. Weatherspoon said “I think that the deficit is certainly a concern I do believe that they have a good eye on this situation and have plans in place as far as how to get us from under this crisis. They have been hit with a lot obviously during this pandemic just based on where a majority of the funding comes in through.

“So I think that with the new structure that they plan to implement and also any new ideas that they would get from the recent surveys I think that it’s going to be looking up. I don’t know that it will happen soon but I think that they’re committed to the work. And certainly if I am elected I will be committed to the work as well.”

Mr. Smith turned to Ms. Kim and asked “Miss Kim are we in good fiscal shape if not what needs to be done?”

Ms. Kim said “We are facing a structural deficit that has been in place for decades. I believe Joey [Hailpern] shared recently the historical documents from when the referendum was being passed.

And the referendum in 2017 was never meant to solve the structural deficit it was meant to buy us time to evaluate and figure out where cuts needed to be made and where we needed to right size and figure out efficiencies.

“And that’s where we are now. Unfortunately that timeline has been shortened because of the pandemic. And the revenues have decreased because of how property taxes are levied and how much we can collect in terms of property taxes. So there are a lot of factors that contribute to the structural deficit. And the issue is that the solutions were not addressed earlier. So the Board whatever Board is elected we’ll need to deal with that.

Mr. Smith asked Ms. Blaising “Do you agree? Or do you have a different take on it?”

Ms. Blaising said “I think the budget is a direct reflection of fiscal mismanagement both by the Board and the Superintendent. And I’ll just read from a spreadsheet I had: When the referendum was done in 2017 there was a pledge to use that money to fund certain funds over time including capital improvements contributing a million dollars to funds.

“The first two years after the referendum those pledges were met meaning the revenue exceeded expenses by more than the amount that was supposed to be saved into those funds. That reversed two years ago and is continuing to decline – so much so that we didn’t even save the million dollars that we pledged tax holders to save into the funds this year.

“If we continue on the trajectory that we’re on we will be in dire financial straits. Four to five million dollar budget cuts every year is going to wreak havoc on education. And I think it’s a big problem and I think it needs to be solved.”

“Ms. Voorhees what’s your take?” asked Mr. Smith.

Ms. Voorhees said “I agree. Despite knowing that the structural deficit exists the Board has approved for the administration to continue increases in spending by hiring many new positions 10 new administrative positions that do not impact students in the classroom. That equals $1.5 million.

“By the way enrollment has gone down at this point by almost 500 kids. Kids are leaving the District principals are leaving the District – three in the past few weeks. Many people in the District have p-cards [purchasing cards] with a $3000 limit.

“I just see so much mismanagement so much so that now a school might need to be closed. And what does that mean? That means that kids are going to have to be moved to a different school larger classroom sizes fewer teachers. I think this is unnecessary and we need to stop spending the money that we don’t have.”

Mr. Smith asked Ms. Muboyayi “Do you see mismanagement or structural deficit or both?”

Ms. Muboyayi said “I actually do see a bit of both. And I absolutely agree with both Katie [Voorhees] Angela [Blaising] as well as Soo La [Kim].

“I believe that there is some management. But I also do believe that whoever’s going to be on the new Board must address these issues immediately. And in order to do so we do have to take a look at the spending that has taken place over the past two years look at the hiring as well as positions that have been terminated as a result of not being able to cover the salaries of some necessary employees such as reading specialists.

“I do believe that as a result of the much needed work of equity inclusion and diversity that’s been taking place with the District some things are extremely necessary.

“But at the same time based on the fact that we are in a deficit certain things need to be moved around in my opinion not necessarily getting rid of but actually looking at what’s working and what’s not working and move the funding to where it needs to be placed the most.”

Mr. Smith said “Mr. Hailpern You’re there right now. Would you use the word ‘crisis?’”

Mr. Hailpern said “Yeah. We have a fiscal sustainability problem. And that’s been a part of my work the past two years as Finance Chair. A couple of points. Katie [Voorhees] knows about p-cards because I dug that up and brought them up in a public meeting. Ndona [Muboyayi] wants to move money between funds but there’s actually laws that restrict the way money can be moved between funds. And Angela [Blaising] is referencing spreadsheets about the difference between revenues and expenditures in the first four years there was an excess.

“And if you look below on that spreadsheet there’s a line below that says how much money from the reserves is to be put to future deficits. So we were compiling money early in the referendum years to be spent in the out years which is what we’re in now. So we expected the deficit to be there so that we can use the referendum reserves in the out years.

“We need to figure this out. We need to straighten up. We need to go lean in the administration. But this has been here for decades. When 20 years ago or whenever JEH [the Joseph E. Hill early childhood and administration center] was built the District was asked to fund that this problem was there then.

“When we did the referendum six years ago the projection at the time was a $112 million deficit 10 years out which is why the referendum was asked for and we still have that problem. It needs to be straightened up. And we need a team of seven to do due diligence and work together to get it right.

Mr. Smith asked “Ms. Su what’s your perspective?

Ms. Su said “I do see it both ways.

“I do see that this has been a deficit that has continued over the years.” She contrasted District 65 with District 202 saying District 65 has 18 schools compared to one in 202. “Additionally” she said “there’s been the burden that the State has put on our Districts with funding teacher pensions but I also see a lack of transparency.

“When I was looking also at numbers and spreadsheets I saw that in February 2020 we were supposed to have a projected $43 million left in our fund reserves. But then in February 2021 our reserves in the projections dropped down to $28.5 million. That’s $15 million lost. And so I’m kind of curious what happened there.

“And I think that from what I’m hearing and what I’m reading there’s been quite a bit of spending on consulting.”

Mr. Smith asked Ms. Lindsay-Ryan “What needs to be done?”

Ms. Lindsay-Ryan said “Well I want to say that I think it’s a great disservice to have this conversation in one minute because it’s a very complex problem. And I really encourage folks to check out finance meetings. We had a five hour plus meeting on March 8 where we were talking about all these things trying to get more information.”

She said a comparison of District 65 to District 202 is “an apples-to-oranges comparison with 18 schools versus one school and all of the structural things there.

“I do support what Soo La [Kim] talked about in terms of the structural deficit. And I think Joey highlighted that this is a long problem and the folks on the Board now feel like we cannot keep kicking the can and are trying to solve that problem.

“There’s a lot of inaccurate information out there. This conversation keeps happening about 11 new positions. We’ve put a lot of information out there and I’d recommend again watching finance meetings and looking at campaign pages talking about that a lot of this was rebranding of positions. A lot of this was changing what this person was paid and moving that money over to pay this person. So the vast majority was budget- neutral.

“And the idea that we can’t ever consider like nobody wants to close a school but schools have to do their job in serving our community. And if we get to the point where the enrollment is 10 kids in the school we have to think about enrollment and have things tied to those things. So we can’t have any decisions that are off the table. No matter how emotional they are or how tied we are to them. We have to consider all of the different pieces to make the best sustainable decisions for our District as a whole.”

Mr. Smith concluded the two-hour forum saying “I believe that we’re having what many in Evanston claim we ought to have more difficult conversations. That’s why we’re having this forum.”

Corey Taylor's concert announced Wednesday will be the first at the iconic Detroit venue since mid-November 2019 a few months before COVID-19 engulfed the nation and halted in-person gatherings. Taylor's CMFTour is scheduled to be among the first national acts coming to metro Detroit. Scores of other performers who have kept tentative holds on spring and summer dates in Michigan and elsewhere will be watching closely.

Harpos normally packs in more than 2000 people in the east-side Detroit venue but it will likely be at limited capacity and lacking many of the hallmarks of a traditional heavy metal show. There won't be any crowd surfing stage storming or mosh pits — more like mosh pods and a psychosocially distant experience.

""To be honest with you I'm nervous"" said Ruzvelt Stevanovski who bought Harpos five years ago but has been in the business 40 years. ""I had the ball rollin' man … 2019 was a successful year. Most of the shows were sold out. We had the momentum going until this happened. It's like we're starting all over again.""

Many local venue operators have had the same feeling of being frozen in time for the past year not knowing when they could reopen or if they could survive that long.

DTE Energy Music Theatre the 15300-capacity amphitheater in Clarkston and symbol of summer has sat empty for a year and a half but its books remain full. James Taylor and Jackson Browne are scheduled to play there June 12 kicking off a season of big shows that includes Dave Matthews Steely Dan Steve Winwood Santana Ted Nugent Kiss and Alanis Morissette among others. Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre at Freedom Hill in Sterling Heights also has a full slate of shows scheduled.

What's likely to happen industry observers say is that some of the schedule will be pushed like what happened in 2020. Shows on the second half of the calendar stand a better chance of going forward.

""We are basically in a holding pattern"" said Scott Hammontree co-owner of the Intersection in Grand Rapids who also represents Michigan members of the National Independent Venue Association. ""Really a wait-and-see in terms of what the state will allow us to do and at what capacity we will be allowed to operate.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

A Look at the New Latta Nature Center and Preserve and Carolina Raptor Center

“So this is the brand-new raptor center” says Michele Miller Houck technically the Carolina Raptor Center’s associate executive director but someone who on the center’s website and in her email signature has adopted the title of “Chief Wonder Maker.”

“And it’ll have 40 enclosures. It’ll have an outdoor classroom and health and wellness center for the birds—so essentially this is where the diet is prepared. This is where the quarterly health checks are done on the birds. This is where they would come if they had an injury. This is for our resident birds that live at this facility—which will be probably between 60 and 80 birds that will live here.”

It’s midday on a January Friday at Quest the new multimillion-dollar science education center for the nonprofit Raptor Center and Latta Nature Center and Preserve (6345 Sample Rd. Huntersville); 1460-acre Latta Mecklenburg County’s largest nature preserve has hosted the Raptor Center since 1984. No one else is around—we’re all still slogging through the winter of COVID—and Houck and I keep our masks on and our conversation properly distanced.

But eventually Houck and the rest of her team hope as many as 100000 children and adults per year will roam the trail that leads to new enclosures for owls eagles hawks vultures shrikes and even a laughing kookaburra and take in bird shows at a new 200-seat Duke Energy Amphitheater.

This alone would be a significant step for the Raptor Center. But those improvements join hands with the now-completed 13000-square-foot Quest a modern education center for Latta with water-themed interactive exhibits meeting spaces classrooms and an indoor fountain that demonstrates how Charlotte gets its drinking water: rain that collects in nearby Mountain Island Lake.

The back part of Quest serves as an introductory stop for the Raptor Center and the building’s design allows visitors to take in the hydrological Latta exhibits in front then the Raptor Center space in back. From there they can head behind the building to the bird enclosures and amphitheater. Houck expects 20 of the enclosures to be finished this year.

Even after nearly 40 years and even though Latta and the Raptor Center are technically separate entities they’ve never integrated their missions this fully. The complex’s touchstones are “innovation and collaboration” she says. “We just think that we’re stronger together.” —Greg Lacour

A Visit to Lake Norman State Park (and Others)

Even boomtowns have oases. Here’s Lake Norman’s biggest: nearly 2000 acres of pines and mixed hardwoods 30 miles of mountain biking and hiking trails a 125- yard sandy beach and 32 sites for camping—and of course fishing. The state park (759 State Park Rd. Troutman) opened in 1962 after Duke Power donated the land and the lake’s sediment-rich waters teem with crappie perch bass and channel catfish.

The park about a 45-minute drive from Charlotte hugs the northern edge of the lake near Troutman and trails meander along the edges of coves and inlets. On a chilly Sunday afternoon in January families ply the tracks with their dogs and at the bottom of a peninsula near the visitor center a father and his two young sons cast lines from a sandstone boulder that juts into the water.

If you don’t need the expanse or care to drive that far check out any of a trio of local parks in Cornelius: Ramsey Creek Park (18441 Nantz Rd.) with its 44-acre waterfront area; Jetton Park (19000 Jetton Rd.) with its reservable decks and gazebos; and Robbins Park (17738 W. Catawba Ave.) a newer offering with a disc golf course and an expansive play area for kids. —G.L.

Carolina Renaissance Festival Returns

Historic Celebrations at Rural Hill

Historic Rural Hill (4431 Neck Rd. Huntersville) an open 265-acre rise just 16 miles north of uptown is a popular space for weddings and similar events along with normally the beloved Loch Norman Highland Games and North Carolina Brewers and Music Festival in spring and the Rural Hill Amazing Maize Maze in fall. As of this writing COVID has canceled the Loch Norman Games at least a major downer for a property devoted to Scottish history; its founder John Davidson built a mansion there in 1788 some 60 years after relatives of his had sailed from Scotland. (The remnants of the house which burned down in 1886 remain on the property.) Couples still go there to exchange vows among the tree stands though—and once says executive director Jessica Bustamante a falling walnut conked a bride on the head during the ceremony. —G.L.

Cornelius History on Foot

The town offers two 1.25-mile tours one each for north and south of Catawba Avenue. Highlights include the former site of the Cornelius Cotton Mill co-founded by J.B. Cornelius for whom the town was named in 1905. The mill building was demolished in 1997 and replaced by the town hall and (progress?) a Food Lion. —G.L.

A Saucy Survey: 5 Lakeside Pizzas to Try

Tour the world without leaving the lake

Naples-Style: The thin wood-fired pies at Aliño Pizzeria (500 S. Main St. Ste. 401 Mooresville) follow a traditional mold. Authenticity points: The tomato sauce is made from San Marzano tomatoes found only near Mount Vesuvius.

Chicago-Style: Deep-dish lovers in Charlotte point to Matt’s Chicago Dog (19732 One Norman Dr. Cornelius) for a prime multi-layered pie. The box is heavy so you can pretend you worked out today.

New York-Style: Hand-tossed NYC-style pizzas at Giovanni’s Pizza and Pasta (559 Winecoff School Rd. Concord) are regularly praised by northern transplants—and we all know which style has the most gatekeepers.

Buffalo-Style: Yes Buffalo has a style too: Expect a fluffy crust with toppings that cover the entire surface. The aptly named Taste of Buffalo Pizzeria (9610 Sherrill Estates Rd. Ste. B Huntersville) does it right.

Detroit-Style: Pellegrino’s Trattoria (275 N. Main St. Ste. C Troutman) slings many styles including Detroit’s: rectangular semi-deep slices with cheese cooked into the crust. —A.S.

Croon the Pit Stress Away at Saeed’s

We can’t think of a better Lake Norman bar that an Iranian mechanical engineer opened behind a gas station-turned-snow cone shop and which thanks largely to the patronage of Dale Earnhardt Jr. draws NASCAR drivers and crew when they feel like singing karaoke. COVID restrictions have hurt Saeed’s Bar & Grill (20832 Catawba Ave. Cornelius) as they have other bars; a longtime patron set up a GoFundMe in January on behalf of owner and founder Saeed Safaie. But Saeed hangs on with karaoke; a menu with burgers dogs subs and other racin’-appropriate grub; and young NASCAR stars like Cole Custer and Ryan Blaney who drop by every now and then. —G.L.

‘Strip’ Sips at The Soda Shop in Downtown Davidson

The Charlotte area doesn’t have much in the way of college-town “strips” the strings of cheek-by-jowl small businesses that have served generations of undergraduates. But Main Street in downtown Davidson is a kind of miniature Franklin Street in Chapel Hill with its antique stores the hobnobbing hub of Summit Coffee and Kindred perhaps the region’s best restaurant. The Soda Shop (104 S. Main St. Davidson) open since 1951 across Main Street from the imposing brick structures of Davidson College embodies the cozy atmosphere of downtown: You can squeeze into booths or perch atop old-fashioned soda fountain stools to inhale classic burgers fries and shakes. —G.L.

Say ‘Hello’ to Hello Sailor

Joe and Katy Kindred’s second restaurant (20210 Henderson Rd. Cornelius) serves Carolina classics like fried catfish blue crab claws and hushpuppies with a side of honey butter. Think of it as a Palm Springs inspired fish fry with a tiki bar and sweeping lake views. Enjoy calabash shrimp in the midcentury modern dining room sip a Negroni slushie on the covered patio and watch sailboats dock for lunch or treat the kids to chocolate and vanilla swirl soft serve. If you order something to go get the Lobster Roll on the Kindreds’ famous milk bread. No matter how you slice it a meal here tastes like an instant vacation. —T.B.

Rise Shine and Soak Up Sun at Café 100

This family-owned restaurant (100 Huntersville-Concord Rd. Huntersville) in a converted blue house serves breakfast and lunch until 2:30 p.m. daily. Order a bacon and egg combo Greek frittata or a Café Sunrise mimosa at the seven-seat counter. Stop in for lunch on a sunny day and enjoy a panini wrap or burger on the patio that overlooks the garden. —T.B.

… and Don’t Forget Dessert at Mooresville Ice Cream Company

This 97-year-old ice cream parlor (172 N. Broad St. Mooresville) serves classics like Nana’s Banana Pudding and My-Oh-My Peanut Butter Pie and it occasionally unveils new recipes like Flavor #88 in honor of Dale Jarrett’s 2014 induction into the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Stay and order a banana split at the counter or grab a cone to go and stroll downtown Mooresville. —T.B

Lost Worlds Brewing Brings Adventure to … a Cornelius Shopping Plaza

Dave Hamme is a relative newcomer to the beer world but being a business consultant gives him one key insight: “As craft beer’s been maturing and growing we had to differentiate ourselves.” He injected a love of archeology and adventure into Lost Worlds Brewing (19700-D One Norman Blvd. Cornelius) modeled after the explorer clubs of the early 1900s. Maps artifacts and the replica skull of a woolly rhinoceros—an extinct species that dwelled in Pleistocene Asia—adorn the walls.

Hamme’s brewery at One Norman Plaza is less than a year old but it gets national attention in beer publications and competitions. When we chat in January he shares “three pillars” that drive Lost Worlds’ success in our booming beer sector.

The first “whatever you’re doing you’ve got to do right” is why Hamme hired industry vets. Lost Worlds opened in April 2020 as a fully formed concept: Head brewer Dave Gonzalez—formerly of NoDa Brewing Rivermen Brewing Company Foothills Brewing and Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery—crafted brews that medaled in the NC Brewers’ Cup and the Great American Beer Festival. Content strategist Sherri Johnson’s past clients include Miller Brewing Company; she brought along a graphic designer from those days to create Lost Worlds’ intricate cans and merchandise.

The second pillar Hamme says was to build a “lifestyle brand” beyond the cans and apparel. One example: Lost Worlds calls its bartenders “Adventure Guides” and each staffer is trained to regale visitors with the explorers’ tales that inspired the brewery’s decor.

The third pillar “community” has been the most difficult for a place that opened during the shutdown last year. They’ve partnered with nonprofits Pat’s Place Advocacy Center Shirley’s Angels and Cornelius Animal Shelter and the brewery hosts yoga sessions hiking groups and soon speakers from the archeology field.

While his core customer base comes from the Lake Norman area Hamme hopes to host travelers when the world opens again. “Everyone has a great travel story they want to share” he says “and the key for us is to give them a place to do that.” —A.S.

Have a Glass at Davidson Wine Co.

This urban winery (121 Depot St. Davidson) is like a candy store for oenophiles who endure limited options at craft breweries. Choose from more than 35 varieties including Barolos pinotages petit verdot and ports. Order appetizers like crab and lobster dip and charcuterie or splurge on gluten-free chocolate mousse pie. —T.B.

SAN ANTONIO — Danielle Dupont with Wildlife Revealed has found her missing black raven Hoogin after he went missing this weekend.

The raven is part of an educational show for Wildlife Revealed. They were doing a show at the San Antonio Zoo for the newly opened Dragon Forest.

KENS 5 reached out to Dupont who said on Saturday that Hoogin became startled right before the show began because he's not used to the San Antonio area. Although his owners allow him to fly freely he wasn't able to find his way back after he took off as he is from Bastrop.

Dupont told us this little guy is spoiled! He normally sleeps in a large mew at home and is a ""good boy."" He can even say several phrases such as ""hello what you're a good boy want some water and come on.""

He went missing on Friday having been last spotted at La Tuna Icehouse & Grill. He reportedly showed up to the restaurant and literally asked an employee for some water.

On Sunday Dupont told KENS 5 Hoogin was found just across the street at Southtown Flats apartments.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jared Polis’ proclamation of March 20 as MeatOut Day has caused the opposite effect in several counties across Colorado including Weld County and even parts of Nebraska.

Polis’ attempt to promote the benefits of a more plant-based diet was met with outrage and uproar from farmers and ranchers across the state who contribute nearly $47 billion dollars each year to the Colorado agricultural industry.

“For our governor to say that we should have a meat-free day is the last straw” state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer R-Weld said. “It’s just one more attack against my county.”

In Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts pushed back against Polis’ proclamation by declaring Saturday as “Meat on the Menu” Day in his state.

“While meat is one of the most nutrient-dense foods you can eat there are radical anti-agricultural activists that are working to end meat production and our way of life here in Nebraska” Ricketts wrote on his Twitter account @GovRicketts.

The Farm Animal Rights Movement a nonprofit animal welfare organization began the MeatOut movement in 1985 with proclamations issued by states and countries around the world.

The proclamation aims to encourage people to eat more vegetables and fruits to help prevent risks associated with high-meat diets such as heart disease high cholesterol stroke cancer and diabetes. A 2020 study partly funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute links consumption of red and processed meat with a higher risk of heart disease and death. The World Health Organization in 2015 classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans” and processed meat as “carcinogenic to humans.”

In addition to the health benefits eating a more plant-based diet is said to help the environment in reducing carbon footprints preserving grasslands and wildlife habitats.

And while some area produce farmers understand what Polis was trying to do and appreciate his attempt to endorse their industry many have said that the governor went about the proclamation in the wrong way.

“My take on it is that I am a meat lover and am going to eat my meat regardless but I would prefer that the governor change it to a positive instead of the negative approach” said Kathy Rickart co-owner of Tigges Farms at 12404 County Road 64 1/2 in Greeley. “Instead let’s have a ‘Veggies In’ day rather than a MeatOut day and take a positive approach.”

Dean McElroy owner of Eden Herbs and Flowers 27491 County Road 66 in Gill agrees with Rickart in that a more positive approach would have probably been better accepted within a state that is agriculturally centered.

“I eat a salad every night and we raised our children to eat a salad every night. Our grandchildren eat a salad every night because you need raw food” McElroy said. “But to do this in an agricultural county that’s supplying most of the agricultural wealth in the area that’s not really the right way to go about it. You don’t start with the negative. A ‘Vegetable In’ day would have been better.”

Weld County Commissioner Lori Saine echoed that sentiment.

“In his proclamation the governor could have celebrated food choice in this diverse state and highlighted the Colorado-grown staples such as millet quinoa black beans that make vegan burgers and other meatless products” Saine said. “Instead he inferred that an essential part of our Weld agricultural industry is cruel unhealthy and unsafe for the environment.”

Saine wrote Polis a letter challenging him to a brisket cook-off hoping that the friendly contest would help open the governor’s mind toward agricultural constituents in Weld County.

On Wednesday Polis issued a op-ed backpedaling a bit on his proclamation to promote plant-based diets stating that he was “excited to see the grassroots movement that (his) recent proclamation helped generate in support and promotion of Colorado beef products.

“I’m hopeful that this renewed support helps our producers and all who earn a living in ranching and the livestock industry.”

The governor also stressed people’s right to choose what they eat without the government interfering in those choices.

“In Colorado we value the highly personal choice individuals make about what to eat” he said. “That choice is between you your family your doctor and the Lord.”

Polis’s statement also included the recipe for his Famed Brisket Rub.

Art Guttersen hosted the Meat-IN rally for Ag which took place at Double Check Arena 37440 County Road 43 in Eaton and included a barbecue of beef lamb and pork provided by Colorado ranchers farmers and meat producers such as Rockin 4D Meats Wells Ranch Arapahoe Meat Company and The Colorado Pork Producers Council.

The free event drew more than 250 people including Weld County Commissioner Scott James Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams and Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer R-Weld.

Betta Gumbo at 277 N. Lincoln Ave. in Loveland hosted Meat-In specials that included a smothered pork chop or lollipop wings.

Over at the Windsor Mill Tavern 301 Main St. Unit C customers could partake in the restaurant’s Mountain Man Feast that featured a platter piled high with bison tenderloin beef skirt steak New Zealand lamb smoked salmon buffalo jalapeno sausage wild game meatballs and chicken wings. Customers also received $15 off the feast in support of the Meat-In movement.

Polis isn’t the first governor of Colorado to make a MeatOut Day proclamation. In 2011 then-governor John Hickenlooper made a similar proclamation. However Hickenlooper’s event was met with much less pushback.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm93ZW5zYm9yb3RpbWVzLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzY5MDMyLXRyb3ktZGV3YXluZS1oYXJkaXNvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Troy DeWayne Hardison Obituary 2021 - Owensboro Times,"Troy DeWayne Hardison 50 of Owensboro joined his heavenly Father on March 20 2021 while under the care of Hospice of Western Kentucky.

In October 1986 Jeremy Bamber was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders at White House Farm.He has always maintained his innocence.

At the time of his sentence it was recommended that he serve a minimum of 25 years.

The Home Secretary amended this to a whole life term in 2004.

Bamber and his supporters continue to campaign for a new appeal.

Two appeals one in 1999 and one in 2002 failed and an application for appeal in 2012 was dismissed.

At the moment Bamber is incarcerated at the category A men’s prison HM Prison Wakefield West Yorkshire.

HM Prison Wakefield is the largest high-security prison in the United Kingdom and is nicknamed “Monster Mansion” due to a large number of high-profile killers and sex offenders held there.

Author Scott Lomax in his book Jeremy Bamber: Evil Almost Beyond Belief? detailed how Bamber worked as a peer partner in the prison helping other prisoners to read and white.

Bamber has also won several awards for transcribing books in the prison’s braille workshop.

Kakao favored bidder for eBay Korea sits this one out

When eBay Korea put itself on the block in January Kakao seemed to be one of the most promising bidders as it does battle in the highly-competitive e-commerce market.Kakao was expected to utilize its banking and payment services to secure more sellers and buyers for eBay Korea’s platforms following the acquisition to stand against market-leader Naver and recently-listed Coupang.eBay Korea runs Gmarket Auction and G9.Bucking expectations Kakao which operates Kakao Commerce did not take part in a preliminary bidding round for eBay Korea that took place on March 16 according to industry sources. Kakao refused to clarify citing confidentiality.Kakao Commerce which offers gift services and in-app shopping on KakaoTalk messaging app was seen bidding because acquiring eBay Korea could raise its online transactions to 25 trillion won ($22.32 billion) annually surpassing Coupang’s total and putting it on par with Naver according to Kim Hyun-yong an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities.Total online transactions made on Kakao last year were 4.6 trillion won the seventh most after Naver Coupang eBay Korea 11st WeMakePrice and TMON according to data provided by a research center at Meritz Securities.eBay Korea was the third largest e-commerce player in Korea last year. It accounted for 12 percent of domestic e-commerce market just behind Coupang’s 13 percent according to data by Statistics Korea and Kyobo Securities research center. Naver led the market at 17 percent.The final buyer of eBay Korea is expected to pay around 5 trillion won for the acquisition.The high price and lack of synergies are seen as the primary reasons for Kakao staying on the sideline.“Kakao has already established its own business ecosystem from KakaoTalk to Kakao Pay” said Prof. Seo Yong-gu who teaches business at Soomkyung Women’s University. “It would be a better strategy for Kakao to grow commerce through its established business structure instead of spending 5 trillion won and adapting new systems to the existing business ecosystem.”“If Kakao had decided to acquire eBay Korea [to become a major player to] stand against Coupang it would have to invest massive amount of money on building logistics infrastructure” said Park Jong-dae an analyst at Hana Financial Investment.As an open market eBay Korea mostly relies on logistics firms for delivery. Coupang has its own logistics facilities while Naver partnered with CJ Logistics the largest logistics firm in Korea and became the largest shareholder of Mesh Korea an operator of last-mile delivery service provider Vroong.“Kakao already has a [successful] platform which online retailers ultimately want and therefore is questionable whether it needs to spend significantly in acquiring eBay Korea” Park added.Kakao's unsuccessful partnership with 11st another open market operator last year was also seen as a reason Kakao stepped back.“Price competitiveness and optimal logistics service are the key to the e-commerce market these days and Kakao Commerce is focusing on diversifying product categories to expand user base” said a spokesperson for Kakao Commerce.Shinsegae and Lotte are among the retailers that took part in the bid to acquire eBay Korea according to local media outlets.BY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldm9sdC50di9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjEtMDMtMjAvNTczMTcvdHJhdmlzLXNjb3R0cy1mYW5zLWFyZS1yZXNlbGxpbmctaGlzLXNvbGQtb3V0LWNhY3RpLXNwaWtlZC1zZWx0emVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Scott's fans are reselling his sold out CACTI spiked seltzer,"No surprise — Travis Scott’s CACTI Agave Spiked Seltzer has sold out. The “Sicko Mode” rapper’s hard seltzer creation in collaboration with Anheuser-Busch was released earlier this week. US Weekly reported that after CACTI was released nationwide in 20000 stores on Monday — 24 hours later — many locations said they had sold out of the beverage.

Some fans have quickly taken their purchases to sites like eBay and are now attempting to resell CACTI for insane amounts. While the nine pack 12 oz cans are in retailers for just under $19 some opportunists on the e-commerce site currently have them priced at $70 and higher.

In an interview on CNBCs “Closing Bell” Anheuser-Busch CEO Michel Doukeris said the alcohol beverage giant is “ramping up production and delivery” due to the demand. The stores carrying the drink reported unprecedented sales. “Several of them are saying that they have never seen anything like this before: sold out within one day” Doukeris said.

CACTI is offered in three different flavors: pineapple lime and strawberry. It’s made with 100% premium blue weber agave from Mexico it’s 7% alcohol by volume. Cans will be offered in 12-ounce 16-ounce and 25-ounce sizes. Over the past few years spiked seltzer has reportedly grown into a $3 billion industry with companies like Truly and White Claw leading the way.

“CACTI is something I’m really proud of and have put a ton of work into. Me and the team really went in not only on getting the flavor right but on thousands of creative protos on everything from the actual beverage to the can concept to the packaging and how it is presented to the world” Scott said in an official statement back in December. “We always try to convey a feeling in our products. I’m a big fan of tequila so I came at it from that angle too. I’m really excited to put this out in 2021 and see other people be able to enjoy it.”

Doukeris mentioned on “Closing Bell” that Scott was “super hands-on” during the development of the product. And the rapper also known as Cactus Jack assisted in creating the commercial that aired during the Grammy Awards show.

Last year McDonalds experienced a similar frenzy when stores began to run out of ingredients due to demand for the Travis Scott meal. Scott’s collaborations with Jordan Brand routinely sell out upon their release as well.

Those who want to avoid paying extra for CACTI can visit the website Drinkcacti.com and use the store locator to search for local retailers carrying the drink.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3Mvb25lLW93bmVyLTE5NjktcG9udGlhYy1ndG8tcGFya2VkLXNpbmNlLTE5ODUtYm9hc3RzLW15c3RlcmlvdXMtb3JpZ2luYWwtbXVzY2xlLTE1Nzk2Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One-Owner 1969 Pontiac GTO Parked Since 1985 Boasts Mysterious Original Muscle,So overall the GTO itself is a car that can instantly catch everyone’s attention regardless of its condition though when you add some original tidbits a matching numbers engine and a full history the excitement really goes through the roof.The 1969 GTO that we have here has everything it needs to become an Internet sensation and this is the reason more than 30 people are already fighting to get it home as part of a no-reserve auction on eBay. In other words the highest bidder becomes the new owner of the GTO and with 5 days still left until the auction comes to an end there’s a chance its price increased substantially.This GTO is a one-owner car that was originally purchased new in Virginia before eventually being moved to Florida Hawaii and California.eBay seller estate-sale-warehouse explains the car is complete and comes with factory air conditioning power steering and power brakes but also with the original documentation receipts the owner’s manual and even a copy of the check used to pay for the car.As for the overall condition it looks fair yet it’s far from perfect with some rust in the outer wheel arches. The seller says some paintwork has already been done at some point so you should inspect this thoroughly before the purchase.On the other hand the under the hood part is as interesting as it is mysterious. While we do know it’s a matching numbers 400 paired with an automatic transmission no other information has been shared because the owner just wanted to sell the car in its current condition.“I have not attempted to start or do anything mechanical to the car” they say.Without a doubt this GTO is definitely worth checking out and this is why the interest in the eBay auction is already so high. The top bid is $14600 but as said expect it to skyrocket in the coming days.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldHN1cnJleS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLXdvcmxkLW5ld3MvcG9saWNlLXdhcm4tb3Zlci1zY2FtLXRhcmdldGluZy0yMDIyMzkwNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police warn over scam targeting sellers on Gumtree Facebook and eBay,"Something went wrong please try again later.

People have been warned to take care when selling expensive goods online after a number of frauds - totalling more than £171000 in one part of the UK alone.

People selling goods on Facebook Gumtree and eBay are being targetted by scammers - especially people selling high-value items such as watches and mobile phones.

The scammers pose as buyers who meet with the sellers and agree to pay via bank transfer reports BirminghamLive.

Police say money will appear to be sent to the seller's account - but later once they have handed over the goods and the buyer has gone - the transfer will fail.

Police say the money can appear as 'pending' in your account or on mobile apps it can even appear to have cleared.

West Midlands Police has warned sellers to check their online banking via a computer or phone their bank to confirm the payment is complete before handing over items.

Police are investigating 33 separate Action Fraud reports from February alone in the West Midlands with residents losing a total of £171k.

DC Edward Spokes from the Economic Crime Unit said: “The closure of non-essential shops has meant more people are buying and selling their goods online and unfortunately fraudsters are finding ways to take advantage of people even during this difficult time.



“Anyone selling goods online should check with their banks that any payments have cleared their accounts before handing over goods. Funds shown as pending in the account do not necessarily mean that the payment has been completed.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcDI0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMjA2NTc0NjMubWFuLWJ1eXMtZ3JlYXQteWFybW91dGgtcGxlYXN1cmUtYmVhY2gtbG9nLWZsdW1lLTE0MC1lYmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man buys Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach log flume for £140 on eBay,"Jason Lawrance a 28-year-old Lidl warehouse operative from Durham has visited the attraction on Great Yarmouth's Golden Mile for decades.

Jason (left) his brother and his mum: all loyal devotees of Great Yarmouth's Pleasure Beach which they visit nearly every year (Image: Jason Lawrance)

He settled on the idea of buying his own flume after coming across a fellow theme-park enthusiast in Blackpool in 2015 who had ""turned one of them into a go-kart"" and was ""riding it up and down the seafront"".

Inspired by the man's craftiness Mr Lawrance tracked down a vintage seller on eBay who happened to have eight Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach log flumes for sale down in Margate Kent.

His ""cheeky bid"" of £140 was accepted and the flume began the journey from one end of the country to the other.

However since that ""moment of madness"" five years ago Mr Lawrance confessed that the boat has sat dormant in the allotment at the back of his house.

The main reason for the delay in progressing with his project he said was the sheer heaviness of the flume.

""It took five big strapping men to get it out of the delivery van and into my garden"" he said. ""I had absolutely no idea the thing would be that heavy. It was like the weight of a small car.

""It's made of really thick fibreglass and it's taken five years for me and my mate to finally get round to sawing off the bottom. It took us four hours the other day because it required so much effort.

""I found out later that the seller had used a forklift to get the flume into the delivery van. And there we were with pure muscle power.""

Explaining why the Pleasure Beach flumes were in Kent in the first place owner Albert Jones explained he had sold some spare models to the Margate-based amusement park Dreamland years ago.

Mr Lawrance who has promised to keep the people of Great Yarmouth updated on his project said: ""My mam and brother were totally speechless when they saw this delivery van turn up with a log flume but they quickly came round.

""We're going to decorate it so it looks exactly like the Pleasure Beach flumes as they are now.

""Even if they wanted to move it they can't - it's impossible to lift."""

The concept art was posted by the game’s executive producer on Twitter in response to a Tweet from its creative director who said that fans “could use a little pick me up” following a few months without updates on the RPG’s progress.

BioWare released the first full trailer for the new Dragon Age game in December. The video offers the first look at the RPG instalment since Gamescom in August when the EA studio said the game was still in early development.

“We’re still in early production but we thought it was time to give you the very first look at how BioWare’s passionate team of developers are crafting this very special game” the studio said at the time.

Electronic Arts has reportedly allowed BioWare to drop all planned multiplayer features from Dragon Age 4 which will now be a single player RPG rather than a live service game.

That’s according to a Bloomberg report which claims the publisher had a change of heart after BioWare’s last live service game Anthem flopped while Respawn’s single-player title Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed expectations.

Last month BioWare announced that it had cancelled plans to reboot Anthem and would be focusing its efforts on the new Dragon Age upcoming Mass Effect titles and Star Wars: The Old Republic.

A team of about 30 people that had been working on Anthem’s redesign will reportedly now support development of the next Dragon Age instead.

Christian Dailey executive director of Dragon Age 4 has published another piece of concept art that gives us a bit more insight into what we can expect from BioWare's upcoming Dragon Age 4.

Dailey was prompted to post the image after creative director Matthew Goldman suggested the studio show something to fans to tide them over whilst they wait for more news. ""Meet me in Minrathous!"" Goldman said in a quote RT of the image below.

Minrathous is the biggest city in the world of Dragon Age – the capital of Tevinter – so it's no surprise to see this mysterious mage call that place their home.

Much has been said about David Dobrik and his Vlog Squad in recent weeks. The American YouTuber has seen former collaborators accuse him of creating an atmosphere of toxicity leaving them feeling “worthless” and “traumatized.”

Dobrik finally responded to the allegations in a March 16 YouTube video saying: “I’ve grown as a person and I don’t agree with some of the videos I’ve posted”.

The situation has worsened since Dobrik’s apology video with Vlog Squad member Durte Dom facing more allegations of sexual misconduct.

The backlash has seen Dobrik lose sponsorships with Electronic Arts HBO and more. There have been efforts to ‘review bomb’ his Dispo app as well but it now appears that he is losing followers in massive numbers.

Social media tracking site SocialBlade states that since March 17 (the day after his apology video was published) he has lost over 200000 YouTube subscribers dropping from 18.9m to 18.7m.

There’s also a whopping reduction in the number of views his channel has with a drop of 66 million apparent on March 19. Usually such a significant and sudden drop in views means a creator has deleted videos from their channel.

During the COVID-19 pandemic gaming played an even more important role in people’s everyday lives with games such as Animal Crossing offering the sense of escapism we all craved and sales of PS5 breaking all kinds of records.

While the stats around sales are all positive the facts behind the scenes paint a more disappointing picture. According to a 2020 census conducted by the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (ukie) women make up only 28% of the game development workforce – a number that is significantly below the national average. Despite the fact that women make up a significant portion of players they remain largely absent when it comes to the games’ creation and design.

As ukie notes “the sector will need to build both short- and long-term strategies that help support and develop existing talent” as well as implementing “a wide range of initiatives” to encourage future generations of female and non-binary gamers to join the industry.

This is why it’s important to highlight the women making strides in this field and inspiring others through their imaginative and meaningful creations that are integral to diversifying the game industry as a whole.

Below are just a handful of female game developers who are striving to make that change.

The 17-year-old has been granted a sporting exemption to Germany’s Covid-19 regulations meaning he will not be required to go into quarantine when returning to the country after the upcoming internationals.

Gareth Southgate admitted last week there were doubts over whether Bellingham would be able to take his place in the squad given the restrictions but said he wanted to take the chance as “those rules can change quickly”.

Bellingham’s club team-mate Jadon Sancho would have been in the same situation but the 20-year-old has been ruled out through injury.

Germany’s strict travel regulations had led to a number of Champions League fixtures being moved to neutral venues in recent weeks with Manchester City and Liverpool playing German opposition in Budapest earlier this month.

England face three World Cup qualifiers in the coming days with both San Marino and Poland due at Wembley either side of a trip to Albania.

Bellingham made his England debut in November appearing as a second-half substitute in the 3-0 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland becoming England’s third youngest full international in the process.

Ever since the series creators announced they were creating more Avatarverse content for Nickelodeon many fans have been clamoring for more backstory on the beloved Iroh. Baldwin who voiced the character from 2007 to 2008 took to Twitter on Saturday to pitch his own idea for the retired Fire Nation general.

""Honestly...if I had the power to green light an #Iroh spin-off at Nick...it would be this... A show for pre-schoolers in which Iroh imparts gentle life lessons in each episode. Not 'Mr. Roger's Neighborhood' but 'Uncle Iroh's Tea Shop'"" Baldwin wrote.

Despite being dispatched to hunt down the Avatar with his temperamental nephew Zuko (Dante Basco) the wise and free-spirited Iroh served as a mentor to many of the characters. He dispensed wisdom humor the occasional lotus tile and of course tea and even owned his own tea shop called the Jasmine Dragon in the animated show.

Baldwin who took over the role from Mako Iwamatsu following the actor's death initially tweeted about Iroh on Fred Rogers' birthday comparing the two sage TV personalities.

""Fred Rogers would have been 93 today"" Baldwin wrote. ""I've often said that I believe Iroh's enduring power is largely due to the fact that he represents #MrRogers for another generation. The lessons are the same. You're special. You matter. Be kind. Not sure how he felt about tea...""

Honestly...if I had the power to green light an #Iroh spin-off at Nick...it would be this...

""I've seen the positive impact the character can have on lives. I've seen it up close. Again and again and again"" he continued in another tweet. ""Make no mistake. Fred Rogers WAS Mr. Rogers. The character and the man were one and the same. Greg Baldwin is a voice actor and occasional narcissistic asshole. The fact that the Universe chose me of all people for this gig is... Humbling.""

In February it was announced Nickelodeon is launching Avatar Studios headed by Avatar: The Last Airbender creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko to create original content spanning animated series and movies based on the world of ATLA and The Legend of Korra.

Avatar Studios has already lined up its first project too: an animated theatrical film set to begin production this year.

In an exclusive statement to EW DiMartino and Konietzko expressed their excitement to ""develop our franchise and its storytelling on a vast scale in myriad exciting ways and mediums.""

All of that means an Iroh spin-off can't be ruled out but there are so many other characters and storylines fans will also want to see from a Red Lotus origin story to exploring what Team Avatar was like as adults.

The sprawling 6000-square foot property on a lush winding road overlooking Los Angeles is at the center of a legal war playing out in LA Superior Court between New York socialite Taylor Stein 54 and Lauder 60 the chairman of Estee Lauder.

Both Stein and Lauder are members of storied New York families. Lauder is the son of billionaire philanthropist Leonard Lauder who donated more than $1 billion worth of art to the Metropolitan Museum. Stein is the daughter of the late legendary NYC nightclub impresario Howard Stein who opened 1980s hot spots Xenon and Au Bar. Her grandfather Ruby Stein was a loan shark murdered by the Westies gang. His headless body was found floating in Jamaica Bay in May 1977.

The couple met at a party at Lauder’s Aspen mansion in 2000 when Lauder was still married to his wife Karen the mother of his two other daughters. The illicit affair began a year later and by 2005 Stein was pregnant. Lauder asked her to end the pregnancy because he was negotiating an agreement with his wife whom he eventually divorced in 2009 according to reports.

Stein became pregnant again in the fall of 2006 and had the baby in May 2007. The secretive Lauder who was then CEO of his family’s multinational company and did not want his personal life to end up in “the gossip press” as one of his lawyers said at the time arranged for the mother and newborn daughter to be taken to Aspen to escape media attention.

Under a 2007 agreement Stein was to receive $1 million every year if she did not publicly disclose the identity of her child’s father and she agreed not to come within 100 yards of any member of the Lauder family in Palm Beach Aspen and New York according to a report.

Stein and Lauder have had an explosively fraught relationship for years. A shouting match between them on an LA street in November 2012 resulted in Stein’s arrest after she allegedly punched him in the face. Stein pled guilty to a domestic charge and did 19 days of community service for the California Department of Transportation.

The recently-renewed battle over the mansion apparently began late last year after the couple’s 13-year-old daughter -— whose name The Post is withholding — allegedly described her parents as being “divorced” on social media. Lauder argued that the public post violated his demands for strict secrecy a source told The Post.

Those demands regarding his love child and former mistress have resulted in dozens of heavily redacted court filings and several attempts to seal the current case.

Stein is now accusing the billionaire baby daddy of backing out of a court-brokered arrangement to support them according to court papers. She also accuses Lauder of allegedly engaging in a campaign of harassment that included hiring high-profile private detective Jack Palladino to spy on her the source told The Post.

Stein first alleged in a 2018 complaint that Lauder was refusing to fund a “residence support trust” worth a reported $1 million a year and was trying to oust her and their daughter as well as her 10-year-old adopted son from the six-bedroom five-bathroom home that also includes a pool court papers say.

But by last fall — before the social media post blew things up — the warring parties seemed to have reached a truce with the help of a mediator. In November 2020 Stein’s attorney drafted an email to the judge in the case saying it had been settled. He sent it to Lauder’s attorney Thomas Nolan for review.

“Looks good” Nolan responded according to a copy of the email filed in court.

By January Nolan was arguing in legal papers that they had “merely reached a settlement in principle not a formal settlement.” This is when Stein discovered the long-threatened eviction from her home could be imminent.

“How is it that suddenly almost 2½ months after the fact ‘Looks good’ has been transformed by Lauder into in essence ‘Looks terribly wrong?'” Stein’s lawyers argued.

Calls and emails to lawyers for both Stein and Lauder were not returned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjAvc3R5bGUvc3BlbmRpbmctcmljaC1wZW9wbGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auctions of Cars Watches and Furniture Heat Up,"Rich people who shopped too much used to be called collectors.

I doubt I was alone in my struggle to find something thoughtful COVID-safe under $50— and if I'm being honest a gift I'd enjoy too.

That was how I landed on the idea of giving my partner a nice box of bath bombs. Not the mass-produced ones that try to seduce you with their colors when you're in the check-out line at Walgreens but something more bespoke. That meant turning to Etsy where I knew I could find something handmade by a mom-and-pop operation — ideally more eccentric and interesting than what one might find at Lush or Bath and Body Works.

The bath bomb set I settled on advertised themselves as ""handmade organic"" and ""healing"" — plus they were infused with ""essential oils."" ""FEEL your skin being nourished like never before; SEE the multicolor swirls of a long lasting beautiful fizz; HEAR your stress melting with the bubbles"" the description promised. And a bonus: these bath bombs had ""no parabens sulfates or chemicals"" and were ""only pure natural goodness."" It sounded soothing.

On Valentine's Day my fiancé unwrapped his gift thanked me and said ""you can use these too."" My not-so-sinister plan was working.

When it comes to having fun in a pandemic I take what I can get; and well let's just say I was very excited for this bath. I ran the hot water until it was halfway full and dropped in the purple bomb. As it dissolved it resembled a ball of yarn unfurling slowly turning the water a shade of cobalt blue. My bathroom smelled like a field of lavender; I was in heaven. I lowered my body into the hot bath and felt instantly relaxed. I read for about 20 minutes and then flipped the switch to drain the water. After my bath I felt so relaxed. Maybe the stress actually did melt with the bubbles. I even told my partner that it was the best bath I ever had — until it wasn't.

* * *

A few hours I felt the inexplicable urge to pee yet I hadn't been consuming liquids. The sensation was familiar; I immediately suspected that I had a urinary tract infection.

How did this happen? I wondered. Could it be that the best bath of my life is to blame?

I googled ""Can bath bombs cause UTIs?"" To my horror a slew of articles detailing why bath bombs are bad for women's health popped up.

In hindsight it should have been obvious why and how bath bombs aren't good for women. Foreign objects — like bath salts or color dye — can lead to the beginnings of a urinary tract infection.

Dr. Megan Evans MD Obstetrician and Gynecologist at Tufts Medical Center said the ingredients that are often used in bath bombs can cause ""irritation and inflammation to the vulva.""

""Irritation to the epithelium [skin on the outside of the body] makes it easier for bacteria to ascend up the urinary tract through the urethra and into the bladder causing a urinary tract infection"" Evans said.

So are all bath bombs equally bad? Is there a specific ingredient to look out for? Different bath bombs have different ingredients but most include a weak acid and a bicarbonate base to create the fizzing effect.

""It's difficult to know as bath bombs are likely made with a variety of ingredients"" Evans said. ""For some people artificial scents and colors could cause irritation to the vulva; for others it may be a specific ingredient; and not all people will have a reaction.""

Bath bombs are generally marketed towards women; and ironically the feminine design and scents may be what makes bath bombs apt to cause UTIs. The visual aesthetic achieved through dyes are a large part of the appeal. Indeed bath bombs are frequently Instagrammed by wellness influencers for their effervescent colors and effects.

Interestingly the history of the bath bomb predates social media: Lush Cosmetics claims that their co-founded invented the bath bomb in 1989. Still the visual culture of social media has inarguably helped popularize them. Hence since 2014 creating homemade bath bombs has become somewhat of a trend with how-to guides published in an array of publications from Scientific American to MindBodyGreen.

Evans agreed this is certainly part of a larger trend of products being marketed to women that aren't actually good nor ""necessary"" for their hygiene.

""Think 'vaginal cleaning products' or scented menstrual products'"" Evans said. ""Many people enjoy baths and this appears to add a fun element to the experience; however there may be unintended consequences like urinary tract infections or vaginal infections.""

Evans said in general she would recommend that women avoid heavily scented and artificially colored products.

""If you want to add something to your bath stick with things that you know haven't bothered you in the past"" she said. ""If you want to try a bath bomb check out the ingredients and proceed with caution; you might be surprised how many unfamiliar ingredients are in there.""

* * *

The next day I was able to get on antibiotics and AZO pills to relieve the discomfort. I was fine 10 days later. But I am forever wary of bath bombs and I can't shake the feeling that this should be common knowledge. To every woman considering a bath bomb I leave you with this: proceed with caution and know your risks. A bath bomb might be a ticking UTI time bomb in disguise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLXRyZW5kcy9hMzU2ODY3NzkvZmFzaGlvbi11cGN5bGNpbmctcGFuZGVtaWMtYm9vbS1leHBsYWluZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Luxury Brands Are Embracing Upcycling Amid the Pandemic,"Every item on this page was chosen by a Town & Country editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

The New York designer Hillary Taymour is something of a fashion rebel. Instead of following the industry norm and enticing fans to buy the latest from her label Collina Strada she teaches them the techniques necessary to imitate her trippy tie-dyes on their own or alter them to their liking should they so choose. “You don’t necessarily have to buy the brand to feel like you’re wearing the brand” she tells T&C. “You can just re-dye my shirts draw on your jeans or make a face mask with one of my patterns.”

Hers is an open source approach to clothesmaking that until recently was strictly the realm of DIY evangelists at e-commerce players like Etsy and among students at Parsons or L.A.’s Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising Taymour’s alma mater. Then the pandemic happened and suddenly designers like her are no longer a party of one. They are members of a growing sorority that privileges sustainability over trendiness ethics over exclusivity—and the major leagues are starting to pay attention firmly pushing upcycling into luxury’s mainstream.

“With their supply chains interrupted brands realized Oh we’ve got a lot of fabrics we’ve got a lot of clothes we’ve got a lot of implements already” says Orsola de Castro author of the new book .

Last June when Chanel’s factories reopened creative director Virginie Viard put together a resort collection using leftover but-tons and thread and yarns that they had in stock. Around then Burberry which had come under fire for burning unsold merchandise launched the ReBurberry Edit of sustainable pieces from its spring/summer 2020 collection. In October Prada which had introduced its Re-Nylon bags a year earlier launched a collection of ready-to-wear and accessories that used recycled nylon yarn and two months later the house rolled out 80 reworked vintage looks under the label Upcycled by Miu Miu. Gabriela Hearst recently named creative director at Chloé intends to stop using “virgin materials” at her namesake label by 2022.

Upcycling has even taken hold in haute couture. In January the Dutch designers Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren turned up the volume with an “Haute Fantaisie” rave that revitalized old dresses fabrics and surplus materials.

The high priest of circular fashion as this practice has come to be called is Martin Margiela who scavenged flea markets from his earliest days. In 1994 he recreated decades-old pieces down to the stitch with a collection that was eventually called Replica. Always ahead of the curve his successor John Galliano started riffing on this concept in February 2020 with a line named Recicla that metamorphoses found garments of varying sources and periods not all necessarily from the brand’s archive. Each limited edition piece carries a label disclosing its period and provenance. Call them Second Haute Roses.

The renaissance of redux fashion vintage and DIY design coincides with a cultural wave that puts a premium on sustainable shopping. Even Elon Musk is trawling Etsy these days. When the Tesla entrepreneur tweeted in January that he had “bought a hand-knit wool Marvin the Martian” helmet for his dog shares of the e-tailer platform took off. But that was after the publicly traded company had already enjoyed a 300 percent rally over the course of the last year as more shoppers turned to it as a way to support small businesses and procure materials to become makers themselves. (A year ago Etsy sold $12 million in fabric face masks in a single month; it is currently valued at around $29 billion.)

“Brands have realized that in order to attract younger audiences that are increasingly more concerned with the environmental and social impacts of the fashion industry they must begin to incorporate some of these values into their business strategy” says the stylist Rachael Wang.

For young designers championing a collage aesthetic is as much a stylistic choice as it is an ethical imperative. In London for instance Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena rode their one-of-a-kind dresses assembled from unwanted traditional fabrics from Bulgaria (Chopova’s home country) trinkets and fastenings found on Etsy and eBay to a coveted LVMH Prize last year.

Another prize winner Priya Ahluwalia draws on her Indian-Nigerian heritage to inform her patchwork garments which are made of largely vintage and deadstock materials. And Raffaella Hanley makes homespun pastiches using clothes culled from the Salvation Army for her label Lou Dallas by Raffaella. It’s not that what’s old is new; it’s that what new means is evolving.

“Fashion is a reflection of the time so it’s always going to be changing” Hanley says.

For her part Taymour has figured out a clever way of inviting fans to buy into her eco-conscious journey. “If you give anyone advice it needs to be in a very authentic way where they will have FOMO if they don’t do it”she says. She adds with a laugh “And if you don’t then you’re just a jerk.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZXZlcnltb20uY29tL2Zsb29yLW90dG9tYW4tcG91ZnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Ottoman Poufs to Spruce Up Your Space,"When it comes to baby-proofing padding any sharp corners is near the top of most parents’ list along with covering outlets and anchoring furniture.

As Phoebe told The Ringer in June 2020 the skeleton suits just make life a little more comfy for the Grammy nominee. “I put on the skeleton suit and it’s like ‘Damn this is comfortable’” she said. “So I think being a character is funny but it also it is rooted in reality. Like I really have been wearing the same pajamas for like two months. I wash them every three days and tried to get another pair online but they’re sold out.”

In August 2020 Phoebe revealed to Variety that she has five copies of the skeleton suit. “They’re so cheap — it’s the best idea ever to make my “look” the cheapest Halloween costume” she said. “They don’t hold up very well — when you sweat in them they’re disgusting — but I have a different one for each day and mass-wash them.” (One Reddit fan reported a different experience : “My b--h ass bought one when I was drunk for $140 on Etsy because I was shopping for a Halloween costume in March.”)

Phoebe went on: “I love things that are innocently creepy. I was mixing my first record [2018’s ‘Stranger in the Alps’] around Halloween time in Omaha and I went to Target for three hours. … I just love corny creepy stuff which is why my first record’s [visual theme] is a ghost and the second one is a skeleton.”

Phoebe Bridgers' fans are obsessed with her skeleton suit.

The California-raised singer — who snagged four Grammy nominations this year including nods for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album — also wore the skeleton suit for her Late Show With Stephen Colbert and Late Late Show With James Corden performances as well as for her “Kyoto” and “I Know the End” music videos. The latter music video also featured her bandmates in matching get-ups.

And now fans are eager to get their hands on a skeleton suit just like the ones Phoebe wears (and re-wears). “Hello PB fans I’m looking to buy the skeleton jumpsuit she wears or as close as possible” one devotee wrote on Reddit recently. “Does anyone have a source? I will be your best friend.” In a different Reddit thread another user wrote “Does anybody know where to get the iconic skeleton onesie [Phoebe] wears so often?”

The singer-songwriter’s costume is already influencing Amazon recommendations.

After a Reddit user referred that second fan to a skeleton suit on Amazon a commenter noted that Amazon lists the vinyl version of Phoebe’s album “Stranger in the Alps” as a product that customers can buy along with the costume!

That makes it easy to make mini houses and beds for cats. When it comes to dogs the beds on the market are usually about functionality and when they do have an interesting design it tends to be for smaller dogs.

Yes some designs (the handmade ones) have options to size up. But let’s be honest a great dane isn’t going to fit into any of these. Like most dogs he or she will be using your sofa or your bed for a nap when the chance arises.

But if you do want something for a small dog with character I might well have something for you in this selection of 10 designs. No order just 10 designs that will liven up both your home and your dog’s life.

1. Midcentury modern dog houses by Pijuan Design Workshop

Let’s start with the most expensive. But also one of the more appealing ranges out there.

As you might have noticed these are miniature midcentury modern houses for your dog. Well some aren’t that miniature. As you can see from the house at the top of the page big dogs ARE catered for here.

Each one is produced with attention to detail and using premium materials for some genuine authenticity despite the size. Handmade too so you can tweak the design if there is anything you want to add in (or take out).

Whether it’s an Eichler an A-frame or an individual midcentury modern statement you get the architectural style you love and your dog gets a great home. Note that some even double up as pieces of furniture too which adds in some extra value. Just as well as these start from around £1300 and jump up for the really big houses.

2. Le Corbusier-inspired Piet pet sofa at Made

Modernism of a slightly earlier era is the inspiration for this Piet pet sofa.

This one if you didn’t know seems loosely based on the iconic (and I don’t use that word lightly) LC seating range https://www.aram.co.uk/designers/le-corbusier-jeanneret-perriand by Le Corbusier Pierre Jeanneret Charlotte Perrian which dates back to 1928 and has been in production with Cassina since the mid-1960s (should you want to buy a full-size one).

Or you could just treat the dog with this one which is available in two sizes and has a chrome frame and a grey cushion. £159 gets him or her an iconic bed.

3. Midcentury modern walnut dog bed by Naluli

The dog here looks so proud of the bed So it should as this one looks super-cool.

This is based on a classic midcentury modern sofa design with that American walnut frame and velvet cushioning. Love the skinny tapered legs.

Handmade of course (this being Etsy) and available for around £267.

4. Eames-inspired dog beds by Cairu MCM

Various options from this maker all of which are worthy of a look of Eames is your thing.

Not that these are Eames designs But the curved wood certainly hints at the style and would fit effortlessly into an interior that happened to have original or reproduction pieces on display.

Small beds large beds covered beds and more. But I like this one which is one of the more pricey but has a great look from that walnut veneer on the bent plywood as well as the lovely atomic orange cushioning. One of the largest and priciest at £338 but other cheaper options available too.

5. Emery Dog Sofa by Archie & Oscar

I know this looks like the kind of sofa you and I would quite fancy in the house. But it is another design for dogs. Yes we really do spoil them.

Very cool with the angled legs the cushioned seat (that main cushion is removable) and the coloured cushions at the back. Another that’s perfect for a midcentury modern interior.

If you want it £127.99 gets you one.

6. Moby midcentury modern pet sofa at Made

Two colour options for this one which is also a more affordable option as well.

I preferred the mustard here but there’s also a pink and copper finish too. The design is based on the wonderful Moby sofa at Made but shrunk down for dogs (and cats/small dogs too if you go for the smaller size). Contrasting tapered legs are worth a mention too as well as the curves of this seat.

The prices are from £129.

7. Retro 1950s pet caravan at Daydream HQ

This works for both smaller dogs and cats. It also works as a talking point and a great piece of interior design.

Inspired by the classic Shasta trailer and available in five colours the trailer is crafted using thick birch wood with the colour added in which uses all-weather UV-protected inks. A free personalised licence plate too.

$249 for the caravan.

8. Handmade wooden bed dogs by Bed Pet UK

Something a little more rugged and functional perhaps. But I do like the finish of this one. It’s very much in tune with a lot of handmade midcentury modern designs out there right now.

A lovely wood frame harpoon legs and a memory foam mattress for comfort. This one is really but to last too. You might need to change the mattress now and then but the frame will probably outlive you!

9. Small dog bed by Lvll Design

Very much designed for smaller dogs. If that’s your dog have a look at this.

10. Tristan retro dog chair by Archie & Oscar

How does the idea of a retro chair instead of retro dog beds in the living room grab you? If it does this looks like it could be a well-priced option.

Well-priced because this design is actually in the sale right now in both shades. A circular chair with angled legs and plenty of comfort for your dog. It might even stop him or her from jumping on the sofa. But probably not.

£83.99 for this one.

Find out more at the Wayfair website

Or maybe instead of retro dog beds go for a retro pet cushion…

There are a few options for retro cushions but I have picked out a couple at the affordable end of the market.

The first is them is the Emmott dog cushion/bed which has a retro finish for the cloth and is top value at just £22. You can pick that one up here.

Or get one featuring the coolest cartoon dog. Yes the Snoopy cushion by Archie & Oscar is just so eye-catching and practical too. A cotton outer and wadding inside for comfort it’s the kind of dog bed you really don’t want to hide away. Woodstock available too with both selling for £62.99 here."

It joins a plethora of travel businesses that are remaking themselves whether they are launching financial services or subscription offerings during the pandemic.

Many travel businesses whether it is Trip.com Group in China Traveloka in Indonesia or Despegar in Argentina are refashioning themselves during the pandemic.

For China’s Trip.com formerly known globally as Ctrip it is trying to diversify away from its over-reliance on transactions particularly because the hotel discounting frenzy in China and its dependence on airline ticket sales lead to sub-par commission levels.

In its fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call earlier this month Trip.com officials detailed how they are getting into the content business to get a line into airline hotel and destinations’ advertising budgets.

“We traditionally only made most of our money from commission” co-founder and Executive Chairman Jianzhang “James” Liang told analysts during the earnings presentation. “So it’s really coming out of the sales budgets of airlines and destinations and hotels. Of course as we know they also have a marketing budget and branding budget probably just as large and the same order magnitude and it’s just as large as the sales budget. So this is the area that we hope to through our marketing and platform and our content capability be able to tap into in the near future.”

He said focusing on content creation and travel inspiration will attract new customers for Trip.com Group entice them to engage more frequently and spend more time on the brands’ apps which are seeing increased spending in domestic packages for example.

Getting Into Content Creation and Advertising

The move into content creation and the goal of creating advertising revenue comes after Trip.com Group entered into a joint venture with Massachusetts-headquartered Tripadvisor in late 2019 to share content on their respective platforms. Trip.com Group CEO Jie “Jane” Sun now has a Tripadvisor board position.

Tripadvisor of course has long brought in the majority of its revenue from advertising/media as opposed to transactions. Advertising is a relatively high-margin business compared with transactions.

We are not alleging that Tripadvisor is somehow directing or teaching Trip.com Group the content business. This isn’t a situation of an all-knowing fair-haired Western business teaching a Chinese enterprise which was founded in 1999 and even prior to Tripadvisor a thing or two about the travel business.

There are plenty of logical reasons for Trip.com Group to get into the advertising business and ways to learn about it. There may be many homegrown advertising models in China. Expedia Group too has long had an active media solutions business.

But it wouldn’t be surprising for Trip.com Group given its new strategic partnership to compare notes with Tripadvisor on its longstanding experience in the advertising arena.

Addressing Weaknesses

Here are some of the problems that China’s largest travel agency which has its online platform but also operates thousands of stores particularly in lower-tier cities is addressing with its move into the advertising business:

Skift’s Deep Dive Into Trip.com Group 2020 cited the fact that In May 2017 Trip.com Group disclosed that its net take rate on hotels because of couponing or discounting was relatively small at 8-10 percent. The company also has a dependence on flights which is a great source for new customers but provides low commissions.

Fast-forward to 2020 and you can see from the chart below that although Trip.com Group greatly outpaced Expedia Group and Booking Holdings in gross bookings or the total value of travel goods sold it lagged in revenue despite the relatively robust nature of China’s Covid travel recovery compared with the United States and Europe.

Trip.com Group Had the Largest Gross Bookings Among Its Peers

Company Revenue Net Income/Loss Gross Bookings Trip.com Group $2.8 billion $497 million $61 billion Expedia Group $5.2 billion $2.7 billion $36.8 billion Booking Holdings $6.8 billion $59 million $35.4 billion

In fact Trip.com Group attracted $61 billion in gross bookings in 2020 compared with $36.8 billion at Expedia Group and $35.4 billion at Booking Holdings.

Skift Research’s deep dive into Trip.com Group which used data as of October 28 2020 found that Booking Holdings’ take rate or commission levels were the highest at 16 percent Expedia Group generated 11 percent and Trip.com Group lagged considerably at 4 percent. Hotel commission levels in China are generally much lower than they are in North America or Europe.

So it is likely a smart move for Trip.com Group to address some of these take rate and margin weaknesses by entering the content and advertising business.

Sun explained during the earnings call that many Trip.com users already write reviews and travel journals on its platform arguing that its “strong product and transaction capability allows to make content-to-transaction conversion easy and frictionless.”

Said Sun: “For example our livestream channels delivered the highest conversion rate in travel industry last year. So for these reasons we are confident to see that we will be one of the go-to platforms for users that seek both travel inspirations and values for care in the short-haul and long-haul travel demand.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Every message pushes a sense of urgency onto consumers to buy the latest cellphone capable of unprecedented speeds. The 5G explosion isn’t just on its way it’s here.

For self-storage owners this evolution may enable you to capitalize financially by allowing your facility to become a new or enhanced cell-tower site. Let’s take a closer look at the 5G phenomenon and why it presents a great opportunity this year.

What Exactly Is 5G?

Existing 4G wireless networks which most mobile customers still use access relatively low radio frequencies compared to the new 5G networks being built across the United States. The higher frequencies used by 5G offer valuable upgrades including faster connections. In short they’ll support more devices and add never-before-seen capabilities to cellphones and other wireless devices.

While many folks get hung up on the additional speed that’ll be achieved 5G’s low latency is just as important particularly for businesses. Essentially wireless latency is the response time to download data such as streaming video or money transfers between an original source and the user’s destination such as a cellphone.

The Wireless Industry Is Changing

Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic many people have been working or attending school from home. They’ve also had to find new ways to entertain themselves. All this leads to greater consumer reliance on wireless services. The events of 2020 will likely accelerate investment in U.S.-based wireless networks and usher expansion and upgrades to existing broadband services. Whereas most people may have previously viewed access to wireless services as a privilege it’s now deemed a necessity.

Before last year the wireless industry expected more than 1 million new 5G cell sites to be built by 2025. These estimates are now being recalculated not only regarding the number of sites to build but by the speed with which they need to be complete. The heightened visibility to the importance of this new infrastructure means the wireless industry—particularly the cell-tower sector—might be poised to enter a boom period.

Land Rush

Property owners have been and will continue to be approached by wireless companies seeking to upgrade their existing cell-site equipment or install new equipment necessary to develop 5G networks which are going to be cash cows deep into the 21st century. It’s important to understand that 5G isn’t a replacement for existing cell-tower sites; it’s an enhancement to their current value. Further property owners who don’t already have a cell tower are more likely to be approached to lease their land.

As a self-storage owner you’ll have to decide whether you’ll be an unpaid or underpaid catalyst for wireless carriers or recognize that the new 5G rollout is an opportunity to optimize revenue. When approached by a cell-tower company or wireless carrier looking to modify cell-site equipment it’s important you understand the value of that update. Don’t be fooled by the work being described as “maintenance activity.”

Similarly if you’re engaged to install a new cell site it’s just as important if not more important that you understand the type of equipment that’s going to be installed on your property as well as how much space is being requested. 5G has made property more valuable to wireless carriers and cell-tower companies. Thus the amount you receive in rent should track that increase.

Think Like a Utility

The ever-expanding rollout of 5G presents an opportunity to garner new cell-tower rent or enhance an existing lease. Don’t view a cell-site lease or license agreement as a real estate transaction when every wireless carrier and cell-tower company views it as a utility transaction. Wireless companies view the value of the real estate only as a small variable. Their major consideration is how much value a cell site will garner them along with how much determent will occur if they’re unable to acquire a new site or upgrade an existing one.

While you may have experience negotiating property leases a cell-site agreement is quite different. In this context you’re like a baseball player being inserted into a football game. While some of your skills may translate you don’t have a shot at winning.

Don’t just take my word for it. Look at the profitability of the largest wireless carriers and cell-tower companies which is further boosted by the deals they make with property owners just like you. Trust me the wireless industry doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t matter if you own a single self-storage facility in a rural location or thousands in densely populated cities; wireless carriers and cell-tower companies are all going to maneuver out of the same playbook because those plays continue to be successful for them. Be prepared and don’t let them undervalue your position.

The 5G explosion is here. The only question you need to ask yourself is whether you want to be a primetime player or continue to sit in the stands and watch the game go by.

Gordnier was living with his brother and applying to jobs when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Before that Gordnier had spent eight years serving in the US Coast Guard.

""March April and May was just so difficult. Because of COVID I knew I wasn't going to find a job. The way that life was looking I had everything taken from me"" he told Insider.

""So now it was like 'okay we're rebuilding from absolute zero'"" he added.

Despite the setback Gordnier set a goal for himself to still try to find a job and save money so that one day he could retire with enough to be able to travel the US in an RV. But during that job hunt he decided to speed up the process just a little.

""I realized in that moment that I could cut 40 years out of that plan and just get the RV now"" Gordnier told Insider.

He said that his time in the Coast Guard inspired him to take the plunge.

""There was always that one guy who either lived in a van or in an RV who was saving a bunch of money"" he said. ""I never really wanted to do it until last year when I started actually planning out my life and I got to the end and I realized how much I actually would like it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiugFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvcmVhbF9lc3RhdGUvbmVhcmx5LTQwMC1ob21lcy1jb21pbmctdG8tbmV3LWpvaG5zLWlzbGFuZC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1uZXh0b24tYWRkaW5nLWFtZW5pdHktY2VudGVyL2FydGljbGVfMDFjYjYwYzQtNzc3Ny0xMWViLTk1ZWMtZWY3NjQ2ZTdkOTUzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 400 homes coming to new Johns Island development; Nexton adding amenity center,"A new gated community with several hundred residences will soon take shape on Johns Island.

Plans for Sea Island Preserve call for 387 homes on more than 700 acres off Main Road across from Mary Ann Point Road.

Charleston County land records show Pulte Homes paid $10.5 million in December for the large parcel formerly owned by McLeod Lumber Co. of West Ashley.

The Pulte Homes development will offer 12 one- and two-story home designs ranging from 1500 square feet to 3000 square feet. Prices will start in the high $200000s.

About 360 acres are to be set aside for conservation with a huge part of them being wetlands.

""With its oversized homesites and natural conservation areas Sea Island Preserve evokes the feeling of a secluded and private neighborhood in blossoming Johns Island"" said Jacob Reynolds Pulte's general sales manager.

Four model homes will be completed by this fall including the single-story Dunwoody Way with gathering areas connected to a cook’s kitchen. Each of the three bedrooms has its own bath while a 2½-car garage can be used as a workshop or extra storage.

Once completed the new community will include a swimming pool play parks and event lawns for recreation.

Adding an amenity

A growing community that will one day be as big as a small city on the edge of Summerville is adding an amenity center to its newest housing development.

Nexton recently broke ground on the Midtown Club an 8000-square-foot facility in the middle of the new Midtown neighborhood off Nexton Parkway. It's set to open in the spring of 2022 and will be open to all Nexton Residential Association members.

The two islands dubbed Cottonwood Island cover a 45-acre area and are currently owned by the Montana Department of Transportation. The transportation department acquired the islands when it bought out a ranch as part of a plan to demolish a bridge across the Yellowstone River.

The islands will provide float-in opportunities for river recreation and camping on the islands. The islands will also fill a need for woody debris and wildlife habitat that was lost during the clean up of the 2011 Exxon Mobil oil spill.

Woody debris along the Yellowstone River is responsible for creating islands that form a healthy meandering river according to the wildlife department release.

About 10 years ago an Exxon Mobil pipeline buried under the Yellowstone River near Laurel broke open and dumped 63000 gallons of crude oil into the Yellowstone River. In all nearly 11000 acres of property and 85 river miles were included in the cleanup.

To purchase the land the wildlife department will use $54050 from the Montana Natural Resource Damage Program. The damage program was created in 1990 to recover damages for natural resourced damaged by the release of hazardous substances into the environment according to the state's web site.

In 2018 the state reached a settlement with Exxon Mobil worth $12 million over the oil spill. $2.3 million was allocated to advance recreational facilities along the Yellowstone River.

It has been over a month since former Executive Director of the Environ-mental Protection Agency (EPA) Dr Vincent Adams made the revelation that the agreement has still not been signed.

In February Adams had told Stabroek News that during his tenure as Executive Director of the EPA they made two changes in the Liza-2 permit. He said that the Environmental Permit for Liza-2 had initially stated that Exxon’s subsidiary EEPGL would self-insure but given that they are a limited liability corporation Adams demanded that they transfer the liability to its parent company.

He stated that they threatened to bring their President into the discussions but that he called their bluff and told them they couldn’t pump a barrel of oil until they transferred the liability to their parent company. He noted that it was written in the permit but the EPA gave EEPGL time so that the three companies: ExxonMobil Hess and CNOOC could figure out how they will cover the liability.

“Even though it was written into the permit that the parent corporation is going to cover the liability they went out for insurance for US$2.5 billion and we said that it’s not going to do and the parent companies have to have coverage for everything over and above so it’s an unlimited liability coverage. Well guess what? It’s been over a year now and they have not signed the document from the parent companies saying that they are going to go ahead. We had several meetings with them with our lawyers present and so questions need to be asked from the government about what is going on with the signing of that guarantee for unlimited coverage that the company (EEPGL) had agreed to in the past” Adams had said before adding that even though it is part of the environmental permit EEPGL has not signed the document that guarantees this.

“They have agreed to it but did not put it on paper” Adams who was fired last year by the government said.

When contacted by the Sunday Stabroek Exxon stated that the Stabroek Block co-venturers have secured comprehensive insurance for their petroleum activities and added that under the existing legal framework and agreements with the government there are extensive assurances of their commitments including environmental protection measures to respond to operational incidents.

“ExxonMobil Guyana is committed to environmental performance excellence. Our goal is to prevent incidents that would have a negative impact to the environment. Prevention of such issues is our number one priority. However we also prepare and practice emergency response in case of unlikely events such as an oil spill. We employ robust preventative and mitigating mechanisms including advanced technology; vigilant maintenance; robust health and safety measures; ongoing risk management and effective emergency preparedness” ExxonMobil said in response to questions posed by the Sunday Stabroek.

There was no response as to why the document that Adams referred to remains unsigned.

Meanwhile Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat when first questioned about the agreement some three weeks ago directed the Sunday Stabroek to the Civil Defence Commission (CDC). When contacted the CDC stated that it does not deal with such agreements and referred the Sunday Stabroek back to the Ministry and to the EPA.

The Sunday Stabroek once again made contact with Bharrat who then stated that he would have to “read up” on the issue because he did not want to give false information and promised to provide the necessary response the following day. Calls to the Minister following that conversation went unanswered.

In addition numerous phone calls to the current head of the EPA Sharifah Razack in the past weeks went unanswered.

Article 12.1 of the Environmental Permit states that the “Permit Holder shall have insurance of liability for pollution damage and in such amount as is customary in the international petroleum industry in accordance with good oil field practices for petroleum Operations in progress Offshore Guyana in respect of:

1) Loss or damage to all assets used in projects

2) Pollution caused in the course of the project for which EEPGL will be jointly and severely held responsible

3) Loss or damage to property or bodily injury suffered by any third party in the course of the Project for which EEPGL is liable to according to terms of the policy.

4) EEPGL’s liability to its employees engaged in the projects.

5) Any other requirement(s) made by the EPA under condition 12.4.”

In addition the permit also states that condition 12.1 shall not be interpreted to mean that the permit holder its parent company servants and/or agents will not be liable to any other existing or forthcoming applicable laws rules and regulations related to insurance for petroleum operations within or out of the jurisdiction of Guyana. Further it was stated that the permit is issued subject to the fulfillment of the obligations outlined in article 12.1 and in correspondence dated March 20 2019 indicating the commitment of EEPGL to obtain such insurance for coverage of environmental liabilities in accordance with the requirements of the EPA and the Bank of Guyana.

“Failure to fulfil such obligations or commitments is in breach of this and will result in its immediate cancellation” the permit states.

Meanwhile Article 12.4 of the permit says that the EPA shall reserve the right to request and review the environmental liability insurance policy and that such review is subject to the provision of documentary evidence that the insurer is authorized to provide the insurance in the jurisdiction and to provide evidence of the insurer’s financial strength and the details of the amount of cover and the cost profile and evidence of

authorization of the institution or insurer to provide insurance.

Article 12.5 of the Environmental Permit states “The Permit Holder must as soon as reasonably practicable provide from the Parent Company or Affiliate Companies of Permit Holder and its Co-Venturers (“Affiliates”) one or more legally binding agreements to the EPA undertaking to provide adequate financial resources for Permit Holder and its Co-Venturers to pay or satisfy their respective environmental obligations regarding the Stabroek Block if EEPGL or its Co-Venturers fail to do so. As a consequence EEPGL will be required to:

1) provide evidence of the following:

That the Affiliate(s) are authorised to provide that guarantee or agreement in this jurisdiction.

That the Affiliate(s) have sufficient financial strength for the amount of the potential liability.

That the Affiliate(s) have the corporate legal capacity to enter into the agreement.”

Additionally article 12.6 stated that the permit holder its servant and agents shall be strictly liable for the adverse effects of any discharge or release or cause or permit the entry of the pollution contaminant in any amount concentration or level in excess of that prescribed by the regulations or stipulated by any environmental authorization which are attributed to any project in accordance with section 19 (1) and (2) of the Environmental Protection Act.

The contract signed with EEPGL in 2016 states that to the extent permitted by applicable laws rules and regulations such insurance may be provide through the contractors’ affiliate insurance company. “Subject to the Minister’s approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld the contractor notwithstanding the provisions of article 20.2(a) shall have the right to self-insure all or part of the aforementioned insurances in article 20.2 (a)” it further states.

The group in a statement by its leaders General Dede Udofia and Major Ibanga Ekang expressed shock and displeasure over the passive response of the state government to the constant cries and yearnings of the masses in the oil communities.

The group however exempted ExxonMobil and Savannah Petroleum from the quit notice.

The group advised the affected oil companies to immediately evacuate all their workers from their operational bases and rigs both onshore and offshore within the territorial waters of the state to avoid casualties and damages.

""As a result of the refusal of the oil firms operating in the territorial waters of Akwa Ibom State apart from ExxonMobil & Savannah Petroleum to locate their operational bases in the state.

""Their refusal to implement their Corporate Social Responsibility as well as the provisions of the Nigerian Local Content Law in their employment and contract policies we hereby advise them and their subsidiaries/partners to vacate Akwa Ibom State with immediate effect.

""It is very sad to observe that since the commencement of operations by Addax Moni Pulo Chevron Century Oriental Energy Savannah Petroleum Total E & P SEEPCO AFREN AMNI etc. and their subsidiaries/partners in the various oil fields in Akwa Ibom territorial waters they have enjoyed relative peace without any hostilities to their projects compared to other oil communities in the Niger Delta region.

""But our people have not derived any substantial benefits from these oil companies rather we have been subjected to unwholesome deprivations and marginalisation.

""It is also indeed very painful and regrettable to witness the high level of suffering hopelessness degradation and poverty that the people of the oil producing communities in Akwa Ibom State have been subjected to as a result of the industrial activities of the various oil firms since their commencement of operations.

""We also express our utmost displeasure at the companies’ insensitivity to underdevelopment and degrading living standards of the people in the oil producing communities due to their many years of oil exploration and exploitation in the area with the attendant environmental hazards.

""It is no more news that the companies have been drilling several barrels of oil per day from the rigs located in our territorial waters but do not see the need to provide basic amenities for their immediate host communities and catchment areas who suffer the adverse effects of their drilling operations.

The Government of Albania has a “master plan” for the gasification of the country that would bring economic development.

The Government of Albania has a “master plan” for the gasification of the country that would bring economic development the Albanian Energy Minister Belinda Balluku said Report informs referring to Exit News .

Balluku noted that “gasification would be made possible by the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and the investment of American companies in Vlora thermal power plant (TPP)”.

“All the investment will be made by the US and there will be no investment from the Albanian state only by the US” said Balluku.

Albania has signed an agreement with ExxonMobil and Excelerate Energy last week to turn a site in Vlora into a terminal for liquified natural gas (LNG).

The memorandum of understanding foresees a feasibility study expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2021.

The next steps include the repurposing of the thermal power plant in Vlora southern Albania and the construction of a new LNG terminal thus transforming the coastal city into a regional hub for liquefied gas.

Minister Balluku stressed “the need for Albania and the Balkan region to diversify and enhance energy supplies.”

Balluku also said that “part of the agreement is that the Vlora TPP will produce according to the needs of Albania”.

In the future gas may also be transported to the Balkan region via the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The Western Balkans include countries Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Montenegro North Macedonia and Kosovo.

TAP transports natural gas to Europe from the giant Shah Deniz field in the Caspian Sea's Azerbaijani sector. The 878 km pipeline connects to the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline on the Turkish-Greek border in Kipoi crosses Greece Albania and the Adriatic Sea and reaches Italy's southern coast.

On the first day of the project which started the flow of natural gas to Europe on December 31 2020 TAP pumped 10.9 million cubic meters of natural gas to Europe.

TAP can stimulate gas supplies to Southeast European countries through interconnectors to be built in the future. For example Bulgaria will strengthen supply security by meeting 33% of its natural gas needs via TAP. In turn it will increase the penetration of natural gas in the country. TAP's outlets in Greece and Albania and Italy also open up opportunities for transporting Azerbaijani gas to other European countries.

TAP's shareholders are SOCAR (20%) bp (20%) Snam (20%) Fluxys (19%) Enagás (16%) and Axpo (5%)."

News of in the wild exploitation comes on the heels of a proof-of-concept exploit code that surfaced online earlier this week by reverse-engineering the Java software patch in BIG-IP. The mass scans are said to have spiked since March 18.

The flaws affect BIG-IP versions 11.6 or 12.x and newer with a critical remote code execution (CVE-2021-22986) also impacting BIG-IQ versions 6.x and 7.x. CVE-2021-22986 (CVSS score: 9.8) is notable for the fact that it's an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability affecting the iControl REST interface allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands create or delete files and disable services without the need for any authentication.

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a full compromise of susceptible systems including the possibility of remote code execution as well as trigger a buffer overflow leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

While F5 said it wasn't aware of any public exploitation of these issues on March 10 researchers from NCC Group said they have now found evidence of ""full chain exploitation of F5 BIG-IP/BIG-IQ iControl REST API vulnerabilities CVE-2021-22986"" in the wake of multiple exploitation attempts against its honeypot infrastructure.

Additionally Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team said it found attempts to exploit CVE-2021-22986 to install a variant of the Mirai botnet. But it's not immediately clear if those attacks were successful.

Given the popularity of BIG-IP/BIG-IQ in corporate and government networks it should come as no surprise that this is the second time in a year F5 appliances have become a lucrative target for exploitation.

Last July the company addressed a similar critical flaw (CVE-2020-5902) following which it was abused by Iranian and Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue an alert cautioning of a ""broad scanning activity for the presence of this vulnerability across federal departments and agencies.""

""The bottom line is that [the flaws] affect all BIG-IP and BIG-IQ customers and instances — we urge all customers to update their BIG-IP and BIG-IQ deployments to the fixed versions as soon as possible"" F5 Senior Vice President Kara Sprague noted last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtpbmZvc2VjdXJpdHkuY29tL2hhY2tlcnMtYXJlLWV4cGxvaXRpbmctY3JpdGljYWwtZjUtbmV0d29ya3MtdnVsbmVyYWJpbGl0eS1hLTE2MjM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Attackers Exploiting F5 Networks' BIG-IP Vulnerability,"3rd Party Risk Management  Breach Notification  Cybercrime

Attackers Exploiting F5 Networks' BIG-IP Vulnerability

Flaw in Network Traffic Security Management Platform Ranked as Highly Critical

Attackers are exploiting a critical remote code vulnerability in F5 Networks' BIG-IP platform tracked as CVE-2021-22986 for which the company released patches on March 10.

See Also: Digital Transformation: Better Ops Agile Apps Faster Business

The vulnerability which has a CVSS ranking of 9.8 out of 10 - highly critical - is a remote command execution flaw in BIG-IP a network traffic security management appliance.

By exploiting the flaw unauthenticated attackers can gain access to BIG-IP’s management interface and self IP addresses and execute arbitrary system commands create or delete files and disable services F5 Networks says.

On Thursday security firm NCC Group said attackers were chaining multiple BIG-IP vulnerabilities with CVE-2021-22986. NCC added that an exploit for the vulnerability is likely to be available in the public domain soon.

In another alert on Friday security firm Palo Alto Networks said a Mirai botnet variant is chaining the BIG-IP with another flaw as part of an attack although the company did not clarify if the Mirai attacks were successful.

We are now observing the Mirai variant from https://t.co/ZDTVwtdYlq attempting to exploit CVE-2021-22986 an unauthenticated RCE in F5 BIG-IP & BIG-IQ products and CVE-2020-28188.



IOCs for the new activity available at:https://t.co/bc0IySEAEk pic.twitter.com/ZsUqxq60XO — Unit 42 (@Unit42_Intel) March 19 2021

NCC Alert

The NCC Group report notes the attacks exploiting the flaw unfold in two stages. In the first stage the attackers leveraged the BIG-IP flaw to gain an authenticated session token; this was then used to interact with the application API endpoint.

Using the token the attackers extract browser cookies that allow the threat actors to access a web-based interface which then enables them to remotely control the application.

The second step of the attack occurs when the victim’s device calls the attacker-controlled API. The report further notes the attackers have been using this method to access honeypots set-up by the researchers.

""Starting this week and especially in the last 24 hours [March 18] we have observed multiple exploitation attempts against our honeypot infrastructure"" the NCC report notes. ""Fortunately the attackers got the details of the exploit wrong and attempted a chain of events that could not possibly work.""

Other Vulnerabilities

Researchers and government agencies have warned of several other significant vulnerabilities found in various popular products this month.

For example Microsoft issued emergency software patches for four zero-day vulnerabilities in its Exchange email server (see: Microsoft Patches Four Zero-Day Flaws in Exchange).

Following the Microsoft alert the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency warned that scanning activity for the vulnerabilities had picked up in recent days. It stressed that federal agencies and private firms should apply patches or disconnect internet-facing systems until the bugs are fixed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NzaG9vdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL3NvbnktZjUtZjU1LWRpc2NvbnRpbnVlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sony F5 & F55 Discontinued?,"Has Sony officially discontinued the F5 and F55? Both cameras were announced in October 2012. Sony Japan and Sony GB have listed both the F5 and F55 as being discontinued however Sony USA still has both cameras listed as available.

Sony Japan

Sony GP

Sony USA

Anyone who bought an F5 or F55 certainly got their money’s worth. There are few cameras in the modern age that have had the longevity that the F5 and F55 have enjoyed. In fact there are still many F5 and F55 owners out there who are still using their cameras today and there is no reason why they shouldn’t continue to use those cameras going forward.

Even though Sony looks like they have discontinued both cameras you can still purchase the F5 new from retailers such as B&H.

Both the F5 and F55 can be found for pretty reasonable prices second-hand.

The F5 and F55 were the first truly modular Sony digital cinema cameras. Both cameras were a departure away from Sony’s previous high-end digital cinema cameras that were large and heavy.

The F5 and F55 were a hit with shooters who were moving from 2/3″ ENG cameras because they could be configured to work in a way that was familiar. You could shoulder mount both cameras and comfortably shoot with an EVF.

Sony continued to update both the F5 and F55 over the years as well as introduce new features and functionality such as the 4K recording option for the F5 in 2014.

I bought an F55 in early 2013 and I used it for a few years before eventually selling it and moving on to an ARRI Amira.

The Sony FS5 2 also looks like it has been discontinued. According to Sony Japan production has been completed which means they are no longer making the camera.

So what does this mean?

I doubt there will be F5 and F55 replacements. Sony has changed around their digital cinema camera line-up and the VENICE effectively became the F65/F55 replacement. The FX9 is arguably the F5 replacement.

You have to hand it to Sony both the F5 and F55 were ahead of their time and their longevity is proof of that. Both cameras are Netflix approved and there is absolutely no reason why you couldn’t use either model for the foreseeable future.

The text states:

“Dear Fifth Third Banking customer as a part of our commitment to keep your account secure we have detected an activity on your Fifth Third Banking Account and we are placing a hold on your Fifth Third Banking account for your protection. Please click the link below and follow the instructions to unlock your account.”

FOX19′s tech expert Dave Hattar advises to step back and read through the text again to determine the red flags.

Hattar says that the link at the bottom of the text does not go to Fifth Third Bank’s website but leads to another site.

Some other red flags include:

The message was sent to about a dozen people at the same time

It has many grammatical errors

The recipient might not have a Fifth Third Bank account

“A regional bank like Fifth Third or big banks like Wells Fargo or some sort of national bank they know that they’re going to be able to ensnare a lot of customers just throwing out a name like that” Hattar said.

Scammers with this particular type of scam could be after personal information bank account login or money.

Internet scams are a business the FBI says cashed in for more than $4.2 billion in 2020.

The best way to avoid getting scammed is not to click the link and just delete the message.

“I think really the best defense against all of this sort stuff is to stop think protect. When you get something like this stop and read it carefully” Hattar said.

Furniture World recently spoke with Barb Scherer Vice President of Marketing at W.S. Badcock Corp and its retail store brand Badcock Home Furniture &more. Before joining Badcock almost three years ago she was on the ad agency side for over 25 years and served as Sr. Vice President of Regional Marketing at Fifth Third Bank a Fortune 500 company.

380 Stores & Growing

“W.S. Badcock Corp is in its 117th year” she said. The company was founded in Mulberry Florida by Henry Stanhope Badcock. We have 380 stores in eight southeastern states and are continuing to grow. Badcock is a dealer network company so we have both corporate-owned stores as well as dealer-owned stores. Beyond furniture and mattresses Badcock sells appliances electronics computers lawn and garden and several other categories of merchandise including generators.”

Carrying “essential” products in the early days of the pandemic allowed many Badcock Home Furniture &more stores to stay open when other furniture stores were shuttered. “At the height of shut down orders” Scherer explained “at most only 20 to 30 percent of our stores were closed at a given time and they weren’t closed for long.”

Like many furniture retailers Badcock experienced robust sales in categories associated with customers working and studying from home. “We definitely saw an increase in website traffic during that time as well as online ordering.”

Consumer Insight Research

Over these months of uncertainty Badcock was also undergoing an ambitious rebranding initiative. By the time Scherer joined the company it had been a number of years since they had done substantial consumer insight research.

“The management team including senior executives and Badcock’s owners” she said “decided it was a good time to speak to customers and non-customers to better understand their perceptions about our stores and get a deeper understanding of the level of brand awareness versus our competitors throughout our footprint.

“In December 2019 we hired &Barr a full-service advertising agency based in Orlando as Badcock’s agency of record.”

&Barr provides ongoing support for the brand's marketing initiatives. Badcock partnered with them to do research creative testing production media planning and buying promotional ads and digital banners.

“To prepare” noted Barb Scherer “the agency spoke with a number of our store managers associates and dealer-owned stores. These initial conversations helped them discover what Badcock’s people were interested in and eager to see in terms of a new advertising direction.”

We started with qualitative consumer insight research doing multiple in-person focus groups.



Focus Groups

“We started with qualitative consumer insight research doing multiple in-person focus groups in three areas representative of the markets in which Badcock operates. Customers non-customers and lapsed customers were included. Our goal was to understand their feelings and perceptions about Badcock. For those who still shopped with us we wanted to know why they were loyal. For those who had never shopped with us or hadn't shopped us for four to five years we wanted to understand how to better engage or reengage with them.

“We wrapped up our in-person focus groups a week or two before stay-at-home mandates went into effect. We are thankful that we were able to meet with people and speak with them one-on-one before all of that happened.”

Brand Tracking Study

“In late March and early April when a lot of people were at home we started doing quantitative research. A brand-tracking study was emailed out to measure brand awareness perceptions preferences and establish benchmarks to set the stage to track improvements over time. The response to this survey was great. What normally would have taken us a few weeks to complete was wrapped up in about 10 days. Participation rates were high.”



Pictured above are a screen shot and still photos from the 30 second “Just Right” production shoot. The voice over audio for the “Peace” TV spot found at https://bit.ly/3dR4W7W says: “We all know when something feels just right. Like when you found the one. Or maybe ‘the one.’ It's the smallest victory or simply a moment of peace. It's what feels good and what feels like home. It's different for everyone. But when you find it you'll know. Because when something's just right it's more than just a good fit. It's what fits our lives. Badcock Home Furniture &more. Just Right.”

Information Treasure Trove

“Once the research stage was completed we worked with &Barr to collect insights and formulate a new brand strategy. The research yielded a treasure trove of information.”

Scherer explained that customers told stories about how Badcock fit into their lives. They shared anecdotes about shopping with their parents when they needed furniture for first apartments for newborns school-age children teens and grown children. These were multi-generational stories.

“We heard stories about how Badcock’s financing options helped them to be able to make a furniture purchase. And why when they would sometimes go to smaller local furniture stores or larger big-box ones first they would end up at Badcock.



Magazine ad reads: “Good moments always feel just right. If any place deserves to feel that way - it's home. We're honored to be your go-to place for making your house feel like home.”

“Our customers literally wrote the brand positioning and ad campaign for us. They told us how we fit into their lives and why we are just right for them.

“They said that when they walked into a Badcock Home Furniture &more store the feeling was friendly. Also that they felt at home were served by neighborhood people who knew them by name and that the prices styles and financing options fit them just right.”

“Badcock finances in-house with our revolving credit equal payment/no interest and no credit refused programs. We offer Snap as an additional option for our credit-challenged customers. This allows us to provide a financing solution that fits ‘just right’ for any individual’s or family’s needs.”

‘Just Right’ Tagline

‘Just Right’ became the tagline for the campaign. “We called it the Goldilocks effect” Scherer recalled. “People shop here they shop there but they end up buying at Badcock because it is just right for them.”

Before switching over to the new branding Badcock had a more price-item-financing approach to advertising.

“We’ve done a great job over the past several years using strong monthly promotional campaigns rotating several discount offers and specific-themed sales” Scherer explained. “We don’t plan to abandon that. The purpose of the 'Just Right' campaign is to update our communications to do a better job of connecting emotionally with current customers lapsed customers and those who shop elsewhere.

“During COVID many people realized just the importance of their homes and family. Badcock’s new advertising plays into this and reflects what the research told us. We will tell this story on video and TV spots going forward.”



Pictured are partial screenshots of the roughly 3.5 minute animated brand essence video which can be found on YouTube at https://bit.ly/2NOt4NP. The narrator begins by saying “This is a story about a family. And the feeling of ‘just right.’ And how Badcock Home Furniture &more fit perfectly into my life.”

Creative Development

“Throughout the process the Badcock team worked closely with the agency. It was a partnership that resulted in the agency developing several creative concepts based on the consumer research analysis we did together. Late in the summer of 2020 these concepts were tested with consumers. 'Just Right' was the concept direction they most responded to.”

Brand Essence Video

“Before creating specific ad materials we decided to produce an illustrated brand essence video. It was shared throughout the organization with employees owner-dealers and store associates so that they would understand the brand positioning that we were aiming to accomplish. We didn’t plan to go public with the video but it turned out to be such a good story that we posted it online and to our social media channels so it is out there for consumers to see and understand our brand as well.”

30-Second Spots

The messaging from the brand essence video was then encapsulated in a shorter-form video basically 30-second TV spots. But instead of using the animation format actors were used to relate the message.

“We did a four-day production shoot in Tampa to create the first two TV spots for our winter 2021 campaign. There were mask and social distancing requirements. Our production company had a chief COVID officer to oversee the process. We didn't hire normal craft services for the crew or talent. Instead we catered individual boxed meals that were served outdoors.

“We cast real families couples and families with children keeping safety in mind. Then Hurricane Eta came through and we had to close down production early the first day so that we could make sure all the crew and talent were safe. We made up for lost time over the next three days.”

Media Selection

“Now that creative materials have been developed Scherer said that Badcock Home Furniture &more’s media placements are evolving.

“Before COVID hit we already started moving further into the digital advertising realm. During COVID we’ve continued to ramp up the use of digital channels in our media planning and buying.

“A few years ago our primary media buys were broadcast and cable TV plus print media. We've added streaming OTT and CTV to our traditional broadcast and cable. We're also out there using digital programmatic advertising across all devices advertising on social media channels and search engine marketing. Now we are exposed across the whole spectrum of available digital.”

We decided to produce an animated brand essence video. It was shared throughout the organization with employees owner-dealers and store associates so that they would understand the brand positioning that we were aiming to accomplish.



Badcock Home Furniture &more is also doing some digital radio employing the same kind of targeting as used with streaming television services like Hulu. “We are in 38 DMAs” Scherer noted. “So we're doing some streaming radio in all of these DMAs geotargeted around our store's trade areas.”

Conclusion

Barb Scherer concluded by telling Furniture World that “Here at Badcock Home Furniture &more we try to live our purpose which is that everything we do is about helping our customers live better lives.

“This whole campaign—how it looks and feels was developed to connect with them using their input and insights. We believe that the messaging will connect positively with current customers lapsed customers and consumers who haven’t found us yet to help the Badcock Home Furniture &more brand now 117-years old to continue to flourish.”",,,

Mongolia's energy ministry awarded the order for a 5 megawatt solar farm with 3.6 megawatt-hours of storage capacity to JGC Japan's NGK Insulators and local general contractor MCS International. The value of the contract which also includes an energy management system has not been disclosed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLWluZGlhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL3RoZS1sb25nLXJlYWQtY2VudHJhbC1hc2lhcy1zb2xhci1hd2FrZW5pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The long read: Central Asia's solar awakening – pv magazine India,"From pv magazine 03/2020

In a matter of only a few months the Republic of Uzbekistan managed to strike its first large-scale PV project. This is only the start as the the Central Asian country has another 1.1 GW of projects under tender with the ambition to install a total PV capacity of 5 GW by 2030.

Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Energy has launched three PV tender rounds. The latest third round is the largest comprising two 200 MW projects and one with a capacity of 100 MW. Similar to the previous two rounds each project will be developed on a design build finance and operate basis under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA). The co-signer alongside the solar developer is state-owned JSC National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan.

As per International Finance Corp. (IFC) which was appointed by the Uzbek government to structure the tender mechanism a two-stage process is envisaged where developers must first meet prequalification criteria and then submit bids by July 2021. The projects are expected to achieve financial close before the end of the year.

In 2019 Abu Dhabi-based renewables giant Masdar submitted a bid price of $0.027/kWh – an impressive figure given it is the first solar project of its kind in the country. Similarly French joint venture Total Eren is putting its final touches on a secured 100 MW project expected to reach financial close in the near future.

A second tender round is progressing in parallel as 15 developers were prequalified and eligible to submit an offer for the construction of two PV plants with a capacity of 200 MW each in the Samarkand and Jizzakh regions. This round seems to have faced delays amid the Covid-19 pandemic as the original submission date was slated for August 2020 and appears not to have been met. In parallel to the three rounds the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the Uzbek government in tendering an additional 200 MW project in the Sherabad region.

Key companies

The considerable pipeline of projects and the low-risk public-private partnership scheme have succeeded in attracting developers from around the globe. The Uzbek solar tenders attracted as many as 84 developers that prequalified for the second ongoing tender round.

Among the bidders to the second round are China’s JinkoPower Japan’s Marubeni and the Scandinavian developer Scatec besides the winners Masdar and Total Eren. Another heavy hitter engaging in the market is Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power which hopes to leverage its recent success in securing 2.5 GW of gas and wind power projects in the country.

As Uzbekistan is only now kickstarting its large-scale PV segment the EPC players looking to execute the projects have not yet stepped forward publicly. Indian contractor Sterling and Wilson which has been active in the region has expressed interest in the Uzbek market hoping to secure a large pipeline. METKA EGN which has just completed the 100 MW in Uzbekistan with Total Eren is another candidate that is well positioned to take EPC market share.

On the money side almost all multilateral financial institutions are present. These institutions have provided financing and loan commitments to the ongoing projects in addition to offering advisory services and policy support. For instance the IFC and the ADB have played leading roles in structuring the public-private partnership scheme of solar projects. Similarly the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is heavily engaged leveraging its long involvement in Central Asia.

“Besides the robust and clear regulatory framework Uzbekistan has the political will to harness the huge potential of renewable energy in the country” says Aida Stidikova the director of energy for EBRD in Eurasia. The EBRD has played a role in both of the country’s lighthouse solar projects by providing a $60 million equity bridge loan to Masdar. And it is expected to soon close a financing agreement for the second project with Total Eren.

Stidikova confirms that the bank is in discussion with other developers in the country as possible sponsors. “A day-to-day product that we offer would be a senior loan as a co-financier” Stidikova explains. However she confirms the bank’s flexibility and that the factors going into structuring a facility are unique to each project. When it comes to financing cost evolution Stidikova remains positive: “Cost of financing is a function of risk actual or perceived. If the renewables sector gets momentum and attracts commercial lenders in addition to DFIs [development finance institutions] the cost of financing becomes more market driven and [will] potentially go down.”

Stidikova notes that a battery storage facility may well be coupled to one of the third-round Uzbek projects. “It is good to see Uzbekistan thinking two steps ahead. With the large scale-up of intermittent renewables we will see the need for system reinforcement and investment in the transmission grid and storage. We at EBRD would certainly be very interested in supporting projects like this.”

Suitable for solar

Until 2019 Uzbekistan had almost no solar or wind capacity as per the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). It is quite remarkable that now the country aims to install 3 GW of wind alongside 5 GW of PV by 2030. The conditions are sunny especially in the central and southern regions where irradiation can reach 1800 kWh/m². In addition almost 80% of the country’s territory is flat desert which is highly suitable for solar.

However Ebby Adhami the director of Corporate Solutions a management consultancy active in Central Asian power markets believes that political will and reforms were the decisive enablers of the current green boom. “The country has a new administration since 2016 which has extremely ambitious plans of claiming Uzbekistan’s rightful place in the region. During the Soviet times Uzbekistan was the regional center … inheriting widespread infrastructure” says Adhami. “That infrastructure still exists although it needs upgrading.”

Adhami says that the government has recognized that it needs to revamp its infrastructure if economic development goals are to be achieved – with energy a top priority. Indeed the Uzbek economy has experienced steady growth over the past decade leading to a significant increase in energy consumption. The government forecasts demand for electricity increasing 6% annually – representing an almost doubling by 2030 on 2019 demand. The government estimates that as much as $14.4 billion will need to be invested to install the required generation capacity.

Azerbaijan Kazakhstan

In the past Kazakhstan was the solar star of the region. As early as 2014 the country started its renewables journey and had around 800 MW of installed capacity mostly solar by 2019. More recently Kazakhstan has switched to an auctions system instead of the previous feed-in tariff scheme achieving a lowest price of $0.035/KWh in the latest round which was held in late 2020.

Toward the west bank of the Caspian Sea positive signs are also emerging from Azerbaijan. The local energy ministry has disclosed that negotiations are underway with Masdar for a first-of-its-kind 230 MW solar project in the country. It is understood that the country will define the terms of renewable auctions after wrapping up its first project.

Other countries in the region are still lagging in the race for renewables. Indeed Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan already have a considerable capacity of hydropower but still neither wind nor solar technology has been implemented in either country.

Potential threats

Despite its strong start the Uzbek solar market has some aspects that must be handled with caution. Grid integration of variable renewables is still in question. In January a major incident hit the transmission network leading to power supply failures in some parts of the country.

JSC the national electric network of Uzbekistan stated that the malfunction was caused by a false trigger in the protection equipment that led to an unscheduled shutdown of a combined-cycle gas generator. Local authorities acknowledge the need to upgrade the existing transmission infrastructure and are already constructing new high-voltage lines. Similarly the operator is gradually revising existing standards and norms to align with international ones. Moreover permitting processes and the availability of local expertise remain possible challenges as in any new market for renewables.

Geopolitical implications

It is somewhat counterintuitive to see companies from fossil-fuel strongholds like Saudi Arabia’s ACWA and Masdar in the United Arab Emirates invest and engage in renewable energy projects in other oil and gas-rich countries like Uzbekistan. Whether it is the financial reasoning to engage in such opportunities or a new form of renewable energy diplomacy it proves that such countries are accepting the inevitable and joining the renewables wave instead of watching it from the sidelines.

It is often stated that renewable energy projects in fossil-fuel-rich countries aim to save valuable gas and oil for export instead of for their own consumption. However the extent of renewable energy implementation suggests that sooner or later the demand for these exported resources will decrease and revenue streams will shrink.

Patrick Willems an independent consultant and expert in the green energy sector in Russia and Central Asia sees renewable developments in the region as an enabler for cooperation and resilience. “Central Asian countries face many challenges in the energy and water sectors. They need to develop inter-regional trading and embrace that the weakness of one country can be the strength of the other and vice versa” he concludes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9zb2xhci1vcHBvc2l0ZXMtc2Vhc29uLTItanVzdGluLXJvaWxhbmQtbWlrZS1tY21haGFuLWludGVydmlld9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9zb2xhci1vcHBvc2l0ZXMtc2Vhc29uLTItanVzdGluLXJvaWxhbmQtbWlrZS1tY21haGFuLWludGVydmlldz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar Opposites Season 2 is nuts but its creators promise it will get even weirder,"The Solar Opposites are coming back to Hulu! Less than a year after they first made contact with the Disney-owned streaming service Earth's favorite Shlorpians (Korvo Terry Jesse Yumyulack and the Pupa) will enjoy a second season of sci-fi adventures later this week. While we won't venture into specifics ahead of Friday's premiere we will tell you that the next eight episodes are balls-to-the-wall crazy. And that's not hyperbole folks. This is some of the most creative hilarious and messed-up television you'll ever behold.

After firmly establishing an over-the-top world filled with quirky characters co-creators Mike McMahan and Justin Roiland (also the voice of mission leader Korvo) allowed themselves more freedom in the series' second outing. For example Season 2 features genetically-engineered monsters that eat people and then poop them out as bottles of artisanal wine. That bit was already teased in the trailer from late February so just imagine what they haven't revealed yet.

""[With the] first season we had been learning about the show while making it"" McMahan tells SYFY WIRE. ""We knew we were doing the Wall stuff we were learning about the characters we were learning about how the voice actors are playing the characters. [When it came to] Season 2 we went into it and we're like 'OK we've done eight episodes. Now let's figure out what we can do narratively with this show. Let's amp everything up. Let's just go crazy. Let's keep the Wall going but do a whole new style of story.'""

Ah yes the Wall. How could we forget the tiny civilization of shrunken-down humans that exists within the confines of Jesse (Mary Mack) and Yumyulack's (Sean Giambrone) bedroom? When we spoke with McMahan last year he likened the parallel narrative to War of the Roses as Tim (Andy Daly) and Cherie (Christina Hendricks) led an epic revolution against the demagogic Duke (Alfred Molina). The uprising was successful but came at the cost of Tim's morality; he ended up stabbing Cherie his own lover in an effort to maintain the ignorant bliss of the Wall's citizens. In Season 2 we'll learn what that minuscule society looks like in the aftermath of the conflict through a fresh genre lens.

""The Wall is kind of like The Wire where there was always a different flavor every season"" McMahan adds. ""[We wanted to continue] building out the story of the Wall and we continue to do that in Season 3 into a whole new direction and a really cool way. And for the Solar Opposite side of the story for the Solars [we never wanted to] constrained to what we thought the show was supposed to be. The Solars are so funny and big — what are stories that can get big and crazy that can only be in this show?""

""I think it just happened naturally"" Roiland says when we ask if it was always the plan to dial up the insanity the second time around. ""Just the escalation of who these characters are and the comfort we have with them and the crazy s*** we wanna do. And how that's all sort of ok in this show. As a viewer you can buy into it all.""

Credit: Hulu

And if you think Season 2 is bananas then just brace yourself for Season 3 which McMahan alluded to above (the series was renewed for a third outing last June and the production crew is ready to tackle a fourth should that become a reality). In addition SYFY WIRE can exclusively confirm that the third season will have a longer episode count than its two predecessors.

""I think we're still pushing the boundaries too going into Season 3. Like holy s***"" Roiland says. ""There's some stuff in Season 3 that's really f***ing insane.""

The idea was to send a clear message to alien civilizations living elsewhere in the solar system: We are here.

Von Littrow never saw his idea come to fruition. Still long after he proposed his ambitious plan we haven't stopped our attempts to contact extraterrestrial life.

So what messages have we sent to aliens?

Radio actualized the quest to declare Earth's existence. In 1962 Soviet scientists aimed a radio transmitter at Venus and saluted the planet in Morse code. This introduction the first of its kind included three words: Mir (Russian for ""peace"" or ""world"") Lenin and SSSR (the Latin alphabet acronym for the Cyrillic name of the Soviet Union). The message was considered largely symbolic according to a 2018 article published in the International Journal of Astrobiology . More than anything it was a test run for a brand-new planetary radar a technology which sends radio waves into space with the primary goal of observing and mapping objects in the solar system.

In terms of distance the next attempt to reach ET was far more ambitious. In 1974 a team of scientists including astronomers Frank Drake and Carl Sagan transmitted a radio message from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico toward Messier 13 a cluster of stars about 25000 light-years away. The image sent in binary code depicted a human stick figure a double-helix DNA structure a model of a carbon atom and a diagram of a telescope.

""The Arecibo message tried to give a snapshot of who we are as human beings in the language of math and science"" Douglas Vakoch a psychologist and the president of Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) International told Live Science.

The Arecibo message was quite literally a shot in the dark. It will take around 25000 light-years to reach Messier 13 — at which point the star cluster will have moved according to the Cornell University Department of Astronomy . Hypothetical aliens might still be able to detect the signal as it whizzes past — it has 10 million times the intensity of radio signals from our sun. (The sun emits a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation — from ultraviolet to radio.) But that's unlikely said Seth Shostak an astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.

""It was in some sense the most powerful message"" Shostak told Live Science. ""It's like a giant billboard on [U.S. interstate] I-5 but it's off in a field somewhere.""

More recently radio has been used to transmit everything from art to advertisements. In 2008 Doritos beamed its own ad to a solar system in the Ursa Majoris constellation around 42 light-years away according to the article in the International Journal of Astrobiology. In 2010 a message written in Klingon a language used by fictional aliens in the ""Star Trek"" universe invited real aliens to attend a Klingon opera in Holland.

We haven't relied only on radio to communicate; we've also launched spacecraft containing artifacts from Earth  in the hope that they'll eventually be scooped out of interstellar space by intelligent life-forms. Voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in 1977 to explore the outer reaches of our solar system and interstellar space. Each carries a Golden Record containing music ambient sounds from Earth and 116 images of our planet and solar system.

The Voyager spacecraft are still chugging through interstellar space waiting to be discovered. But the chances of that happening? ""Zero"" said Sheri Wells-Jensen a linguist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who specializes in extraterrestrial intelligence.

""It was just a beautiful and poetic lovely brave attempt that really did sum up kind of the best of us even if it's pointless in terms of actually communicating"" Wells-Jensen told Live Science.

Experts agree that the likelihood that any of these attempts will reach alien civilizations is low. That outcome depends of course on whether there is alien life in our star system. But that life in question would also have to be listening closely for radio signals and understand enough about math and science to interpret our messages. Finally the messages we've sent tend to assume that these aliens sense the universe in the same way we do: with hearing and vision.

But that doesn't mean all of these messages are pointless. ""We're looking. Why wouldn't they be looking?"" Wells-Jensen told Live Science. And if our messages are unintelligible to these hypothetical beings? That's OK. ""I think the most important thing that we've ever said is just that we exist"" Wells-Jensen said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ5NTY0My92aWRlby10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLWhvbWVtYWRlLXNvbGFyLXJvb2Ytd29ya3Mv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9pbnNpZGVldnMuY29tL25ld3MvNDk1NjQzL3ZpZGVvLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLTMtaG9tZW1hZGUtc29sYXItcm9vZi13b3Jrcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Guy Adds A Solar Roof To His Tesla Model 3 And It Works,"When the video above first came onto our radar our first question was ""How well does it work?"" We know that it's possible to add some range to an EV via a solar roof but not really enough to be worth the cost. Hopefully as technology improves and costs come down this will become more commonplace going forward but it's going to be a while.

This Tesla Model 3 owner didn't permanently attach solar panels to the roof of his car. Instead to see how it worked he just laid them over the car. Obviously this wouldn't work for use while driving. However if you're going camping and your car will sit for a long period of time with no access to a charger this might do the trick. It certainly can't hurt.

A few cars are available with solar roofs but they're mostly a novelty rather than something useful. For example when Hyundai completely redesigned the Sonata Hybrid for the 2020 model year it added a solar roof as an option. It's only on the top Limited trim which costs about $8000 more than the base model and it can add about 2 miles of range per day.

Since the Sonata Hybrid isn't a plug-in hybrid – Hyundai eliminated the Sonata PHEV as part of the 2020 redesign – the added range really just means saving some pocket change on fuel costs. With over 600 miles of range the Sonata Hybrid doesn't need the 2-mile bump.

You can't yet buy a Tesla car with a solar roof but there are companies experimenting with the concept. In the meantime this guy took the project into his own hands. It actually works but the question is how well does it work?

Check out the video for the answer as well as all of the interesting details. What do you think of this homemade Tesla Model 3 solar roof? Is it something you'd consider for camping? Should we expect this to be common in the future? Leave us your takeaways in the comment section below."

Clark didn’t recognize the Cleveland number but he picked up the call anyway. He said he was glad to talk and he kept talking.

In a span of nearly three months Clark became a prized source. He provided background and context about dark money FirstEnergy and the players in the biggest scandal to sully Ohio politics: House Bill 6 and the $60 million in bribes that authorities say were used to pass it.

“Make the best of your opportunity” Clark texted me Feb. 12.

On Monday I tried Clark’s cell phone again hoping to discuss a person from Cleveland linked to the scandal. The call went into voicemail. Hours later authorities reported finding his body in Florida where he had a home. Officers are investigating his death as an apparent suicide. He was 67.

Clark former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder political strategist Jeffrey Longstreth and lobbyists Matthew Borges and Juan Cespedes were charged in July with federal racketeering involving the tainted legislation that offered a $1 billion bailout for two nuclear plants that were once owned by a FirstEnergy subsidiary.

Longstreth and Cespedes have pleaded guilty. Borges and Householder have denied the allegations. Clark also appeared determined to fight the charges.

But House Bill 6 had turned Clark one of the most successful lobbyists in Columbus into a political outcast. Whether out of loneliness despair or empathy Clark agreed to share how the scandal unfolded and how it touched Cleveland. Many of his statements were self-serving such as his perceived limited involvement in the case.

In death Clark created an ethical dilemma editors and scholars can debate for decades: Should the closely shrouded words of a reporter’s source in life become public once the person dies?

In this case the words will remain with Clark. This is a story about the unusual situation of a powerful insider-turned-indicted co-conspirator having multiple conversations with a reporter not about the specifics of those conversations. He skewered business executives and stressed that the corruption of House Bill 6 seeped into the highest reaches of the state’s legislative and executive offices. Much of it was his opinion and a lot of it was difficult if not impossible to verify.

With bravado and bluster Clark railed about the inner workings of the legislative process. But there was a condition to his words: He did not want information attributed to him in a story. He simply didn’t want hassles from federal authorities amid the investigation he said.

“Have you thought about telling your employer you have direct access to me?” Clark texted. “Could [editors] force you to print my comments?”

He said several times that he was prepared to go to trial but he believed that he would be convicted by a jury. He stressed however that he thought he would win on appeal. He said the most accurate information about the scandal – and his life – would come out in his book titled “What Do I Know? I’m Just a Lobbyist.”

“During his nearly four decades in the Ohio political arena Neil Clark lobbied for over 2000 clients and directed scores of successful political campaigns for candidates and statewide ballot issues” the book’s cover jacket says.

He texted the cover art and a few pages from the book. It appeared to be self-published and it went to its first printing in November but it was hard to pin him down on when it would be released.

He said he met with authorities for four hours during the summer but he refused to cooperate with them or plead guilty. He said he had done nothing wrong.

He didn’t need prodding to disclose what he had told investigators as we discussed several names that he said came up during the meeting. He just wanted to make sure that the information never appeared in print or online. He was convinced that the case would span several years as he believed more people would be targeted and charged based on the word of cooperating witnesses.

His voice began to rise when discussing powerbrokers and rainmakers who in his opinion had committed crimes.

An FBI affidavit in the case portrayed Clark as someone extremely close to Householder the person who could be relied upon when the then-speaker was away.

“When [Householder] is busy I get complete say” the FBI quoted Clark in a recorded conversation in 2019. “When we’re working on stuff and he says ‘I’m busy’ everyone knows Neil has the final say not Jeff. Jeff is his implementer.”

Clark however claimed that he was never part of the inner clique of Team Householder. He stressed that he got involved in the push for House Bill 6 only after he demanded that it wouldn’t be tainted by bribes or anything illegal.

At times the interviews appeared more for Clark’s benefit than mine. Some conversations went on for hours during the day or at night. Terrible cell-phone reception didn’t help.

“OK then?” he said often then launching into another subject.

For his bravado and at times profanity Clark appeared to have a keen sense of right and wrong. He became irate over an error in a story on the scandal wondering how the mistake could have happened. He dismissed an explanation.

He also spared no words when blasting the antics of fellow Republicans and others whom he spent decades working to help. At one point the discussion of dark money came up and Clark gave a detailed example of the path through several nonprofits.

Asked how he knew so much about the various individuals and the stream of cash Clark barked back: “They’re my clients.”

Clark seemed somewhat buoyant and surprised to learn of a legislator’s fund-raiser that coincided closely with the vote for House Bill 6 in May 2019. He repeated it a few times and appeared struck by its timing.

In our last conversation a few weeks back he talked briefly but he appeared distracted almost dismissive. The point of the conversation was a Cleveland attorney’s lobbying efforts in Columbus.

“OK?” he said after explaining the lawyer’s work. He then hung up taking a lifetime of secrets with him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZGF3Z3BvdW5kZGFpbHkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjAvY2xldmVsYW5kLWJyb3ducy10cmFkZS1vZGVsbC1iZWNraGFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Would it make sense for Cleveland Browns to trade Odell Beckham Jr.?,,,,,,,,,,

Dozens of large businesses — from McDonald's and Chick-fil-A to a local DMV and car wash — couldn't accept credit card payments one afternoon in February — creating a flurry of confusion and frustrated customers.

The problem which only lasted a few hours can be traced to a backend system operated by just four companies that underpins much of the payments ecosystem. Most consumers know little to nothing about it.

When customers slip their debit or credit cards into a machine at a business a little phrase pops up: ""authorizing payment."" Those two words reference an elaborate system that allows the multi-billion dollar payments processing industry to approve the charge for the customer.

It sounds simple but each processor — the companies that handle every card payment by communicating between the merchant and customer's respective banks — must use an elaborate system of backups to keep the consumer economy running each day preventing an outage that would leave many merchants scrambling to not lose sales from consumers who increasingly don't carry cash.

On top of that they're pounded by hacking attempts from criminals wanting to steal payment information meaning their cybersecurity must be top notch.

But in their most simplistic form ""you can think of them as being these huge data center-based companies that are processing billions upon billions of transactions 24/7 365"" said Lisa Ellis an analyst at MoffettNathanson.

On Feb. 26 when Fiserv one of those payments processors had an internet outage merchants across the US couldn't take electronic transactions until the issue resolved. The company services to a majority of fast-food restaurants which explains why Chick-fil-A McDonald's and Popeye's were some of the businesses affected that day.

Fiserv alongside FIS Global Payments and JPMorgan Chase account for about 80% to 90% of the payments processing industry in the US according to MoffetNathanson. That means each time you swipe your card there's about a 90% chance one of those businesses is responsible approving the payment.

A case of an ""outage"" in which many merchants can't process card payments is extremely rare according to Ellis and Robert Le an analyst at PitchBook. That's because the processors have backups for every single part of the process.

""The IT infrastructure of any large company has a whole backup plan to it"" Ellis said. It's ""a business continuity plan that says 'OK what's the redundancy that's built in here in case something goes down?'""

Payments processors have backup internet providers and backup data centers that process payments in case one data center goes down. If a card is taking longer than normal to authorize it might be because the payment is being routed to a data center farther away.

A spokesperson for FIS told Insider the company has heavily invested in its infrastructure ""to minimize the likelihood and impact of an outage."" It regularly tests backups like its ""auto failover"" that allows payments to move between data centers as needed they said.

Global Payments didn't respond to Insider's request for comment and a representative from JPMorgan Chase declined to discuss company operations and cybersecurity measures.

As for Fiserv which had the issues in February a company spokesperson said: ""Redundancy and resiliency are built into our solutions."" That includes multiple internet service providers and data center backups across the country they said.

In February despite the hours-long wait many merchants had in being able to once again accept digital payments Cave said Fiserv's internet backups worked as intended. She added that ""the initial internet service provider outage created a secondary impact for some clients.""

A widespread long-term outage at a payments processor is ""very rare"" Le the Pitchbook analyst said.

So rare in fact that when Visa a payments provider that works with the processors had an outage in Europe in September 2018 people thought it might have been a terrorist attack Ellis said. More than 5 million transactions failed over the 10-hour outage because of a rare data center malfunction Finextra reported at the time.

""People were freaking out"" Ellis said ""because it's so unusual.""

Though the Visa outage was a data malfunction payments processors and others in the network must be on top of cybersecurity to prevent service problems related to a hacking. They're ""bombarded constantly with cybersecurity attacking attempts"" because criminals are wanting to get payment information Ellis said.

""Aside from military agencies and stuff like that they've got to be some of the most attacked networks in the world because they contain payment information"" she said.

Outages though rare likely affect merchants the most considering the lost sales and damage to the brand reputation with customers according to Le.

""Consumers nowadays don't carry any cash"" Ellis said. ""So if you were in a store buying anything of a reasonable size and you couldn't use a card most consumers would just walk out.""

Over the years cash has become less widely used as card payments have taken over. Card penetration or the number of consumers using a card instead of cash is about 60% to 70% according to Ellis but that varies across the country. In New York City for example card usage is even higher.

If there was a big outage at a payments processor in the future it could ""lead to a call to bring cash use back into the system"" Le said. But in the long-term merchants are likely to look for support from multiple payments processors instead of just relying on one he said.

Large businesses in the US usually do have multiple processors so they have a backup in case one goes down. But smaller merchants generally don't Ellis said.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic cash increasingly became a thing of the past as merchants sought to use more contactless payments to avoid exposure to the virus.

Their contributions helped make Ford a significant asset to the U.S. economy in 2020 and they play an extremely important part in the construction of every Ford vehicle made in America.

Ford employed over 57000 hourly UAW autoworkers last year making it the top UAW employer over cross town rivals GM and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles). According to a 2020 Boston Consulting Group Study union employees producing the Ford F-Series are part of a group of Ford workers that are indirectly supporting about 500000 American jobs through their efforts churning out the insanely popular trucks.

“The numbers confirm Ford’s leadership and commitment to American manufacturing and the U.S. economy. Not only is the auto industry the backbone of the U.S. economy Ford is vital to it” said Kumar Galhotra president of the Americas and International Markets Group at Ford. “We are a proud supporter of American manufacturing – and we do back it up year after year investing in our workforce and the country.”

Part of that investment will enable UAW autoworkers to construct the Ford F-150 Electric at the Ford Dearborn Truck plant at the Rogue Complex where The Blue Oval is investing $700 million to build the truck. The Ford Rogue Electric Vehicle Center will enable Ford to create an additional 500 jobs for the company’s first-ever battery electric full-size pickup.

As part of its current four-year contract with the UAW Ford has committed to invest $6 billion into its U.S. plants overall. Combined these plants have made Ford the single largest producer of vehicles in the country and the nation’s largest exporter of vehicles as well. In fact Ford contributed approximately $100 billion to the U.S. GDP in 2020.

In its place we’re running some of Dave’s favorite past columns. This one originally ran in June 2015 and Dave says the owner has sold the car since then.

It’s hard to understand how a company as successful as Ford Motor Co. could have created such a disaster as the Edsel. The car was introduced in 1958 after a lot of hype in 1957 that “The Edsel is coming.” Everyone involved with the Edsel was sworn to secrecy. The Edsel Division instructed dealers to keep the Edsels under cover until “E Day” on Sept. 4 1957. No one was allowed a sneak peak.

According to several websites on the subject 2.5 million people showed up in dealer showrooms on “E Day” but not many bought. Edsel lasted only three model years with the first year 1958 its best but selling only about 64000 cars. In 1959 sales dropped to 44891 and in their last year model year — which lasted only a few months — Edsel sales were 2846. It has been reported that Ford lost $350 million (about $2.9 billion in 2015 dollars) on the Edsel fiasco.

A lot of reasons have been given to the Edsel failure but the primary one has to be Ford’s management. True there was a recession in 1958 and some experts say the car’s name itself was a major negative. The fact that the 1958 models had the ugly “horse-collar” grille didn’t help either. It wasn’t really a bad car though. It offered a “teletouch” push-button automatic shift with the buttons in the center of the steering wheel. A nice idea but plagued with problems. Another interesting feature was the “rolling-dome” speedometer considered very cool at the time.

By the time the 1959 Edsel priced at $2691 ($21864 in 2015 dollars) was launched it was already too late to breathe life into Edsel. I suspect many of the Edsel Division people were already polishing up their resumes and downplaying their involvement.

Eliminated for 1959 were the teletouch push-button transmission and the rolling-dome speedometer. The larger Edsel models based on the Mercury chassis were dropped leaving only the smaller Ford Fairlane-size models for Edsel. Gone was the horse-collar grille in favor of a more conservative and traditional grille. The dashboard was almost identical to the Ford dashboard. Pittsburg resident Lee Leder has a love for Edsels.

“This is the fourth one I’ve had in 10 years” the car collector said. “I like ‘X’ cars car that aren’t produced anymore. I’ve had Packards Studebakers and Edsels. One reason I like Edsels is that a lot of people will come up to me and say they have never seen one before and some have never even heard of it.”

Leder’s 1959 Edsel was originally sold in December 1958 with plastic seat covers a popular thing to do at that time and they’re still protecting the seats. When I asked what he paid for this Edsel he said “I stole it. I only paid $8000 for it. The car sat in an auto museum in Tucson for about 45 years.”

When the museum scaled down they sent this Edsel to an auction. “The auction ran late into the evening and there were not many Edsel buyers there and that’s why I got it for $8000.”

Leder has documents showing that the car had only 67000 original miles. After the auction he checked all the fluids and drove it back to California. “I was driving in the desert in the mountains at night time in the rain and on the freeway.” It made it all the way home minus one block. It turned out there was a pin hole in the gas line which Leder quickly fixed before driving the Edsel the last block home. “I drove it 920 miles.”

Proudly the owner states “I consider this car 100% stock original unrestored and all I had to do was wipe the dust off.”

Leder estimates the current market value of his Edsel is around $15000. He drives the care about 1000 miles a year now mostly to car shows and around town. The car is tight and the 200-horsepower 292-cubic-inch V8 engine has a great sound. It has power steering and brakes but no other power equipment. The radio is AM-only. He took me for a ride. He still has a little hot rodder head under that gray hair.

During the hype of the Edsel there were a number of advertising slogans that didn’t prove true like the one that claimed “The Edsel is going to be copied.” But as far as Lee Leder is concerned one slogan has proved true. It stated “Once you’ve seen it you’ll never forget it. Once you’ve owned it you’ll never want to change.”

“I’m going to keep it” he said. “It’s my favorite.”

LOUISVILLE Ky. — It was months in the making – the debut of the 1982 Ford Ranger.

“It was just that perfect moment in time for Louisville to shine and come to the floor” Ted Ryan Ford Motor Company said.

Ryan the Archives and Heritage brand manager for the automaker said the launch of the small to mid-size truck was strategic coming at a time when money was tight for most Americans and workers needed jobs.

“The decision was made to bring the work back to America and to launch an all new mid-size pickup truck The Ranger – and the Louisville Assembly Plant was the plant chosen to launch this fantastic new vehicle” he said.

Produced exclusively at the Kentucky truck Assembly Plant the production of the Ford Ranger re-opened the plant and almost instantly demand was high.



Sky11 captured the moment nearly 100 Rangers in that iconic red and white body rolled off plant property heading for dealerships across the region.

The new truck stimulated Americans desire for something different in the market and the Louisville economy. However the thrill didn’t last.

“The Ranger that small to mid-size truck pretty much worked its magic and was tapering off – sales were tapering off by the late 90s and we were looking for a replacement” Ryan said.

Louisville was the truck capitol of the world for just a moment and never lost the love of that original Ranger.

Almost four decades later history is now repeating itself with a newly released revamped Ranger. It’s one Ford officials said the country was asking for.

“Obviously Ranger has a tremendous heritage. I think what’s great about today’s Ranger it’s is really just built on everything that’s made Ranger great over the years including when we brought it to market back in 1982” Trevor Scott Ford Motor Company said.

In another twist of fate The Ranger relaunch comes at the same time as Ford will release an all new Bronco.

And so they say history repeats itself.

‘I cannot think of a better landing spot for ShieldX than Fortinet ... I know this transaction has the potential to be incredibly good for all involved’ ShieldX CEO Ken Levine wrote on LinkedIn late Friday.

Fortinet has quietly purchased cloud and network security startup ShieldX to give customers a more comprehensive view of end users workstations and OT devices.

The Sunnyvale Calif.-based platform security vendor closed its acquisition of San Jose Calif.-based ShieldX March 10 a Fortinet spokesperson told CRN but the company hadn’t publicly announced the deal. ShieldX CEO Ken Levine posted about the Fortinet transaction on LinkedIn late Friday which followed a Monday LinkedIn post on the deal by Dave Karp ShieldX’s SVP of product management and marketing.

“I cannot think of a better landing spot for ShieldX than Fortinet” Levine wrote on LinkedIn Friday. “I know this transaction has the potential to be incredibly good for all involved.”

ShieldX’s relationship with Fortinet started at the February 2020 RSA Conference according to Levine. He said on LinkedIn that the Fortinet team was an “absolute pleasure to deal with even if appropriately tough on some matters!!”

Fortinet is not disclosing how much it paid for ShieldX according to a company spokesperson.

“After 18 months at ShieldX I can say with certainty that … this was as smart and as talented and as passionate a team one could wish to be part of” Levine wrote on LinkedIn. “Adding [in] an exceptional board and advisors it was a privilege to be CEO.”

The combination of Fortinet and ShieldX has created an integrated offering to address lateral movement prevention as well as the convergence of OT campus and multi-cloud data center segmentation ShieldX wrote on a blog posted to the company’s website March 8. ShieldX said it can extend perimeter security and campus segmentation with east-west lateral movement prevention.

The joint company can better protect data and applications across all environments thanks to the combination of Fortinet’s network security and ShieldX’s customer visibility and controls the company said. Fortinet’s threat intelligence and alerts combined with the analysis of traffic flowing east-west in the data center should lead to faster response times according to ShieldX.

ShieldX said it can autogenerate security policies for proper segmentation as well as provide context and quantify risk for all assets communicating with applications. The company said its patented microservices architecture allows the platform to elastically scale security while recording all changes in a report to ensure compliance.

The company said its unsupervised machine learning can generate security policies based on the risk score associated with vulnerabilities in the application structure. ShieldX said it can also automatically prevent exploits from attacking the vulnerabilities through deep packet inspection as well as the automated creation and deployment of security policies.

This is Fortinet’s third deal in the past eight months and comes three months after the company bought Panopta for $34 million to automate management of servers containers applications databases cloud infrastructure and virtual appliances. The company also bought Opaq for $8 million in July to strengthen distributed network protection from data centers and branch offices to remote users and IoT devices.

ShieldX was founded in 2015 raised $34 million of outside funding and employs 43 people down from a high of 64 employees in April 2019 according to LinkedIn and Crunchbase. The company closed a $25 million Series B round in December 2017 led by Bain Capital Ventures and followed that with an August 2019 investment for an undisclosed amount from Thomvest Ventures.

The company has a number of high-profile board members including FireEye Founder Ashar Aziz former Symantec President and COO Michael Fey former Palo Alto Networks President Mark Anderson NTT Security CEO Matthew Gyde and Aspect Ventures Co-Founder Theresia Gouw who lead the firm’s early investments in Cato Networks Exabeam and Forescout.

The same month Thomvest invested Levine joined Shield X as CEO following nearly five years leading Waltham Mass.-based data protection vendor Digital Guardian. “It did not take long for me to recognize that ShieldX is where I wanted to be if the founders and board would have me” Levine wrote on a ShieldX blog at the time of his arrival.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Credit: Jonathan Ng If only the great Italian composer Giacomo Puccini were still alive today he could have written a tragic opera on the real-life melodrama being played out at Collaroy’s Bellagio apartment complex once the glittering jewel in the diverse business empire of Sydney’s millionaire Italian migrant family the Mustacas. And Calabrian-born patriarch Roy “Rocco” Mustaca 78 the owner of one of the Bellagio’s units with its jaw-dropping views over the ocean who is also renowned for his Elvis-style jet-black bouffant and penchant to break into song could have sung it. The part-time crooner and businessman is already a familiar face to patrons at his United Cinemas chain with his regular performances screened before movie sessions – including a five-minute masterpiece titled God Kill The Coronavirus – which he performs in a shimmering metallic suit with matching silver bow-tie.

No doubt the warbling chanteur of Pittwater’s talents impressed his latest business partner Hollywood big-hitter Mark Wahlberg with whom the Mustacas intend to open a chain of burger joints in a $50 million deal trumpeted in a blaze of headlines in January. Mark Wahlberg. But rather than Hollywood beefcake and burgers back at the Bellagio building in Collaroy it is Roy’s son Sam Mustaca the mastermind of the Wahlberg deal and CEO of his father’s United Cinemas whose name is on many a long-suffering resident’s lips. The Bellagio’s body corporate and the building’s original developer Sam Mustaca’s ACA Developments have been embroiled in years of disputes and court cases over a leaking roof. (ACA Developments is now effectively half-owned by corporate watchdog ASIC after Mustaca’s former business partner Dee Why fruiterers Vumbaca Brothers Pty Ltd was deregistered.)

ACA still owns 20 apartments in Bellagio or roughly a third of the building which it developed nearly 20 years ago estimated to be collectively worth between $20 million and $30 million. And as the rain tumbled down this week Bellagio’s body corporate faces a $3 million-plus bill to fix its leaking roof and repair years of water damage.

The proposal was rejected. Furious owners told PS roof repairs had been delayed after they “wasted” thousands of dollars in legal fees chasing Mustaca’s company for late strata levies. ACA which had already entered a payment plan blamed COVID and paid the outstanding fees.

Owners are also angry Mustaca’s company continues to rent out units for short-term stays after the body corporate passed a bylaw preventing owners who did not live in the building from doing so. Sam Mustaca said his company had previously sued the body corporate in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal over the leaking roof which resulted in a compulsory manager being appointed and assuming responsibility to fix it. Two years later repairs are yet to commence.

GAMESTOP CFO RESIGNS FOLLOWING REDDIT STOCK TRADING MANIA

The great apes are the latest cause celebre for the subreddit’s citizen investors who made headlines last month when their frenzied run on shares of struggling video game retailer GameStop sent the company’s stock soaring.

GameStop shares spiked more than 100 percent in a single day during Reddit run on its shares before plunging back down to earth earlier this month.

The run on the gorillas began March 12 when one Reddit user posted he had adopted one of the endangered apes — a process by which a donation is made to the fund in the name of a specific gorilla to help in its upkeep.

DraftKings which went public in April of 2020 after combining with Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp. a special acquisitions company or SPAC at the time is now valued at far more.

“Now it's over $25 billion because a number of states over the last years have changed their policies to create big opportunities for growth...

Credit: Jonathan Ng If only the great Italian composer Giacomo Puccini were still alive today he could have written a tragic opera on the real-life melodrama being played out at Collaroy’s Bellagio apartment complex once the glittering jewel in the diverse business empire of Sydney’s millionaire Italian migrant family the Mustacas. And Calabrian-born patriarch Roy “Rocco” Mustaca 78 the owner of one of the Bellagio’s units with its jaw-dropping views over the ocean who is also renowned for his Elvis-style jet-black bouffant and penchant to break into song could have sung it. The part-time crooner and businessman is already a familiar face to patrons at his United Cinemas chain with his regular performances screened before movie sessions – including a five-minute masterpiece titled God Kill The Coronavirus – which he performs in a shimmering metallic suit with matching silver bow-tie.

No doubt the warbling chanteur of Pittwater’s talents impressed his latest business partner Hollywood big-hitter Mark Wahlberg with whom the Mustacas intend to open a chain of burger joints in a $50 million deal trumpeted in a blaze of headlines in January. Mark Wahlberg. But rather than Hollywood beefcake and burgers back at the Bellagio building in Collaroy it is Roy’s son Sam Mustaca the mastermind of the Wahlberg deal and CEO of his father’s United Cinemas whose name is on many a long-suffering resident’s lips. The Bellagio’s body corporate and the building’s original developer Sam Mustaca’s ACA Developments have been embroiled in years of disputes and court cases over a leaking roof. (ACA Developments is now effectively half-owned by corporate watchdog ASIC after Mustaca’s former business partner Dee Why fruiterers Vumbaca Brothers Pty Ltd was deregistered.)

ACA still owns 20 apartments in Bellagio or roughly a third of the building which it developed nearly 20 years ago estimated to be collectively worth between $20 million and $30 million. And as the rain tumbled down this week Bellagio’s body corporate faces a $3 million-plus bill to fix its leaking roof and repair years of water damage. The complex’s original builder (not ACA) went into liquidation years ago. Roy and Sam Mustaca owners and operators of United Cinemas. Credit: Steven Siewert Sam Mustaca who previously lived in the building told PS it was an ″⁣unfortunate state of affairs″⁣ and confirmed his company had offered to pay for the roof repairs if the body corporate allowed ACA to develop 13 new units on the roof. The proposal was rejected. Furious owners told PS roof repairs had been delayed after they “wasted” thousands of dollars in legal fees chasing Mustaca’s company for late strata levies. ACA which had already entered a payment plan blamed COVID and paid the outstanding fees.

Owners are also angry Mustaca’s company continues to rent out units for short-term stays after the body corporate passed a bylaw preventing owners who did not live in the building from doing so. Sam Mustaca said his company had previously sued the body corporate in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal over the leaking roof which resulted in a compulsory manager being appointed and assuming responsibility to fix it. Two years later repairs are yet to commence. Meanwhile sitting in Bellagio’s basement car park spaces belonging to Mustaca’s company proudly sparkles an impressive collection of expensive luxury cars from Porches to Mercedes-Benz replete with their famous insignia lovingly inlaid into the gleaming polished floor.

Harris splits with husband Seven years after Channel Ten television personality Sarah Harris married her red-headed IT specialist Tom Ward Harris has confirmed the union has come to an end. The Studio 10 co-host who was widely mooted as a potential replacement for rival show Sunrise following the departure of Samantha Armytage told PS the separation was amicable. “Tom and I are taking time apart however we remain good friends and deeply committed to co-parenting our two beautiful boys” she explained. The pair were bathed in publicity when they tied the knot at private boys’ high school Saint Ignatius’ College Riverview in the Dalton Chapel with the reception held at the Royal Sydney Golf Club in Rose Bay.

Television personality Sarah Harris and husband of seven years Tom Ward have separated.

Five years later Ward proposed on Balmoral Beach. Harris who has previously reflected on her humble upbringing on a housing commission estate in Mount Druitt in Sydney’s west remains very much a hands-on mother even as she juggles a high- pressure media career. In 2018 she revealed her husband suffered from narcolepsy a rare neurological disorder where he constantly falls asleep.

GAMESTOP CFO RESIGNS FOLLOWING REDDIT STOCK TRADING MANIA

The great apes are the latest cause celebre for the subreddit’s citizen investors who made headlines last month when their frenzied run on shares of struggling video game retailer GameStop sent the company’s stock soaring.

GameStop shares spiked more than 100 percent in a single day during Reddit run on its shares before plunging back down to earth earlier this month.

The run on the gorillas began March 12 when one Reddit user posted he had adopted one of the endangered apes — a process by which a donation is made to the fund in the name of a specific gorilla to help in its upkeep.

That’s still far from the 75 to 85 percent of Americans experts estimate need to be vaccinated in order to get the coronavirus pandemic under control but recent research indicates that goal is within reach: a February survey by the Pew Research Center found 69 percent of American adults either have received at least one dose of vaccine or intend to be vaccinated when they can.

That’s an improvement over recent months; in November before vaccinations had been rolled out about 60 percent of Americans said they planned to be vaccinated.

But there remains a deep partisan divide in willingness to be vaccinated — and in how Americans view the danger caused by the pandemic. Pew’s work and other recent surveys have found Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be willing to take the vaccine and are more likely to be concerned about the public health ramifications of the pandemic.

As Zeeshan Aleem recently wrote for Vox:

CBS News released a poll conducted between March 10 and 13 which found 33 percent of Republicans say they won’t get the vaccine when it becomes available to them while just 10 percent of Democrats said the same. In that survey 47 percent of Republicans said they’ve already received the vaccine or plan to do so compared to 71 percent of Democrats. Those findings follow a recent poll from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist which found that 47 percent of people who supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election say they won’t choose to be vaccinated (versus 10 percent of Biden supporters) as well as a Monmouth University poll released earlier in March that found 59 percent of Republicans either wanted to wait and “see how it goes” before getting vaccinated or said they were likely to never get one. By contrast 23 percent of Democrats felt the same way.

Similarly Pew found 83 percent of Democrats have been vaccinated or plan to be compared to 56 percent of Republicans.

The Kaiser Family Foundation and Washington Post recently discovered that partisan vaccine hesitancy extends to the medical profession. A survey they conducted from February 11 to March 7 found 40 percent of Republican health care workers — including doctors nurses and staff — feel available vaccines may not be safe and effective. That view was held by 28 percent of Democrat health care workers.

Why this is the case is not completely clear — Dr. Anthony Fauci the top infectious disease expert in the United States told Meet the Press that the divide “makes absolutely no sense.”

Republicans appear to be far less worried about — and frightened by — Covid-19 than Democrats

One thing polls have made clear of late is that people’s political inclinations tend to correspond with how worried they are about the virus in general something that could influence how likely they are to take measures to prevent exposure and infection.

According to the Pew survey for instance 82 percent of Democrats say that the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to the health of the American population compared to 41 percent of Republicans. That divide has been fairly steady since last March when 33 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of Democrats were worried about the threat Covid-19 posed to public health.

Pew also found Republicans to be much less concerned about the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus — 40 percent of Republicans said they worry these variants some of which are more transmissible and deadly could lead to “a major setback” in progressing toward the end of the pandemic compared to 60 percent of Democrats. Members of both parties largely agree that the virus is a threat to the economy however with 83 percent of Democrats and 81 percent of Republicans sharing that sentiment.

A Franklin Templeton/Gallup study conducted in December 2020 — when confirmed daily cases regularly topped 200000 (compared to the 50000 to 60000 confirmed cases seen for most of March 2021) — found Republicans far less likely to believe a coronavirus infection posed a hospitalization risk than Democrats. Members of both parties were found to vastly overestimate an infected person’s chances of being hospitalized with 28 percent of Republicans 41 percent of Democrats and 35 percent of independents believing the hospitalization rate was at least 50 percent. Far more Republicans than Democrats — 26 percent to 10 percent — correctly responded that about 1 to 5 percent of those infected must be hospitalized.

According to more recent polling from CBS/YouGov (conducted from March 10 to 13) 51 percent of Republicans said they weren’t concerned about being infected with Covid-19 compared to the 17 percent of Democrats who weren’t concerned. When asked why they weren’t concerned most Republicans said the risk of infection was exaggerated or declining.

These numbers suggest that at least a portion of Republican vaccine hesitancy may stem from some Republicans feeling as if the coronavirus is not something that is overly dangerous — or something to fear.

The results come as a majority of Americans express optimism about the state of the pandemic. About 60 percent of Americans say that the “coronavirus situation” is getting better and 26 percent said it’s staying the same according to a Gallup poll taken February 14 to 21. Only 14 percent say it’s getting worse the lowest response to that question since July. For the pandemic to end however more people than are currently willing to do so will need to take a vaccine — and key to making that happen will be overcoming hesitancy among all groups Republican voters included.",,,,,,,,,

Both are tough no-frills fitness trackers but there are a lot of differences hidden inside.

Here we've given you a full comparison of both Garmin watches so you can pick the best one for you depending on your budget and needs.

Summary

Summary

If you're a runner then both the Instinct and Forerunner 945 will serve you well. Both feature accurate GPS and heart rate tracking downloadable training plans lap alerts interval training and course times and both can be connected to external foot pods or heart rate monitors.

For cyclists however the Forerunner 945 is a much better choice. It's able to calculate elevation profiles show cycling-specific maps connect to power meters cadence sensors lights and radar units and provide real-time breadcrumb trails.

The Forerunner 945 is also the best watch for golfers pre-programmed with maps for thousands of courses plus scoring and plotting tools.

If you want a smartwatch for everyday wear the Forerunner 945 again comes up trumps. While its fitness tracking tools aren't that different it has a lot more features you'll use in everyday life such as Wi-Fi connectivity a built-in music player support for third-party apps and NFC for contactless payments. The Forerunner 945 is also the only one of the two to have a pulse ox sensor unless you upgrade to the more expensive Instinct Solar.

All that extra functionality comes at a price though and the Forerunner 945 costs around twice as much as the Instinct. If running and walking are your main activities then the Instinct could be a great buy. Otherwise the Forerunner 945 will serve you better.

Display and design

Display

Instinct is grayscale; Forerunner 945 is color

Instinct has dual-screen design

Forerunner 945 has higher resolution

The most immediately obvious difference between the two watches is that the Garmin Instinct has a monochrome display while the Forerunner 945's is color. That's not the only thing to note though.

The Garmin Instinct has a dual-screen design with a small cut-out window to display extra information and contextual icons. As you're browsing through the watch's menus the icon in this window will change to show what pressing the top right button will do and when you're using the Instinct in smartwatch mode you can choose what information it shows (such as step count or temperature).

It's a neat intuitive way to help you find your way around the watch's myriad options but it does mean that the main screen is smaller and capable of showing less information with a resolution of just 128 x 128 pixels.

The Garmin Forerunner 945 has one large screen with a resolution of 240 x 240 pixels. It's not AMOLED so it's not as vivid as the display of the Garmin Venu but it offers good visibility in sunlight and is a good size for viewing maps.

Design

Both made from fibre-reinforced polymer

Similar size and weight

Instinct has more color options

Both the Garmin Instinct and Forerunner 945 are notable for their no-frills designs favoring practicality over style.

Both watches have a bezel and case made from fiber-reinforced polymer though the Instinct is a little thicker and smaller in diameter measuring 45 x 45 x 15.3mm compared to 47 x 47 x 13.7mm.

The Instinct is also slightly heavier tipping the scale at 52g compared to 50g for the Forerunner. The difference is imperceptible in use though.

Both Garmins have a silicone strap and the Instinct is available in four colors (Seafoam Black Tundra and Lakeside Blue) while the Forerunner 945 only comes in black or blue if bought as part of a bundle with Garmin's HRM-Tri and HRM-Swim heart rate monitors.

Features

Smartwatch features

Forerunner 945 was Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity

Only Forerunner 945 supports third-party apps

Battery life is roughly the same

Both watches support Bluetooth for connecting to your phone and ANT+ for linking additional devices (such as heart rate monitors and cadence sensors) but the Forerunner 945 also has Wi-Fi connectivity plus NFC allowing you to make contactless payments via Garmin Pay.

The Garmin Instinct doesn't support apps downloaded from the Garmin Connect IQ store. Nor does it have a music player - it can only control the music player on your phone. The Garmin Forerunner 945 has internal storage for up to 1000 songs.

Both watches have battery life of around two weeks in smartwatch mode but the Forerunner 945 can keep running for up to 36 hours in GPS mode (without music) while the Instinct only lasts 16 hours. However you can extend that to 40 hours with the Instinct's UltraTrac mode which decreases the GPS upload rate.

If you're planning a long expedition then we recommend taking a look at the Garmin Instinct Solar. It's a little more expensive but its face is covered with Solar Glass which keeps the battery topped up with only a few hours of sunlight exposure every day. Garmin claims that with sufficient sunshine and all the power-saving functions enabled it can theoretically hold its charge forever.

Fitness tracking features

Both are good for runners

Forerunner 945 has a lot more cycling features

Forerunner 945 is a fully fledged GPS golf watch

When it comes to fitness tracking the Garmin Instinct is a good all-rounder particularly for runners but the Forerunner 945 is much more advanced.

Both the Forerunner 945 and the Instinct have full on-board GPS supplemented by Galileo and GLONASS satellite tracking for improved accuracy anywhere in the world. Both also feature a compass barometric altimeter and thermometer.

Both watches offer all-day heart rate monitoring (with alerts for abnormally high or low heart rates) but only the Forerunner 945 has a pulse oximeter for tracking blood oxygen saturation. This feature was added to the Instinct Solar but isn't present in the original Instinct.

Both watches feature Livetrack allowing a friend or relative to monitor your location but the Forerunner 945 also offers incident detection which alerts your emergency contact if it detects a sudden deceleration or impact during an activity.

The Garmin Instinct will serve walkers and runners well (Image credit: Garmin)

Runners will be well served by either watch though the most serious athletes may prefer to opt for the Forerunner 945 thanks to advanced training tools like its race predictor and PacePro pacing strategies. Connecting a RunPod to either watch will give you a wealth of extra info in the Garmin Connect app including ground contact time and balance and vertical oscillation.

For cyclists the Forerunner 945 is easily the best choice. While the Instinct offers only basic activity tracking and courses the 945 provides real-time breadcrumb trails elevation profiles navigation back to start elevation plotter barometric trend with storm indicator and much more. It can also be connected to compatible Varia lights and bike radars.

The Garmin Forerunner 945 is also a fully-fledged golf watch pre-loaded with details of 42000 courses around the world. It provides a digital scorecard hazard and course targets and stat tracking.

Price

Price

Forerunner 945 is around twice the price of Instinct

Forerunner 945 is available in heart rate monitor bundle

Both often cheaper at third-party retailers

It also never sleeps so it keeps an eye on your car even when you’re nowhere near it and it records everything that happens so its memory is better than yours. Dash cams are becoming increasingly popular and the list of models available grows on a regular basis. The best one you can buy new in 2020 is the Garmin 56. It’s loaded with user-friendly features and it can even create time-lapse videos you can post on social media using an app.

Digital Trends selected Garmin’s 56 after testing the most popular dash cams on the market in real-world conditions. We judge them by their ease of installation storage capacity video quality and features. When we’re not behind the wheel we constantly stay up to date with the latest developments in the dash cam world by attending major international trade shows like CES.

The best dash cam: Garmin Dash Cam 56

Why should you buy this? It boasts a robust set of features that actually work as intended.

Who’s it for? Anyone who wants the absolute best in dash cam tech.

How much will it cost? $200

Why we picked the Garmin Dash Cam 56:

At $200 the Garmin Dash Cam 56 — the 2019 successor to our former Editors’ Choice pick the Dash Cam 55 — offers a ton of useful features and above-par quality for a reasonable price. The new 56 boosts the field of view from 122 degrees to 140 and adds a Clarity HDR feature for higher contrast recordings day and night. In a crowded market it takes more than just being good — and the unique attributes of the Dash Cam 56 give it an edge.

At 1440p HD resolution and 30 frames per second the Dash Cam 56 shoots in stunning quality during the day and respectable quality at night. Like some other dash cams on the market the Dash Cam 56 offers innovative driver aids but unlike other cameras its alerts are often relevant (instead of driving you nuts with false alarms). And thanks to a slew of voice-activated functions it lets drivers focus on the road ahead. Also the nifty Travelapse feature makes cool time-lapse videos that can easily be shared on social media via the app.

The Garmin Dash Cam 56 looks great feels sturdy and has better features than competitors costing far more. What’s not to love?

The best dash cam under $100: Apeman C860

Why should you buy this? It protects you without breaking the bank.

Who’s it for? Cost-conscious consumers.

How much will it cost? $100

Why we picked the Apeman C860:

Adding a dash cam to your car is a smart move but that doesn’t mean it’s always an affordable one.

Fortunately the Apeman C860 dash cam allows drivers to protect themselves without going broke. It offers more than just a low price tag. It records high-resolution footage it’s compatible with 128GB memory cards (which you’ll need to purchase separately; no memory card is included) and it offers a 170-degree field of vision with a double lens. It can even keep an eye on what’s going on behind your car because it comes with a second camera.

Even the simplest cheapest model comes with a built-in G-sensor that detects accidents and locks the footage following the impact so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Finally the Apeman C860’s standard Sony IMX355 sensor helps its night-seeing ability. Stuffing all of these features in a $100 package is a winning combination.

The best dash cam for safety: Thinkware U1000

Why should you buy this? You want front and rear video surveillance for maximum safety.

Who’s it for? Extra cautious drivers.

How much will it cost? $590

Why we picked the Thinkware U1000:

The U1000 is expensive but it’s also the best all-around do-it-all dash cam that safety-conscious drivers will love thanks to its second rear-facing camera lens and impressive video quality. The U1000 also stands out from the competition for its other features.

The front camera records in 4K UHD resolution and has a relatively wide 150-degree viewing angle while the rear camera shoots in 2K QHD and has a 156-degree lens. Wi-Fi connectivity built-in GPS and a G-sensor are also included with the U1000. Also the low-light recording quality is better than most because the dash cam uses a Sony Starvis image sensor. The dash cam also comes with driver-assist features including forward collision warning front vehicle departure warning and lane departure warning.

When parked the U1000 will start recording video if it senses motion or an impact and it records in time-lapse for lower power consumption. The cloud-ready dash cam also utilizes the company’s app so drivers can receive notifications (like impacts when parked) check the vehicle’s location and monitor camera activity (including a live feed) from their iOS or Android smartphone. Also the Thinkware U1000 should perform reliably and not lose recordings thanks to its integrated thermal sensor and anti-file corruption feature.

The best dash cam for Uber or Lyft drivers: Vava VD009

Why should you buy this? You want a dash cam that doubles as a virtual co-pilot.

Who’s it for? Motorists who drive a lot.

How much will it cost? $200

Why we picked the Vava VD009:

The Vava VD009 is ideally suited to the needs of those who drive for a living. Sony-sourced technology allows it to record clear images during the day and at night which means the device won’t become an expensive windshield ornament after the sun goes down and it features two cameras. One faces the road ahead one films what’s going on inside the passenger compartment and both record high-resolution footage at 30 fps.

The Vava VD009 automatically overwrites older footage unless its G-force sensor detects a collision. Note that the SD card is not included. Its built-in GPS tracks your car’s location driving route and speed among other parameters. Smartphone connectivity allows users to download videos and share them on social media.

How do I install a dash cam?

There are two basic ways to install a dash cam. The first and simplest solution is to plug the cam’s power cord into your car’s 12-volt outlet. To do this use the suction cup that most dash cam manufacturers include with their device to attach it to your car’s windshield. Make sure it has a clear view of the road ahead and double-check that it’s not in your field of vision. Run the cord from the cam to the 12-volt outlet — which is normally located on the center console — and you’re good to go. It’s not the neatest solution but it works.

For a cleaner look you can hard-wire a dash cam into your car. This solution requires a handful of tools a little bit of time and a basic knowledge of how a car’s electrical system works. Again start by positioning the dash cam on your windshield using the suction cup. Carefully tuck the power cord under the front part of the headliner and run it down the A-pillar by sliding it under the panel that covers it. Use a fuse tap — which you’ll need to buy online or from an auto parts store — to plug the wire direction into your car’s fuse box.

What does a dash cam record to?

Though some dash cams come with a small amount of internal storage a vast majority of the devices on the market save the footage they record onto a micro SD card. Most cams feature a loop function that automatically overwrites older footage when the card reaches its capacity though users who don’t want to lose their files can turn this feature off. If the loop function isn’t on users will need to either empty the SD card or insert an empty one to keep recording.

How long can a dash cam record?

The amount of footage a dash cam can record varies depending on the size of the SD card that’s in it and the resolution selected. If the loop function is on meaning old footage gets overwritten when the card is full the cam will keep recording indefinitely as long as it’s connected to a power source. If you want to save every file the cam records keep in mind an 8 GB memory card stores approximately 20 minutes of footage recorded at 1080p resolution in AVI format. Upgrading to a bigger card — like a 16 or a 32 GB unit — and lowering the resolution will help you save more footage.

Do dash cams have night vision?

Like humans dash cams don’t see as well in the dark as they do during the day and they rely on a car’s headlights and other sources of lights (like street lights) to capture footage at night. Recent advances in sensor technology helps them record increasingly clear footage after the sun goes down but the quality depends on the model purchased. Some of the more expensive units on the market come with night vision technology that automatically adjusts lighting levels to provide the best possible picture but it’s not going to be as clear as what they record in broad daylight.

Broadly speaking your dash cam sees about as well as you do. If you drive out to the Nevada desert on a cloudy night and turn your headlights off don’t count on your dash cam to back up your claim of shaking hands with a jackalope.

Can dash cams tolerate extreme heat or cold?

The simple answer is yes. Dashcams are extremely resistant to heat and cold. Much like modern in-dash navigation systems dashcams can withstand a wide range of temperature changes. That means you can leave them in your car without fear unlike your smartphone.

While all dashcams can withstand harsh environmental conditions exact tolerances will vary by model. Devices that use a capacitor rather than a battery are better at tolerating extreme temperatures. The capacitor allows your camera to record the last few moments of footage when turning your camera off since there is no built-in battery.

While a dash cam that includes a capacitor will be more expensive it’s worth the money if you live in a climate that experiences extreme temperatures. Its design makes it more durable than basic models so you’ll pay once for a cam that lasts longer than those that run on batteries.

Can dash cams work with Alexa Siri or Google Assistant?

When it comes to smartphone integration the dashcam industry still has a long way to go before it catches up with in-dash audio. You can find some expensive cams that have voice activation features but none are fully equipped to link up with Siri Alexa or Google Assistant.

The Garmin Speak Plus is the only cam on the market that came close to being fully integrated with voice commands. This tiny device supports a wide range of Alexa features allowing you to access news reports stream audio communicate with your home and carry out a host of other actions as you move.

With large consulting and IT services firm Accenture reporting strong deal bookings  Indian IT services providers are bound to see a strong deal pipeline analysts have said.Last week Accenture reported significant growth in outsourcing and consulting deals with total new bookings worth $16 billion in the quarter to February.Analysts suggest this could mean a strong deal pipeline for those Indian IT services companies that have built capabilities in digital technology-led services.Accenture deal bookings and performance show that there has been a significant increase in demand and companies realize they need digital channels business models and monetization. For Accenture all these factors have played a key role in bookings growth said Ray Wang chief analyst Constellation Research.“I see the same happening for the firms that have built strong digital practices and have the ability to cross-sell into accounts. There is a lot of demand for cybers cloud AI but digital (transformation) is a key driver” he said.The market is set for a strong year ahead said Peter Bendor-Samuel chief executive of IT advisory firm Everest Group The top five Indian IT services firms - Tata Consultancy Services  Infosys HCL Tech Tech Mahindra - have reported strong performance during the third quarter (October-December) with Infosys leading the pack signing $7.13 billion worth large deals during the period.IT research firm Gartner said in a forecast in January that worldwide IT spending is projected to total $3.9 trillion in 2021 an increase of 6.2% from 2020.“We see the overall market set for a strong year with almost every sector likely to do well” said Bendor-Samuel.One of the key factors driving this is that firms are looking to move away from experimentation post-Covid-19 and focus on large digital programmes that can deliver substantial business value quickly he said.“It is also going to be a year of big contracts… These large deals add to the competitive dynamic” Bendor-Samuel added.ICICI Securities however wrote in a report that the industry needs to watch whether there would be consolidation.“While Accenture’s recent strength in outsourcing has often been perceived as the lead indicator for Indian IT by consensus it needs to be seen whether it is coming at the expense of market share consolidation” said Sudheer Guntupalli and Hardik Sangani in the report."

General Electric (GE) has patched a number of potentially serious security vulnerabilities in its Universal Relay (UR) family of protection and control devices.

Attackers who successfully exploit the flaws could “access sensitive information reboot the UR gain privileged access or cause a denial-of-service condition” according to a security advisory published by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) this week.

Threat to critical assets

The affected products which are produced by GE’s Grid Solutions division are used in critical infrastructure sectors worldwide like energy manufacturing healthcare and transportation to simplify “power management for the protection of critical assets”.

Although CISA described the flaws as being remotely exploitable by attackers with a “low skill level” one of the security researchers who uncovered the vulnerabilities said exploitation “at scale” would “require a great level of skill budget and organization”.

Speaking to The Daily Swig Ron Brash director of cybersecurity insights at Verve Industrial also pointed out that “direct access to these systems or a network that can access them is required”.

However he added: “Generally these devices are not found on the internet directly unless someone has not applied any secure deployment strategies or has inadvertently misconfigured various network infrastructure devices/security apparatuses.”

Read more of the latest critical infrastructure security news

But “if you can get access to these devices and upload your own logic or firmware then you can effectively brick them upload malicious functionality and the consequences will be highly negative.”

However a GE spokesperson told The Daily Swig that “to date GE has not been notified of any exploits of the reported vulnerabilities.”

UR running insecure firmware

CISA describes the critical vulnerability (CVSS score 9.8) as arising from the “UR IED with ‘Basic’ security variant” not allowing “the disabling of the ‘Factory Mode’”.

The issue (CVE-2021-27426) is classified as insecure default variable initialization meaning an internal variable is initialized with an insecure value by default potentially exposing sensitive data or system information to modification.

Assigned the second highest CVSS of 8.4 another high risk flaw (CVE-2021-27430) related to unused hardcoded credentials in the bootloader binary.

Ron Brash who discovered the vulnerability said: “The credentials were visible in the firmware in cleartext. It also leaked the version other available functionality and if fuzzed it could be interrupted or be made to behave unreliably.”

Another high severity flaw (tracked as CVE-2021-27428 and with a CVSS score of 7.5) also uncovered by Brash means an unauthorized user could upgrade firmware without appropriate privileges.

“Physical access or access to the device via a network helps but we were able to push a tampered image to the device” said Brash.

The other two high risk bugs related to inadequate SSH encryption and potential sensitive information exposure through running a web interface over HTTP.

A further four flaws were deemed medium risk.

Firmware fix mitigations

Affected UR models include: B30 B90 C30 C60 C70 C95 D30 D60 F35 F60 G30 G60 L30 L60 L90 M60 N60 T35 and T60.

Brash said Verve Industrial submitted details of the flaws to GE in July 2020. UR firmware version 8.10 which addressed all of the flaws landed on December 24 2020.

Catch up on the latest hardware security news

A GE spokesperson said that the company “immediately worked to assess any potential impact and remediate the reported vulnerabilities” upon receiving the reports.

“We encourage our customers to visit the Grid Solutions customer portal and/or the CISA advisory for additional information and mitigation recommendations” the vendor added.

SCADA-X VuMetric and the US Department of Energy’s CyTRICS program were also involved in finding analyzing and reporting the vulnerabilities.

Salutary reminder

“The advisory is a reminder that the latest programming fads such as sprints to use open source everywhere or by abstracting needlessly away from hardware will not absolve humankind from logic requirements and flaws that sneak by the narrow scope of most companies’ testing” said Brash.

“As devices and software continue to advance new layers of functionality and integrations will be added” and inevitable security degradation over time across “multiple components will equate to multiple high-risk entry points for a malicious party.”

Moreover “a lack of signed firmware will allow malicious parties to insert their own code onto your device – especially if it’s not verified by the receiver.”

Brash envisages that vendors might “start completely encrypting images” to validate a device’s integrity although this will create “key management complexities” and “hinder “derived SBoM creation”.

After all the most searched phrase in 2020 was “how to help” and people from every corner of the globe have come together to help their communities and beyond all in the name of humanity. Even the young have stood up to be counted. “Everyone is suffering in different ways be it financially mentally or even physically seeing friends and family afflicted by the virus itself. This is truly the time to be kind … to be selfless and equally importantly to be generous” says Amira Badawi Kamaluddin.

Just 20 years of age the granddaughter of Malaysia’s fifth prime minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has kick-started a unique fundraising initiative called Move For Hope (MFH) which aims to raise RM100000 between Feb 15 and March 30 to provide a year’s worth of internet for 54 refugee families at Hope Learning Centre in Kuala Lumpur. “We want better access to online education” says Amira. “The school accommodates students aged between three and 16 years old most of whom have no proper routers at home and resort to attending online classes using their mobile phones with unreliable data plans.”

What sets MFH apart is its win-win approach to fundraising — help your fellow man out while having fun and staying fit. Fifty-six instructors including some of the city’s most sought-after names like Yi Ping Teo Christian Lee and Muiz Tajul Abrar teach classes for a minimum donation of RM30 per participant with all proceeds going to MFH. “Every single instructor brings something beautiful to the table” she adds.

“Besides being wonderfully unique in the way they teach participants can be assured they are in good hands. Yi Ping for example is powerful strong and such a great role model for young girls and those finding their way in their own fitness journey. When she started PWRHouse I was in awe and went out of my way to ensure she was on board for MFH. Christian from Tribe Boxing blew me away from the first Facetime call with his kindness passion and drive. He is excellent for those starting out in the sport as well as advanced-level boxers. Muiz has also been an angel raising a lot for the cause and being the brains behind March’s daily challenge where he bases his number of kettlebell swings on the number of children we are helping. I love how all this revolves around getting people active while giving back to the kids.”

Having trained as a dancer for the last five years at Hurtwood House in the UK and at NYU Tisch School of the Arts in the US it is clear that Amira knows firsthand the power of staying active for the sake of physical and mental wellbeing. “That was what inspired me to use fitness as the means to an end” she smiles. “I have personally signed up for all the classes on MFH and would like to stress how this is a great opportunity for people to try something new. There’s a myriad of dance classes from salsa to afro jazz to contemporary as well as spin Hiit and boxing. Whatever you are looking for we have it! The point is to try and have fun while donating to a cause that will make a huge difference in people’s lives. So even if one class isn’t right for you there are 50-plus others that could be. And even if fitness isn’t your thing just know you’ll be helping kids with real needs.”

Amira is not going it alone. She is backed by a dynamic team of young people all in their 20s which includes Ula Wyss (manager and head of technology) Vanessa Tay (head of designs) Jaan Joseph (head of marketing and social media management) Gerald Anyi (marketing and client correspondence) Dzaim Dzulkifli (marketing and admin) Katelyn Tan (designs and content creator) Danial Marzuki (photographer/videographer) Jayme Teoh (marketing and admin) and Alex Webster (international instructor manager).

“MFH started off with Ula and I brainstorming how we could make a small contribution to an underprivileged community during this lockdown” Amira explains. “We wanted to teach a couple of dance classes pile our money together and see what we could do. Ula then recruited Vanessa to join our little duo and we decided to channel our energy towards Hope Learning Centre as both of them already had a close relationship with the school volunteering as teachers.”

Clearly one who dreams big Amira went into overdrive recruitment culminating in 56 instructors who are all on board to help achieve the target of RM100000. “As the goal got bigger so did the team” she laughs. “We were young and it’s a lot of money to raise but we were all in it together and there for each other. And we understood that if we set our minds to something and tried our best we could create something beautiful something bigger than all of us.”

With the word “bigger” in mind it also comes as no surprise that MFH is not going to come to a grinding halt at end-March. “We have many other things in the pipeline including donation drives performing arts workshops teacher training workshops and panel talks” she says animatedly. “There are a lot of ideas being thrown around now and it has been so exciting to come up with new ways to push our initiative further. MFH isn’t just about moving for Hope Learning Centre. It is about creating a movement while bringing hope to other such communities. We want to spend time shedding light on these issues so that people have an idea of what's going on outside their homes. There’s a lot in store and I can’t wait to share all of our new goals and dreams very soon.”

With MFH’s rallying cry being “Everyone has the right to education” Amira acknowledges that her own path has been blessed. “Which is why it is important to give back particularly when one is privileged to do so” she notes. “I have a roof over my head clean water and food on the table. I was able to study abroad to learn many things and form opinions of my own. My family has given everything to me so I especially want to give back now to those who didn’t have the same opportunities I did.”

At press time MFH had raised over RM85000 with their end target well in sight if Malaysians continue to be generous and supportive of a good cause. Giving us an inkling of greater things to come Amira smiles and pointedly states: “This is only the beginning.”

At one time the two models of iPad looked quite different. Yet with the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 (second generation) now sporting nearly identically-sized displays with Apple’s Liquid Retina technology at first glance they might appear to be the same product. However under the surface the two tablets provide their varied offerings. We take a look at both models in this comprehensive roundup.

Specs

iPad Pro 11 (2020) iPad Air 4 Size 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.23 inches (247.6 x 178.5 x 5.9mm) 9.74 x 7 x 0.24 inches (247.4 x 177.8 x 6.09mm) Weight 471 (1.04 pounds) 453.6 grams (1 pound) Screen size 11-inch Liquid Retina LCD (ProMotion & TrueTone) 10.9-inch Liquid Retina LCD (TrueTone) Screen resolution 2388 x 1668-pixels (265 pixels per inch) 2360 x 1640 pixels (264 pixels per inch) Operating system iPadOS 14 iPadOS 14 Storage 128GB 256GB 512GB 1TB 64GB 256GB FaceID Yes No Processor Apple A12Z Bionic Apple A14 Bionic RAM TBC TBC Camera 12MP and 10MP rear 7MP front 12MP rear 7MP front Video 4K at 24 30 60 fps; 1080p at 30 60 120 240 fps 4K at 24 30 60 fps; 1080p at 30 60 120 240 fps Bluetooth version Bluetooth 5 Bluetooth 5.0 Ports USB-C USB-C Fingerprint sensor No Yes Water resistance No No Battery 10 hours on Wi-Fi 9 hours on cellular 10 hours on Wi-Fi 9 hours on cellular App marketplace Apple App Store Apple App Store Network support AT&T Sprint T-Mobile Verizon (cellular models only) AT&T Sprint T-Mobile Verizon (cellular models only) Colors Silver Space Gray Silver Space Gray rose gold green Sky Blue Price Starting at $799 (Wi-Fi) $949 (cellular) Starting at $599 (Wi-Fi) $729 (cellular) Buy from Apple Apple Review score 4.5 out of 5 News

Design display and durability

Both the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 look nearly identical. With housings made from aluminum sharp flat edges and Liquid Retina displays these two devices look more similar than ever before. The iPad Air 4 moves forward with Apple’s new design language — flat edges and bright vivid displays that do away with physical home buttons. The only external factors that allow you to pick out iPad Air 4 from the iPad Pro 11 are the different camera bumps on the rear.

The iPad Air 4 does gain a few design features that the iPad Pro 11 lacks namely colorful pastel options for the exterior. While the iPad Pro 11 is only available with either a silver or Space Gray exterior the iPad Air 4 also adds on rose gold green and Sky Blue. We’d like to see more color options available for the Pro models — after all those going for the more expensive model would like to have some fun too.

The iPad Air 4 is also the first model in the iPad Air line to ditch the Lightning connector for a USB-C connector making both devices great for hooking iPad up to external displays external drives and other peripherals.

The displays on the two iPads are quite close but the iPad Pro 11 pulls ahead. The iPad Air 4 features a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone at 2360 x 1640 pixels resulting in a 264 pixels per inch resolution. The iPad Pro 11 on the other hand has a minutely larger 11-inch display that features both True Tone and ProMotion technology the later allowing for smoother animations on screen. The Pro model’s resolution comes in at 2388 x 1668 resulting in a 265 ppi resolution. Both displays offer a wide color gamut (P3) with the iPad Air 4 reaching a brightness of 500 nits and the iPad Pro 11 reaching 600 nits.

With the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 offering nearly identical exteriors you might think this round a tie. On the other hand iPad Pro 11 provides a display that offers smooth visuals thanks to its ProMotion technology. But if you care more about the exterior color of your tablet the iPad Air 4 offers by far more options. So we will need to call this round a tie.

Winner: Tie

Performance battery life and charging

When it comes to performance we’ve never felt that the processors inside are underpowered and the same factor applies to iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11. The iPad Air 4 features Apple’s A14 Bionic chip with Neural Engine while the Pro model features the A12Z chip with Neural Engine. This results in an odd situation in which the iPad Air contains the newer processor. However don’t let this hold you up if you seek out the iPad Pro 11 as both chips are incredibly fast and will handle iMovie editing and hardcore gaming with ease.

Moving past the processor we find that both iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 offer sufficient amounts of internal storage for various tasks but the iPad Pro 11 takes it up a notch. The iPad Air 4 is provided with two storage options — either 64GB or 256GB — while the iPad Pro is offered at 128GB 256GB 512GB or 1TB. While 256GB should be sufficient for most tasks anyone looking to turn their iPad into a mobile video or photo editing workstation should consider the Pro’s more sizable offerings.

When it comes to charging both iPads use a USB-C connector to get the job done allowing for faster charging times than that permitted by previous Lightning port devices. Both iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 are rated for up to 10 hours of web surfacing and video watching or if you have the cellular versions of either tablet up to nine hours.

When it comes to performance and battery abilities the iPad Air 4 has caught up quite a bit thanks to the inclusion of a USB-C port and even sports the newer processor. More testing will need to be done between the A12Z and A14 but the more modern A14 seems to pull ahead as one would expect. That said the iPad Pro 11 is the only iPad that offers 1TB of storage which may be a necessity for some users. As a result we are also calling this round a tie.

Winner: Tie

Cameras

As we mentioned before one of the physical differentiating features between the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 is the rear camera bumps. The iPad Air 4 features a single 12-megapixel wide-angle camera lens on its rear with an f/1.8 aperture. The iPad Pro goes a step farther by offering the same 12MP camera and also adding on a 10MP ultrawide lens with an f/2.4 aperture. Both cameras perform well as expected and offer wide color capture autofocus with focus pixels smart HDR and a panorama mode that enables photos up to 63MP in size.

When it comes down to video capture both camera systems can record 4K video at 24 fps 30 fps or 60 fps as well as slo-mo video capture at 1080p with either 120 fps or 240 fps. The front camera systems are the same featuring a 7MP HD camera. However the iPad Pro 11 can utilize effects such as Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting thanks to the built-in TrueDepth camera system — a feature absent on the more affordable iPad Air 4.

When it comes to camera systems the iPad Pro 11 and iPad Air 4 are nearly matched but the iPad Pro 11 gains extra points for its ultrawide lens and TrueDepth camera system. If you’re looking for the best camera experience on the iPad you’ll find it on the Pro model.

Winner: iPad Pro 11

Software and updates

Both the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 ship with Apple’s iPadOS 14 mobile OS. With iPad OS 14 devices can take advantage of redesigned home screen widgets a more compact spotlight-style search window and the ability to use the Apple Pencil to write into any text field whether you are on the web or in a document. For more details about iPadOS 14 check out our guide on the best features. If you purchased an iPad Pro 11 before iPadOS 14 was released as with all upgrades of iPadOS and iOS you can upgrade at no extra charge.

Winner: Tie

Special Features

Let’s tackle a question that you might have on your mind. If the iPad Air 4 doesn’t have a home button with TouchID and it doesn’t have a TrueDepth camera system for FaceID then how do you unlock your device? Apple’s iPad Air 4 is the first device to ship with its new TouchID system built directly into the top button. Want to unlock your iPad Air 4? Merely press the top button with your registered finger and your device with both wake and unlock. This system is absent on the iPad Pro 11 instead replaced by FaceID a system that unlocks your iPad when you look at the device.

One feature absent entirely on the iPad Air 4 is the iPad Pro 11’s LiDAR Scanner which allows for more advanced and accurate augmented reality experiences. This scanner can be found next to the dual camera lenses on the back of the tablet. If a LiDAR Scanner doesn’t sound useful to you how about an attachable keyboard and trackpad? Both iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 support Apple’s Magic Keyboard and Smart Keyboard Folio options. Additionally you can use an Apple Pencil (second generation) if you prefer to draw sketch or take notes.

We have quite a few ties in this battle but don’t blame us as each iPad packs features that can be considered personal preferences depending on the user. Do you prefer FaceID or TouchID? That is a question and the answer isn’t the same for everyone. Otherwise beyond the built-in LiDAR camera system these two tablets offer many of the same features and peripheral compatibility.

Winner: Tie

Price and availability

Apple’s iPad Air 4 is the more affordable model starting at $599 for a 64GB model and increasing to $749 for a 256GB model. It is now available for pre-order and will release on October 23.

The iPad Pro 11’s 128GB model has a higher starting price at $799. The following models are also available with their respective prices: $899 for 256GB $1099 for 512GB and $1299 for 1 TB. If you don’t want to depend on Wi-Fi connections you can add the option to get data and cellular access to any iPad for an additional cost; data is $130 for the iPad Air 4 and $150 extra for the iPad Pro.

Overall Winner: iPad Air 4

Interestingly the iPad Air 4 dominates over the pricier iPad Pro 11 in this competition. The iPad Pro 11 has the best Apple tablets title but we believe the iPad Air 4 wins the title of best overall value. The iPad Pro 11 showcases enhanced features like an extra-wide camera lens  FaceID ProMotion display and the LiDAR scanning feature. While these features are nice upgrades you’re not likely to use them unless you’re a major tech nerd. The iPad Air 4 is more consumer-friendly with all of its basic features efficient speed and various color options.

You might be intrigued by all of the techy aspects of the iPad Pro 11 and if so you’ll enjoy everything the tablet has to offer. However if you’re interested in getting the best iPad with an outstanding value go with the iPad Air 4. No matter which device you choose you can receive a discounted price if you stick around for iPad deals on Cyber Monday.

General XCOM 2 tactics

Plan your turns in advance

XCOM 2 is a turn-based game so you can take as much time as you want to plan out your turns. That includes swapping to other members of your squad for a tactical advantage. Before making your moves you’ll want to take stock of your squad and what they’re capable of. Although it’s tempting to dive in and start shooting targets right away it’s better to plan what you’re going to do with all your squad members before confirming a single action.

Recommended Videos

War of the Chosen added a clutch feature that many players had already modded in which is the ability to preview available targets when deciding where to move your units. Holding Left Alt will bring up all of the targets your soldier will be able to shoot from the tile you’re highlighting taking out all the guesswork and making it much easier to plan your turns precisely.

Concealment and Overwatch make a deadly combo

New to XCOM 2 you’ll begin many missions “concealed.” While you’re concealed enemies will be unaware of your presence and will have a much more limited range of sight. This gives you an opportunity to position your troops before the fight begins or if you have a stealth soldier in your squad sneak up and take out enemies undetected.

While you’re concealed position your soldiers on high ground and around flanks if possible. Then have all but one of the members of your squad activate Overwatch attempting to target as much of the enemy field as possible. With your last soldier fire at one of the aliens and let the fireworks begin. Enemies will start pouring into the battlefield triggering Overwatch and giving you a free attack. Just make sure to position your Overwatch to take out as many targets as possible. It’s better to face three enemies at full health than five enemies at 25% health.

Make sure to extract your soldiers

Permadeath is still present in XCOM 2 so if you lose a soldier on the battlefield you lose them forever. However their bodies remain on the battlefield along with all the gear they have equipped. Whenever a soldier dies make sure to extract their body back to the Avenger. Doing so allows you to re-equip any gear they have and save their body from alien desecration.

Lead with explosives

Armor works a bit differently in XCOM 2 than its predecessor. The yellow lozenge at the end of a character’s health bar acts as a constant reduction on all damage taken. However armor can be shredded by explosives (or normal grenadier attacks with certain upgrades) which permanently removes it for all subsequent attacks. Furthermore many of the cover-providing environmental elements can be destroyed by grenades.

Accordingly it is often best to lead a round of attacks with explosives which will shred armor destroy cover and generally make enemies more vulnerable to attacks from the rest of your squad ensuring the most value for your actions. This is especially pertinent for ambushes from concealment when unwitting enemies are more closely clustered than they will be once engaged.

Grow the resistance early and often

While the geoscape strategic metagame is certainly much more interesting in XCOM 2 than building satellites in Enemy Unknown there are certain similarities to how you should approach it. The game will present you with lots of tempting options for ways to spend your time in the Avenger picking up valuable resources or recruits. Focus on expanding the resistance early in the game contacting new regions and building radio towers in regions you own once you have researched them. All of these will increase your monthly supply income which is critical to your long-term success.

Radio towers also have the added bonus of reducing the intel cost of contacting new regions which is based on the distance to the nearest tower. Global access becomes increasingly important as the game goes on and you are prompted to investigate alien facilities around the world. Having to spend weeks contacting multiple new regions in order to access a critical story mission or Avatar Project facility on the other side of the world can completely kill your momentum.

Stay classy — Character roles and builds

Grenadier

While all of your soldiers can carry grenades into battle grenadiers specialize in raining down explosive destruction on the battlefield and accordingly can carry more with them than anyone else. Propelled by a specialized launcher their grenades fly farther and hit for more damage over a wider radius. Because so many of the cover-providing environmental elements in XCOM 2 are destructible and armor can be shredded by explosives grenadiers serve primarily as a control class reshaping the battlefield in your favor.

The Demolitions Expert skill tree has skills like Heavy Ordinance Volatile Mix and Salvo allowing for grenade fire to be more frequent and effective.

Heavy Gunner on the other hand emphasizes the cannon and shredding armor through direct fire.

All of the grenadier’s grenade-related bonuses apply to all grenades such as the defensive smoke grenade or the various experimental grenades from the proving grounds. Armor-melting acid grenades are particularly synergistic with what grenadiers are already trying to do.

Ranger

Like Enemy Unknown‘s assault class rangers are up-close-and-personal heavy damage dealers. Their biggest change this time around is enhanced synergy with the new concealment mechanics. Able to dish out huge damage in single shots they’re perfect for finishing off the most imminently threatening enemies on the field.

The Scout tree focuses on stealth allowing your rangers to extend and abuse the tactical advantage granted by concealment.

Assault instead emphasizes the Ranger’s new sword for melee attacks.

Both builds are greatly supported by the Spider/Wraith Suits from the proving ground and the enhanced mobility that they provide.

Sharpshooter

Redesigned from Enemy Unknown‘s sniper class the sharpshooter’s name change reflects more robust support for their secondary weapon the pistol. Sharpshooters focus on damage from a distance either concentrated into powerful single attacks with the sniper rifle or spread out through a series of rapid pistol shots.

The Sniper tree supports the traditional role of a high damage dealer who provides cover for the rest of the squad from a distance.

Gunslingers on the other hand are much better at maintaining pressure while staying on the move reserving rifle shots for more specialized situations.

Keep in mind that weapon upgrades only apply to the sniper rifle and cannot be used for the pistol.

Specialist

A flexible support class specialists primarily act through their flying gremlin drones which heal and protect their squadmates or harass and disable robotic foes. They also specialize in another of XCOM 2‘s new mechanics hacking. Having at least one specialist focused on healing with you at all times is practically a requirement for keeping your squad alive as the game goes on. Because the two skill trees fill such different roles doubling up on Specialists can be one of the best ways to capitalize on the increased squad size bonuses from the guerrilla tactics school.

Battle Medic skills do exactly what you would expect allowing for the Specialist to keep their squadmates fresh with medical and revival protocols.

Combat Hackers become more important as the game goes on and you encounter some of its nastier robots such as the advanced MECs and the towering sectopods.

Note that all of the gremlin’s protocol abilities require a single action and do not end the turn allowing for immense flexibility in how Specialists conduct their turns.

Because Specialists benefit the most from medkits or the hacking-aiding skulljacks they are particularly well served by the additional utility item slot in the basic Predator and Warden Armors.

Psi Operative

The fifth soldier class introduced in XCOM 2 the psi operative works differently from the others. Instead of gaining promotions through field experience Psi operatives level up through training in a specialized facility on the Avenger. Moreover rather than progressing linearly through a sequence of choices for new abilities psi operatives choose each successive ability to train from a random selection meaning they can get access to their most powerful abilities from the beginning or learn both abilities from the same tier. These powers can be extremely impactful on the field so it behooves you to get a jump on training your psi operatives as early as possible which is easy with some focused research.

In order to access psi operatives first kill a Sectoid in the field. Instructing Dr. Tygan to complete the Sectoid Autopsy will unlock the Psionics research project which will in turn let you build the Psi Lab. Stick a fresh recruit in there and start them training and you’ll be mind-controlling aliens in no time. Staffing the Lab with an engineer or gremlin substantially accelerates the training process.

SPARK

SPARK soldiers are robotic units similar to MECs in XCOM: Enemy Within. SPARKs are very powerful soldiers with high defense and attack. That makes them devastating on the battlefield allowing you to position a SPARK soldier as a high-powered damage dealer or as a high-defense support unit.

SPARK units have the key Overdrive ability which allows them to take up to three actions in a turn with no turn-ending actions. This is the first skill in the SPARK tree. After unlocking a few more you’ll have two class trees to choose from:

The War Machine skill tree focuses on raw power allowing you to break through walls and cover avoid recoil penalties in Overdrive and rush forward to deal a massive melee attack to any enemy.

The Future Combat is a general skill tree that balances offense and defense offering boosts to Heavy Weapons and extra armor points.

Home is where your jet is — Base Building

At first glance your base inside the mobile Avenger looks similar to the side-on view of your underground facility in Enemy Unknown — a bisected grid of stacked rooms reminiscent of Fallout Shelter or The Life Aquatic. Befitting the smaller scrappier scale of your operation this time around however the grid is half the size at three by four rooms. That many fewer decisions make each one all the more important so here are some tips for getting the most out of your base:

Make sure all of your engineers are always busy. Shen reminds you when they are totally idle but be mindful of ones that might be staffed in inactive rooms like a proving ground with no project or the advanced warfare center with no injured soldiers.

Exposed power coils are randomly distributed with (as far as we have seen) two in the lower half of the grid. These either reduce the power cost of rooms built on them or increase the output of power relays. The latter is ideal for getting the most use out of them. Similar to Steam Vents in Enemy Unknown plan your base accordingly.

Unlike in Enemy Unknown adjacent rooms of the same type no longer confer any bonus to efficiency and thus should not factor into your layout decisions. In general you will rarely want to build more than one of any given facility upgrading those you have instead of redundant expansion.

Clearing out rooms comes with the added bonus this time around of giving you valuable supplies and alien resources for your trouble. Barring anything in particular you need them to do this is the best default task for your engineers to be doing.

Build the Guerrilla Tactics School and start training soldiers

The most important room is the Guerrilla Tactics School by far. First it allows you to invest in Combat Tactics a new feature to XCOM 2 that offers bonuses such as extra experience from kills for your squad and an increased squad size for missions. That last one in particular makes some of the later missions much easier.

Additionally the Guerrilla Tactics School allows you to train rookies to take on whatever class you want. As you recruit new rookies make sure to always have one of them training in the Guerilla Tactics School. That will allow you to invest in skills shortening the gap between rookies and your key soldiers.

Build plenty of Power Relays

Each room in the Avenger has a power cost and at the beginning of XCOM 2 you’ll only have enough power to provide electricity to a few rooms. The mechanic is pretty simple then: Build Power Relays as you need them and you’ll be fine. That works in theory but the reality is that you generally won’t have enough time or resources to build Power Relays as you need them.

Because of that consider building an extra Power Relay or two from the get-go. Doing so will give you plenty of juice to power other rooms without worrying about running out especially as you start to build out the Avenger.

Pay attention to adjacency

Although placement isn’t always important there are a few key rooms that care about the rooms around them. The most important is the Workshop which gives you two extra engineer drones to staff other rooms. The catch: You can only send Workshop engineer drones to rooms immediately above below or to the side of the Workshop.

You only have a certain amount of space to build new rooms so make sure to keep in mind any adjacency conditions when building. Using the Workshop as an example again you’d want to make sure to either leave space around the room or to build the Workshop around rooms you want to staff.

War of the Chosen tips

Get hunting

The eponymous chosen are the headline feature of the new expansion and accordingly you will want to prioritize dealing with them very highly. They will start to show up during random missions early in the game to mess with you but their harassment quickly extends to the strategic layer as well where they will clamp down on regions you control steal from you and eventually hunt you down. The longer they go unaddressed the more powerful they become so it’s in your best interest to handle them as early as possible.

You proactively take on the chosen with a series of three covert actions with each of their respective rival resistance factions (which are randomly assigned each game) where completing the final action unlocks a conventional mission to raid their stronghold and destroy the regeneration device that keeps them coming back. In addition to the reward of no longer having such a powerful enemy bothering you each Chosen also rewards unique and powerful weapons when defeated which will give you a major leg up for the rest of the game.

Lost and gone forever

A zombie by any other name would smell as putrid. The Lost are another new and interesting threat that can seriously change up how you approach missions. They show up in large groups that in some missions will simply spawn endlessly until you leave making last stands a futile losing proposition.

Fortunately to deal with them you get the added bonus of any conventional ranged kill shot giving you a free action which lets you chain Lost kills for as long as you have targets and/or ammo. Although it’s generally important in any mission keeping your formation tight and not over-extending is crucial in Lost missions where it’s possible to get swamped by unexpected pods.

Melee works in a pinch but note that it will not trigger the headshot free action so save that for when your ranger has run out of ammo/actions otherwise and won’t be left too exposed. Explosives can be helpful for dealing with large mobs but keep in mind that they similarly do not trigger the free action and that the sound will draw more Lost. Use them only as a last resort if you’re already close to your objective or if there are also Advent troops to soak up their attention.

When chaining Lost headshots be sure to take note of their health pools: Regular Lost have 2-4 health and thus can be one-shot by most of your troops without too much problem but the Brutes have a larger health pool that often takes two shots so don’t accidentally end your turn early by failing to finish the job if you don’t have an ally to help mop up. Once your squad is securely at the evac zone within reason you can stick around an extra round or two to mop up XP from endless Lost waves but don’t get cocky.

Manage fatigue

In addition to worrying about your soldiers’ physical health and ensuring you always have enough in active rotation War of the Chosen now adds their mental health to your concerns. Soldiers can be “tired” after missions even if they were not physically injured. As long as they are otherwise in good health you can always bring tired soldiers along on missions but it gives them a much better chance of developing negative personality quirks that can become a real headache for you down the road. These include phobias of particular aliens causing them to sometimes panic at the sight of sectoids or mutons for instance or compulsions that might cause them to act out of turn like an obsessive-compulsive need to keep their ammo topped off or a paranoia that leads them to hunker down sometimes on their second action.

This can be utterly devastating in later game missions where every action counts. You can mitigate this by avoiding bringing tired units along if you can. Sometimes you need to bring a sleepy soldier along for a crucial mission however and even fully rested troops can develop neuroses. When that happens it’s worthwhile to stick them in the infirmary for a few days Darkest Dungeon-style to purge the negative trait.

Believe in the power of friendship

Your soldiers can now form relationships from fighting alongside one another called Bonds. Every member of your team has a compatibility rating with every other. Sending them out on missions together causes their Cohesion meter to fill the rate at which it does depending on how compatible the soldiers are.

In addition to just going on missions together soldiers grow closer by doing things like reviving one another from debilitating mental states or surviving when the rest of the squad is wiped. Bonds lets them do things like lend their actions to one another once or twice per mission reduce the time spent on covert actions together or eventually take simultaneous attack actions. Level one bonds can be established instantly as soon as both soldiers’ cohesion meters are full but advancing the bond to levels two and three requires both soldiers to spend several days in the Training Center so you’re going to want to have that up and running by the mid-game.

Note that bonds are monogamous and “’til death do us part” so don’t lock in those level one bonds if you are hoping to pair them off differently.

Maximize your AP

Rather than unlocking new abilities once per level your soldiers now purchase them with a system of earned ability points. In practice this works out the same in that you still pick one of several potential skills at each new tier but now you can also go back and spend points on abilities from previous tiers as well fundamentally changing the need to specialize your soldiers. Furthermore where building the advanced warfare center in the base game gave you a chance for each unit to pick up one random off-class ability now you have a selection at random levels available for buying with points opening up even more customization options.

Every soldier has an individual AP count earned through experience which scales to a new stat called “Combat Intelligence” but there is now also a shared XCOM pool that can be spent on any character. These shared points are earned through several in-mission actions. Your soldiers taking shots from high ground from a flanking position or from concealment all have a chance to grant a single point to the shared pool which increases in likelihood with higher combat intelligence.

Taking out the chosen during a mission will also net you five points for the organization. We recommend holding onto these for a little bit until you have a stand-out squad in which you are ready to start investing.

A Priest a Purifier and a Spectre walk into bar

Beyond the chosen Advent has also introduced a few new types of minions to complicate your missions. The priest is primarily a support class similar to sectoids in that they like to hang back and manipulate the battle with psychic powers such as mind controlling freezing your troops and buffing their allies. Prioritize taking out priests early to make it easier for you to take down their allies — they’re not too tough so it shouldn’t be hard if you get the drop on them.

Purifiers wield flamethrowers to blast out arcs of flame that seem particularly well suited for taking on hordes of Lost. The most important thing to note is that they explode on death so don’t finish them off with melee attacks unless your rangers are expendable.

Spectres are a highly mobile pain in your butt that look like lithe humanoids but are actually an amorphous cloud of nanobots. Their most obnoxious ability is called Shadowbound which instantly knocks out one of your soldiers at melee range and then creates a shadow clone of them for you to fight. You can revive them either by killing the clone or the Spectre itself which will also take the clone down with it. You can also bring them back while both Spectre and clone are still up if you have a Specialist who can Revive.

Resistance faction classes

Countering the new threats of the Chosen are your three new resistance faction allies: The Reapers Skirmishers and Templars. All three of them are extremely powerful so you will want to make sure that they are all recruited as early as possible.

During your first playthrough of the expansion with its narrative missions that introduce the new content you will get hooked up with the Reapers early on have to rescue Skirmisher Mox and then locate the Templars in order to recruit them. During subsequent plays you can start with any of the special faction soldiers in your ranks. Covert actions in the resistance ring will let you contact the other two factions which will give you one of their powerful soldiers.

While it’s possible to recruit additional faction soldiers later in the game through covert actions but these are rare and require very high influence with the faction in question. Accordingly you will want to treat these soldiers like precious resources breaking them out to tip the scales on crucial missions especially when their rival Chosen is likely to be involved but don’t throw them around like any regular recruit since they are highly useful and hard to replace.

Reaper

Step aside rangers because the reaper is the best stealth unit in the game bar none. In addition to being faster and being able to get substantially closer to oblivious enemies taking actions that would normally break stealth now only provoke a chance to do so allowing your reapers to scout and flank from the shadows for potentially the entire mission if you build them for it.

Pairing this aggressive mobility with a sniper rifle makes them a great counterpoint to the sharpshooter who tends to hang back from the squad providing a lot of coverage if you use both. Although their damage output isn’t ever quite as high as a comparably leveled ranger or sharpshooter the added versatility of their stealth plus their ability to take sniper shots on the second action more than make up for it.

Stealth skills do what you would expect enhancing the reaper’s ability to maintain and go back into concealment while being increasingly aggressive the more you invest.

Saboteur skills enhance the reaper’s destructive capability as a stealthy grenadier-lite buffing their claymore mine and letting them carry an extra.

Marksman enhances the reaper’s sniping capabilities substantially increasing the amount of damage they can put out.

Let reapers lead the charge and scout ahead whenever they’re on a mission since they are least likely to kick up trouble from an unexpected Advent pod. Within reason you should be aggressively positioning your reaper to get maximum information and provide flanking cover that other classes couldn’t.

Skirmisher

Once the genetically engineered puppets of Advent the Skirmishers have thrown off their shackles and accordingly have a lot of anger to work out with Advent. Highly mobile and able to take as many shots as they have actions skirmisher units excel at flanking and adapting to unexpected situations. Their grapple lets them zip around the level particularly to high ground without using an action making them perfect for swooping behind a troublesome enemy and chewing them up quickly.

Hussar skills are the core of why skirmishers can do so much on a single turn. Extra actions can be extremely powerful in the right circumstance so both Reflex and Combat Presence are clutch skills.

Judge primarily enhances your Ripjack melee attacks.

Tactician offers a grab bag of skills to complement both reactive and damage-focused builds.

Because firing their bullpup rifle does not end their turn skirmishers are particularly good at taking advantage of additional actions which can come from their own abilities (such as Reflex) or from other soldiers through combat presence soldier bonds etc.

Templar

If you always wanted to mod Protoss Zealots from Starcraft into XCOM templars are for you. They wield two wrist-mounted blades of psionic energy and cause havoc up close. The templar might be the most nuanced of the three new classes to use because of their unique Focus mechanic. Killing enemies with their primary Rend attack gains them one point of focus up to a maximum of two (or three if you choose the Deep Focus ability when reach Captain rank).

Focus increases your stats overall but also lets you use certain special abilities. Ghost for example costs two Focus and allows you to create a duplicate of a Templar from the body of a fallen human.

Psiblade skills enhance the Templar’s melee powerful capabilities and taking these skills straight down the line is a solid straight-forward build.

The Dynamo tree makes the Templar the closest XCOM has to a straight-up spellcaster giving him or her support abilities that let you spend focus to manipulate the battlefield.

Sage is another support and focus ability tree allowing you to stun and mark enemies as well as gain Focus from various other actions.

Templar are great in a lot of situations but are not especially well suited to dealing with the Lost as their primary Rend attack does not trigger the headshot free action benefit that most units get.

New facilities in War of the Chosen

Resistance Ring

The most crucial new facility which you will want to build as soon as possible lets you coordinate covert actions with the three resistance factions. Send your soldiers away for several days in exchange for a whole plethora of rewards like equipment intel and recruits (eventually including the more special resistance class soldiers) in addition to experience for the soldiers involved. Most importantly this is how you track down the Chosen in a series of three missions with each faction to track down their respective rival’s lair unlocking the mission to kill them once and for all. This also nets you influence with the faction unlocking new resistance orders and slots for you on subsequent months.

Infirmary

This assumes half of the advanced warfare center’s functionality because staffing it with an engineer increases the healing rate of your injured fighters. You can also place your soldiers here for several days to eliminate any adverse characteristics they have procured much like the Sanitarium in Darkest Dungeon. Adding the Hypervital Module allows you to return hurt soldiers back to total wellness only for an individual mission reverting to their former state immediately following. However you can only do this one time per game per fighter. This is a medium priority to develop but grows more critical in Ironman mode or if you’re concentrating on generating a more modest elite unit rather than a broad rotating character lineup.

Training Center

Elaborating on the advanced warfare center’s ability to provide your warriors with premium talents from other classes the training center employs War of the Chosen‘s new method of personal and shared skill points to purchase upgrades from any level in the course including a random assortment of out-of-class powers.

You can also remove fighters from their duty for a few days to retrain their skills rather than acquiring new ones which will refund their personal AP (but not any XCOM AP) you used on them. This is also where you prepare soldiers to raise their bonds beyond the primary level because it takes a while before your warriors move to level two bonds. And it doesn’t necessarily merit investing loads of points in extra abilities until you have a more refined crew which is a lower priority build. Still we know you will want it by the time you reach mid-game.

He was 80 years old and died peacefully in his sleep of natural causes.

Marty was born and raised in Brooklyn New York and received his bachelor’s degree in engineering from Manhattan College. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1963 to 1966 principally aboard the destroyer U.S.S. Farragut and achieved the rank of Lieutenant. He holds a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from The Ohio State University as well as a master’s in Computer Science from Boston University.

It was at Ohio State that Marty met Frances Chmura a graduate student in nursing from Parma Ohio and the two were married in 1968. A few years later the family moved to Davis Road in Hudson where Marty lived for four decades and raised four children. Marty enjoyed exploring his interests with his children in tow visiting museums battleships historic trains and forts and tromping through the New England woods. He had a long career as an electrical engineer at GTE and its successor General Dynamics.

In his retirement Marty enjoyed traveling with his family -- cruising the Rhine and Danube with his brother touring Civil War battlefields with his daughter embarking upon an Alaskan adventure with his sons and extended family visiting the family bungalow in Breezy Point NY and taking many road trips to see relatives throughout the country. He preferred driving on “scenic” back roads so he could stop to read every single historical marker a trait he passed on to his children.

Marty was a dedicated husband and father and a valued member of the community devoting many hours to volunteering with the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts St. Michael’s Parish the St. Vincent de Paul Society the Hudson Conservation Commission the Organization for the Assabet Sudbury and Concord Rivers and other groups. He was especially proud of his work cleaning up the Assabet River protecting wetlands from development and managing the books for St. Vincent de Paul. Though he moved to Brookline in 2019 to be closer to family his heart always remained in Hudson.

Marty was preceded in death by his wife Frances (Chmura) Moran and is survived by daughter Barbara Moran and husband Brian Collins of Brookline; daughter Patricia Moran and husband Andy McIlvaine of Cambridge; son Thomas Moran and partner Amanda Hatton of Fairbanks Alaska; and son Martin Moran IV and partner Molly Reid of Gettysburg Pennsylvania. He also leaves three grandchildren -- Finn and Hugh Collins of Brookline and Caroline McIlvaine of Cambridge -- and is survived by three siblings: Hugh Moran of Hoffman Estates Illinois; Mary Moran of Brookline Mass.; and Alice McGovern of Portland Oregon.

A funeral mass will be celebrated on Friday March 26 2021 at 11:00 a.m. at Saint Michael’s Church in Hudson. Burial with military honors will follow in Forestvale Cemetery Hudson. Calling hours will be held on Thursday March 25 from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. at the Tighe-Hamilton Funeral Home at 50 Central St. Hudson.

Anyone who wishes to make a donation in Marty’s name can contribute to the St. Vincent de Paul Society of St. Michael Parish or the OARS for the Assabet Sudbury and Concord Rivers at OARS3rivers.org",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvdXMtbWlsaXRhcnlzLW5ldy1ncmVuYWRlLWxhdW5jaGVyLWNob2ljZS1tay00Ny0xODA3NznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The U.S. Military's New Grenade Launcher of Choice: The Mk 47,"Designed to remedy the Mk 19’s high weight the Mk 47 is chambered in the same 40mm grenade ammunition as the previous Mk 19 though it can also fire airburst ammunition useful against entrenched positions or targets behind walls.

Here's What You Need to Know: Though used primarily by the United States military the Mk 47 has not seen widespread use and is in service mostly with U.S. Special Operations Command Units.

The Mk 19 grenade launcher has been a mainstay of American operations since its introduction in the late 1960s during the Vietnam War. The weapon is still prized for its ability to fire high numbers of 40-millimeter grenades accurately out to a distance of 1500 meters or nearly 5000 feet.

The 40mm round packs quite a punch too. According to the U.S. Army the 40mm grenade used with the Mk 19 grenade launcher system can punch through three inches of steel and is best used against dismounted infantry and lightly armored vehicles though the weapon could also in theory be used against some armored personnel carriers.

While the Mk 19 has low recoil one of its shortcomings is weight. Without ammunition or any accessories the Mk19 weighs over seventy-seven pounds or about thirty-five kilograms. Ammunition canisters are likewise quite heavy. Altogether the Mk19’s weight is nearly prohibitively heavy for use by dismounted infantry leaving the Mk19 most commonly used on vehicle mounts.

Though still in widespread use today among the United States military as well as a number of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries it wasn’t the first grenade launcher used in service with the United States.

Early Launchers

The earlier Mk 18 used the same 40mm grenade as the Mk 19 though the design was hand-cranked somewhat like the much earlier multi-barreled Gatling gun design.

The design was relatively light-weight though firing with a hand-powered crank rather than a butterfly-style trigger reduced the weapon’s accuracy. The Mk 18 was often used in fixed positions during Vietnam like bases or on vehicle mounts.

Along with the Mk 18 an odd hybrid machine gun grenade launcher was built and experimented with the XM174. This odd-looking launcher used a twelve-round canister and appeared to use parts of the single-shot M79 grenade launcher as well as the M1919 machine-gun.

All platforms aside there is now something better that you may have never heard of: the Mk 47.

Mk 47

In order to remedy the Mk 19’s high weight General Dynamics developed the Mk 47. The grenade launcher is chambered in the same 40mm grenade ammunition as the previous Mk 19 though it can also fire airburst ammunition useful against entrenched positions or targets behind walls.

By far the biggest benefit the Mk 47 offers over the Mk 19 is its significantly lower weight. Incredibly the large grenade launcher weighs just under forty pounds or about eighteen kilos making the weapon system much easier for grunts to hump around.

General Dynamics’ Mk 47 uses a Lightweight Video Sight that allows operators to engage targets during the day and at night when used in tandem with a thermal imaging sight.

Though used primarily by the United States military the Mk 47 has not seen widespread use and is in service mostly with U.S. Special Operations Command Units.

Last month US Air Force Chief Gen. Charles Brown said that the service was having a second thought on the earlier plan of replacing the sturdy F-16 fighters with the fifth-generation Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter jets.

While the F-35 is a highly sought-after aircraft across the world the fighter jet’s huge operating cost coupled with the history of problems may have forced the US to look at other alternatives.

“The Air Force will consider a ‘clean-sheet design’ for a new ‘four-and-a-half-gen or fifth-gen-minus’ fighter as a direct replacement for the F-16s currently in service” said Brown adding the service has already launched a study to look at possible alternatives.

While the study is expected to be finished by 2023 an aviation magazine Hush-Kit invited some experts to design the potential replacement for the F-16.

The magazine teamed up with aviation experts such as Stephen Mcparlin and James Smith who helped develop aircraft such as the Lockheed F-35 Lightning II and Eurofighter Typhoon and illustrator Andy Godfrey from the Teasel Studio.

What’s Wrong With F-16s?

Originally developed by General Dynamics the single-engine supersonic all-weather multirole F-16 fighter jet has remained the backbone of the US Air Force ever since its first flight in 1974.

However the USAF is now struggling to maintain an aging fleet of fighters and there is a need for a more advanced aircraft to provide support to the F-35 and F-22 Raptors.

According to Brown the new fighter jet should be an affordable lightweight one that doesn’t necessarily have advanced stealth features and hence a ‘fifth-gen-minus’ design.

Keeping all parameters in mind Hush-Kit and the team of experts designed a new fighter jet calling it ‘F-36 Kingsnake’.

The ‘F-36 Kingsnake’

Like the F-16 the F-36 Kingsnake would be a multi-role fighter jet capable of carrying out air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.

According to reports the new design has made provisions for missiles and guided bombs that could be carried in internal bays. The weapons that may be integrated include new generation long-range air-to-air missiles.

The F-36 fighter would also be equipped with a gun making it capable of strafing attacks against enemy forces on the ground.

It is believed the concept aircraft would use the F-22 Raptor’s F119 afterburning turbofan engine to attain a top speed of Mach 2. The fighter would be equipped with AN/APG-83 advanced electronically scanned array radar the same one used on the latest version of the F-16 fighter jet.

According to Hush-Kit the F-36 fighter jets’ wings are based on the wings of the F-16XL with the cranked arrow having an inboard section of increased sweepback.

The new fighter jet’s wing makes it efficient at high speeds enabling it to be faster than the F-35 stealth fighter jet. Moreover the design of the wing allows sufficient space for fuel and external hardpoints.

Bigger wings also provide instantaneous turn rate. The fighter is expected to have high energy maneuverability with low wave drag and a good thrust-to-weight ratio.

In a news conference last month reported by Air Force Magazine Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown said he wants a lighter less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft in numbers so he can save his advanced but notoriously unreliable F-35s for the kinds of battles they’re best suited for. “I want to moderate how much we’re using those aircraft” he said. “You don’t drive your Ferrari to work every day you only drive it on Sundays. This is our ‘high end’ [fighter] we want to make sure we don’t use it all for the low-end fight … We don’t want to burn up capability now and wish we had it later.”

Students of history might remember that the F-35 was originally intended to be the Swiss army knife replacement for all the 1970s hardware that still forms the backbone of the Air Force. But at $100 million a copy and packed with buggy systems that are magic when they work Brown said the Air Force finds itself needing a somewhat lower tech fighter for the trenches to take some pressure off the fifth-generation Lightning II. He said he doesn’t want yet another update on the F-16 but a new “fourth-and-a half/fifth-gen minus” platform. “Actually I want to build something new and different that’s not the F-16; that has some of those capabilities but gets there faster using our digital approach.” The new fighter will be part of a study he launched to establish tactical aviation requirements but he’s clear on one point. The Air Force fleet averages 28 years old he said and “that’s not going to compete well with adversaries. That’s why this force mix study is so important: to bring down the average age to have something relevant not just today but well into the future.”"

The S&P 500 pulled back from all-time highs this past week on investor concerns about rising interest rates and inflation.

On Wednesday the Federal Reserve announced it is maintaining its target interest rate range of between zero and 0.25% and reassured investors that inflation “continues to run below 2%.” However the Fed also increased its full-year 2021 PCE inflation projection from 1.8% to 2.4% prompting 10-year Treasury yields to rise above 1.7% for the first time since January 2020.

Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. bank Wednesday to offer a select group of its wealthiest most risk-tolerant clients access to Bitcoin funds. Bitcoin prices hit $60000 for the first time last weekend but pulled back to around $58500 to close out the week.

On Tuesday Uber announced it will be reclassifying all of its U.K. drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. The change came after Uber lost a legal battle in the U.K. over driver classifications and the company is currently fighting a similar battle in the state of California.

Both accusers said that Dom was sexually inappropriate towards them.

The first accuser is TikTok user ‘whoaannellyy’ who said that she had to hide in the bathroom and pretend to throw up to avoid having sex with “creepy” Durte Dom.

Meanwhile another TikToker called ‘notkaiamarie’ alleged in her post that Dom invited her and roommate over to his apartment.

Claiming that he gave her “r*pey vibes” she says in the video that he asked her to buy him a Subway sandwich after she refused to sleep with him.

These claims come after Durte Dom was accused of sexual assault from an occasion in 2018 during a Vlog Squad shoot where the accuser said that they were “too incapacitated” to consent to sexual activity.

Earlier this month Dom released a YouTube addressing the sexual assault accusations wagered against David by Seth Francois. Saying that Seth was “a good friend of [his] to this day he said in the video which is entitled ‘Addressing the Drama’ that David “needs to deal with” the situation with Seth.

Called ""Full Self-Driving"" or FSD it's been available to a small select group of Tesla owners since October but CEO Elon Musk promised widespread access starting last week. Then he pushed out the wider release a few more days and now it's the weekend and Tesla drivers are still waiting. The latest news from Musk: FSD access is expected next month.

Even if Tesla drivers don't have access to a more adept version of Autopilot that can autosteer stop at stop signs and accelerate on smaller city streets the original automated assistance system is still available for anyone who bought the extra feature. While Tesla has offered Autopilot since 2014 competitors have cropped up like General Motors' Super Cruise hands-free driver assistance feature in 2017.

Last year General Motors rolled out an updated version of Super Cruise now available on the newest Cadillac Escalade. The ""enhanced"" Super Cruise will also be an option on the upcoming Chevy Bolt EUV this summer.

Both Super Cruise and Autopilot don't claim to be autonomous driving since you have to still pay attention and be ready to take over but there are many similar automated driving features available.

Let's look at what makes the two systems different.

Hands or no hands?

Tesla's Autopilot gives you 30 seconds with hands off the wheel before it starts visibly and then audibly warning you to take hold of the wheel. Once FSD arrives the automated driving won't require constant contact. Here's a FSD ride with the driver's hands on his lap:

Super Cruise on the other hand was designed to be used as a hands-free experience. A driver attention camera on the steering wheel notices if you look away for too long stare down at your cellphone or close your eyes. It works even if you're wearing sunglasses.

If you stop paying attention the system will alert you with a flashing green light on the steering wheel. Eventually it turns red before a voice alert commands you to take over steering.

Where does it work?

Autopilot works best on the highway but it can be enabled on any major thoroughfare. FSD will add city driving and work on smaller streets.

What makes it work?

Tesla's Autopilot relies on a lot of cameras eight of them to be exact. There's also 12 ultrasonic sensors and a forward-facing radar.

For Super Cruise there's the infrared camera inside the car to make sure the driver isn't distracted but there are also cameras and sensors placed around the car. The car knows details about the road from LiDAR mapping.

How to turn it on?

In Teslas just push down twice on the right gear stalk to activate Autopilot. Then a symbol will appear on the screen denoting that the feature is engaged.

For Super Cruise there's a button on the bottom left side of the steering wheel. A symbol also appears on the screen along with the illuminated steering wheel light bar. Once the wheel is solid green you can let go.

So what does it do?

On Autopilot the car drives you forward and keeps up with the pace of surrounding traffic. Autosteering keeps the car in the lane.

Like the name suggests Super Cruise automatically accelerates to keep up with your set speed. It also steers for you to keep you in the lane. You can use Super Cruise without auto-steering and it will keep the car driving at a certain pace but you have to keep your hands on the wheel. For that mode the steering wheel turns blue.

What else can it do?

FSD mode adds onto Autopilot's autosteering and automatic cruise control. With FSD the biggest upgrade is called ""Navigate on Autopilot"" that will automatically change lanes if you're behind a slower driver and move you over to exit the freeway.

There's also self-parking stop sign and traffic signal recognition and access to Autopilot on smaller city streets. But again this is only available with FSD.

Super Cruise's enhanced version can automatically change lanes. When you turn on your blinker the car will assess the situation and once it decides it's safe it'll get over. You then turn the turn signal off and carry on.

What do celebrities think?

Actor Jamie Foxx took a Tesla out for a drive last year and was frustrated that he couldn't keep his hands off the wheel when using Autopilot. Catch the Autopilot moment around the 8:40-minute mark:

This week GM gave the Jonas Brothers (well two of them) Tiffany Haddish Sofia Vergara Joe Manganiello and tWitch and Allison Boss a chance to try Super Cruise. Most of the excitement came from the hands-free experience. One celeb tester even ate a cookie while the car drove along.

So how much is all this?

Currently all Teslas now come with basic Autopilot features. But if you want access to the full automated package with FSD that's $10000 extra. (And unless you're part of the lucky beta testing group you still have to wait until it's actually available.) There's also a subscription plan in the works if you don't want lifelong FSD access.

GM is offering Super Cruise for free for the first three years then it'll be $25 per month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3Mvc2ltcGxlLWlkZWF0aW9uLXNrZXRjaC1vci1haGVhZC1vZi1pdHMtdGltZS10ZWFzZXItZm9yLWV2LWx1eHVyeS1zZWRhbi1mcm9tLWdtLTE1NzkwNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simple Ideation Sketch or Ahead-of-Its-Time Teaser for EV Luxury Sedan From GM?,"General Motors has pledged to fully transform itself from a traditional ICE automaker into a sustainable company that will even achieve total carbon neutrality come 2040. But first it has to unleash a barrage of zero-emission models upon the world.

Naturally one can imagine the company has plans to deliver a luxurious battery-powered sedan sooner or later. It would be logical since Tesla has been churning out countless examples of the Model S over the years and just about every small or big startup (such as Lucid Motors with the Air) is thinking about joining the party.Now we have no idea if General Motors has decided to allow us a glimpse into the future similar to Volkswagen’s Project Trinity or not but here’s a stylish sedan sketch to keep us company while waiting for more EVs to join the roster alongside the 2022 Bolts.Of course this could be just an ideation sketch  even though GM Design’s official Instagram account claims these renders are “showing how easily a strong volume statement can translate closer to production.” Intriguing words right?Well anyway even if nothing pans out from this official post we’re still very much interested in seeing what this social media account has to show us next. After all since we’re dealing with an official venue we’re basically getting a peek inside the imagination of the people tasked with literally sculpting the automaker’s designs.As far as these sketches are concerned credited to car designer Kevin Nougarede we think this electric sedan would best be suited to a Lucid Air comparison if it ever turns into a real car. That is also why our photo gallery also includes official images of the California-based company’s Dream Edition.Here's hoping that GM has plans to bring out something that’s also capable of delivering more than 1000 horsepower and still travel for 465 miles (almost 750 km) on a single charge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2dtLWtlZXBzLXRydWNraW5nLWV2ZW4tbWlzc2luZy1wYXJ0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM missing parts keeps on trucking,"Building the pickups without the module is expected to be a temporary fix only affecting the remaining 2021 models but GM said the modules cannot be added to those vehicles later. Instead GM plans to credit affected customers $50.

The decision could signal that GM sees an end to the shortage said Stephanie Brinley principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. GM is unlikely to build the pickups without the fuel management modules for the 2022 or 2023 model years she said.

""They might be at the point where … if they do this they can get through"" the rest of the model year she said.

GM spokeswoman Michelle Malcho told Reuters that GM's move would not have a major effect on the automaker's U.S. corporate average fuel economy numbers.

According to the EPA the lack of modules does not affect the pickups' emissions of nitrogen oxides or hydrocarbons. GM has promised to account for the difference in greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy in compliance reporting the agency said. The EPA also plans to conduct follow-up testing.

Ford last week said it would build some F-150 pickups and Edge crossovers without certain electronic modules because of the semiconductor shortage and February's severe winter weather. But instead of selling them to consumers that way the automaker will hold the vehicles until the missing modules are available and can be installed.

The needed parts support basic functions such as windshield wiper motors and infotainment features Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said.

Ford's move matches the pattern of other automakers in the wake of previous supply disruptions said Kristin Dziczek vice president of industry labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor Mich. In the past automakers have made vehicles with missing parts parked them put the parts on later and then shipped them to dealerships as GM plans to do with some other models.

Its strategy of modifying the vehicle to permanently go without a part and altering the fuel economy she said is ""really unusual.""

""It points out how semiconductors are a strategic supply"" and highlights the need for automakers to have more strategic relationships with chip suppliers Dziczek said.

Automakers in similar situations also will make decisions to preserve profitability and meet vehicle demand but GM's move was an extreme solution Brinley said.

""It strikes me as a difficult decision to keep the pickup trucks moving"" she said. ""I don't feel like this is a harbinger of what everyone will do going forward."""

Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects 2.3 million people globally with 1 million in the US alone. It occurs when our immune system attacks the myelin sheath a fatty substance that insulates our nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. The demyelination affects quick and effective neuronal communication thereby disabling the central nervous system. Vision problems muscle weakness numb sensations and cognitive issues are some of the common symptoms.

Relapse is often the most significant challenge with Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) being the predominant form Other forms include primary progressive MS (PPMS) secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) that denote patients who exhibit MS-like symptoms but isn’t diagnosed yet.

A New Entrant in an Already Crowded Market

On March 19th the USFDA approved yet another MS drug—Janssen’s Ponvory (ponesimod). The oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator received the agency’s nod for treating relapsing forms of the disease RRMS SPMS and CIS. Ponvory has now entered a market crowded with pharma giants namely Novartis Biogen Roche Bayer Pfizer Merck Sanofi Teva and GSK (See Table 1 & 2).

Table 1: FDA approved MS drugs since 2010

Table 2: FDA approved MS drugs on or before 2010

“Every person with multiple sclerosis is affected differently given variability in both the underlying disease and emerging symptoms. Continued innovation in this space is critical and we’re committed to meeting patients’ evolving healthcare needs” said Mathai Mammen M.D. Ph.D. Global Head Janssen Research & Development Johnson & Johnson. “We are proud to offer PONVORY as a valuable new option for people with MS that may help them gain better control of their disease.”

Strong Trial Data Surpassing Established Therapy

The FDA approval is an outcome of positive results for Ponvory which was pitted against Sanofi’s billion-dollar drug Aubagio (teriflunomide) in Phase 3 OPTIMUM trial comprising of 1133 participants. Superior showing in annualized relapse rate (ARR) a measure of the average number of relapses that trial patients experience in a year was the primary endpoint.

Results from the two-year study period showed that 20mg of Ponvory significantly reduced annual relapses by 30.5% as compared to 14mg of Aubagio. Besides 71% of patients treated with Ponvory had no confirmed relapses as opposed to Aubagio’s 63%. Ponvory also delayed disability progression and registered benefits over Aubagio in standard assessments of MS pathology and disease burden as measured by MRI scanning of the brain and spinal cord. The drug was well-tolerated over multiple clinical studies spanning more than 10 years. Upper respiratory infection hepatic transaminase elevation and hypertension were some commonly observed side effects.

“In the pivotal study ponesimod demonstrated superior clinical efficacy in reducing annual relapses and MRI activity compared against teriflunomide another oral MS therapy. Those results combined with a favorable side effect profile make ponesimod a useful treatment option for people with relapsing MS” said Robert J. Fox M.D. Staff Neurologist at Cleveland Clinic and member of the ponesimod Advisory Board.

Ponvory is the first and only FDA-approved oral disease modifying therapy studied in a head-to-head trial against an established oral comparator drug Janssen said in a statement.

Dozens of large businesses — from McDonald's and Chick-fil-A to a local DMV and car wash — couldn't accept credit card payments one afternoon in February — creating a flurry of confusion and frustrated customers.

The problem which only lasted a few hours can be traced to a backend system operated by just four companies that underpins much of the payments ecosystem. Most consumers know little to nothing about it.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

When customers slip their debit or credit cards into a machine at a business a little phrase pops up: ""authorizing payment."" Those two words reference an elaborate system that allows the multi-billion dollar payments processing industry to approve the charge for the customer.

It sounds simple but each processor — the companies that handle every card payment by communicating between the merchant and customer's respective banks — must use an elaborate system of backups to keep the consumer economy running each day preventing an outage that would leave many merchants scrambling to not lose sales from consumers who increasingly don't carry cash.

On top of that they're pounded by hacking attempts from criminals wanting to steal payment information meaning their cybersecurity must be top notch.

But in their most simplistic form ""you can think of them as being these huge data center-based companies that are processing billions upon billions of transactions 24/7 365"" said Lisa Ellis an analyst at MoffettNathanson.

On Feb. 26 when Fiserv one of those payments processors had an internet outage merchants across the US couldn't take electronic transactions until the issue resolved. The company services to a majority of fast-food restaurants which explains why Chick-fil-A McDonald's and Popeye's were some of the businesses affected that day.

Fiserv alongside FIS Global Payments and JPMorgan Chase account for about 80% to 90% of the payments processing industry in the US according to MoffetNathanson. That means each time you swipe your card there's about a 90% chance one of those businesses is responsible approving the payment.

A case of an ""outage"" in which many merchants can't process card payments is extremely rare according to Ellis and Robert Le an analyst at PitchBook. That's because the processors have backups for every single part of the process.

""The IT infrastructure of any large company has a whole backup plan to it"" Ellis said. It's ""a business continuity plan that says 'OK what's the redundancy that's built in here in case something goes down?'""

Payments processors have backup internet providers and backup data centers that process payments in case one data center goes down. If a card is taking longer than normal to authorize it might be because the payment is being routed to a data center farther away.

A spokesperson for FIS told Insider the company has heavily invested in its infrastructure ""to minimize the likelihood and impact of an outage."" It regularly tests backups like its ""auto failover"" that allows payments to move between data centers as needed they said.

Global Payments didn't respond to Insider's request for comment and a representative from JPMorgan Chase declined to discuss company operations and cybersecurity measures.

As for Fiserv which had the issues in February a company spokesperson said: ""Redundancy and resiliency are built into our solutions."" That includes multiple internet service providers and data center backups across the country they said.

In February despite the hours-long wait many merchants had in being able to once again accept digital payments Cave said Fiserv's internet backups worked as intended. She added that ""the initial internet service provider outage created a secondary impact for some clients.""

A widespread long-term outage at a payments processor is ""very rare"" Le the Pitchbook analyst said.

So rare in fact that when Visa a payments provider that works with the processors had an outage in Europe in September 2018 people thought it might have been a terrorist attack Ellis said. More than 5 million transactions failed over the 10-hour outage because of a rare data center malfunction Finextra reported at the time.

""People were freaking out"" Ellis said ""because it's so unusual.""

Though the Visa outage was a data malfunction payments processors and others in the network must be on top of cybersecurity to prevent service problems related to a hacking. They're ""bombarded constantly with cybersecurity attacking attempts"" because criminals are wanting to get payment information Ellis said.

""Aside from military agencies and stuff like that they've got to be some of the most attacked networks in the world because they contain payment information"" she said.

Outages though rare likely affect merchants the most considering the lost sales and damage to the brand reputation with customers according to Le.

""Consumers nowadays don't carry any cash"" Ellis said. ""So if you were in a store buying anything of a reasonable size and you couldn't use a card most consumers would just walk out.""

Over the years cash has become less widely used as card payments have taken over. Card penetration or the number of consumers using a card instead of cash is about 60% to 70% according to Ellis but that varies across the country. In New York City for example card usage is even higher.

If there was a big outage at a payments processor in the future it could ""lead to a call to bring cash use back into the system"" Le said. But in the long-term merchants are likely to look for support from multiple payments processors instead of just relying on one he said.

Large businesses in the US usually do have multiple processors so they have a backup in case one goes down. But smaller merchants generally don't Ellis said.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic cash increasingly became a thing of the past as merchants sought to use more contactless payments to avoid exposure to the virus. And the future of payments is likely digital as Insider Intelligence predicts they will continue to grow from 2023 and beyond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc2hpbnNlZ2FlLWdyb3VwL25ld3NWaWV3L2tlZDIwMjEwMzIxMDAwN9IBMWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbmV3c0FtcC9rZWQyMDIxMDMyMTAwMDc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shinsegae mulls 100% stake in Starbucks Korea,"(Courtesy of Starbucks)

South Korea’s retail giant Shinsegae is reviewing ways to double its stake in Starbucks Korea from 50% to 100% according to an industry source on Mar. 19.Shinsegae’s affiliate E-mart currently owns 50% of Starbucks Korea while Starbucks Corporation headquartered in the US owns the other 50%.If the deal is successful Starbucks Korea would become a wholly owned subsidiary of E-mart which will receive double the dividends from the company. Starbucks Korea paid out annual dividends of 30 billion won ($26.6 million) each to E-mart and Starbucks Corporation last year.“While we are having thorough reviews on the topic internally nothing has yet been confirmed” said a Shinsegae spokesman.Starbucks Korea will still have to pay royalties at the current rate of 5% to Starbucks headquarters even if E-mart owns a 100% stake in the company.South Korea’s retail and franchise industry has been speculating for years regarding Starbucks Korea’s next steps.Many had projected that Starbucks headquarters would want to purchase E-mart’s shares to operate independently as it did in China and Japan in the last five years.In case of a successful deal between Shinsegae and Starbucks Corporation South Korea will mark the first country in Asia where Starbucks is 100%-owned by a local operator.Starbucks Korea was established as a 50:50 joint venture between E-mart and Starbucks Corporation in 1997 opened its first branch in 1999 and expanded to 1503 branches as of December last year.Starbucks Korea’s revenue now exceeds 10% of Starbucks’ total revenue generated globally but its operating margin falls behind the global average.Starbucks currently holds the highest coffee franchise market share in Korea surpassing 1 trillion won ($885 million) revenue in 2016 and maintaining more than 20% year-over-year growth rates from 2017 to 2019 at 26% 20.5% and 22.8% respectively.Last year Starbucks Korea generated 1.92 trillion won ($1.7 billion) in revenue just 80 billion short of 2 trillion won ($1.77 billion).Bo-Ra Kim at destinybr@hankyung.com Daniel Cho edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMS9tYXIvMjAvZW5nbGlzaC1zZWNvbmRhcnktc2Nob29sLWhlYWR0ZWFjaGVycy1hbW9uZy1iZXN0LXBhaWQtaW4tdGhlLXdvcmxk0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2VkdWNhdGlvbi8yMDIxL21hci8yMC9lbmdsaXNoLXNlY29uZGFyeS1zY2hvb2wtaGVhZHRlYWNoZXJzLWFtb25nLWJlc3QtcGFpZC1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,English secondary school headteachers among best paid in the world,"Headteachers in England are among the highest-paid in the world and the gap between school leader and teacher salaries is one of the widest new analysis has revealed.

A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on state secondary school heads’ salaries in 36 countries shows that top earners in England are paid more than £102000 a year with only heads in Luxembourg and Mexico receiving more. Heads in England also have one of the highest pay premiums taking home on average 136% more than secondary school teachers. The average differential across OECD countries is 49%.

Principals in English secondaries top the salary satisfaction table with 80% indicating they are happy with their remuneration.

The Education Indicators in Focus findings based on 2019 data is likely to ignite the debate around excessive pay for academy heads and the chief executives of multi-academy trusts some of whom earn far more than the levels indicated in the OECD report.

Some academy heads and CEOs are paid wholly unjustifiable sums from taxpayer funding Kevin Courtney National Education Union

It comes as teachers in England face a pay freeze this year which the government claims is necessary to avoid “deepening the disparity” between public and private sector wage rises.

England’s highest-paid headteacher of a single school is Colin Hall at Holland Park School in west London. He received between £280000 and £290000 in 2019-20 according to recently published school accounts compared with between £270000 and £280000 the year before.

Academy chain heads are also earning salaries in excess of a quarter of a million pounds.

Sir Kevin Satchwell the executive head of the Telford City Technology College Trust was paid between £290001 and £300000 in 2019-20. The trust runs Thomas Telford School and sponsors Thomas Telford Multi-Academy Trust which has five schools in the West Midlands.

Brampton Manor Trust which has two schools in east London paid its executive principal Dayo Olukoshi between £250001 and £260000 in 2019-20 up from £220000- £230000 the year before.

The top earner by far however is Sir Dan Moynihan chief executive of the Harris Federation which runs 48 primary and secondary academies. He has seen his salary increase to between £455000 and £460000 in 2019-20 – a £5000 increase on the 2018-19 salary band. A second senior staff member of the trust not named in the Harris Federation accounts received between £300001 and £310000.

National pay scales for England published at the end of last year indicate that headteachers on the top pay range can earn between £81942 and £117197 (outside London). As academies are not part of nationally set pay structures trusts are left free to set remuneration as they see fit. The latest academy accounts show that an attempt by the government to rein in excessive pay by writing to trusts with senior executives on more than £150000 a year has had little impact.

Kevin Courtney joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) said a number of academy heads and chief executives were paid “wholly unjustifiable sums”.

“Pay for school leaders in England has been deregulated for many years and now some academy heads and CEOs are paid wholly unjustifiable sums from taxpayer funding” he said. “The NEU wants a review of the system which restores objectivity and pays leaders according to the demands of the job.”

Dr Patrick Roach general secretary of NASUWT said: “School leadership is a challenging job but the excessive salaries that the leaders of some academy trusts are receiving appear difficult to justify particularly at a time when teachers are facing a freeze in their pay.

“We have repeatedly called for greater transparency on the finances of academy schools and multi-academy trusts. Millions of pounds of public money are being spent without detailed and open scrutiny.”

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said at the end of last year teachers’ pay increases would be paused this year following a 3.1% rise in 2020. However public sector workers who earn below £24000 will receive a pay rise of at least £250 in 2021. The government has committed to setting the teacher starting salary at £30000 by 2022.

A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Since expanding the academies programme we have made sure that increased autonomy is supported with increased transparency so we can take action where trusts are not following the clear rules we have laid down. This includes the requirement to publish the number of employees whose benefits including salary exceeded £100k.

“We continue to challenge high pay where it is not proportionate or directly linked to improving pupil outcomes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5kYXl3b3JsZC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RlY2gvaG93LWlyaXNoLWJyb3RoZXJzLXBhdHJpY2stYW5kLWpvaG4tY29sbGlzb25zLWZpcm0tc3RyaXBlLW1hZGUtdGhlbS10ZWNoLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcy80MDIyMDEwNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison's firm Stripe made them tech billionaires,"Tipperary brothers join global super-rich list of tech billionaires with company

Meet the tech geek brothers from Co Tipperary who currently share a combined fortune of €23 billion.

Brainboxes Patrick and John Collison are now technically Ireland's second richest people being pipped at the top for the moment by Hilary Alannah and Galen Jr Weston and family whose companies include Penneys Brown Thomas and Selfridges.

Fresh-faced Patrick (32) and John (30) still have quite a jump to make it into the top ten list of billionaires who earned their wealth from technology.

But the brothers from Dromineer about 10km from Nenagh are on cloud nine having turned Stripe an online payments processor into the most valuable private company Silicon Valley has ever produced.

Stripe is an internet payment procurer which allows companies to quickly process online payments from customers.

Handling almost 5000 transaction requests a second it takes a cut of around 1.4 per cent and a flat fee of 20c per transaction and thanks to lockdown its usage has gone off the charts.

It's a far cry from playing cops and robbers when growing up in a sleepy hamlet on the shores of Lough Derg where they lived in a remote area mostly populated by cows.

Every day they'd each check out at least two books from the local library on everything and anything which they'd devour in a night and return the next morning.

Scientific

One day Patrick selected a couple of books about the internet and computer programming - and that was that.

""Instead of using the internet I used to borrow books from the library about the internet"" he recalls. ""I read everything I could find. It was like staring through the glass to this amazing world out there but none of it was available.""

At the ages of 13 and 11 Patrick and John researched prepared and delivered a formal pitch to their parents proposing that they buy a special German satellite connection that would finally give them access to the World Wide Web.

""After that we were off down a rabbit hole"" smiles Patrick.

Meanwhile their parents both from scientific backgrounds and entrepreneurs busy with their own projects - their father ran a 24-room hotel and their mother set up a corporate training company - left them to blossom.

Suddenly every minute of their spare time was spent programming teaching themselves coding and for a bit of extra fun hacking each other's websites to reinforce the importance of cyber security.

After being ranked runner-up when he was 15 in 2004 Patrick was crowned Young Scientist of the Year in 2005 for developing a programming language and artificial intelligence system.

He managed to complete his Leaving Cert cycle in 20 days rather than over two years and enrolled in MIT in Boston at the age of 16.

John followed him to America a couple of years later and won a place in Harvard.

Together again they spent their spare time developing iPhone apps and working on a software company and dropped out of college to concentrate on Auctomatic Inc a software company that built tools for eBay which sold in 2008 for $5m when they were just 19 and 17.

Two years later having spotted a gap in the market they set up Stripe which within a couple of years was being touted by developers and investors in Silicon Valley as the company to watch.

While Patrick insists they didn't set out to build a large company just solve the problem of a lack of a global payment mechanism for internet trading companies Stripe has far exceeded all expectations.

Founded in 2010 Stripe's valuation has almost tripled in the past year surpassing anything achieved by companies such as Facebook or Uber before they went public and according to John Collison the company is now 'bigger [by payment volumes] than the entire ecommerce market' was when they started working on it.

The Collison brothers now own a company worth $95 billion which boasts former Bank of England governor Mark Carney on its board.

Nine of the 20 wealthiest people in the world are tech tycoons and here's who the Collisons will be chasing in the years to come.

The injury likely puts Jung on the shelf for six to eight weeks. A generalized timetable puts him on track to return a couple of weeks into the minor-league season. MLB.com ranked him as the 63rd best prospect in the game.

Jung 23 is not on the Rangers’ 40-man roster but he was invited to major-league camp. Generally speaking he’s believed to be closer to the majors than one might assume considering that his last game action took place in Single-A during his first professional season. The Rangers took Jung with the eighth overall pick out of Texas Tech in the 2019 draft. Jung departed Texas Tech as one of the best position players in Red Raiders history.

Even though the Rangers like what they’ve seen from Jung he was not going to be on the Opening Day roster. Still it’s an unfortunate setback for the Rangers’ consensus top prospect. He is likely to begin the 2021 season at Double-A. In the long term the Rangers are hopeful that Jung will establish himself as the third baseman of the future at Globe Life Field in Arlington.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVudGlmaWNhbWVyaWNhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90aGUtdW5iZWFyYWJsZS13aGl0ZW5lc3Mtb2YtY2xpbWF0ZS1hbnhpZXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Climate Anxiety Is an Overwhelmingly White Phenomenon,"Is it really just code for white people wishing to hold onto their way of life or to get “back to normal?”

The climate movement is ascendant and it has become common to see climate change as a social justice issue. Climate change and its effects—pandemics pollution natural disasters—are not universally or uniformly felt: the people and communities suffering most are disproportionately Black Indigenous and people of color. It is no surprise then that U.S. surveys show that these are the communities most concerned about climate change.

One year ago I published a book called A Field Guide to Climate Anxiety. Since its publication I have been struck by the fact that those responding to the concept of climate anxiety are overwhelmingly white. Indeed these climate anxiety circles are even whiter than the environmental circles I’ve been in for decades. Today a year into the pandemic after the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed and the attack on the U.S. Capitol I am deeply concerned about the racial implications of climate anxiety. If people of color are more concerned about climate change than white people why is the interest in climate anxiety so white? Is climate anxiety a form of white fragility or even racial anxiety? Put another way is climate anxiety just code for white people wishing to hold onto their way of life or get “back to normal” to the comforts of their privilege?

The white response to climate change is literally suffocating to people of color. Climate anxiety can operate like white fragility sucking up all the oxygen in the room and devoting resources toward appeasing the dominant group. As climate refugees are framed as a climate security threat will the climate-anxious recognize their role in displacing people from around the globe? Will they be able to see their own fates tied to the fates of the dispossessed? Or will they hoard resources limit the rights of the most affected and seek to save only their own deluded that this xenophobic strategy will save them? How can we make sure that climate anxiety is harnessed for climate justice?

My book has connected me to a growing community focused on the emotional dimensions of climate change. As writer Britt Wray puts it emotions like mourning anger dread and anxiety are “merely a sign of our attachment to the world.” Paradoxically though anxiety about environmental crisis can create apathy inaction and burnout. Anxiety may be a rational response to the world that climate models predict but it is unsustainable.

And climate panic can be as dangerous as it is galvanizing. Dealing with feelings of climate anxiety will require the existential tools I provided in A Field Guide to Climate Anxiety but it will also require careful attention to extremism and climate zealotry. We can’t fight climate change with more racism. Climate anxiety must be directed toward addressing the ways that racism manifests as environmental trauma and vice versa—how environmentalism manifests as racialized violence. We need to channel grief toward collective liberation.

The prospect of an unlivable future has always shaped the emotional terrain for Black and brown people whether that terrain is racism or climate change. Climate change compounds existing structures of injustice and those structures exacerbate climate change. Exhaustion anger hope—the effects of oppression and resistance are not unique to this climate moment. What is unique is that people who had been insulated from oppression are now waking up to the prospect of their own unlivable future.

It is a surprisingly short step from “chronic fear of environmental doom” as the American Psychological Association defines ecoanxiety to xenophobia and fascism. Racism is not an accidental byproduct of environmentalism; it has been a constant reference point. As I wrote about in my first book The Ecological Other early environmentalists in the U.S. were anti-immigrant eugenicists whose ideas were later adopted by Nazis to implement their “blood and soil” ideology. In a recent dramatic example the gunman of the 2019 El Paso shooting was motivated by despair about the ecological fate of the planet: “My whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn’t exist.” Intense emotions mobilize people but not always for the good of all life on this planet.

Today’s progressives espouse climate change as the “greatest existential threat of our time” a claim that ignores people who have been experiencing existential threats for much longer. Slavery colonialism ongoing police brutality—we can’t neglect history to save the future.

RESILIENCE AND RELATION AS RESISTANCE

I recently gave a college lecture about climate anxiety. One of the students e-mailed me to say she was so distressed that she’d be willing to submit to a green dictator if they would address climate change. Young people know the stakes but they are not learning how to cope with the intensity of their dread. It would be tragic and dangerous if this generation of climate advocates becomes willing to sacrifice democracy and human rights in the name of climate change.

Oppressed and marginalized people have developed traditions of resilience out of necessity. Black feminist and Indigenous leaders have painstakingly cultivated resilience over the long arc of the fight for justice. They know that protecting joy and hope is the ultimate resistance to domination. Persistence is nonnegotiable when your mental physical and reproductive health are on the line.

Instead of asking “What can I do to stop feeling so anxious?” “What can I do to save the planet?” and “What hope is there?” people with privilege can be asking “Who am I?” and “How am I connected to all of this?” The answers reveal that we are deeply interconnected with the well-being of others on this planet and that there are traditions of environmental stewardship that can be guides for where we need to go from here.

Zebulon Vermillion tossed eight innings of one-hit one-run ball while striking out four to lift No. 1 Arkansas to a 9-1 win against No. 22 Alabama on Saturday night at Baum-Walker Stadium. The Razorbacks are now 13-3 on the year stopping a three-game slide with their first SEC win of the season.

The big righty was untouchable through his first five innings of work retiring 15 of the first 16 Crimson Tide batters he faced. He did not allow a hit until the sixth inning when Alabama’s Jim Jarvis singled to right field before eventually coming around to score on a sacrifice fly.

Arkansas’ bats meanwhile came alive after a quiet day at the plate in the first game of the series. The Razorbacks broke out for 12 base knocks led by Casey Opitz and Cayden Wallace’s three-hit days.

Opitz put the Hogs ahead early launching his first home run of the year deep to right in the third inning to open a 1-0 lead. Arkansas would score runs in the fourth fifth sixth and eighth innings steadily extending its advantage throughout the ballgame.

The big blow came in the sixth. After Alabama cut its deficit to two the Razorbacks scored three in the bottom half of the inning to take control. An Opitz single his second hit of the game scored one and set the table for Cullen Smith and Jalen Battles to each drive in runs of their own.

Up 6-1 in the eighth the Hogs tacked on three more to put the game away for good. Opitz collected his third hit of the night in the inning and now has five multi-hit efforts on the year.

Vermillion meanwhile was cruising on the mound. After allowing a run in the sixth the right-hander settled down to retire six of the next seven he faced before departing the ballgame after eight innings of work.

He and reliever Zack Morris who tossed a scoreless ninth with two strikeouts combined for Arkansas’ second two-hitter of the season. The Hog pitching staff also did so against nationally ranked TCU earlier this season at the State Farm College Baseball Showdown at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas.

Sunday’s contest will decide the series. The rubber game is set for 2 p.m. at Baum-Walker Stadium and will broadcast nationally on the SEC Network.

Quote “He was a truly humble hard-working simple and a quintessential family man. He told us don’t aspire to ‘be the very best’ but rather to ‘do your best’ and to live a balanced life.” — Gagan Singh writing last year about his father whose death of COVID-19 on March 21 2020 became the first such fatality in Berkshire County

In Massachusetts the toll stands at 16498 confirmed COVID-19 deaths with an additional 334 listed as probably the result of the disease.

The Eagle’s Heather Bellow interviewed members of Singh’s family for a story last March that captured the new realities of pandemic grief.

Barred from seeing their beloved father and spouse members of this Hindu family including Rita Ghai the deceased’s wife watched on a WhatsApp video call as his remains were consigned to flame. Anup had fallen ill in early March 2020 and was first told in a March 12 visit to urgent care to take over-the-counter painkillers. On March 16 he ran a high fever and was taken to the hospital.

From BMC Singh sent a photo to family from his hospital room and seemed upbeat about his condition. Family last spoke with him March 17. The next day he was placed on a ventilator. He died at 11:11 p.m. March 21.

In a written remembrance Anup’s son Gagan Singh spoke of his father’s selflessness.

“He was a truly humble hard-working simple and a quintessential family man” he wrote. “He told us don’t aspire to ‘be the very best’ but rather to ‘do your best’ and to live a balanced life.”

He also recalled his father’s grace and sense of humor. Gagan Singh said his dad “would find humor and a spiritual acceptance in the toughest of life situations.”

As The Boston Globe reported the pandemic was shattering customs that long have defined bereavement and grief. The newspaper later interviewed members of the Pittsfield family for a story headlined “It was pure devastation.”

The story quoted from one of Anup’s text messages: “The high spirits of all of you have boosted my spirits to great heights! I do believe that very soon I will become hale & hearty to join you all in our happy family!”

But within a day as his health failed he was sedated and intubated. With death imminent someone at BMC called Samta Ghai his daughter. As The Globe reported Samta and her mother rushed to the hospital and made it to the intensive care unit clad in protective clothing. “They were trying to revive him” Samta Ghai told The Globe.

“ ‘Papa wake up wake up I’m here’ ” she recalled saying. “ ‘I’m here I love you so much.’ ”

Here is the story members of the family shared with Bellow last year about Anup Singh.

Family of first Berkshires resident to die of COVID-19 grieves the trauma of his swift death and a funeral at a distance PITTSFIELD — In the parking lot at Vong’s Thai Cuisine Anup Singh’s family stood outside their cars masked and distanced. It was as close as they could get to Singh to watch as his body was placed into a hearse across Wahconah Street at the hospital.

A group of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs created a professional-looking presentation in the company’s style. The analysts called it the “Working Conditions Survey” which polled the “self-selected” 13 analysts. The presentation circulated on social media. These analysts are assumed to be working in the investment banking division of Goldman Sachs.

There is pushback among many in the industry as investment banking analyst work is known for long-working hours in hopes of larger bonuses and a lucrative career path in the deal-making community. Investment banking is famous for its obscenely long hours. 100 hour weeks can happen. Junior banking analysts spend hours and hours working in excel spreadsheets researching financials and making pitchbooks.

Low-level employees grouse that the chief executive makes them work around the clock through the pandemic to keep up with deal flow. White-shoe investment bankers complain that they get blasted when they miss out on business.

He uses the corporate jet to travel to his mansion in the Bahamas even as he indulges in hobbies that include pricey wines kitesurfing and DJing at nightclubs — all the while demanding that his people get back to the office as the COVID pandemic subsides.

And if you’re a Goldman associate and see him having lunch at some restaurant in the Hamptons don’t make the mistake (as one poor sap did) of stopping by to say hello. He will probably chew you out because in his worldview Goldman execs are supposed to eat only what they kill.

Yes he’s hated in many parts of Goldman’s sprawling empire on Wall Street — and it doesn’t matter. Solomon is becoming a much-beloved leader with another more important constituency: his investors.

These headlines (including an amazing story in Bloomberg detailing the plane use and the lunch incident on top of The Post’s coverage of Goldman first-year analysts’ grueling 100-hour work weeks) have been making the rounds and stoking considerable schadenfreude in C-suites across Wall Street.

But the Solomon-hating hasn’t halted Goldman’s strong performance or its surging stock price.

Shares are up 132 percent over the past year compared with the 84 percent surge of banking giant JPMorgan the gold standard of Wall Street and the 62 percent spike in the S&P 500 index of big company stocks.

Only Morgan Stanley which has been on a buying binge of expansion is doing better with its stock surging 168 percent since last year.

Of course it’s hard not to make money on Wall Street in times like these. With the Fed keeping interest rates low and printing the currency at a feverish pace lower borrowing costs make it easier for Goldman to finance trades. Cheap money has led to a flood of stock and bond offerings for Goldman to underwrite.

Shares of blue-chip companies like Goldman and not-so-blue-chip ones like GameStop will go up when rates are so low because there’s no place else to park cash and earn a decent return.

Even so Solomon is quietly earning kudos for execution. The firm he inherited from the allegedly nicer Lloyd Blankfein in 2018 was profitable but over time became far less so. It fell under scrutiny for not matching its archrival Morgan Stanley in expanding into wealth and asset management.

It was slow going for Solomon at first. He was said to have considered a deal to merge with US Bancorp — a foray into commercial banking to look more like powerhouse JPM. The idea fizzled over control issues (Goldman’s market cap was lower and Solomon would have had to relinquish control.) Goldman’s stock sputtered. In 2020 things began to turn. Goldman recently announced that trading revenues hit a 10-year high last year matching those produced during the halcyon days under Blankfein just before financial-crisis regulations made it difficult to take balance-sheet risk.

Likewise investment-banking revenues hit new records; Solomon a dealmaker himself has retained Goldman’s long-held status as the go-to adviser on M&A.

“Solomon took over Goldman when it was a mess” veteran bank analyst Dick Bove recently told Lydia Moynihan of Fox Business.

“He knew exactly what he was doing and he made Goldman one of the most exciting companies in America.”

The big question on Wall Street is: Will Solomon’s mojo last? Probably. The Fed shows no signs of letting up on printing money which is usually good for banks. Unless it leads to massive inflation and higher interest rates which could crush stocks and make financing trades more costly.

Meanwhile the surging trading and I-banking revenues many bank experts believe continue to paper over blind spots in Goldman’s business model: It’s still largely a two-trick pony of investment banking and trading. It has a smallish consumer-banking division known as Marcus which five years into the experiment still loses money.

That’s why all signs are pointing to Solomon’s investment banking instincts kicking in soon. Goldman’s market value of $119 billion has now exceeded US Bancorp’s so maybe that deal is heading back on the table. Maybe it will make a run at PNC another largish bank that could give Goldman a competitive edge versus JPM and Morgan Stanley. Goldman could use its currency to buy a bunch of smaller banks or an asset manager.

One thing is certain: If Solomon keeps doing what’s he’s doing he’s going to be calling the shots for some time no matter how difficult he is to deal with.

“The fact he wants to use the company jet as his private plane — so what?” says Bove. “No one is going to get rid of the guy with the golden touch.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcmV0LmNvbS91dGFoLzIwMjEvMy8yMC8yMjI4NTY4OS9kaXZlcnNpdHktdGhlLXdvcmtmb3JjZS1oYXMtYmVjb21lLWEtbWFqb3ItZ29hbC1mb3Itc29tZS11dGFoLWVtcGxveWVycy1ibGFjay1jaGFtYmVyLWxpdmluZy1jb2xvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developing diversity in the Utah workforce a daunting task some find,"Frances James an analyst at Goldman Sachs is photographed in Salt Lake City on Wednesday March 10 2021. The Oakland California native was apprehensive about moving Utah. After living in Salt Lake City for nine months James has decided to return to the Bay Area.

SALT LAKE CITY — As a senior at University of California Berkeley Frances James was apprehensive when Goldman Sachs tapped her for a job as an analyst at the company’s offices in Utah.

She knew the move from Oakland to Salt Lake City in July would be a significant cultural shift but she wasn’t prepared for just how momentous it would be. James is Filipino and Black and identifies as Black.

“The thing I noticed first from that first day coming out of the car was that no one looked like me” James said.

Many of Utah’s largest employers are trying to bring more racial and ethnic diversity to the workforce hoping varied viewpoints will enrich companies and communities.

They’re not getting as far as they’d hoped.

Utah remains overwhelmingly white a “shock factor” that often stuns newcomers and makes it difficult for them to feel at home according to executives civic leaders and those who moved to the state for career opportunities. Civic and business leaders have joined in a push to help make all feel welcome and to retain minorities in the workplace.

The art of intentionality

“Since about 2013 (Dominion Energy) started aggressively hiring diverse candidates” according to Craig Wagstaff senior vice president of Western operations for the Virginia-based natural gas and electricity supplier in 16 states. “(As) a benchmark in 2013 about 27% of our new hires (nationwide) were diverse at that point. In 2020 that number had jumped to 50%.”

While the company’s national efforts have been successful revamping the workforce in states like Utah can be a bit more difficult due to the natural makeup of its population he said.

“One of the things we felt was important is to try to ensure that we train our hiring managers and supervisors and most of this training would focus on unconscious biases that they maybe didn’t even realize they have” he said.

He said the effort included participating in major recruiting events across the country and hiring diversity recruiting specialists to help create workforces that mirror the communities Dominion Energy serves he added.

Dominion has aligned itself with organizations like the Society of Hispanic Engineers the Society of Black Engineers and the National Society of Women Engineers. Wagstaff said the company is dedicated to providing opportunities to a broad cross section of qualified applicants any time it lists an open position.

“We encourage all of our hiring supervisors and managers that when they do have a position they’re filling to ensure they have some diversity in that pool for consideration” he said. The company also has a scholarship program geared toward minority student interns.

To help in its retention efforts the company has developed employee resource groups to give workers a way to make connections and develop a sense of belonging.

“It’s about inclusion and having more of the interaction of professional development amongst employees (because) employee inclusion is just absolutely critical for retention” Wagstaff said.

At Lehi-based Carrus — an online training provider for the allied health care industry — employing a diverse workforce is important to serve its target audience comprised primarily of people of color and women explained CEO Misty Frost.

“In order to best serve our audience and really understand exactly what it is they need and help them achieve the success that they’re looking for we really need to be very conscious about being plugged into not only what we care about in our culture but being sensitive to the culture of our learners and really supporting people where they’re at” she said.

For companies it’s incumbent they provide ongoing awareness training to create an environment that exhibits inclusivity and intentionality.

“It’s really important for leadership to continually beat the drum and they need to do it in meaningful ways by the actions they take. You can’t just talk about it once a month and (say) we care about diversity and then you don’t do anything about it” Frost said. “Are you reviewing your hiring practices how you write your job descriptions how you’re interviewing people are all the people who are interviewing sensitive to the issues?”

Casting a wide net to develop more diversity

Getting people from diverse backgrounds to take good jobs and come to the Beehive State is one thing but getting them to feel like Utah can be their new long-term home is another.

“People will move to a new state for economic opportunity. So for people of color when they get to Utah they maybe last three to four years” according to Sui Lang L. Panoke senior vice president for diversity equity and inclusion at Zions Bank. “Then they start to think ‘I don’t know if I could really build a life here raise my children start a family. If I really feel integrated into the community.’ And so we lose that (talent).”

She added that because retention is very important to businesses and their bottom lines having high rates of employee turnover can be costly not only in a financial sense but also as it relates to innovation and productivity.

“We need to get this retention thing down. That’s the piece that we struggle with. Recruitment — we’re definitely making great strides in that arena and it’s working” she said. “But it’s the retention piece (we need to work on). How do we get people to stay? People stay because of the culture. People (also) leave because of the culture.”

While some organizations foster an “amazing inclusive culture” in the local community — 15 minutes down the street people feel isolated.

“You don’t feel like you belong in that culture” Panoke said. “It has to be a business partnered with government that public-private partnership committed to driving home a culture that is really going to move the needle on retention.”

Currently 1 in 5 Utahns identifies as a minority she said. In Zions Bancorp. the proportion of minorities within the workforce is about 15%. She said the goal of the company is to reflect the makeup of the local population.

“It starts with listening learning and then leading” she said. “That’s where especially white people in the Beehive State need to start.”

Diversity equity and inclusion starts at home

Minority business leaders are echoing the sentiments of employers like Dominion and Zions about the need to focus attention on recruiting candidates from the state’s growing minority population.

The head of the Utah Black Chamber of Commerce noted that the number of African Americans in the Beehive State has jumped significantly in recent years.

“When you think about the Black population’s growth here we’ve been talking about 2% (overall) for the last six years” said James Jackson III founder of the Utah Black Chamber. Utah’s population grew steadily in the five-year period ending in 2014 he noted but the percentage of Black Utahns remained stagnant he said “and the reason why is attrition.”

Statewide 4 in 5 Utah residents are white census data show while 14.4% are Hispanic and just 1.5% are Black according to 2019 census estimates the most recent available.

Jackson said often after a few years African Americans choose to leave Utah because they don’t feel comfortable being such a huge minority at work and in the community.

Jackson said companies should make an effort to provide employees of all backgrounds the opportunity for advancement to the highest levels of their companies.

“I was speaking with a Black professional last summer who was part of a tech company. He was one of our mentors for our Leadership Pathway Program the goal of which is to increase diversity in leadership in business in government and within other organizations” Jackson said. “Ironically he ended up getting promoted to a chief technology officer position out of state. He said he would have stayed here but there were no C-suite opportunities here for him so he was shipping out.

“We have to do a better job of continuing the pipeline not only out of high school or college but from entry to midlevel from midlevel to senior level from senior level to the executive level — that pipeline has to continue.”

That includes the right mentoring and the right opportunities for the proper pay Jackson said. Those steps are something Utah could better ensure take place by appointing a statewide officer over diversity in business he said.

In the meantime Jackson’s organization has teamed up with other diverse business chambers in the state and with Salt Lake City on an initiative to help those new to Utah feel at home whether they’re looking to find a social network a place of worship or cultural events they might not otherwise learn about.

Living Color Utah still in its early stages provides an online guide and events aimed at those of different ethnicities plus LGBTQ people and transplants.

Ben Kolendar director of the city’s Department of Economic Development said it became more clear that Utah’s capital city has work to do after a corporation that was considering coming to Utah chose Atlanta instead citing Utah’s lack of diversity.

“That stung. And it started some conversations with some partners of ours and got the ball rolling on a lot of things that you see playing out now” Kolender said. “It wasn’t just that we weren’t diverse enough but also that we hear from some of our local companies that retention can be tough.”

To help Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall is hiring a chief equity officer a senior adviser that will help the city chart a path forward and her employees are working on an equity master plan.

It’s an idea that Rep. Sandra Hollins Utah’s lone Black state lawmaker welcomes.

“I think that’s that’s what we all need to be looking at doing how do we go about making this our community a better place for it and more welcoming to everyone?” Hollins said.

When Hollins moved to Utah from her home state of Louisiana roughly 30 years ago the difficulties she encountered ranged from finding a sense of community in the overwhelmingly white state to tracking down hair products for African American women.

It took about two years to adjust but Hollins found a home at Cavalry Baptist Church in Salt Lake City and in an African American women’s sorority organization and the right hair care items have become more widely available as Utah has slowly diversified.

“For newcomers it’s difficult for them and that’s what I’ve heard from a lot of people. They just feel that they there’s no way for them to fit in” Hollins said.

A significant adjustment

Before taking her job with Goldman Sachs James a Southern California native had done her research about the Beehive State’s history demographics and politics but the difference when she arrived in Utah was startling all the same.

In just the first few weeks she encountered employees at stores who were reluctant or refused to help her. Others in public stared at her hair and her Black Lives Matter T-shirt.

One worker in a Salt Lake City home improvement store refused to help James and her 15-year-old brother find a drill leading her brother to ask her “Why was that man so mean to us? Was it because we were Black?

“I’m used to it” James said. “I’ve dealt with microagressions and macroegressions and blatant racism to my face before but it really was hurtful to know that my little brother had to confront this in a new state that we had been in for three days.”

She’s met others through the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and advocated for a successful 2020 ballot measure Hollins proposed to eliminate slavery from the state constitution. The initiative’s success signaled process but James said she struggled to make sense of the voters that voted against it.

“As a Black person new to the state I thought who’s in favor of slavery?” she recalled.

Her colleagues at work are supportive and her employer is committed to increasing diversity across its ranks. It announced a $10 billion initiative to help Black women advance economically in the face of racism James noted.

But not being able to see those co-workers in person because of the pandemic makes it harder to adjust.

She’s isn’t immune to the charms of Salt Lake City’s downtown which she described as “this little blue bubble in Utah” and has enjoyed hiking snowboarding and camping in the mountains.

She’s now planning to return to her home state in part to be close to family but also because of what she’s faced in Utah.

“I could love my job I could love the area I can love the activities that I do. But if I feel like I can’t go out somewhere or if I feel like I can’t go to Zion National Park and stay in St. George because the people look at me funny when I walk in the hotel or question whether or not I’m supposed to be there ... I’m tired of having to continuously deal with it and act like it doesn’t bother me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbmFpcmFtZXRyaWNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL2pwLW1vcmdhbi13ZWxscy1mYXJnby1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLXNldHRsZS1sb3dlci1pbi11bmlzb24tZm9sbG93aW5nLWZlZHMtZGVjaXNpb24v0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly9uYWlyYW1ldHJpY3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjAvanAtbW9yZ2FuLXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtc2V0dGxlLWxvd2VyLWluLXVuaXNvbi1mb2xsb3dpbmctZmVkcy1kZWNpc2lvbi8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JP Morgan Wells Fargo Goldman Sachs settle lower in unison following Fed’s decision,"U.S major Bank settled lower in unison following the Fed’s decision in keeping rates low despite signs that showed the world’s largest economy was back on track.

1st 2nd 3rd Final PROVIDENCE 1 2 3 6 HARTFORD 0 0 1 1

HARTFORD CT. - Alex-Olivier Voyer scored two goals and Kyle Keyser earned his first win of the season as the Providence Bruins defeated the Hartford Wolf Pack 6-1 on Saturday afternoon. In total 10 different P-Bruins recorded at least one point in the victory. The win marks Providence’s fourth straight win and 10th win in their last 12 contests. Providence has recorded a point in eight consecutive games and 11 of their last 12 contests.

JAY LEACH HEAD COACH

“It’s (the season) not the same. It’s not going to be the same. It never was really going to be the same. With that being said it’s a professional hockey game in the American Hockey League against a formidable opponent that we’ve played for years and years and years. We certainly respect the two opponents we’ve played and we certainly want to make sure we do everything we possibly can to win every one of those games. That’s just the way it’s going to be.

I think today and even our last game I can’t say our performance was as solid as its been throughout. We were able to capitalize on some chances but I think we’re getting a little loose. I think it’s a challenge for us to be able to maintain the level of play that we’ve had up until this point and it will be a challenge.

If you keep playing the same teams over and over they’re going to keep pushing harder and harder. I’m certainly excited for our success but I’m also aware how hard it will be to continue that sort of stretch against these two teams. They’re going to get better and we’re going to have to do the same.”

MECHANICSBURG Pa. — It was day two of the PIAA State Swim Championships at Cumberland Valley High School and once again even though there were no fans in attendance the atmosphere was electric.

That was in no small part to the job the Cumberland Valley staff did to ensure an excellent event. Eagles swim coach Michael Gobrecht was spinning the playlist from the nest up top on his audio board or using his smart watch from the deck to keep the juices flowing.

Carboard cutouts from area teams like Spring Grove Red Lion Cumberland Valley Ephrata dotted the stands among others. Hershey High School is well known for their loud fans at meets and they had a few cutouts to provide a lift to their girls.

The Trojans in the Girls 200 yard free style relay of Cali Oyerly Tori Tafuto Angela Woronko and Clair Ryland took gold in 1:34.16. The chance to top the podium was a great way to end a tough year according to Woronko.

“There has been things thrown out left and right. There were snow-days and practices cancelled and not just for our team but every team as hole came together and were able to bust out some fast times so that’s pretty exciting to see everyone come together.”

Shippensburg Senior Julia Strine had a determined attitude when she took to the starting block. After missing last years meet with the cancellation of the ""AA"" events she was not leaving anything in the tank for her last high school race in the 100 yard breaststroke. Entering the final turn it was a tight race and Strine was able to out touch her opponent to win with a 1:02.33. She wasn't supposed to do it but Strine took a peak to see how close the race was.

“I wouldn’t be honest if I did say that I didn’t glance over and see that I had competition to the right. I wanted this so badly my aim was to finish as hard as I could.""

On the boys side Cedar Crest’s Logan Smith swam a fast 55.42 to claim silver in the 100 breaststroke.

The only foods they buy from the store she said are sugar and flour.

In early February their paradise became a nightmare.

A flaring incident at the massive Limetree Bay oil refinery sent a plume of steam into the air and covered more than 130 houses in the Clifton Hill neighborhood including the Rivera’s home and garden with specks of oil.

When workers contracted by the refinery’s owners stopped by her house a couple of days later and sprayed chemical dispersants to help clean up the oil Rivera said she had to dig up and throw out her whole plot including more than 50 pounds of food.

“Literally black spots were all over everybody’s roofs” Rivera said. “We’ve already spent over $600 trying to replace the dirt that was contaminated.”

It’s certainly not the first accident to occur at the 56-year-old facility once one of the largest oil refineries in the world.

The refinery site is home to one of the biggest and least known oil spills in U.S. history. Its previous owners faced a multi-million dollar settlement for violating the Clean Air Act. And over the past year as new ownership rushed to reopen the plant after nearly a decade Limetree Bay has experienced a series of mishaps and delays including multiple fires foul odors strong enough to close schools and several unscheduled flares like the one that doused Rivera’s home and garden. Now the plant stands as a prime example of what environmentalists see as the Trump administration’s unfettered and irresponsible deregulatory agenda and a penchant late in President Trump’s term for granting sweetheart deals to well-connected corporate interests. In Limetree’s case the administration ignored decades of precedent in issuing new permits and expressed a willingness in emails to the refinery’s new owners to do almost anything they needed to restart it.

The plant’s renewed operations in the context of the Paris climate accord also prompted questions among climate activists about why a massive refinery needed to be reopened when global fossil fuel use must decline annually by 6 percent over the next decade if the planet is to have any chance of avoiding runaway climate change by keeping warming within the limits set by the international agreement.

Limetree didn’t respond to questions regarding community concerns over environmental and health threats posed by its operations but promised on its website that the community’s safety and the island’s environment were “paramount” to its work.

Virgin Islands government officials touted the plant’s restart in February as a lifeline for the territory still recovering from two Category 5 hurricanes in 2017—Irma and Maria—and crippled by a pandemic that devastated global tourism. Locals like Rivera worry what it will mean for them and their tropical island to once again live in the shadow of an oil refinery that has fouled St. Croix’s ecosystem throughout its existence.

Several green groups including the St. Croix Environmental Association are urging President Biden to revoke Limetree’s air pollution permit. They have filed an appeal with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental Appeals Board calling the refinery’s ongoing operations a textbook case of environmental injustice.

Nearly 75 percent of the people living in the communities just north of the refinery are Black almost 30 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino and over a quarter fall below the national poverty line according to a recent EPA analysis. In 2016 St. Croix also had the highest number of reported cancer cases among the three islands according to the territory’s cancer registry data.

For decades government officials have known that polluting facilities like oil refineries are far more likely to exist in poor minority communities than affluent white ones. President Biden has made fighting climate change a top priority and pledged to elevate environmental justice to the top of his regulatory agenda to reverse decades of health disparities in minority neighborhoods.

The White House declined to comment on the demand to revoke Limetree’s permit. But officials now in top positions in the EPA have previously pointed to that permit as an example of the Trump administration’s abdication of the agency’s mission to protect nature and human health.

For locals like Frandelle Gerard a St. Croix business leader and the executive director of the Crucian Heritage and Nature Tourism Foundation the moment represents a chance for the new administration to back up its rhetoric.

“The people directly impacted the people living closest to the refinery are poor Black and brown” Gerard said. “It’s a social justice racial justice and environmental justice issue.”

A History of Spills Explosions and Dodged Enforcement

When the ground shook on a sunny February afternoon in 2011 David Bond’s first thought was that a natural disaster had struck. “It felt like a volcanic eruption or earthquake” he said. “I had no idea what it was.”

A fuel line at the St. Croix oil refinery operated by the company Hovensa at the time had caught fire and exploded. The blast was heard from miles away and a pillar of black smoke rose from the island’s southern shore churning across a blue tropical skyline.

Bond an anthropology professor at Vermont’s Bennington College was visiting St. Croix that day for research and remembers workers in protective hazmat suits moving from house to house to clean the oil from resident’s cisterns—the rain catching systems commonly used on the island to collect drinking water.

Hovensa a joint venture between Hess Corporation and Petroleos de Venezuela reported no injuries in the explosion. But the event added a further stain to a growing laundry list of high-profile accidents and violations at the facility in the years leading up to its closure.

Just weeks prior to the explosion in January 2011 the EPA had found the refinery in such disrepair that it ordered Hovensa in a consent decree to spend $700 million on new pollution control equipment that would help reduce the plant’s emissions by as much as 8500 tons a year. The facility had been emitting too much nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide volatile organic compounds—or VOCs—and benzene all of which can contribute to significant environmental and human health harm such as increased risk of lung disease and cancer the agency said.

Frandelle Gerard poses for a portrait at the Crucian Heritage and Nature Tourism Foundation Cultural Center where she works as the foundation’s executive director. Gerard testified in 2018 against the proposal to reopen the Limetree Bay oil refinery saying the facility poisoned the island’s only aquifer. Credit: Michael Butler The EPA also slapped the company with a $5.4 million civil penalty and ordered them to fund $4.9 million in projects that would improve the environmental health of St. Croix. But perhaps the most notable incident happened decades prior to the explosion said Gerard who was born in St. Croix and personally remembers many of the mishaps. In 1982 she explained the EPA discovered that Hovensa was quietly leaking oil into St. Croix’s groundwater. Cast iron pipes carrying the refinery’s waste products had long been corroding underneath the island’s salt-rich soil investigators discovered. It wouldn’t be until late 2011 however that the agency announced the extent of the leak: More than 43 million gallons of oil—four times the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez—had seeped into the island’s only aquifer with hardly anyone one noticing.

Hovensa recovered the vast majority of that oil according to the company’s self-reporting to the EPA but roughly 306000 gallons remain in the aquifer. “We only have one aquifer” Gerard said which “has been contaminated permanently because of the underground spills.”

Then in January 2012 Hovensa announced it was shutting down production at the plant for good citing a global oil glut and stiff competition. Hovensa also said at the time that the refinery’s closure meant it didn’t need to honor the more than $700 million in equipment upgrades air monitor installations and habitat improvement projects required under its agreement with the EPA according to the February permit appeal filed by the St. Croix Environmental Association.

In September 2015 the U.S. Virgin Islands filed a lawsuit against Hess Corporation for more than $1 billion alleging “a pattern of misconduct by executives” who “conspired to strip the facility’s assets in order to leave the government with claims against a broke polluted and inoperable refinery” according to the environmental association’s permit appeal.

“Within hours of the filing Hovensa announced that it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy” the appeal added a move that allowed the company to market and sell the refinery as an oil storage facility.

In December 2015 Hovensa sold the plant to Limetree Bay Ventures a partnership between the private equity firms EIG and Arclight Capital.

The timing of those events left many locals feeling swindled believing that Hovensa shut down the refinery knowing very well it had no intention of honoring the promises it had made to clean up its mess and improve the island’s habitat.

In fact not only did Hovensa pull out of its agreement with the EPA it spent more than half of what it owed under the consent decree on making the sale of the refinery more attractive according to a letter between the Trump EPA and Limetree first reported by E&E News. The letter said that Hovensa spent more than $400 million “to maintain the restart capability of the refinery operations” after closing the plant and putting it up for sale.

Limetree’s current permit issued under the Trump administration in 2018 requires the company to install the air monitoring equipment that the previous owners ducked before filing for bankrputcy. But Limetree is appealing those conditions among others before the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board saying the permit is too strict and unneeded.

Limetree didn’t respond to questions regarding its appeal.

As the refinery rebooted this February old fears crept into Gerard’s thoughts. What if another spill happens and goes unnoticed for years—for decades? What if oil reaches the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge just 10 miles away and home to one of the world’s largest populations of nesting sea turtles? “Is there even a plan for something like that?” she asked.

‘Tax Break After Tax Break After Tax Break’

Nobody contests that the oil refinery’s closure left a crater in the Virgin Islands economy. But many are now arguing over what role—if any—the refinery should play in rebuilding it.

In 2012 the year the refinery shut down the territory saw its GDP drop by more than 13 percent a government report found specifically citing the plant’s closure as a main factor. And by the following year nearly one out of every five people living in the territory were out of work.

But since efforts to reopen the plant began in 2019 St. Croix has already seen a much-needed influx of cash. The refinery brought in hundreds of temporary construction workers and technicians to get the plant back up and running and the facility itself will employ up to 700 permanent workers Limetree has said. The refinery is also expected to generate $7 million in public revenue each year.

“There’s no doubt there’s an economic benefit of having contractors coming to the island” said Ryan Flegal a local hotelier. “They stay in our hotel.”

Those funds are particularly needed when considering the two back-to-back Category 5 hurricanes—Irma and Maria—that devastated the Virgin Islands in September 2017. The damage caused by the storms was so extensive a 2020 congressional report noted that up to 90 percent of the territory’s power lines were damaged and public revenues were gutted by half.

The hurricanes destroyed homes schools and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to St. Croix’s only hospital much of which remains out of commission today.

“Patients visiting the ER have to use outside Porta Potties because the plumbing doesn’t work” said Jennifer Valiulis executive director of the St. Croix Environmental Association referring to portable bathrooms. “Many people still live in houses without a roof.”

The Virgin Islands received $2.3 billion in emergency funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help with recovery efforts. But many residents—including Valiulis Gerard and Flegal—don’t believe the Virgin Islands government did enough to advocate for the community in the contract with Limetree.

A copy of the contract obtained by Inside Climate News shows that Limetree Bay is exempt from at least 15 different taxes and fees many of which are commonly used by governments to pay for things like repairing roads and investing in public infrastructure. They include income taxes fuel taxes highway users’ taxes production taxes property taxes withholding taxes and license fees. The contract remains in effect until 2041.

Paying for road repairs or helping to reopen schools and the hospital “would be small beans for a multi-billion-dollar oil refinery” Flegal said. “Instead what we did is we gave tax break after tax break after tax break.”

Several officials who voted against approving the Limetree contract in 2018 as Virgin Island senators including Lt. Gov. Tregenza Roach and Department of Agriculture Commissioner Positive Nelson didn’t reply to requests for comment. Virgin Islands Gov. Albert Bryan who said in a press release that the refinery was “well-situated to meet growing demands in the region and deliver local economic development” also did not respond to requests for comment.

While the White House declined to comment on the Limetree Bay oil refinery top officials in Biden’s EPA have previously pointed to the facility’s reopening as a prime example of how the Trump EPA failed to protect human health and the environment.

In a 2019 paper for the Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program Joseph Goffman and Janet McCabe wrote that between 2017 and 2019 the Trump administration had “weakened” rules under the Clean Air Act that would ultimately increase emissions at polluting facilities and decrease air quality for nearby communities.

McCabe is now the EPA’s No. 2 regulator as the agency’s deputy administrator and Goffman heads the department’s Office of Air and Radiation.

Particularly McCabe and Goffman said Trump’s EPA had weakened provisions in the New Source Review rule which specifically seeks to safeguard communities from increased pollution when a new polluting facility is built or a major modification to an existing one is made. It does that by ensuring new permits require the most up-to-date pollution control equipment.

The rule also aims to ensure that companies share some of the financial burden of monitoring and curbing air pollution Goffman and McCabe wrote. “Instead the Trump EPA is treating the competing incentives of profit vs. air quality as irreconcilable and is privileging businesses’ preferences for avoiding costs.”

Trump officials essentially interpreted the New Source Review rule in ways that allow more polluting facilities to avoid the stricter emissions caps required by it said John Walke an environmental attorney and director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s clean air climate and clean energy program.

In the case of Limetree’s permit Trump officials ignored decades of EPA precedent that required any facilities shut down for two years or more to essentially apply for a new permit rather than reinstating its old one Walke said.

The new permit issued by the Trump EPA he said grandfathered in old emissions caps at the refinery rather than adopting stricter ones required under the New Source Review rule.

Limetree’s limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and other harmful pollution were determined by the old refinery’s production levels in 2009 and 2010 when it was refining upwards of 525000 barrels of oil per day. Those limits remain in place even though Limetree is only proposing to refine less than half as much oil at around 200000 barrels per day.

That means the refinery was given tremendous leeway in terms of how much it’s allowed to pollute likely at the expense of the community Walke said.

Data requests filed by E&E News and reported in 2019 also revealed that EPA officials under Trump including then-administrator Andrew Wheeler rushed the refinery’s permit to ensure the company’s financial viability. One top EPA official wrote in an email that he was there to give the company “anything they need” the report said.

Valiulis of the St. Croix Environmental Association said the local government officials had the same attitude when it came to the approval of Limetree’s permit.

“Whether it is for the government officials’ own personal gain” she said “or because they are afraid that Limetree will leave if they are forced to be accountable the government seems to be allowing the refinery to do whatever they want no matter how it negatively affects the community.”

A Looming Climate Disaster

In August one of the refinery’s stormwater pumps failed because of heavy rains. Oil-slicked water spilled from the refinery into an open containment pond and discharged into a nearby harbor—though a containment barrier and cleanup efforts prevented oil from reaching the sea the company said in a press release.

Valiulis rolled her eyes when she saw the company’s response. “They said it was an unexpected event because of heavy rains” she said. “But a tropical storm those happen every year. It’s not like it’s a once-in-a-century hurricane.”

Only a few years ago historic hurricanes swept through St. Croix. How long until another one hits Valiulis thought and what about containing waste water then?

The potential threat is only underscored by climate change which is making extreme weather more frequent and severe. Warmer air holds more water and more potential for destruction scientists have long warned. This hurricane season is expected to be another record year. And a study last year found that the most powerful storms are increasingly forming within striking distance of states in the Southeast and Caribbean islands like St. Croix.

It’s an issue Limetree doesn’t appear to be addressing. The company has no plan to measure or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions and makes no mention of its role in contributing to global warming in any of the documents it filed with regulators.

In March the EPA announced that it was investigating the February flaring incident that contaminated Sonya Rivera’s garden. Besides making its way onto 134 roofs and 208 cars oil was also found in 63 cisterns Robert Weldzius Limetree’s senior vice president of operations wrote in a letter to federal regulators.

Ever since the refinery contaminated St. Croix’s groundwater cisterns have become a necessity on the island—catching rain to provide water for residents to drink wash with or as in Rivera’s case irrigate their vegetable gardens.

As a consolation besides offering to clean their cisterns Limetree provided packages of bottled water to those affected. Rivera remembers the anger she felt when workers showed up at her door with a case for her.

“How are you going to take my food and replace it with water?” she said to them her voice growing louder.

One worker suggested she go to a restaurant.

Now more than a month since digging it all up Rivera is back in her garden planting lettuce greens and okra. This time she and her husband have raised the beds off the ground to make it easier to recoup their losses should things go wrong again.

“I’m not going to change my lifestyle for them” she said of Limetree. “All they care about is making money for themselves.”

Hess Corporation has sold its operations in Denmark for US$150 million which would be invested in oil exploration and production activities in Guyana Rigzone publication has reported.

Hess Denmark has entered into an agreement with Ineos E&P AS for a total consideration of $150 million effective January 1 2021.

Commenting on the deal Hess’ chief executive officer John Hess said “the sale of our Denmark asset enables us to further focus our portfolio and strengthen our cash and liquidity position”.

“Proceeds will be used to fund our world class investment opportunity in Guyana” he was quoted as saying by Rigzone.

Under the deal Ineos will acquire 61.5 percent of the Syd Arne oil field currently operated by Hess bumping its share in the asset to 98.3 percent. Ineos will also acquire 4.8 percent of the Solsort field which is already operated by the company.

Approximately 60 people will transfer to Ineos on completion of the deal which is expected in the third quarter of this year subject to government approval. The deal is the first to be announced following the formation of the new Ineos Energy business which incorporates Ineos’ oil and gas business.

“This deal represents a major step in reshaping our energy business” Brian Gilvary the executive chairman of Ineos Energy said in a company statement.

“Hess was one of the earliest pioneers in developing this basin. This deal will open up future growth prospects that can be developed in Denmark’s offshore oil and gas sector supported by a very promising carbon storage project helping to deal with future emissions” he added.

“The Greensands project in Denmark will make a significant contribution to our understanding and growth of carbon storage technology whilst supporting Denmark’s wider CO2 emission reduction targets for 2030 and beyond” Gilvary continued.

Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd has a 30 percent interest in the Stabroek Block which is located around 120 miles offshore Guyana. Gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block are currently estimated at approximately nine billion barrels of oil equivalent with multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential on the block Hess states on its website.",,,,,,,,,

The Governor's Economic Development and Tourism office said in September there's been a ""tremendous increase"" in companies reaching out since the pandemic hit with 237 relocation or expansion projects currently in the works.

Oracle moved its headquarters to Austin Texas late last year. Tesla is also building its new Gigafactory there and Apple will house its second-largest campus in Texas' capital city. This Big Tech influx has raised chatter about Texas potentially becoming a business hub that could rival Silicon Valley.

CBRE and Charles Schwab relocated their headquarters from California to the Dallas area in recent months and Hewlett Packard Enterprise is headed to Houston. Texas has also attracted wealthy individuals like Joe Rogan Elon Musk Dropbox CEO Drew Houston and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

But it's not just big businesses and the wealthy who are moving to Texas. In 2020 Texas added more residents than any other state. This comes as California's population and job growth have slowed to a trickle.

Plans for a 24-unit business park on the Binfield site - which it is hoped will attract data centres or film production - were published last year.

Now a new request has been made to the council to speed up the demolition of the old HP site in Cain Road.

A planning statement attached to the new application reads: “A concurrent and separate application for planning permission has been submitted to the council for a data centre.

Find out how you can get the latest news from BerkshireLive delivered straight to your inbox.

“This application […] is submitted in order to provide the council with greater certainty around the planned demolition operations and to allow the applicant to carry out early-stage demolition works ahead of planning permission being granted.”

Plans published last year showed designs for the complete redevelopment of the site from offices to a new business park called ‘Network West’.

The joint venture behind the plans made up of real estate group Hines developers Chancerygate and bankers Credit Suisse are hoping to attract a range of firms to the revamped site.

According to the business park’s owners the site’s location and facilities make it an ideal location for data centres or film production facilities.

Speaking in 2020 Greg Cooper Hines UK director of industrial and logistics said: “With excellent motorway links and the ability to serve such a large proportion of the population Network West provides a fantastic opportunity for businesses looking to either expand or relocate their operations.

“The site’s wider appeal to data centre users and film production companies a number whom have already enquired about bespoke facilities is another avenue we are exploring.”

A planning application to knock down HP’s offices and build the business park was submitted to Bracknell Forest Council in August 2020 as a full proposal.

The new plan is a ‘prior approval’ proposal — applications which are typically approved much quicker than full plans — and asks simply for permission to demolish HP’s offices rather than asking for demolition and the building of the business park.

Should the plan go ahead the demolition of the offices will take place in seven steps starting with asbestos removal.

A soft strip of the site will take place after any hazardous material is removed leading to the structural demolition of the buildings.

The underground structure would then be removed before brick and concrete is removed from the site.

A restoration of the site is the final step.

Bracknell Forest Council is currently considering the application.

Full details of the plan can be found by entering planning reference 21/00259/DEM at planapp.bracknell-forest.gov.uk

""They call me tiger mum because I'm very protective of my cubs"" she says.

That is not to say she has no tiger traits. She is sharp determined and confident which probably explains why she is standing tall today as one of the rare women leaders in the male-dominated tech industry.

Ms Chua did not have a degree when she joined HP as a sales representative more than two decades ago. But she more than found her feet in the multinational taking on various roles in business development channel marketing and consumer personal systems both locally and regionally.

Only one sidewalk vendor applies for license as new strict rules begin

Exterior of the Las Vegas Hilton which is now the Westgate.

Sin City will have two new resort-casinos by the end of the year with Resorts World Las Vegas and Virgin Hotels Las Vegas set to open in the coming months.

But there’s another brand expanding in Las Vegas this year that has flown under the radar: Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

Once the namesake to one Las Vegas’ most successful resorts the Hilton brand is more commonly found in the city’s off-Strip nongaming hotel properties these days. This year though it’s set to add 5000 rooms to its portfolio through Virgin Hotels and Resorts World.

“Both partnerships have solidified our presence in this sought-after destination and have brought Hilton back to the center of the city” Danny Hughes Hilton’s executive vice president and president of the Americas told the Review-Journal. “Las Vegas is a destination that attracts people from all over the world and we see it as a unique market for development and investment opportunities.”

Hilton’s history

In 1969 when the Las Vegas Hilton — then referred to as The International — opened it was the largest hotel in the world and considered by many to be the first true megaresort.

It was a breathtaking feat for its time: more than 1500 hotel rooms. Thirty stories. A 2000-seat showroom that hosted stars such as Elvis Presley and Barbra Streisand.

Las Vegas mogul Kirk Kerkorian in 1970 sold the property to Barron Hilton who renamed it the Las Vegas Hilton the following year. Business thrived under the new ownership and Hilton ended up expanding its hotel-casino operations with the Flamingo Hilton and Reno Hilton now the Grand Sierra Resort. Its casinos accounted for more than 30 percent of the company’s total revenue in 1987 according to its annual report.

The document said the Las Vegas Hilton helped lead a “stellar year” for the company drawing in convention travelers from the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center as well as international guests and high rollers.

But the heyday didn’t last long. Hilton ended up spinning off its “slumping casino business” into its own public company just over a decade later according to a 1998 Review-Journal article. The property changed hands again and briefly went by the name Las Vegas Hotel before being transformed into the Westgate.

Hilton’s presence in Las Vegas has been diluted since then with the company focused on a capital-light business model. Nevertheless executives say Hilton still believes in Las Vegas.

Shifting strategies

The company’s 2021 buildout in Las Vegas includes four of its brands three of which are being introduced to the city for the first time.

Hilton’s Curio Collection is teaming up with Virgin Hotels Las Vegas which is set to open Thursday. The partnership provides Virgin Hotels access to Hilton’s loyalty program and customer service app Lucy.

Resorts World’s partnership is tied to three Hilton luxury brands: Hilton Hotels & Resorts LXR and Conrad with each brand getting its own entrance lobby and selection of room products. The $4.3 billion property is set to open later this year.

The company already has a presence in the Tropicana and offers stays in nongaming hotels on and off the Strip including the Waldorf Astoria Home2 Suites and Embassy Suites.

Industry watchers don’t expect the big-name additions to have a substantial impact on Hilton’s bottom line.

“To be honest a deal like this probably doesn’t move the needle much for the company overall given its size” Evercore ISI analyst Rich Hightower said. “But I think it’s an important beachhead in a big hotel market where they didn’t have as much distribution as some of their peers.”

Hilton had nearly 6400 properties as of Dec. 31 according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Hughes said the partnerships should elevate Hilton’s portfolio and introduce its brands to Las Vegas’ global base of tourists. It’s also considered a safe investment for Hilton adding thousands of rooms to the company’s portfolio without requiring the company to put up capital.

Hilton’s newest Las Vegas rooms may not be opening at an ideal time with visitation rates in Las Vegas still below their pre-pandemic peaks but the company said it is confident the market will rebound.

“Las Vegas is a destination that doesn’t give up or give in. Time and time again the city has reinvented itself always staying true to its core of offering entertainment in many formats” Hughes said. “We are all in on our growth and development in the city. Las Vegas has been and will continue to be a priority market for Hilton.”

Perks for Resorts World Virgin Hotels

One of the most valuable assets of a Hilton partnership for Resorts World and Virgin Hotels may be access to the company’s customer database and loyalty program.

The partnerships add Virgin Hotels and Resorts World into the Hilton Honors system which incentivizes travelers to stay at the properties to redeem or earn points. The program could act as a bridge between Hilton’s 112 million-plus rewards members and Las Vegas’ two new properties.

“(This gives us) the opportunity to engage with a larger audience” Richard “Boz” Bosworth president and CEO of JC Hospitality LLC which owns Virgin Hotels said of the Hilton partnership. “(We can) increase our overall brand awareness to more potential customers via more channels.”

Hightower believes the partnership could be especially useful for Malaysia-based Genting Group Resorts World’s operator because most of the company’s assets are in Asia. With its upcoming Las Vegas property Genting has resorts in New York Malaysia the Bahamas the United Kingdom and Singapore whereas Hilton has properties in 119 countries and territories.

“Genting needs as wide a marketing funnel in the U.S. as possible. … They’ve got nothing on the West Coast they’ve got nothing in middle America” Hightower said. “A lot of those markets will feed into Vegas.”

As for Virgin Hotels Bosworth described the Hilton partnership as “the best of both worlds” for the company.

“We have the operational support of Hilton while still getting to deliver a unique experience to our guests” he said. That operational support includes access to Hilton’s national sales office — one of the largest conference and event booking teams in the world.

The head of Resorts World Las Vegas added that the partnership allows it to leverage Hilton’s “extensive resources” including team member training and operational guidelines such as the CleanStay program.

“We believe it will be a great foundation for creating the cleanest safest resort experience in Las Vegas” said Resorts World Las Vegas President Scott Sibella.

An entrepreneur who has launched everything from footwear lines to specialty fragrances Hilton has also become well known as a celebrity DJ and host.

Due to her status as a hot topic Hilton has been a regular paparazzi target since she first rose to fame close to two decades ago. While she has for the most part accepted this as par for the course the star has duped the photographers on a number of occasions in a bid for more privacy as she exclusively revealed in a recent “Hot Ones” episode.

When was Paris Hilton born?

Hilton was born in 1981 one of the heiresses to the Hilton Hotel chain fortune. As a young girl Hilton became a model perfecting not only her catwalk but her ability to manipulate the camera drawing every eye to her.

In the early 2000s Hilton became a celebrity hot topic after stepping out to various nightclubs and LA events. She seemed to be everywhere at once a source of public fascination due to her fabulous wealth her signature “baby voice” and her iconic catchphrase “that’s hot.”

While Hilton has received criticism for starting the “famous for being famous” trend there’s no doubt that she’s a hustler. Over the years Hilton has curated dozens of products and business ventures including over 50 boutiques and multiple designer fragrances.

Paris Hilton was a huge paparazzi target

Through all of her ventures and endorsement deals Hilton has remained a worldwide phenomenon a woman who has been hotly pursued by photographers and tabloid reporters. In the early days of her fame paparazzi were much bolder and had no problem stalking and harassing celebrities whom they considered to be “high-value” targets people like Hilton who always made for great photographs.

Hilton understood the drawbacks of fame and for the most part she handled being pursued with grace. However she sometimes just wanted privacy and in a recent interview with Sean Evans of “Hot Ones” she talked about how she has managed to evade the paps in a super-clever way.

What did Paris Hilton say to Sean Evans about tricking the paparazzi?

In her March 2021 appearance on “Hot Ones” Paris Hilton admitted that over the years she has gone incognito more than once when she wants to truly blend in with the crowd and enjoy some everyday activities. Hilton said that her “proudest moments” tricking the paparazzi include when she would have friends over to her house and would dress up one of her friends as Hilton — including a blonde wig large sunglasses and a Juicy Couture tracksuit.

“I would basically have them run out of my house trying to hide…and all the paparazzi would follow them. I’ve done that like 50 times” Hilton said. “It works!”

She also admitted that there’s some truth to the rumor that she has utilized prosthetics including a fake nose and dark wigs in order to attend Disneyland restaurants and other public events to remain undisturbed by photographers.

Finally Hilton remarked on the infamous “paparazzi-duping scarf” an accessory that features reflective technology that renders the wearer invisible to flashing light bulbs. “I haven’t really worn it” Hilton said but stated that she plans to add it into her wardrobe rotation eventually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1zdW1tZXItc3VyZ2UtZXhwYW5zaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Anticipates Summer Surge With Expanded Service To Over 20 Destinations,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1zdW1tZXItc3VyZ2UtZXhwYW5zaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Costco (COST 1.96%) and Home Depot (HD -0.47%) share many similarities as investments. Each company dominates its niche of the retail industry and each has a long track record for generating solid returns for shareholders. Both just experienced record growth years in 2020 due to the pandemic.

But which one looks likely to be the better investment in 2021 and beyond?

Comparing growth rates

While both companies gained market share during the past year the edge goes to Costco in the growth department. Its comparable-store sales gains consistently outpaced national peers like Walmart (WMT 1.25%) in recent quarters. Costco's February revenue for example grew by 14% in the core U.S. market after adjusting for gasoline price swings.

Walmart's Sam's Club has been expanding at a slower pace with net sales up 8.7% for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. The warehouse giant's success also shows up in its renewal rate which recently edged up to a record 91%.

Home Depot's latest results look closer to average for its peer group by comparison. It grew sales by 20% in its fiscal 2020 while Lowe's (LOW -0.10%) notched a 24% gain. The home improvement retailer is also opening stores at a slower pace with just 5 new locations added in 2020 compared to the 21 that Costco is planning for the current fiscal year.

Profits and cash returns

On the other hand Home Depot is the clear winner when it comes to profits and cash returns. It boasts a higher operating profit margin than Costco and dominates Lowe's and most other national retailers on this score.

Home Depot promises to deliver more cash to investors as well. Management targets an annual return of 55% of earnings to shareholders compared to 35% for Lowe's. That commitment supported a 10% hike in Home Depot's dividend for its March distribution. In contrast while Costco sporadically issues large special dividends its regular payout commitment translates into a 0.9% annual yield at current share prices the lowest in its stock cohort.

The outlook

Home Depot's stock has fared much better since the start of the pandemic which likely flows from the fact that investors are expecting no big slowdown in its sales as the threat of the coronavirus recedes. Sales will likely grow modestly in 2021 management forecast in late February as earnings grow following the prior year's spike. The housing market is booming across the country and factors such as income growth the age of housing stock and home prices all suggest further robust gains ahead.

In contrast business in Costco's portion of the retail world could be in for a relatively sluggish period as demand slackens for bulk quantities of consumer staples like paper towels and laundry detergent. Tens of millions of Americans might soon ease back into their pre-pandemic shopping habits of visiting several stores more often to get the various items they seek rather than seeking to consolidate their shopping trips as much as possible. That could further pressure the warehouse giant's sales over the next few quarters.

Valuation and bottom line

Yet that potential slowdown appears to already be baked into Costco's stock price which participated in the wider market's surge over the past 12 months. You can now buy shares of the warehouse retailer for about 0.8 times annual sales. That's less than half Home Depot's valuation by the same metric and below the 1 times sales you'd have to pay to buy shares of Target (TGT 1.30%).

Costco is more expensive on a price-to-earnings basis though as investors are paying over 30 times annual earnings for the stock. That premium is partly thanks to the chain's unusually low profit margin.

On the other hand cash returns are the best reason to prefer Home Depot even at its premium valuation. You get a bigger dividend commitment and are likely to benefit from aggressive stock buybacks over the next few years by holding the home improvement leader.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjAvdHdvLWluanVyZWQtYWZ0ZXItc2hvb3RpbmctZWFjaC1vdGhlci1ob21lLWRlcG90LXdlc3QtcGFsbS1iZWFjaC1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LzQ3ODEzODQwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two injured after shooting each other at Home Depot in West Palm Beach police say,"WEST PALM BEACH — Two men were wounded Saturday morning after they opened fire on each other in a shootout from their cars in a Home Depot parking lot city police said.

The two men who know each other exchanged gunfire at 11:58 a.m. in the parking lot of the Home Depot on 1550 Palm Beach Lakes Blvd.

The gunfire occurred after one of the men climbed out of his black BMW M4 and moved toward the other who drove a white GMC Terrain SUV police said.

Rapid gunshots went off ""pop-pop-pop"" said one man who was standing near the other side of the Home Depot and did not want to be identified.

The SUV had at least eight bullet holes on its driver's side and three of its windows were shot out. The BMW had no bullet damage.

Both men sustained non-life-threatening injuries and ambulances took them to a local hospital. One of the men had multiple gunshot wounds while the other had one police said.

No one else was injured police reported.

The Home Depot remained open after the shooting.

Police cordoned off the section of the parking lot where the shooting happened. Onlookers whose cars sat in the crime scene quarantine waited more than two hours as officers conducted their investigations and checked cars near the shooting that may have been pierced by bullets.

As of Saturday afternoon authorities had not released the names of the men.

West Palm Beach police urge people with information about the shooting to call them at 561-822-1900.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYm9jYW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjEvbG90dXMtcmVzaWRlbnQta2FyZW4tYmVyZ2VyLXdoby1vd25zLTk2MGstaG91c2UtamFpbGVkLWZvci1zaG9wZmxpdGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lotus Resident Karen Berger Who Owns $960k House Jailed For Shopfliting,"Karen Berger Courtesy Palm Beach County Jail.

BY: STAFF REPORT | BocaNewsNow.com

BOCA RATON FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2021 MetroDesk Media LLC) — The owner of a $960000 home in the Lotus development near Lyons and Clint Moore is accused of shoplifting nearly $1000 worth of lighting from Home Depot in West Boca Raton.

Karen Berger 44 who is identified in a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office report as a teacher was jailed Thursday after Home Depot opted to prosecute the case.

According to police “Karen Berger was seen entering the Home Depot through the main entrance. The subject then proceeded to the store’s lighting fixtures department and selected two Swirl LED Chrome Mini valued at $99.97 each one Keighley 36” LED Crystal Island valued at $219 one Essence Disk LED Integrated Chrome valued at $109. Then Berger proceeded towards the front of the store where she went to aisle 8 and selected three moving boxes valued at $2.68 each. Then she proceeded out of aisle 8 and towards to self check out.”

The police report continues: “While in the self check out Berger scanned the three moving boxes valued at $8.04 total and two Swirl LED Chrome Mini Pendant valued at $199.94 for both making a total purchase of $207.98. Berger did not attempt to scan and pay for the other lighting fixtures that were inside her shopping cart depriving Home Depot of the amount of $756.”

Caught on camera according to the report “Berger exited the store via the main exit with the unpaid merchandise where she was intercepted and brought back into the store’s loss prevention office by the store’s loss prevention investigators. The Home Depot would like to prosecute.”

Karen Berger is now charged with one count of Retail Grand Theft according to police. She was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail at 3:10 Thursday afternoon. She was released on $1000 bond — ironically more than the amount of the alleged theft — just after 10 p.m.

Berger lives in the 8400 block of Apple Falls Lane in a home she paid $961485 for in January of 2021 according to the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser.

Home Depot Founder Ken Langone

Interview With Home Depot Co-Founder Ken Langone

Home Depot Founder Ken Langone : Ken Langone is a legendary American businessman. Mr. Langone first rose to fame as the banker who convinced Ross Perot to IPO his Electronic Data Systems by promising a 100 price-to-earnings ratio on the shares.

Later in 1978 Mr. Langone co-founded global juggernaut Home Depot. With $110 Billion of trailing revenue and 400000 employees Home Depot’s actions set an example for the entire retail industry. We had the privilege of interviewing Mr. Langone on the technological trends at Home Depot.

RR: What has been Home Depot’s relationship with technology was there a time when the firm started to embrace tech or have you always since inception?

KL: Whatever technology was available to manage the business and identify trends and be competitive in market pricing we would use now we are using technology to train our people. Home Depot will spend $11 Billion over the next 3 years on technology.

RR: Where do you see the impact of technology most in Home Depot’s business?

KL: Probably the front end. Our website is in a constant state of evolution we are always making it better for the client. We are trying to make the user experience as easy as possible while helping our customers make informed decisions.

RR: We have covered the smart warehouse wars between Ocado and Amazon please tell us about Home Depot’s warehouses?

KL: You can’t imagine the supply chain management that goes into stocking each store. We are talking about 100000 square foot boxes selling $400 a square foot worth of items. There is just tremendous physical sell-through.

RR: Tell us about managing each store’s employees?

KL: We are using technology to keep our associates better informed of new products and what those products do how they do. This type of continuous training of 400000 associates can only be done with a serious commitment to technology.

RR: What would you say is one of the biggest technological changes at Home Depot?



KL: The front end where the customer checks out has always been a bottle neck its a general problem retail has. So the advent of self-checkout has really helped to expedite the process.

Battle of the Smart Warehouses!

RR: Where would you say Home Depot concentrates the most on technology in its business?

KL: The trio of merchandising supply chain management and training of our associates. But also using technology to pick people who are deserving of advancement and opportunity within the company is critical.

RR: I have to ask about Amazon?

KL: Amazon has made Home Depot better no question. I think they are a different channel to us if our customer wants to shop sitting in their living room now they can our stores are within 1 mile of 90% of the consumers in america so we have that last mile covered. Amazon simply can’t reasonably accommodate the large products in our stores. Our customers look for a 2 by 4 or a few feet of pipe.

RR: What is your overall feeling about Amazon & Jeff Bezos?

KL: Amazon is a great company. We learn so much from them. Jeff Bezos is who you want to pay attention to incredibly smart and humble.

RR: Has Home Depot jumped on the Cloud?

KL: We warmly and enthusiastically embrace cloud technology?

RR:As you are a big advocate for improving public schools do you believe technology can help America catch up from being in the high 20’s in education despite being #1 in spending?



KL: Well we can’t do any worse. Yes I think technology will be instrumental in more efficiently teaching our children.

Do you have an opinion on the best way to educate our children on the coming technological age?

KL: I think we need to elevate the quality of instruction however technology can help us do that would be great.

The First Medication To Extend Your Life?

RR: Last question Langone Health is a global beacon of research though and goodness is there a technology you have seen employed at the hospital or researched that has made you excited?



KL: One thing I’m excited about is we are going paperless everything from prescriptions to patient history. Healthcare is a sector that is being extremely impacted by technology.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Smith,"The 110'x33' linehaul towboat Gretchen V. Cooper built by Blakeley BoatWorks (BBW) was delivered to Cooper Marine and Timberlands (CMT) this month.

BBW and CMT located in the port of Mobile Ala. are wholly owned subsidiaries of Cooper/T. Smith. The company said the new towboat which has a maximum 8'6"" working draft is the U.S.’s first linehaul towing vessel powered by a Tier 4 Caterpillar high-speed engines with selective catalytic reduction.

Currently Tier-4 diesel engine standards are the strictest Environmental Protection Agency emissions requirements for new engines found in inland marine vessels. Tier-4 compliant engines significantly reduce emissions of particulate matter or black soot and nitrogen oxides to near zero levels. The engines are designed to save fuel and reduce emissions by more than 86% for large applications like marine vessels.

The new towboat is powered by two Caterpillar C3512E 3400-hp Tier 4 diesel marine engines operating at 1800 RPM and coupled to Twin Disc MGX-5600 gears.

The Cats are connected to Southeastern Propeller 88""x74""x9"" 4-bladed stainless-steel propellers to provide thrust through twin J&S Machine Works 9"" ABS Grade two propeller shafts with Cutlass shaft bearings Thordon rudder bearings and Kemel shaft seals. Gulf Coast Air and Hydraulics supplied the steering system for the two 9"" main and four 8"" flanking rudders.

Hydra Force LLC provided a pair of Quincy reciprocating air compressors with ventilation fans provided by Donovan Marine. Schuyler Maritime LLC supplied varying sizes of rubber fendering around the perimeter of the vessel and push knees.

Thompson Caterpillar also supplied electrical power with two Cat C4.4 Tier 3 generators with RW Fernstrum keel coolers throughout.

Stone Construction provided a Mitsubishi mini-split HVAC system in all interior spaces with Blakeley BoatWorks providing all custom woodwork and interior finishes. Bozant supplied aluminum and rubber-framed windows.

On deck Donovan Marine supplied a pair of Patterson 40-ton deck winches. Blakeley BoatWorks installed all electronics communications and an alarm system.

The towboat has a capacity of 44200 gals. of fuel and 10000 gals. potable water. The vessel is outfitted with six crew staterooms housing eight crewmen 4 1⁄2 baths and a full galley arrangement.

“Our customers expect Blakeley BoatWorks and Cooper Marine & Timberlands to drive industry innovation and our building and operating one of the industry’s most environmentally friendly towboats marks our unwavering commitment to always exceed their expectations” Angus R. Cooper III president Cooper/T. Smith said in a statement. “Naming a boat after my wife Gretchen meant that we couldn’t just settle for building a standard towboat and therefore the Gretchen V. Cooper will be one of the most powerful towing vessels operating on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway and will lead the way for a new industry standard for reduced emissions on towboats.”

Cooper Marine & Timberlands has a fleet of 20 towing vessels and more than 400 hopper barges. CMT has one of the country's largest fleet of dry bulk gantry and floating derrick cranes. The company’s marine footprint includes the Tennessee-Tombigbee River system Ohio River Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Illinois River Arkansas River Cumberland River Black Warrior River Tennessee River Tombigbee River Mobile River and Mississippi River. CMT’s stevedoring operations include two deep-draft bulk cargo terminals at the port of Mobile and numerous inland marine terminals throughout Alabama and Mississippi.

“The ongoing investments that CMT is making across our fleet best ensures that our customers will continue to receive the safest most environmentally friendly and highest level of service in our region” said James Fowler managing director of marine and stevedoring operations for Cooper Marine and Timberlands and executive vice president for Blakeley BoatWorks. “As was true when BBW built some of the nation’s first subchapter M new construction towing vessels and now as we deliver a new linehaul with the latest and most advanced carbon reduction technology BBW eagerly stands ready to deliver on our industry’s newest and most challenging jobs.”

Blakeley BoatWorks is a full-service shipyard that specializes in small vessel repair barge repair and new vessel construction. It is equipped with a 1900-ton floating dry dock 660-ton Marine Travelift and four covered fabrication shops.

“Our team is proud to be part of the construction of the Gretchen V. Cooper” said Swathin Kannalath managing director of Blakeley BoatWorks. “Delivering one of the first Tier-4 linehaul vessels in the country presented an exciting challenge for the Blakeley team and we delivered with this vessel meeting not only the highest industry standards but also exceeding our customer’s expectations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9pdGFseXMtbmV3LTYwMC1ocC10cmFjay10b3ktYXJyaXZlcy1pbi1hbWVyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italy's New 600-HP Track Toy Arrives In America,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9pdGFseXMtbmV3LTYwMC1ocC10cmFjay10b3ktYXJyaXZlcy1pbi1hbWVyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hcHBsZS1tYWNib29rLWFpci12cy1ocC1zcGVjdHJlLXgzNjAtMTMv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL2FwcGxlLW1hY2Jvb2stYWlyLXZzLWhwLXNwZWN0cmUteDM2MC0xMy8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple MacBook Air vs. HP Spectre x360 13,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?

In the past Apple’s MacBook Air was the definition of a thin and light laptop with an awesome keyboard and a great battery. Today it faces much stiffer competition.

Today you have a mind-numbing selection of options especially in the 13-inch class where the MacBook Air plays. It received an overhaul in 2018 that made it significantly more modern but does it still have what it takes to beat out-stunning new 2-in-1s like the HP Spectre x360 13? Read on to find out about two of the best laptops on the market.

Recommended Videos

Design

The revised MacBook Air is familiar yet far more modern than its predecessor. Its chassis is thinner lighter and sports smaller bezels making it look more like it belongs in 2020 instead of 2012. It’s just as elegant and conservatively attractive coming in gold silver and Space Gray colors. The overall design hasn’t changed significantly since then only the underlying hardware.

The current Spectre x360 features a “gem cut” iteration that has angles everywhere catching the light. You can get it in Natural Silver Nightfall Black or Poseidon Blue. Either way it’s a look that definitely stands out more so than Apple’s laptop.

Both are solidly built sporting an all-aluminum chassis that’s rigid and suffers little flexing or bending. The MacBook Air is thinner than the Spectre x360 at 0.63 inches versus 0.67 inches. It’s also lighter at 2.8 pounds versus 2.88 pounds.

Input matters as well. The latest MacBook Air equips Apple’s new Magic Keyboard first introduced in 2019 on the 16-inch MacBook Pro . After several attempts to resolve the issues surrounding its butterfly switches Apple turned to scissor-style switches and hasn’t looked back. Meanwhile the Spectre x360 includes one of the best keyboards you’ll ever find on a laptop with deep and spacious keys.

Complementing Apple’s Magic Keyboard is a large Force Touch touchpad providing clicky feedback without using moving parts. HP’s touchpad is smaller than the Force Touch version and now supports Microsoft’s Precision Touchpad drivers improving the input over the previous model.

One major point of divergence however is HP’s touch display that supports an active pen for Windows Ink. The MacBook Air does not have a touch screen nor does it support the Apple Pen.

Connectivity is another point of divergence. The MacBook Air doubles down literally on USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 offering two of those ports and nothing else. The Spectre x360 also has two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 but it also supports legacy devices with a USB-A 3.1 port and it has a microSD card reader for storage expansion and compatibility with cameras and external accessories without an alternative connection. It’s all the benefits of Thunderbolt 3 without the inconvenience of needing dongles for older peripherals.

Performance

The MacBook Air uses 10th-generation Intel Ice Lake two- and four-core processors. The Spectre x360 on the other hand uses a different set of 10th-generation CPUs but also has configurations with 11th-generation Tiger Lake chips. You’ll see faster performance on the Spectre x360 that better handles more demanding productivity and content creation tasks. You’ll need to jump up to the MacBook Pro to find a worthy opponent.

The MacBook Air’s PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) is faster than the one fueling the Spectre x360. That doesn’t mean the HP is slow at accessing and saving data but this is the one performance metric that’s in Apple’s favor.

Typically MacBooks offer the best displays with the widest and most accurate colors the highest contrast and the most brightness. Unfortunately the MacBook Air is an outlier here with merely average display performance provided by its Retina 2560 x 1600 resolution panel.

With the Spectre x360 Full HD model we reviewed in early 2019 we found it was roughly equal in terms of colors and brightness but it offered a much higher contrast ratio. At the same time HP installed Intel’s 1-watt screen which uses about half the power of the typical display. You’ll see the results of this later on in the battery comparison.

Lastly the Spectre x360 model we reviewed in late 2019 had a 4K AMOLED display. It was sufficiently bright at 405 nits and excelled in color supporting 100% of sRGB and 98% of AdobeRGB. And because the screen was OLED the contrast and black levels were better than anything we’ve seen in a long while.

Portability

You won’t notice either of these laptops in your backpack. They’re equally portable and therefore a great option for anyone whose work isn’t anchored in one place. However size and weight are only two portability considerations.

Battery life also matters. In our web browsing test the Full HD version of HP’s Spectre x360 13 from early 2019 lasted 12 hours and 45 minutes. The 2020 MacBook Air followed behind with 9.5 hours and the late 2019 Spectre x360 with the 4K AMOLED screen finished last with less than six hours.

In our video loop test the Full HD model lasted 17 hours and 36 minutes followed by the MacBook Air at a mere 10 hours. HP’s 4K AMOLED review unit nearly matched the Air with 9.5 hours.

Overall the Spectre x360 model with a Full HD display is one of the longest-lasting laptops we’ve ever tested and that makes the more meaningfully portable laptop.

HP’s Spectre x360 is faster lasts longer and looks better

The cheapest MacBook Air is priced at $1000 and includes a Core i3 processor 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. If you have other Mac products you want to sync up this laptop is the most affordable Apple you’ll find. Besides having a responsive keyboard and plenty of storage on the hard drive you can allow it to access your iPad iPhone and even your Apple Watch. For those who are looking for better performance the $1299 model may be the best option.

The HP Spectre x360 begins at $950. The standard model features a 10th-generation Core i5 processor 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD. You can dress it up with a max of Core i7-1065G7 and a max of 2TB of storage. This laptop comes standard with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage making it comparable to the MacBook Air. The HP Spectre will set you back $1200 which is worth it considering it has an Intel Core i5-1135G7.

Loyal Mac users are die-hard Mac fans so we understand they will automatically pick the Air because of its trademark design killer aesthetic and of course its phenomenal and convenient ability to connect to other Mac devices. If you’re not concerned with compatibility with other products you should pick the Spectre x360 based on its superior performance when compared to the Air. The Spectre x360 is hard to beat with its high memory capacity a longer-lasting battery and 2-in-1 functionality.

The General Motors-centric tuner is now offering a supercharger kit that should make this Blazer really blaze.

First spotted by Muscle Cars & Trucks the package adds an Edelbrock TVS1740 supercharger to the stock 3.6-liter V-6 engine. Specifications haven't been finalized but the blower is expected to boost output by 40% over the stock 308 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque. That equates to around 431 hp and 378 lb-ft.

Lingenfelter released photos showing some subtle visual changes including stripes and ""supercharged"" lettering on the hood but overall the modified Blazer looks mostly stock.

Lingenfelter supercharged Chevrolet Blazer

The company hasn't discussed any upgrades beyond the supercharger and graphics package but suspension and brake upgrades seem like a good idea to handle the extra power.

Pricing information hasn't been released either but Muscle Cars & Trucks noted that Lingenfelter offers a similar kit for the Chevrolet Colorado (which uses the same V-6 engine) priced from $5550 for the standalone kit or $6995 with installation and dyno testing.

Lingenfelter will also shoehorn a 6.2-liter LT4 V-8 into the Colorado's engine bay. Normally found in the Camaro ZL1 (and the discontinued C7 Corvette Z06 and Cadillac CTS-V) the supercharged LT4 develops 650 hp from the factory but Lingenfelter can upgrade it to 720 hp with an optional pulley kit. That swap would be much more difficult in the Blazer because of its transverse engine layout but we can dream right?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL21vZGlmaWVkLWV2ZXJ5ZGF5LWNhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Modified Everyday Cars Are Faster Than A Rocket Ship,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL21vZGlmaWVkLWV2ZXJ5ZGF5LWNhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The newest IBM Cloud Multi-Zone Region officially opened on March 18 in Sao Paulo Brazil the 10th location that IBM has built out in recent years as part of its renewed cloud strategy. Last year IBM opened MZRs in Toronto and Osaka Japan and has plans to scale to 14 MZRs over the next 24 months.

An IBM Cloud Multi-Zone Region is not just a single data center that IBM has labeled as being ""cloud""; rather it's a new purpose-built infrastructure.

""A Multi-Zone Region really is three data centers 10 to 40 kilometers apart and that's important for latency purposes"" Harish Grama general manager of IBM Cloud told ITPro Today. ""Essentially each one of those data centers in the region is what we call an availability zone so even if one goes down you've got two others up and running as long as you have deployed your application to two or more of them.""

Why MZR Cloud Deployments Matter

Each data center in an IBM Cloud Multi-Zone Region has independent power cooling and networking Grama said.

To guarantee reliability and resilience organizations need to deploy enterprise applications using an MZR cloud approach. The reason three data centers are needed and not just two is to ensure data is accurate he added.

""If you only have two data centers and one is misbehaving how do you know if the data is accurate?"" Grama said. ""You need a third data center to break the tie and that's why three is the right number.""

From SoftLayer to the New IBM Cloud Software Stack

IBM Cloud has undergone multiple revisions over the years since IBM acquired SoftLayer in 2013 and entered the cloud market.

SoftLayer had its own virtualized infrastructure that was focused on bare metal and made use of a hypervisor that had challenges scaling according to Grama. IBM has rebuilt and rewritten the infrastructure and that's what's present in the new MZRs. The new software infrastructure for IBM's cloud began to come together three years ago and is based on the open-source Kubernetes container orchestration system and Red Hat's KVM virtualization hypervisor.

""So the control plane of our infrastructure as a service in our new IBM Cloud is a bunch of containers orchestrated by Kubernetes"" Grama said.

A Quantum-Safe Future with IBM Cloud

One area in particular that IBM Cloud is looking at for the future is quantum computing .

""We're the only ones that are actually running a quantum computer in our cloud. Everybody else either has an emulator or it's not in the cloud"" Grama said. ""Beyond that we're doing things like providing quantum-safe libraries that can be used to build applications.""

A potential risk with quantum computing is once a powerful enough system has been built current forms of encryption will become useless. The promise of new quantum-safe cryptographic libraries is that they will help preserve security in the cloud and elsewhere before quantum computers are able to crack current encryption methods.

Looking forward Grama said IBM will likely continue to have a vertical market focus as it looks to grow its cloud adoption. In 2020 IBM announced new initiatives for the financial services market with cloud offerings that meet the requirements of that industry.

""As we go forward of course there'll be expansion because as more and more people consume the cloud we'll build more of these MZRs"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlibS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvaWJtLWNhbmFkYS8yMDIxLzAzL3dhdGVyLWFuZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWEtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtZnV0dXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM Blogs – Canada,"While Canada has a large share of the world’s freshwater threats remain to our water supply. Overuse pollution poorly managed wastewater and the growing impacts of climate change pose significant challenges. Water scarcity is also an issue in some areas with much of Canada’s freshwater draining to the north away from the 85 per cent of the population that lives within 300 kilometres of the southern border. This makes harnessing and managing our water resources difficult.

Clearly water sustainability impacts all of us but through innovation we can adapt to and develop mitigation strategies to better steward our freshwater supply. For example technological advances in artificial intelligence allow us to discover hidden insights within the multiplying sources of data derived from environmental sensing and mapping technologies. In the next decade we will advance more powerful tools and discoveries by harnessing AI and quantum computing.

Here are some examples of what IBM is doing in Canada in support of water sustainability. And there are many more examples of companies across the country contributing to this important time-sensitive cause. The common theme is that we aren’t going it alone — we continue to collaborate and work towards a shared goal that will benefit us all.

Water recycling and better data

The University of Alberta and National Research Council of Canada are applying IBM-patented nanotechnology to advance water filtration and recycling that has the potential to improve water re-use in industries such as oil and gas manufacturing and even small businesses like golf courses and car washes.

A research partnership between IBM Canada and the University of Calgary led to the development of a collaboration platform called SWIM (Sustainable Watershed Integrated Management) with the goal of improving watershed management. The tool which was built using IBM technology is being used in Calgary’s Bow River Basin to amalgamate disparate data sets and perform deep analyses to support river basin management. The next stages of this platform will infuse AI and machine learning to forecast future scenarios of change and couple land use such as agriculture to water management. As the federal government works to establish the Canada Water Agency tools such as SWIM could enhance our ability to protect conserve and understand our water resources.

Reducing water consumption

IBM’s only semiconductor assembly and testing facility in the world is in Bromont Quebec. Manufacturing is a water-intensive industry and our team has reduced water consumption by 20% since 2015 using innovative water recycling methods which translates into 12.6 million US gallons of water conservation per year (or more than 47500 cubic metres).

Indigenous knowledge and water technology

One of our P-TECH (Pathways in Technology Early College High School) educational partners Six Nations Polytechnic STEAM Academy will move forward with the launch the Ohnegi’yo Water Project with its P-TECH students. The team will be using Watson Studio to predict weather and environment conditions and students will create a dashboard artificial intelligence models and an open data source that encourages scientific technological and professional literacy all underpinned by Hodinohsó:ni values and knowledge.

Inspiring developers and young Canadians to create solutions

Today IBM launched the 2021 Call for Code Global Challenge and one of the key themes of the challenge is clean water and sanitation. Some amazing innovations have come from these challenges. For example Liquid Prep the winner of the 2019 Call for Code IBM employee challenge uses an IoT soil humidity sensor and weather data to deliver insights via a cloud-hosted mobile app. The solution is designed to help small farms know when to water crops in climate distressed areas. Developers designers and product managers in Canada are encouraged to get involved in Liquid Prep’s project via the Linux Foundation and to put forward their own great ideas for Call for Code.

IBM Canada also partners with the Aquahacking Challenge which engages young Canadians aged 18-35 to develop entrepreneurial skills and create solutions to freshwater issues. Since 2015 28 startups have been established through Aquahacking challenges across Canada.

Protecting water is our collective responsibility

At IBM Canada we believe technology is pivotal to solving challenges with clean water. We will continue be a catalyst alongside government industry and academic stakeholders providing support through our technology and expertise.

To mark World Water Day I want to encourage all of my Canadian business peers and partners to think about what more we can do. Whether it’s lending your expertise or financial support identifying opportunities to reduce water usage or enabling others with your products or services there is something all of us can do.

The thing is for reasons that we can’t quite figure out Intel actually made the MacBook Pros in its commercials look better than they do in real life as spotted by tech YouTuber Rene Ritchie.

Take a look at these two photos. The one on the left is a photo of a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip taken for The Verge’s review. The one on the right is taken from this Intel ad. Can you spot the difference?

I’ll spoil it for you: Intel’s version of the MacBook Pro has much thinner screen bezels making it a nearly edge-to-edge display. I’d love it if my MacBook’s bezels were this thin! (Though Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro doesn’t have a webcam. Bummer.)

But Intel’s fabled all-screen MacBook Pro didn’t make just one appearance. It’s also in this ad which attempts to ding the MacBook Pro for not being a 2-in-1. Look at that Mac — all screen!

Image: Intel

Intel did confirm to The Verge on Friday that it used real MacBook Pros with an M1 chip in the commercials but the company wouldn’t initially say what it may or may not have changed about them: “With respect to filming and showcasing details we’re not commenting at this time” an Intel spokesperson said.

However Intel’s Ryan Shrout confirmed a likely theory on Saturday: Intel changed the look of the MacBook Pros’ screens in post-production which had the happenstance effect of making their screens look better than they do in real life. It was a rush job apparently and they made a mistake when compositing.

(If you look at the image from the second ad you can also see some kind of blackish-haze applied over the screen which probably wouldn’t be there in reality.)

These ads in my opinion are also kind of missing the point. None of Intel’s four new commercials demonstrate how Intel’s chips can compete with the MacBook Pro’s real advantage: Apple’s speedy and battery-efficient M1 chip. (So far Intel has only produced cherry-picked benchmarks to try and hit back at the M1.) And by trying to dunk on the MacBook Pro Intel is also in a way dunking on itself since it still provides chips for some models of the Apple laptop.

And seriously doesn’t that all-screen MacBook Pro just look good?

Then hours before that piece was going live Micron announced that it was exiting the 3D XPoint business and selling its Lehi Utah fab that makes the media.

As a result we pulled the original piece to augment it with what and why Micron we think is making that announcement. In hindsight it probably should have been two articles. At the same time we are getting into a level of detail around Intel Optane Persistent Memory that is beyond most slideware but also above many detailed whitepapers. As such the complexity we planned to show in the original piece actually helps explain part of Micron’s decision.

Video Version

Since we have a lot to share we also have a video version accompanying this article. A few mid-week edits later and it mostly matches what we will cover in this piece just in video form for those who prefer to listen.

As always we suggest opening this in a separate browser tab to get the best viewing experience.

The Quick Intel Optane / 3D XPoint Background

For a bit of background with Intel Optane (the company’s marketing name for 3D XPoint-based products) we effectively get a cross somewhere between DRAM and NAND. Typically this is described as byte-addressable non-volatile memory. The basic idea is that it is a persistent storage solution similar to NAND flash that is in your SSD and DRAM memory that is the RAM in your PC. When you hear a PC has say 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD you can think of Optane as a cross between the two but that is a very simplistic view so let us get into a bit of what is going on. In practice it operates differently than many who have not used Optane PMem understand so we wanted to clear that operations part up.

First off the 3D XPoint media has a cell density between that of DRAM and NAND. As a result the idea is that we can get higher DIMM capacities than with DRAM. At the same time the structures storing data are larger than NAND so we get less capacity than NAND. This has a direct relationship with the manufacturing cost. As an in-between product 3D XPoint needs to stay somewhere in the middle since it is not always superior to DRAM (DRAM is faster) and it is also not always superior to NAND (NAND is higher capacity.) As a result as a direct replacement to either 3D XPoint needs to be somewhere in the middle unless a unique value proposition is offered.

Second in terms of endurance and performance Intel’s Optane based data center products are rated for effectively unlimited endurance. This is an exaggeration in some ways but the endurance ratings are so high that unlike with NAND endurance is not a concern. Furthermore an Optane SSD typically writes directly to media instead of a write going first to DRAM then to media. That intermittent write to DRAM is basically why the industry cares about power-loss protection for data center SSDs. If the power fails mid-write then DRAM loses contents which means data written to a NAND SSD is not safe until it makes it to the NAND. For write logs such as a ZFS ZIL/ SLOG and databases this is absolutely magic.

The byte-addressability is a big difference compared to today’s common QLC NAND. In terms of performance compared to NAND 3D XPoint is much faster in solutions especially at low queue depths and has a better quality of service because it is byte-addressable.

At the same time performance-wise 3D XPoint is still an in-between solution so not everything is perfect. It is slower in two ways compared to DRAM typically found in your DIMM sockets. First it has a higher latency because it is writing to the persistent 3D XPoint instead of DRAM. The second is one that not many discuss. The first two generations of Intel Optane DCPMM or PMem 100 and PMem 200 operate at DDR4-2666 speeds with Cascade Lake and Cooper Lake.

That is extremely important. Once you add PMem to a server the memory speed drops to DDR4-2666. So on Cascade Lake or the 2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable that means we go from 6x DDR4-2933 per socket to 6x DDR4-2666. The same happens with the DDR4-3200 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable CPUs as well. Compared to modern CPUs such as the AMD EPYC 7002/ 7003 series and the Ampere Altra as examples those are both 8x DDR4-3200. So theoretically even when we compared 2nd Gen Xeon Scalable with PMem 100 to without we only lost around 9-10% of bandwidth in our conceptual model in the table below:

Theoretical bandwidth plummets when using DCPMM/ PMem compared to the 8-channel DDR4-3200 solutions that have been in-market since at least 2019 with AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome”. Effectively the Intel-only DCPMM / PMem modules added to a system create a memory bandwidth deficit with Cascade Lake/ Cooper Lake CPUs. This combined with almost dizzying memory channel population requirements (so long we removed from this piece and an 8-minute segment from the already long video) means that just adding the PMem to a system has impacts beyond those of DRAM and NAND.

Very few folks discuss the memory speed impact but it is real and it is very easy to understand what is happening.

So why would one lose memory bandwidth and get less capacity storage to add Optane? The answer is to get a mixture of both. To look at this we need to understand what Optane is effectively doing when we add PMem modules.

Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory (PMem) Real-Life Modes

The name of this section is chosen specifically because this is how Intel often simplifies Optane to show what is going on. Intel shows Memory Mode and App Direct mode. That sounds great but in the application it is full of glorious complexity. When I first saw the slides then saw the configuration settings on systems it took a while to figure out what was happening. To Intel’s credit they do have documentation on all of this and it is more complex than what we are going into here but I wanted to give some sense of another layer down of complexity.

First one can see Memory Mode and App Direct Mode. Memory Mode is the one that is perhaps the easiest to understand and sell. Indeed I heard a lot of the early adoption was for memory mode and we are now using this in the STH hosting cluster but we are going to come back to that.

Memory Mode: Conceptually Easy Complex Implementation

Intel says Memory Mode uses the Optane PMem as memory effectively as a substitute for adding more expensive DRAM. That is a high-level abstraction and it somewhat works. I am going to offer another model which fits with the slide above but may seem strange to those who have not gotten into the details. Instead of thinking of PMem as DRAM think of PMem like a storage array where you have data on SSDs but then cache the frequent data in a systems DRAM or RAID controller DRAM. That means frequently accessed data hits fast DRAM then is periodically flushed to the underlying storage. If you are worried at this point about storing data on “memory modules” then Intel’s answer is that there is a cryptographic key that is reset every reboot so the data on the modules is so encrypted one cannot just take the modules out of a system and access the data. Everything is effectively gone every reboot.

As a result one needs to add memory alongside Optane. For performance Intel recommends a 4:1 ratio so effectively there is around 25% as much DRAM as Optane. It turns out that there are a number of research papers by hyper-scalers that show that often servers only have maybe 20-40% of data as hot and the rest is relatively cold. In other words around a quarter of data needs to be in DRAM while the remainder can be in something a bit slower in this case Optane PMem.

That ratio is a big challenge though. For example if one wants to use 128GB DIMMs with a 4:1 ratio then one needs to populate a 32GB RDIMM and a 128GB PMem module in the same memory channel. As a result the cost of the 32GB RDIMM plus 128GB PMem needs to be less than 2x 64GB which would offer the same capacity and higher performance. In our hosting nodes we tend to use 16GB + 128GB because that tends to work well and is a lot less expensive when scaled across 24 DIMM slots in a system. Just for a sense we save a few thousand dollars per node with little impact on our hosting performance with this solution.

Intel’s challenge and this gets to the profitability is that for Memory Mode pricing is constantly pressured by DRAM pricing especially when DRAM prices fall. Memory pricing is more volatile Optane PMem pricing needs to be more volatile as well. Memory Mode may be easy to understand and easy for adoption but it is constantly bound by needing to provide a discount to DRAM-only configurations.

The Persistent Bit: App Direct Mode

The way Intel gets to more value is with App Direct Mode. The easiest way to think of App Direct Mode is that you are turning each of the PMem modules into a SSD. Then comes the complexity. One way App Direct Mode can be used is via APIs with applications that support PMem. If an application is aware such as SAP HANA then the application can write to the PMem modules as if it is a super-fast storage tier. If the application is unaware then there is a fallback.

When one starts Optane PMem modules and wants to expose them as a normal block device in Storage Mode it is actually quite analogous to a SSD. Each CPU has its DCPMM/ PMem Set of modules. The modules in each Set can be grouped into Regions. Namespaces can then be created either through CLI tools or usually there are BIOS settings to do this. Those namespaces can then be exposed to the OS as block devices but there is another option for direct access (DAX) in some OSes that bypasses the traditional block set. You can look up terms such as ndctl and fsdax/ devdax for a bit more on this as the documentation is fairly good and those search terms will get you started.

The tricky part is that there is another layer of complexity that does not get discussed often. That is how you create the regions and namespaces. Optane for App Direct is roughly organized into a hierarchy:

Set – this is a “set” of DCPMM/ PMem modules that sit on a CPU socket

Region – definable grouping across one or more Optane modules

Namespace – this is similar to a NVMe SSD namespace but sits atop a region and allows one to define storage to transact on

Your options are basically that you can use individual PMem modules or you can interleave them into a region. If you interleave the modules it is like creating a large RAID 0 array of Optane P4800X/ P5800X SSDs. That is again a bit simplified but the challenge is that data is written across modules to gain performance like a RAID 0 array. If one fails then you lose data.

To counteract this there is another option. One can expose a PMem module as its own region/ namespace/ block device. Then do things such as create RAID 1 arrays with them as if they were SSDs which gets in-system redundancy. Of course doing this has a performance penalty versus the persistent interleaving modes. Also if one mirrors across sockets then that has to traverse the UPI links adding to latency until it is complete.

So the challenge is that to keep the module fast we would want to interleave using a region across a CPU’s Set of PMem modules. Then we are at risk of losing data so we then need to go to a lower performance state to get redundancy within a system. We can mirror data and transactions across a network to other systems but that is another layer of complexity especially at the speed of Optane DIMMs.

In App Direct/ Storage Mode the DRAM functions as normal DRAM and we get fairly pure access to the Optane DIMMs. Our capacity is close to the Optane DIMM capacity as persistent storage (App Direct) and memory which is close to the DRAM capacity in the system. There are overheads but that is the conceptual model you can use. Then things get more complex.

Glorious Complexity: Mixed Mode

There is one other mode called “Mixed Mode.” This is exactly how it sounds and allows one to access all of the complexity of Memory Mode while also not missing out on the complexity of App Direct mode. In other words you can do both on the same system at the same time. One can provision say a third of our capacity for App Direct/ Storage while the remaining two-thirds are used for Memory Mode. In our 12x 16GB + 12x 128GB DCPMM example we would then have around 0.5TB per socket reserved for Memory Mode for around a 5:1 DRAM to Optane ratio. The remaining 0.25TB per CPU can now be a set used to create regions and namespaces.

How one does this is by setting a “slider” where one sets how much of the capacity is set aside for Memory Mode with the remainder being set aside for App Direct use. Software determines how much goes to each pool and takes care of the alignment/ rounding. One will note here that we are showing this using Supermicro BIOS but there are CLI tools that handle all of this and can do more granular controls (you can see “Create goal config for Platform” as an example.)

Mixed Mode is a cool feature but now we are using the Optane DIMMs for the cold portion of main memory plus the storage so there can be a performance impact. The first application where we used this was to carve out ZIL/ SLOG space which had a small capacity impact but meant we could have another drive free and get the benefits of a fast ZIL/ SLOG device. Since that has modest capacity requirements it not only freed a drive bay but also saved us from having to spend hundreds of dollars per machine to get drives like the Intel Optane DC P4801X 100GB U.2 NVMe SSD Log Option. We have found that Optane in general is an awesome SLOG/ ZIL solution for those running ZFS arrays.

Sure it is complex but it is also extremely useful. Using Mixed Mode to add mirrored write cache devices while simultaneously getting lower-cost memory expansion is immensely powerful leading to our statement around “glorious complexity.”

With that background let us get to the Micron announcement where they are discontinuing the 3D XPoint program.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9leGNsdXNpdmUtaW50ZWwtMTJ0aC1nZW4tY29yZS1hbGRlci1sYWtlLXMtcGxhdGZvcm0tZGV0YWlsZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Exclusive: Intel 12th Gen Core ""Alder Lake-S"" platform detailed","Intel Alder Lake up to 20% single-thread performance uplift

We have received the first details on Alder Lake-S the upcoming desktop and mobile platform from Intel.

The slides confirm the most important aspects of the new architecture including desktop and mobile platforms. First and foremost Intel claims up to 20% single-thread performance uplift with its new Golden Cove core design. We are not sure if the baseline for this claim is Rocket Lake or Tiger Lake though.

Furthermore Intel claims that the Alder Lake processors will be twice as fast in multi-threaded workloads. This is where Intel mentions its new high-efficiency Gracemont cores and silicon built-in hardware-guided scheduling. The 10nm Enhanced Superfin CPU series will feature Intel Hybrid Technology with small (high-efficiency) and big cores (high-performance). The slide actually features a block diagram with the CPU which confirms that the full chip is to offer up to 8 Golden Cove big cores and up to 8 Gracemont small cores.

The slide also confirms that Alder Lake will support PCI Express Gen5 and Gen4. There is also a confirmation on DDR5 and DDR4 support the platform will actually support both memory technologies at the same time. For mobile Alder Lake Intel also confirms LPDDR4 and LPDDR5 support. We have recently revealed that Raptor Lake a successor to Alder Lake will extend the memory support to LPDDR5X.

We also have the first details on Intel 600 series chipset. The new desktop CPUs will support up to dual-channel DDR5-4800 memory. The DDR4-capable motherboards will support up to 3200 MHz modules. We were told that high-end Z690 motherboards are to offer DDR5 support whereas cheaper variants would rely on DDR4. This gives Intel and motherboard makers flexibility when it comes to uncertain DDR5 mass production.

Another big upgrade is support for PCI Gen5. The CPU will have 16 PCI Gen5 capable lanes and also 4 lanes in PCI Gen4 standard. The chipset itself will also support Gen4 and Gen3. Finally Direct Media Interface (DMI) has been upgraded to Gen4. The upcoming 500 series chipset for Rocket Lake already expanded the width to 8 lanes but is still based on Gen3 like 400-series chipsets for Comet Lake.

The 600 series motherboards will feature a new socket type called LGA1700. The shape of the CPU package has changed which will render all existing cooling solutions for LGA115X and LGA1200 unfit for the new CPU series.

Intel already confirmed that the Alder Lake series are scheduled to launch this year but the company did not reveal if that means the desktop or mobile series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0ludGVsLXMtbmV3LWFudGktTWFjLWFkdmVydHMtYXJlLWhpbGFyaW91cy1idXQtZm9yLWFsbC10aGUtd3JvbmctcmVhc29ucy41Mjg2NjAuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's new anti-Mac adverts are hilarious - but for all the wrong reasons,"



After viewing it’s plain to see why so many commenters are going with the word “desperate” to describe Intel's ad strategy here although Justin does do an admirable job of portraying a hapless simpleton who likely pictures a male sheep when someone mentions RAM. The tone used by Team Blue here is too cartoonish – you almost expect Justin Long to slip on an apple while walking over to the MacBook or receive a digital pie in the face when trying to use iOS.

Unsurprisingly the campaign appears to have misfired so far with the videos already amassing more dislikes than likes on YouTube. Intel should be focusing more on producing consumer and prosumer market-attractive processors and less on taking cheap and unwittingly hilarious digs at a competitor that has already impressed with its first-generation silicon output. But it seems the best Team Blue can do right now is hope viewers will copy Justin by going into electronics stores and opining “Oh and there’s Intel nice”."

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Story continues

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

Globalization was also presumed to have a flattening effect; power in a globalized world would be more diffuse and less centralized around just one or two actors.

In a groundbreaking 2019 academic paper published in the journal International Security Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman push back against that idea. In the paper “Weaponized Interdependence” they show how the process of economic integration — the networking of the word — in fact created centralized hubs around which power is concentrated. The country that controls those hubs can exploit its position to pursue its foreign policy goals.

In practice the authors show how the United States has used its central position in the global financial system and in the architecture of the Internet to compel foreign adversaries. Their paper offers a new lens with which to understand globalization and geo-politics and was so well received that it was turned into a book published in February in which several authors build upon the theory.

The co-editor of the new book The Uses and Abuses of Weaponized Interdependence is Daniel Drezner. He is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a contributing editor at The Washington Post. We kick with a few key definitions including what we mean by “weaponized interdependence” and then discuss how this concept has been applied in practice principally by the United States and what this means for potential great power competition between the United States and China.

Forests cover one third of the Earth’s land mass performing vital functions around the world. Around 1.6 billion people – including more than 2000 indigenous cultures – depend on forests for their livelihoods medicines fuel food and shelter.

Forests are the most biologically-diverse ecosystems on land home to more than 80% of the terrestrial species of animals plants and insects. Yet despite all of these priceless ecological economic social and health benefits global deforestation continues at an alarming rate.

The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 21 March the International Day of Forests in 2012. The Day celebrates and raises awareness of the importance of all types of forests. On each International Day of Forests countries are encouraged to undertake local national and international efforts to organize activities involving forests and trees such as tree planting campaigns.

2021 Theme

The theme for 2021 is “Forest restoration: a path to recovery and well-being”. Restoring forests helps build a healthier world for ourselves and for future generations. By replanting and managing forests sustainably we can help preserve our planet’s biodiversity and combat climate change while fostering economic activity that creates jobs and improves lives as we enter the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).

Launched by the government of Germany and IUCN the Bonn Challenge is a global goal to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. It unites nations and regions in bringing landscapes into restoration to halt and reverse the effects of land degradation. At present pledges cover 210.12 million hectares with more than 61 countries involved.

Importance of Forests

According to UN-REDD forests are home to about 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and an estimated 1.6 billion people use forests for all or part of their livelihoods such as food shelter energy and income. Millions including people in cities depend on forest resources for clean air and fresh water.

During the day trees absorb carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and give out oxygen the air that we breathe. The carbon in forests exceeds the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere. Forests and forest soils store more than one trillion tonnes of carbon.

Hence forests play a crucial role in fighting catastrophic climate change by absorbing and storing massive amounts of CO2. In addition trees could reduce temperatures in cities up to 8°C lowering use of air conditioning and related emissions by up to 40%. But as we cut them down oftentimes to make space for agriculture they lose their ability to regulate the global climate.

During heavy rains trees reduce the risk of flooding. Experts say that woodland acts as a barrier to floodwater while trees also prevent soil erosion reducing sediment going into rivers and increasing water absorption into the ground. Forests can also retain excess rainwater prevent extreme run-offs and reduce the damage of flooding. They can also help mitigate the effects of droughts by releasing water in the dry season forests can also help provide clean water and mitigate the effects of droughts.

Furthermore more than a quarter of modern medicines worth an estimated US$ 108 billion a year originate from tropical forest plants.

Global Distribution of Forests

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicates in its 2020 Report “The State of the World’s Forests” that the total forest area is 4.06 billion hectares or approximately 5000m2 (or 50 x 100m) per person but forests are not equally distributed around the globe.

More than half of the world’s forests are found in only five countries (the Russian Federation Brazil Canada the United States of America and China) and two-thirds (66 percent) of forests are found in ten countries.

Build Back Better and Greener

Forests through their ecosystem services are a key nature-based solution for rebuilding the global economy post-pandemic in a way that preserves nature while fostering growth. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) provides some key insights on how forests can help make us more resilient in the longer term.

Leon Neal | Getty Images

Has British Prime Minister Boris Johnson finally found his country the global role that has eluded it since it lost its empire? Has the irreverent ambitious moppy-haired leader of the United Kingdom — the biographer admirer and sometimes emulator of Winston Churchill — provided the blueprint for his own shot at greatness? Or are Johnson's critics right that this week's release of ""Global Britain in a Competitive Age"" — the impressive 114-page guidance for the future from Her Majesty's Government — is brave but insufficient cover for the historic Brexit blunder that will forever stain his legacy? One thing is for sure. This document came as a welcome reminder of British strategic seriousness following further yammering about national decline after Oprah Winfrey's sit-down with rogue royals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (which included a visit to their California farm and its rescue chickens). Johnson's paper also comes as a belated effort to answer Dean Acheson's stinging West Point speech of nearly six decades ago in 1962 where he argued: ""Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role.""

At the time the legendary U.S. diplomat was praising the ""vast importance"" of the UK's application to become part of the then-six country European Common Market which it would only join eleven years later in 1973. His words humiliated then-British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and electrified the Fleet Street media. ""The attempt to play a separate power role"" said Acheson ""that is a role apart from Europe a role based on a 'special relationship' with the United States a role based in being head of a 'commonwealth' which has no political structure or unity or strength – this role is about played out."" One wonders what Acheson would say today more than a year after the United Kingdom left the European Union 47 years after it joined and with its current Prime Minister Boris Johnson searching yet again now for that elusive role. It is a fair bet he would be encouraged by the Integrated Review's ambition clarity and detail. Though at the same time he would question how little attention it gives to what he considered the central role of the European dimension to Great Britain's role. Perhaps the pain of divorce remains too near for sound reflection. Still this paper takes the United Kingdom in great many of the right directions that could ensure its outsized global role as a medium-sized European country with world-leading security and intelligence agencies. It also shows a keen understanding of the most pressing global challenges making it must-reading for Biden administration officials. It's inspiring as a rallying point for fellow democratic countries.

""History has shown that democratic societies are the strongest supporters of an open and resilient international order"" wrote Johnson in the paper's forward ""in which global institutions prove their ability to protect human rights manage tensions between great powers address conflict instability and climate change and share prosperity through trade and investment."" Most notable among Johnson's new ambitions for Great Britain as he put it in his foreword for the paper is to ""secure our status as a Science and Tech Superpower by 2030."" Eight pages detail how the U.K. intends to do that by expanding research and development spending bolstering its global network of innovation partnerships and improving national skills – including though a Global Talent Visa to attract the world's best and brightest. ""In the years ahead countries which establish a leading role in critical and emerging technologies will be at the forefront of global leadership"" the paper says identifying quantum computing artificial intelligence and cyber domains as areas of focus. Without dusting off the overused term ""special relationship"" the U.K. would place highest priority on ties with the United States (""none more valuable to the British people"") while at the same time ""tilt"" its international focus toward the Indo-Pacific. Johnson has invited the leaders of Australia South Korea and India to attend his G7 summit in June and he is visiting India in April to step up efforts to deepen relations with the world's largest democracy which was under the British Raj until 1947. There is much more in the pages of what is being billed as the U.K.'s most significant strategic rethink since the Cold War which will be followed this week by its military dimension. The bumper sticker is that the U.K. will be ""a problem solving and burden-sharing nation with a global perspective.""

INTU,Intuit,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzg5OTgzMSwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intuit Israel: “We are at times referred to as the best-kept secret in the tech industry” | Ctech,"One of the toughest challenges for companies is competing against each other for the top talent that exists in ecosystems. However a company like Intuit has an added disadvantage: despite being a global Fortune 500 company it doesn’t operate in Israel and can’t rely on its local reputation.

“Our leading products - TurboTax Mint Quickbooks and Credit Karma - are not sold locally which affects how the local market interacts with our brand” explained Intuit Israel’s Sivan Geva Communications Leader Intuit Israel and Office of the CISO at Intuit. “This in a nutshell is our challenge - how do we excite potential talent if they are not familiar with our products? And how do we engage our employees and make sure they are proud of their work and Intuit even if those around them aren’t quite as familiar?”

Intuit Israel joined CTech to share some of the Employer Branding strategies it adopted to help attract local talent to its global workforce.

General Info and Company Details:

Intuit is a global technology platform that helps our customers and communities overcome their most important financial challenges. Serving millions of customers worldwide with TurboTax QuickBooks Credit Karma and Mint we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to prosper and we work tirelessly to find new innovative ways to deliver on this belief. Intuit’s innovative ecosystem of financial management solutions serves partners and 50 million customers worldwide unleashing the power of many for the prosperity of one. Intuit Israel began its journey in 2014 with the acquisition of two local startups Check and Porticor. In 2016 the local site was officially declared as Intuit’s second development center outside of the U.S. Today the Petach Tikva site employs about 220 people and focuses on Trust Data and Deep Insight.

Description of the Problem:

Intuit is a Fortune 500 tech giant focusing on providing financial solutions to over 50 million customers worldwide and has a global employee force of nearly 11000. We have been awarded top rankings in Forbes Fortune  and Dun's  and we have gotten here thanks to the fact we place our employees first. We even have a saying: “Shareholders are like food - critical to your survival but you can go three weeks without food. Customers and partners are like water - you can go three days without liquid. However employees are like air - three minutes and you are done.”

Additionally we put abundant emphasis on Women in Tech and have our 37% stat to show for it (industry average is ~30%). We provide endless opportunities to grow and change learn from our colleagues (when the world allows it fly Business across the globe to meet them!) and provide wonderful compensation and benefits (from RSUs and ESPP to private medical insurance for our employees and their families).

And yet here locally we are at times referred to as the best-kept secret in the tech industry. Our leading products - TurboTax Mint Quickbooks and Credit Karma - are not sold locally which affects how the local market interacts with our brand. This in a nutshell is our challenge - how do we excite potential talent if they are not familiar with our products? And how do we engage our employees and make sure they are proud of their work and Intuit even if those around them aren’t quite as familiar? For this precise reason we make sure our employees are able to see how their work affects all 50 million customers directly.

At a time where people all over the world are looking to work for companies that ‘do good’ and help humanity (as opposed to companies in the adtech or gaming industry which help businesses get consumers to spend more) Intuit is focused on ‘Powering prosperity around the world.’ This means we help small businesses and the self-employed to earn more manage their finances and save time while doing so. Therefore in parallel to ensuring our employees understand the impact of their work we placed great importance on building our local tech brand. However those who are familiar with Intuit and our products easily vouch for our cutting-edge technology innovative state of mind and exceptional benefits.

Presenting a Refined Solution:

In my role as Head of Internal and External Communications for the Israel site I dedicate a lot of thought to how we are perceived internally and externally. Employer branding is a segment of my role but overall I divide my time between four categories: internal-local internal-global external and localizing Intuit-wide programs.

Before spreading our wings externally we needed to map out our internal identity. This is where internal-local branding comes into play - while we are a limb of the Intuit brand we are fully functioning and have established a strong identity for our site. With internal-global the main task is to promote our site’s wonderful achievements and emphasize the opportunities that could arise given the support and resources necessary from our overseas sisters’ sites and headquarters.

Once our accomplishments rose to the surface there was no question that Israel’s talent is worth a substantial investment - and that’s when we started hiring at full speed. It was important for us to understand what matters most to the people we’re interested in hiring. Blind surveys were sent out to test what candidates know of our brand how familiar they are with our competitors what is important to them in their place of employment as well as what they read and in what circles they run.

We learned for example that 54% of respondents desire to work for global tech companies solely (or have a preference for global tech companies over startups). As a matter of fact only 18% indicated that they are solely or mainly interested in working for startups. It was also important for us to get the word out about how we truly are a great company regardless of size and that we take a lot of pride in being a favored professional environment for both women and parents. It is our culture that positions our employees above all.

Finally we formulated a solution that recruited our employees to be an integral part of our branding efforts. We currently have two functioning programs across Intuit Israel - Technically Speaking and Technically Writing. These programs are unique in that they provide our tech ambassadors with one-on-one public speaking coaching self-marketing training event scouting assistance writing support and more. The first consists of having our top talent attend conferences speak at various functions and take an active role in being the face of our company while advancing our technological innovations. The second is purely print and requires that these same individuals share Intuit’s internal research and ground-breaking findings through written thought pieces and featured content.

Challenges due to Covid-19:

Our top priority is protecting the health and safety of our employees while attending to the needs of our customers worldwide. This is not a motto we chant carelessly as we practice what we preach: Intuit was among the first companies to shut their doors when the pandemic started and by the looks of things we will also be one of the last.

Although working from home required some preparation the process didn’t affect our workflow as we were already pretty digitized to begin with. A recent Glassdoor survey revealed that 87% of employees expect their employer to support them in balancing work and personal commitments. This preference was always one of Intuit’s strong suits and when working remotely became a deadline-free fact we faced this reality by offering our employees benefits such as sending them an unlimited budget to acquire all the equipment they need to make their home a suitable place to work reimbursing their WiFi expenses childcare support and home cleaning services.

Additionally we provided six recharge days and 10 paid vacation days to help take care of family members during Covid-19 (on top of the generous amounts of sick and leave days provided for any reason). And we declared a company-wide shut down for 10 days during the holiday season - this was a true game-changer as it allowed everyone to disconnect and be present in their home-life. We introduced a new service enabling remote doctor consultation visits offered confidential counseling through licensed mental health providers offered flu shots as part of our bi-annual medical check-ups arranged for guest speakers to provide health tips suitable exactly for a time such as this (from working out and cooking to dietary and mental health) and hosted fun events for sole entertainment purposes.

Our employees were beyond proud to participate in an Intuit-financed GoFundMe initiative to help small businesses raise money and overcome the challenges caused by Covid-19. This initiative raised morale among our employees as they got to play an instrumental part in supporting our nation. Intuit's promise to double the sum raised by the employees resulted in a substantial amount donated to small local businesses and Magen David Adom (Israel’s emergency health services).

As for new employees our unique recruitment and candidate management process called A4A (Assessing-for-Awesome) had to be adjusted to this new era. And so although we could no longer invite candidates to our brand new beautiful offices we adapted our process to Zoom and made sure our culture was felt virtually. Thankfully this unique procedure is already fundamentally different in the most positive sense (guarantees a next-day decision for example) and so candidates understood they were interviewing for a different type of company regardless of Covid-19 restrictions.

Conclusions:

Understanding who we are and what we need to do in order to establish our site’s identity (“Trust Data and Deep Insight”) was an absolute must as it enabled us to get to where we are today. As a Senior Leadership Team member I can safely say that this focus was and is to this day implemented through every action we take and decision we make. It was a strategic and conscious resolution to brand Intuit Israel clearly and effectively as well as provide a meaningful framework for our employees.

Lastly processes such as finding the right balance between internal and external communications were of great importance as was enabling our cherry-picked employees to prosper individually. The mere understanding that we trust each member of Intuit Israel to make decisions learn and soar directly resulted in Intuit’s growth as a whole. There’s no question that Covid-19 is still a thing of the present and as such the workplace of the future will need to adapt. However just as it did before this pandemic Intuit will continue to place its employees at the center and their safety and security as our top priority.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIxL3RheC1zZWFzb24taXJzLXBhbmRlbWlj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One of the most complex tax seasons ever,"This year's tax season is shaping up to be a gnarly one. The IRS has agreed to give Americans an extra month to file their taxes — but that's barely going to be enough to help them and their accountants when it comes to navigating the new code. Why it matters: The U.S. tax filing system is painful and complex — largely by design.

State of play: The new changes to the tax code include everything from health care costs to the child tax credit — all happening during a year when the pandemic caused millions of Americans to have more complex financial lives than usual thanks to job losses unemployment insurance stimulus checks and the like.

Tax season also might be the first time that people find out they’ve been the victim of unemployment fraud.

What they're saying: This year ""really has been much more complicated"" than usual says Julio Gonzalez CEO of Engineered Tax Services. ""We weren’t sure if stimulus checks would be taxable. We had so many individual changes. It's been very challenging.""

Details: The code changes need to be turned into explicit guidance from the IRS and reflected in updated tax-filing software. None of that has happened yet.

The updated software is expected to arrive in the coming week although that just applies to federal taxes. State and local taxes are still in a gray zone — and it's not even clear that all states will follow the feds' lead and allow an extension to May 17.

is expected to arrive in the coming week although that just applies to federal taxes. State and local taxes are still in a gray zone — and it's not even clear that all states will follow the feds' lead and allow an extension to May 17. The extension gives accountants time to start reading through the new IRS guidance for 2020 to train up their staff and to make good estimates for how much tax will be due.

gives accountants time to start reading through the new IRS guidance for 2020 to train up their staff and to make good estimates for how much tax will be due. While estimated payments for 2020 are due in May final returns can now be filed in October at which point there should be a lot more clarity at both the federal and state level.

The big picture: Tax filing can be simple free and automatic. Countries like the U.K. and Spain have ""return-free filing"" for most taxpayers where they don't need to file anything at all.

The government knows its own tax code and knows how much you've earned which means that for most normal employees it should be able to work out how much they owe on its own.

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Six months after his release on parole in the 1992 killings of his parents in Woodland Park Ind says the notoriety he gained as a “broken” 15-year-old has made it difficult to grasp the second chance he has longed for.

“Door after door slammed in (my) face” he said recounting faltering attempts to explain his criminal history to potential landlords and employers.

Now 43 and living alone in an apartment near Denver Ind was released from Sterling Correctional Facility in northeast Colorado late last September — four years after a judge ruled that his former attorney had improperly kept him from testifying at his nationally watched 1994 trial in the deaths of Pamela and Kermode Jordan his mother and stepfather.

Under her ruling Denver District Judge Jane Tidball overturned his first-degree murder convictions and ordered that he receive a new trial. Instead Ind pleaded guilty in November 2017 to reduced charges of second-degree murder. He was later resentenced to a 60-year term leaving him eligible for parole after factoring in time served and credit for good behavior.

Ind’s release on parole was approved on his second attempt under his new sentence setting up his Sept. 24 release.

After entering the prison system at 17 and growing up within its walls Ind recalled the day of his release as “surreal” partly because he was dressed in blue polo shirt and khaki pants — “real-world clothes” after decades in a jumpsuit.

A van shuttled him to the prison’s public parking lot and he got out to greet his father Charles Ind of Washington and Jacob Ind’s wife of three years Denise. The Northern Ireland native had started writing to Ind in prison after seeing a television news documentary about his trial and romance took hold as she aided his efforts at getting released. Before Ind’s parole their only in-person contact with one another came at his first parole hearing more than a year earlier.

“It was awesome. I got a big ol' hug” Ind said. “I got my stuff in the van and we took off and I was sitting in the back seat and got to hold her hand and I was not letting go.”

Ind’s two murder trials — one a mistrial — made national news but there was no media attention as the trio left prison grounds.

Ind said a parole document cited “COVID considerations” among reasons for his parole approval but that it didn’t elaborate.

“They were trying to reduce population and I think that helped” Ind said. The Colorado Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for parole documents the newspaper lodged on March 1 and a department spokeswoman referred further questions to the parole board whose members couldn’t be reached.

After his release Ind’s wife who lives in the United Kingdom remained in Colorado under a 90-day visa to help him get his life started again. Ind said she ultimately rented the apartment where he now lives after the couple were rejected by multiple landlords who said they don’t rent to felons.

Ind works in retail though he won’t say more for fear that attention could cost him his job.

Ind had to walk away from a well-paying job handling packages because late-night hours conflicted with his parole requirements. A grocery store that hired him despite his murder convictions later changed course and terminated him after the store's parent company learned of his past. His current employer didn’t do a background check leaving him fearful of their reaction should they find out.

For felons getting by after prison is “extraordinarily difficult” Ind said. “They generally lack credit history they have no renter’s history there’s hurdle after hurdle to go through and a lot of places will not accept felons.”

Ind argued at trial that he killed his mother and stepfather in self defense after a lifetime of sexual and physical abuse — an account that hasn’t changed and that prosecutors still reject.

During his 2018 resentencing hearing prosecutor Beth Reed said Ind made no such allegations to Woodland Park police after the murders nor to the treatment professionals who evaluated him. She said the District Attorney’s Office agreed to plea talks partly at the urging of some of Ind’s relatives whom she said wanted to move on and partly in recognition of changing attitudes regarding sentences for youthful killers.

Reed emphasized that the two were attacked in bed and shot stabbed and sprayed with bear mace by Ind and an accomplice — calling it “a premeditated violent disgusting choice.”

Ind plotted for three months how to commit the crimes Reed told the judge and followed through only after enlisting a troubled classmate Gabriel “Major” Adams 18 whom she said was likely mentally ill. Adams was convicted of first-degree murder at a separate trial and sentenced to life in prison. He committed suicide in prison in 2014.

Ind’s brother Charles Ind has corroborated his reports of physical and sexual abuse in the Ind household and one of Pamela Jordan’s sisters described a cold unloving atmosphere in the home and said she believed the abuse occurred.

Ind who says he wanted only “to escape an impossible situation” says he tried to confide in a teacher but that his comments about his troubled home life didn’t trigger the attention he had hoped.

He scoffs at the suggestion he should have gone further in trying to report the abuse — saying he’d been “brainwashed” into believing his parents had “godlike powers of control.”

“It’s hard for a grown adult in a therapy session to talk about that stuff. Or to talk about that stuff to a loved one — let alone to a complete and total stranger as a child while you’re still going through it” he said. “It’s completely unreasonable to expect it.”

Ind said he should have been tried as a juvenile and received the treatment he needed.

During his years of incarceration Ind received a paralegal certificate and earned a Ph.D in theology his lawyer said always believing he would one day be released. His story was profiled in a 2007 PBS Frontline documentary about people serving life sentences for crimes committed as children.

A 2012 Supreme Court Case Miller vs. Alabama found that life sentences for children without the possibility of parole violated the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The ruling guaranteed Ind a shot at parole though it was Tidball’s 2017 finding of ineffective assistance of counsel that overturned his 1994 convictions and hastened his release.

Ind was among 48 so-called “juvenile lifers” in Colorado who suddenly had a path to release. He said he doesn’t like being associated with the others.

“I always had a problem having my case lumped in with the rest of the juvenile lifers” he said. “I didn’t go kill somebody because I wanted the light to go out in their eyes. I wasn’t a criminal scum bag going around committing criminal acts and ended up killing someone along the way. I literally was defending myself.”

If Ind lost a loved one to violence it wouldn’t matter if the person who did it “was 15 or 26” he said.

“The effect on my life is the same and I would still want the other person not to get out” Ind said describing as “monsters” some of the other inmates serving life terms in Colorado for crimes they committed as juveniles.

Before his resentencing Ind tried to fire his court-appointed attorney Nicole Mooney of Denver arguing in part that she was more committed to what Ind called the “cause” of sentencing reform and that she failed to represent his case on its merits.

Ind said he pleaded guilty in part because he had no confidence that Mooney and her co-counsel Michael Juba of Denver would “present my case correctly.”

“I’m not their poster child” Ind said. “I’m not their example.”

A judge rejected Ind’s request and found he was partly to blame for some of the miscommunication he had complained about.

Juba and Mooney declined to respond to Ind's comments citing attorney-client privilege.

“We were both happy to hear that Mr. Ind was released on parole and we wish him the best in the future” Juba said in a joint statement.

With his wife again living abroad Ind says he’s consumed with short-term goals — finding a better paying job or buying a house instead of renting.

His “super long-term goal” he says is to move to the United Kingdom.

“That’s where my wife’s family is and where her kid’s family is” he said. “I would love to get a fresh start there where people don’t know me as my crime and just know me as Denise’s husband. It’s a beautiful country. I just need a good place to get a fresh start.”

Ind’s sentence discharge date is in November 2046 prison records show and immigration law experts say that his effort to gain lawful entry into the UK is likely to face headwinds.

“It’s going to be an uphill battle” said Stephanie Izaguirre an immigration lawyer in Colorado Springs. “There’s no guarantee that you’re going to succeed.”

No stranger to long odds Ind said he will petition to have his convictions treated as juvenile offenses recognizing that his fight isn’t over.

“By no means is it a guarantee for me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL21sYi9pbnNpZGVyL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzExMDEyNzkvaG93LWphY29iLWRlZ3JvbS12ZWxvY2l0eS1pbmNyZWFzZXMtZXZlbi1hZ2UtZG9lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Jacob deGrom's velocity increases even as his age does,"Because Nolan Ryan pitched so well for so long he was for many years a working model for what the ultimate pitcher's body might look like. He had those powerful legs anchoring a compact fluid delivery. He is thought to have touched 100 mph in an era when hard throwers were the guys hitting 90 mph. Ryan amassed 5714 strikeouts in the big leagues. As Justin Verlander noted Ryan maintained his status as a power pitcher throughout his entire 27-year career.

But this generation's ultimate pitcher's body might belong to the Mets' Jacob deGrom -- 6-foot-4 and angular a human rubber band with flexibility and elasticity. Even at 32 years old he still seems to be finding physiological levers that enable him to throw a little harder and make the ball move a little more. Second baseman Jeff McNeil acknowledged that after deGrom throws a good fastball McNeil will turn and peek at the scoreboard to see a velocity reading. The other day deGrom's fastball was clocked at 102 mph.

To put that number into perspective: In deGrom's first year in the majors his average fastball velocity was 93.5 mph. That number has continued to climb year after year.

2015: 95 mph

2016: 93.4 mph

2017: 95.2 mph

2018: 96 mph

2019: 96.9 mph

2020: 98.6 mph

His average velocity was the highest in baseball last year but deGrom's power preeminence was even more pronounced with his slider. Among pitchers who qualified for the ERA title deGrom threw his slider nearly 3 mph harder than anyone else.

Fastest sliders

Lee Singer of ESPN Stats & Information sent along these thoughts about deGrom's velocity:

""DeGrom is one of 11 pitchers in the pitch-tracking era to increase their average fastball velocity as a starter in four-plus straight seasons (again no minimum number of pitches or innings). As you can see below most of these guys are not really comparable to deGrom as they either didn't throw as hard to begin with didn't increase their velocity as much over the span or didn't have a full workload every season. The years listed are the years the velocity grew. So it's four increases for deGrom from 2016-20.""

Most consecutive years increasing average fastball velocity as starter (since 2009) Years Player Consecutive seasons Start End 2008-13 J.A. Happ 6 89.0 93.3 2010-15 Mike Leake 5 89.2 91.5 2008-13 Anibal Sanchez 5 90.7 93.8 2016-20 Jacob deGrom 4 94.0 98.5 2016-20 German Marquez 4 93.8 95.8 2016-20 Alex Cobb 4 91.0 92.6 2016-20 Luke Weaver 4 92.5 94.1 2014-18 Charlie Morton 4 91.7 95.7 2014-18 Dan Straily 4 88.9 90.4 2010-14 Chris Capuano 4 87.7 89.7 2008-12 Cliff Lee 4 91.3 92.3

Singer continued: ""Another way of looking at this is seeing where the total increase ranks over a five-year span. In the pitch-tracking era (since 2008) no starter has increased their average fastball velocity more in a 5-year span than deGrom (min. 2 starts each season).""

Biggest average fastball increase in 5-year span as starter (since 2008) Years Pitcher Increase 2016-20 Jacob deGrom +4.5 2014-18 Charlie Morton +4.0 2008-12 Gio Gonzalez +3.4 Minimum two starts each season

I asked Jeremy Hefner the Mets' pitching coach how he thinks deGrom has continued to add velocity.

""Not easily answered"" he responded. ""However I do have a theory.""

Hefner noted deGrom's unusual path to pitching -- he was a college shortstop who nudged into his pitching in his last year at Stetson rather than having a lifetime of innings.

""I believe that his throwing age -- not as many innings as other guys at this point in his career -- and his attention to detail in refining his mechanics are the key contributors"" Hefner said.

Hefner cited the advances in recovery modalities for starting pitchers and how deGrom has used the available technology to maximize the potential of each of his pitches.

""However in my opinion that's not contributing a larger percentage"" Hefner said.

""The physiology question is a bit simpler. He is a very loose mover -- think Gumby -- but can create good tension throughout his delivery to maximize the whip he was naturally born with. Because he is able to control it repeat it (generally) and has long levers we can see the velocity trending upward.

""It's crazy to say but he is getting better where most pitchers his age are trying to hold on or reinvent themselves.""

DeGrom will be on the mound for the Mets' season opener against the Nationals and Max Scherzer on April 1 (7 ET ESPN).

The ongoing universal DH problem

Only 11 days remain before Opening Day and National League teams continue to operate out of necessity as if there is going to be no universal designated hitter. Every day that passes without Major League Baseball surrendering to the players' association on the DH issue is another day of unnecessary injury risk for National League pitchers another day bypassing what just about everybody on both sides recognizes as a product enhancement. The overlords of the sport want more action and the universal DH could increase action unless your definition of action is seeing pitchers bunt or strike out on five pitches instead of three.

MLB's negotiation team wanted the union to swap something in return for the universal DH. While you could argue that the players' association's refusal to do so hurt individual players like Marcell Ozuna in free agency over the winter the fact is that the union didn't budge. Now MLB is left with a choice whether to implement the DH for 2021 or not. Refusing to do so changes nothing about the sport's toxic labor relations. Refusing to do so would be a manifestation of stubbornness with no big-picture benefit for the sport and would tee up the commissioner for a tidal wave of criticism if and when some pitcher suffers a major injury running the bases or hitting. Commissioner Rob Manfred is the anointed leader of the group that has the power to push through the DH. Fair or not he would be blamed for clinging to dispensable conditions that almost nobody wants and almost everybody assumes will be obsolete after the next labor agreement. If someone like deGrom or Scherzer gets hurt on the bases or in the batter's box the fallout for Manfred would be enormous.

Karl Ravech and I talked about the DH issue and the limits of Manfred's power on Friday's podcast before a conversation with Pete Alonso and Todd Radom's ""Forgotten Franchise"" segment.

Those hoping for a universal DH

The teams that would most benefit if there is a decision at the start of the season to institute a designated hitter for the National League:

1. New York Mets

Dom Smith mashed last season and posted a .993 OPS. The fact that he's left-handed helps to balance out what appears to be a spectacularly deep lineup. But in left field he is a first baseman doing the best he can. If a DH is added it would allow Smith to remain in the lineup in late innings and give the Mets the opportunity to play a stronger defender in left. Their best defensive outfield might include Brandon Nimmo Albert Almora Jr. and Kevin Pillar.

2. Atlanta Braves

They could immediately move Marcell Ozuna into the DH role and strengthen their outfield defense behind what should be a really good pitching staff -- although the Braves don't really have an obvious candidate like they did last year to absorb the available at-bats in left field in the way that Adam Duvall did. But the Braves presumably could find another thumper before the trade deadline to stick in left.

3. Washington Nationals

The perception of other teams is that Washington's defense is going to be a real problem. If the DH is added then one of the weaker everyday defenders (Kyle Schwarber?) could stay in the dugout.

4. Los Angeles Dodgers

No roster is deeper. The Dodgers could utilize the DH by deploying Will Smith in the spot on the days that Austin Barnes catches or go with Justin Turner on a day when he's not at third base or Max Muncy or A.J. Pollock or Matt Beaty.

5. St. Louis Cardinals

Matt Carpenter is under contract for $18.5 million this year. Unless there is a DH it's hard to see a way for the veteran to get regular plate appearances because St. Louis is well covered at the corners -- with first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and third baseman Nolan Arenado. Manager Mike Shildt has already ruled out the outfield as a possibility for Carpenter. So Carpenter could really use a DH in the NL in order to extend his career as a regular.

Yankees' rotation shaping up

The truth is the Yankees had absolutely no idea what to expect from Domingo German this spring as he returned from what turned out to be an 18-month suspension under baseball's domestic violence policy. His occasional social media contributions suggesting that his career might be over only added to their uncertainty. But as one evaluator said it's as if German never missed any time. He has been crisp in his stuff and in his command this spring throwing hard and locating all of his pitches including his changeup. So far the Yankees' rotation candidates behind ace Gerrit Cole -- who were perceived to be the soft underbelly of the franchise a month ago -- have all looked good.

The race for the last roster spot

Jay Bruce has had a good showing in the Yankees' camp so far at a time when it appears when the Yankees might have one spot available for the trio of Michael Tauchman Derek Dietrich and Bruce. Tauchman is on the Yankees' 40-man roster which could give him an advantage in the competition. But Bruce and Dietrich can opt out of their respective contracts a week before the start of the regular season if they are not put on the 40-man roster.

An ode to Nick Markakis

Nick Markakis knew at the end of last season that he was retiring. If it were up to him he would've just departed without any public notice. But he was cajoled into telling a couple of familiar reporters that yes he was retiring after 15 years 2388 hits 189 home runs three Gold Gloves and an All-Star appearance. Buck Showalter managed Markakis in Baltimore and wants everyone to know what a model teammate he was. He has stories to tell like this one: Markakis had a strong throwing arm at the outset of his career but an injury robbed him of strength and he had to be measured about how and when he cut loose. Even in this compromised state Showalter said Markakis felt it was important to establish a tone on the first day of spring training. So when the Orioles would go through their initial defensive drills Markakis would be aggressive in throwing to the bases.

Baseball Tonight podcast with Buster Olney ESPN's Buster Olney leads the discussion of the latest news and notes around baseball with the game's top analysts. Listen

""It was like he was Roberto Clemente the way he was whipping the ball all over the place"" Showalter recalled.

Once the tone for camp had been set then Markakis would protect his arm.

""He always knew exactly the right thing to do and when to do it"" Showalter said.

Adam Jones played with Markakis.

""I got some great stories but none really compare to what a human he is"" Jones wrote in an email. ""A great teammate husband father. Not the most vocal guy (they had me for that) but his body of example spoke louder than I or Buck ever could. He taught me how to grind and never make excuses. Play the game hard and play it the correct way.""

Markakis left the Orioles to sign with the Atlanta Braves after the 2014 season after the Baltimore medical staff raised concerns about whether Markakis would hold up. Markakis went on to play six seasons alongside Freddie Freeman.

""And I'm sure that's how Freddie Freeman feels [after playing with Markakis]"" Jones wrote ""because Freddie is the same way -- grind it out. I am still pissed that we didn't sign Nick back with the Orioles because we didn't just lose a great human we lost a brother and a staple in our clubhouse. ... That's why I'm glad he went to prove all the docs and experts wrong. The man is a pro's pro.""

Noteworthy

One of the better major league rotations at the outset of the season could be in Durham the Class AAA affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays. The group is stacked with high-end prospects: 23-year-old lefty Shane McClanahan who made a strong first impression in the majors at the end of last season by striking out two batters per inning; 20-year-old Luis Patino whom Tampa Bay got in return for Blake Snell; and Shane Baz the former first-round pick acquired in the Chris Archer trade with the Pirates in 2017. ... The Cardinals' John Gant has a nice pitch mix for a starter. But command continues to be a challenge. He's walked six in 9 1/3 innings after issuing seven walks in 15 innings -- and in the big leagues he compiled 129 walks in 262 2/3 innings. ...

March is Womens’ History Month giving us one more reason to celebrate and highlight the amazing women who are disrupting the fitness and wellness space. Can you tell us a little bit about your journey in creating the J METHOD?

First off thank you for the honor of being featured during Women’s History Month. I created the J METHOD out of a personal need to improve my own fitness and health after having my two children and in response to a growing demand from my personal training clients. As a mom of two small children I didn’t always have time to go to the gym and I didn’t always have a lot of time in general. I needed to figure out an effective and efficient way to train myself.

One of the hardest parts of staying fit is to be consistent. Part of that challenge is overcoming the belief that you don’t have enough time or you don’t have access to a gym. Thus the J METHOD was born — an efficient and effective way to train less gain more and to train anytime anywhere. Over the years it has evolved into what it is today which is a way to improve movement develop balance and redefine your strength.

What have been the biggest challenges and obstacles you have faced in growing your business?

Changing people’s mindsets about the effectiveness of training in less time and not requiring any gym equipment has been the biggest challenge. People are used to being in their comfort zones and for many it is hard to embrace the concept that you don’t need to do hours of cardio or spend hours in a gym to see results.

What did 2020 mean for your business? Did you have to make any strategic business pivots etc.?

Similar to how 2020 was a catalyst to getting more people to embrace the concept of the effectiveness of work from home it did the same thing to the fitness industry by allowing more people to change their mindsets about the effectiveness of working out at home.

Interestingly I was already training most of my clients virtually online via streaming for many years prior to 2020. In fact even before Peloton’s concept of reaching people this way I was training my clients via Skype. With the changes in 2020 when many people were forced to figure things out and go virtual I was already there! I did plan to have several in-person events in cities across the country in 2020 but that obviously had to be put on hold. A large part of what I do and a large part of my “why” is helping people to live a healthy lifestyle. Motivating inspiring and connecting with my community is an integral part. This typically included being able to be in their community to make in-person connections. During the pandemic and social distancing restrictions I had to think of other ways to connect with my community through social media and other electronic platforms such as Zoom.

There are so many virtual programming options for consumers today how do smaller players compete with the “Pelotons” of the world?

There is more than enough room for every player small or big to have a place within the virtual space as long as they have a purpose. Purpose to the content they provide their users and creating a community within that space makes every player competitive. Small players can compete by finding their niche and focusing on where they excel. It is also important to stay innovative. The world is changing with the constant advancement of technology and it is important to stay on top of the latest developments within the fitness space. That is why I partnered with Ladder Teams in 2020 where I made my J METHOD program available.

Tell us about Ladder Teams…I am not sure if everyone knows what that is?

Jennifer Jacobs of J METHOD Fitness

Ladder Teams is an app like no other app out there. The Ladder Teams platform not only helps make the J METHOD accessible to so many more people but it creates community and accountability in unique and creative ways. It looks at the experience within the app from a holistic 360 approach and is constantly improving the experience for the user by creating meaningful connections thus creating a stronger community. I believe that Ladder Teams is exactly the type of platform that will rise to the top and will be successful in an industry that is quickly becoming more and more digitized.

We know that helping other companies navigate the ever-evolving fitness landscape is something you do extremely well. How has 2020 been different for you in that regard?

As I mentioned I was training my clients online via electronic devices for years so the shift to virtual in 2020 did not impact me significantly. But for others it was not so easy and they did not know what to do or where to start. Many companies also did not know how to pivot quickly to a solely virtual environment. Given my past experiences I had the exact skills and knowledge to not only help my own business but to help others as well.

What have you done differently to support companies during the pandemic?

In addition to consulting and providing advice to various companies and friends I believe that during this time it is especially important for small business owners to support each other. I have supported a lot of small businesses in my local communities and my friends who run small businesses. I not only utilize the products they offer but I have spoken about them on my social media to further their reach.

What advice would you give to other founders (in particular women) looking to start their own fitness related business?

In whatever you set out to do always be authentic and true to yourself. Don’t think that there is anything you can’t do. If you have an idea try it out and see if it sticks. And if it doesn’t know that it is okay. Pick yourself back up and try again. It doesn’t mean you failed it just means you learned something and that always makes you better for the next time around. Lean on your network. Don’t be afraid to ask people you know for advice and if they don’t know the answer ask them if they know someone who does. There are so many people who have been in your place before that you could learn from. You’d be amazed how much small business owners are supportive of other small business owners.

How important is branded product (equipment apparel) to a business? It seems like everyone wants to extend their brands with ancillary products is this a good strategy?

Brand recognition is always a good thing. Putting your brand on certain products is a good strategy but only if the products make sense for your brand. Putting your name on anything and everything may not always make sense and can actually dilute your brand. If not done correctly it can confuse consumers and what your brand represents. For me the J METHOD Travel Size Gym made sense because it is the perfect tool enabling you to train efficiently and effectively anytime anywhere. Before 2020 I traveled quite often and didn’t always have access to a gym or equipment. I needed something portable to take with me to do cardio strength and recovery.. The JMETHOD Travel Size Gym is a collection of different types of tools that I slowly accumulated in my suitcase which allowed me to train anytime anywhere. I soon realized that there were many other people with the same challenges. They were traveling or never had enough time to go to the gym. As a result I created the J METHOD Travel Size Gym my solution to those obstacles.

How do you decide what companies you work with for endorsement and partnerships? Do you have a vetting process?

My vetting process is myself! Every brand that I endorse or talk about I believe in and use. Being authentic in what I share with my community builds trust. As we all know trust is one of the most important elements in any type of relationship.

Mental health is emerging as one of the biggest trends within health and wellbeing. We at Athletech are hopeful that this trend will address an area that has often been overlooked. How does mental health fit into your business and your personal wellbeing?

I have always been a huge proponent for being proactive in self-care. I believe that the concept of being “healthy” includes not only your physical but also your mental well-being. We often spend our time focusing on how we “look” and forget the importance of focusing on how we “feel”. What health means however will differ from one person to the next depending on their needs and situation. Recovery is a big part of the J METHOD philosophy and I often speak about it. Some of us are busier now more than ever as our hours of working are becoming longer and the line between work and home have blurred. Layer on top of that care of family and loved ones. Our ability to adapt to situations especially during times of change is another important factor to maintaining our health. We can all take steps to improve our own mental health and build resilience – our ability to cope with adversity. Self-care is a skill I practice daily and encourage others to practice it too. I have been preaching self-care even more during the past year.

What does diversity and inclusion mean for your business and your community? Have you made any changes in hiring marketing etc. based on the critical need for us to be a more inclusive fitness community promoting diversity across organizations and levels?

Diversity and inclusion play an important role in a workplace regardless of its size. As a small business owner I have made conscious efforts when choosing who I work with as differing world views experiences and skill sets expand what’s possible resulting in new ideas and opportunities. We cannot assume that everyone is the same and approaches fitness in a similar way. It is an important consideration that I take when it comes to who I work with and who I lend my expertise and business advice. If we want to be a more inclusive fitness community then we need to make sure to address the needs of people’s diverse backgrounds and welcome those to the table. Even as a small business owner fighting inequality starts with you.

Where do you see the future of fitness and wellness heading in the next few years?

Looking ahead my goal for the fitness and wellness industry as a whole is to evaluate how it can create an environment that is more equitable and more inclusive. Fitness and wellness will continue to merge with an increased focus on mental health issues with fitness playing a vital role as a form of therapy. Expect far more innovative tech peak social experiences and unlikely brick-and-mortar facilities. You will see an emphasis on convenience and personalization in part due to AI-enabled technology. Imagine being able to attend your favorite fitness class in person or online while simultaneously a shopping cart is filled with nutrient dense foods based on your preferences. This will be accompanied by a healthy recipe from a wellness expert specifically designed to increase your productivity and performance. As consumers put a premium on experience fitness content will increasingly blend fitness with entertainment. And with fitness and wellness merging gyms and digital platforms will expand their offerings to include recovery and mindfulness to optimize performance improve sleep and emphasize nutrition. The future holds a complete approach to physical mental and social well-being on a hybrid platform both digital and in a physical space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIxL2phY29iLXlvdW5ncy1mYXRoZXItcm9vdGluZy1mb3ItcnV0Z2Vycy1hZ2FpbnN0LWFsbWEtbWF0ZXItaG91c3Rvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Young's father rooting for Rutgers against alma mater Houston,"Jacob Young’s father played with Clyde Drexler and Akeem Olajuwon on the University of Houston’s Phi Slama Jama team that was upset in the national championship game by Jim Valvano and North Carolina State and he played again with Olajuwon the next year when Patrick Ewing and Georgetown denied them in the 1984 title game.

Michael Young was a 6-foot-6 forward on those teams a hometown hero from Yates High School and on Sunday night at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis his alma mater will be trying to survive and advance to the Sweet 16 against Rutgers.

His son Jacob plays for Rutgers.

Michael Young and his wife Tina will be in the stands.

Maybe just a little bit conflicted. But maybe not.

“I’m pretty sure he’s gonna wear a Rutgers shirt first ’cause you know?” Jacob Young said with a laugh Saturday “I’m his blood his son. I’m pretty sure it’s different when your son somebody that you raised is playing against your alma mater.”

Son knows best.

“He’s exactly right” Michael Young told The Post. “Either way I’m gonna have some feelings but I’m pulling for Rutgers.”

Jacob Young also comes out of Yates High School and played 39 games over two seasons at Texas before transferring to Rutgers. His father is third in scoring in Houston history and is one of five players to have his jersey retired by the university.

Before Rutgers made history on Friday night by winning a men’s NCAA Tournament game for the first time in 38 years after making history by reaching the tournament following a 30-year absence Jacob Young couldn’t help but notice that No. 2-seed Houston very likely would be next if the Knights could defeat Clemson in their Midwest Region first-round game and allowed himself to dreamed this improbable father-son dream.

“We gotta get this win so we can play them” he said. “I can’t wait. I’m just so pumped up and ready. There’s so many thoughts going through my mind I don’t even like know what to say.”

Under coach Steve Pikiell Rutgers has emerged as a team of destination and believes it can be a team of destiny as well.

“Who wouldn’t want to beat like a hometown team?” Jacob Young said. “We’re so connected now we’re ready to go for Sunday.”

Jacob Young is a 6-2 senior racehorse guard with a will to win. Michael Young was asked if his son’s unmistakable swag reminds him of himself.

“No you know I didn’t have a swag I was a silent assassin” the father said. “He’s kinda talking out there moving out there pumping his arms you know? That’s his style of play.”

He’s fun to watch isn’t he?

“He is” Michael Young said. “I love watching him.”

Jacob’s teammates love playing with him.

“Jacob’s kinda turned into one of my favorite teammates the way he loves basketball. … You never have to worry about him playing hard” Paul Mulcahy told The Post. “His energy is contagious his smile’s infectious and he just really really loves the game of basketball.”

The father was asked whether his son wanted to follow him at Houston. Jacob’s older brother Joe played there from 2011-13.

“Well he had pretty much already committed to Texas” Michael Young said. “Whenever Coach [Kelvin] Sampson had gotten the job [April 2014] … to answer your question he never heard anything from University of Houston. He wanted to stay close to home and Texas was a great school a great opportunity that wasn’t too far away from home.”

The father 60 years old knows how magical March Madness can be … and how heartbreaking it can be.

“The older I get the more I respect it … it was a lot of fun playing with the guys that I played with along with our style of play” he said.

He went to three Final Fours.

“Also as I get older I understand how tough it is to get there” Michael Young said.

He was a UH assistant coach for one season and spent five years as Houston’s strength and conditioning coach before becoming director of basketball operations and performance enhancement.

Jacob has played ball in the summer with some of the Houston players.

“I know one thing” Jacob said laughing. “If we do get the win then go home back to Houston with a big smile on my face.”"
JNJ,Johnson & Johnson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtc3BlYWtlci1qb2huc29uLXRydW1wLTdiYmU3MWI3ZmMyYWVmMjZkZTMwMzZhMzU0YWYwZDEz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene Speaker Johnson meet for second day,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Embattled House Speaker Mike Johnson and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS10aHJlYXQtbWlrZS1qb2huc29uLWhvdXNlLXNwZWFrZXItbW90aW9uLXRvLXZhY2F0ZS_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9tYXJqb3JpZS10YXlsb3ItZ3JlZW5lLXRocmVhdC1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24taG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci1tb3Rpb24tdG8tdmFjYXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene backs away from imminent threat to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson,"Washington — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared to retreat from her threat to imminently trigger a vote to remove Speaker Mike Johnson as House leader after lengthy meetings with him this week.

""Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" Greene said Tuesday. She added that the timeframe for following through on her promise to force a vote is ""up to Mike Johnson and it can't drag out.""

She said Johnson was not given a ""specific timeline but it's pretty short.""

Greene met Monday and Tuesday with Johnson as the Georgia Republican weighed the exact timing of forcing a vote to remove him from leadership. Greene said last Wednesday she would start the clock on a vote to overthrow Johnson a Louisiana Republican this week after dangling the threat since March.

But she emerged from the meetings to offer few details about her plans to force a vote signaling that tensions could be cooling — at least until he makes another misstep in the eyes of the far-right.

Greene demanded that Johnson promise no more aid for Ukraine no bill be brought to the floor unless the majority of Republicans support it stripping funding for Justice Department investigations into former President Donald Trump and automatic spending cuts if the 12 appropriations bills are not passed individually.

""I have high expectations and they have to be met in full"" Greene said in an interview with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on his ""War Room"" podcast before Tuesday's meeting. ""There is no middle ground there is no compromise.""

Johnson a Louisiana Republican said Tuesday the initial conversation was ""productive"" and ""it was not a negotiation."" He also described the second meeting as ""productive"" and said he was ""optimistic"" about finding a resolution on the suggestions. They did not have more meetings scheduled he said.

""I take Marjorie's ideas and Thomas' and everybody else's equally and we assess them on their own value and where we can make improvements and changes and all of that we do. That's what this is. There's nothing more than that going on"" he said Tuesday morning.

Rep. Thomas Massie a Kentucky Republican joined both meetings. He and GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona are the only two Republicans who have publicly backed Greene's effort at this point.

Johnson has repeatedly noted that he's leading a divided majority with a one-vote margin. Special elections in May and June to fill the seats of Republicans who retired in recent months are expected to help give more cushion to the GOP majority.

If Greene does eventually trigger a vote Johnson is expected to survive the attempt to strip him of the gavel thanks to Democratic support that puts him in a stronger position despite the GOP's razor-thin margin of control. Democrats said they would thwart the effort to remove him after he defied conservative members of his party to support more aid to Ukraine.

Democrats offering to help a GOP leader keep his power demonstrates how far conservatives' unwillingness to compromise has pushed the House toward this unique moment. But Democrats say the move is more about beating back the far right than saving Johnson.

""Our view would traditionally be 'Let the other side work its own mess out'"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries a New York Democrat recently told ""60 Minutes."" ""But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.""

Johnson said Tuesday he expects to remain in power next year.

""I intend to lead this conference in the future"" he said at his weekly news conference. ""I expect I'll be doing that in the future. I'm glad to have the support of President Trump.""

” meaning no legislation is brought to a vote without support from a majority of the House majority; Defunding the special counsel probes into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and

into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and Enforcement of the “Massie Rule” whereby government funding is automatically cut across the board if no superseding agreement is reached before a set deadline.

They’ll meet again today at 12:30 p.m. in hopes of finding a detente. Spokespeople for Greene and Johnson declined to comment on their discussions but the speaker struck a conciliatory note after yesterday’s meeting sympathizing with Greene and pledging to “keep this team together.”

Make no mistake though the pressure for Republican party unity in an election year is weighing on Greene who is battling exasperated GOP colleagues and skepticism from the party’s unquestioned leader Trump.

Johnson could be in a position to grant at least some of Greene’s asks. Since this Congress has effectively finished passing controversial must-do items such as funding the government raising the debt ceiling and extending surveillance authorities Johnson can probably stick to the Hastert Rule (named for former now-disgraced speaker Dennis Hastert).

Democrats agreed to a version of the Massie Rule during last year’s spending talks with then-speaker Kevin McCarthy — so Johnson could probably go there as well.

On Ukraine Congress just sent Kyiv $60 billion in aid — enough to last through the year by most estimates though Greene might also want to strike an expected nine-figure aid authorization in the annual Pentagon policy bill that’s expected to move later this year.

But defunding special counsel Jack Smith’s Trump investigations could be much trickier. Front-line Republicans in the past have balked at such demands to say nothing of Democrats. If Greene is expecting Johnson to put up a fight on a much-anticipated September continuing resolution that would be a recipe for a federal shutdown just weeks before the election.

The two sides don’t have a deal yet — and might never get one — but it’s clear temperatures are dropping. A handshake solution after all is in the interest of both parties: It would spare Johnson a risky vote where he’d be relying on the generosity of Democrats to save his gavel.

And for Greene her relationship with Trump and his inner circle is on the line we’re told. The former president “could not have been clearer” one person close to him said last night in signaling that he isn’t interested in any more intraparty drama this election season.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) aimed at defusing her efforts to oust him. Why it matters: Democrats have already vowed to protect Johnson from Greene's motion – leading many of them to ask why he's still trying to appease her.

""He has to be careful here"" said one senior House Democrat telling Axios that ""if he looks like he's just simply going to try to capitulate to her that could affect [the way] some Democrats see him.""

House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said Tuesday: ""When Speaker Johnson meets with her for hours the American people should be asking 'what is Marjorie Taylor Greene extracting from the speaker?'""

Driving the news: Greene met with Johnson for several hours this week laying out demands that include no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel probes.

Johnson told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday: ""It's not a negotiation okay this is how I've operated as speaker.""

After their meeting on Tuesday Greene said ""the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" and that she doesn't have a ""specific timeline."" She previously promised to force a vote this week.

What they're saying: ""I don't know what in the world they could be talking about for hours on end and I don't know why he would waste his time there. We have given enough indication we can help him get back to business"" Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.) told Axios.

Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) told Axios: ""You cannot placate her. The minute you try to appease her she's going to have new demands.""

""I worry that the Republicans are focused more on their internal battles and their culture wars than trying to do what's right for the American people as a whole"" said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.).

Zoom in: House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) compared Johnson's talks with Greene to the deal former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) struck with hardliners last January.

Included in the deal was a rule allowing any member to force a vote on removing the speaker which led to McCarthy's ouster and now has empowered Greene to bring Johnson to the table.

Between the lines: Democrats are still broadly committed to saving Johnson said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) but ""three months from now that doesn't necessarily [have to] be the case"" for some of his less committed colleagues.

Another House Democrat told Axios: ""It's fine – sit listen it doesn't cost you anything. But at some point you say: discussion's over shit or get off the pot. This has already consumed way too much attention.""

The other side: Some Democrats see Johnson as just doing what he needs to do.

""What I saw that I liked is he put bills in front of the House to vote on ... if he keeps doing that my only complaints will be policy"" said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.).

""The concessions that I've heard about they're meaningless ... I don't think she's a threat to anyone"" said Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.).

What to watch: One House Republican predicted Johnson won't give Greene any concessions telling Axios he's ""just trying to give her an exit ramp.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hlcmVzLXdoYXQtZ29wLXJlYmVscy13YW50LWpvaG5zb24tdGhyZWF0cy1vdXN0LWhpbS1zcGVha2Vyc2hpcNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hlcmVzLXdoYXQtZ29wLXJlYmVscy13YW50LWpvaG5zb24tdGhyZWF0cy1vdXN0LWhpbS1zcGVha2Vyc2hpcC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's what GOP rebels want from Johnson amid threats to oust him from speakership,"The House conservatives threatening to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La. are seeking assurances on government funding and aid to Ukraine Fox News Digital is told.

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Democrats have pledged to block the ouster vote by voting to table the resolution whenever it comes up something that could save Johnson while also likely raising more conservative frustrations.

Johnson told reporters on Monday evening that his meeting with Massie and Greene was ""lengthy"" but ""constructive.""

""We have discussed some ideas and we're going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said. ""I just want to say and I told them and I've said this repeatedly that I understand the frustration. I share it. I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin."""

Low-level employees grouse that the chief executive makes them work around the clock through the pandemic to keep up with deal flow. White-shoe investment bankers complain that they get blasted when they miss out on business.

He uses the corporate jet to travel to his mansion in the Bahamas even as he indulges in hobbies that include pricey wines kitesurfing and DJing at nightclubs — all the while demanding that his people get back to the office as the COVID pandemic subsides.

And if you’re a Goldman associate and see him having lunch at some restaurant in the Hamptons don’t make the mistake (as one poor sap did) of stopping by to say hello. He will probably chew you out because in his worldview Goldman execs are supposed to eat only what they kill.

Yes he’s hated in many parts of Goldman’s sprawling empire on Wall Street — and it doesn’t matter. Solomon is becoming a much-beloved leader with another more important constituency: his investors.

These headlines (including an amazing story in Bloomberg detailing the plane use and the lunch incident on top of The Post’s coverage of Goldman first-year analysts’ grueling 100-hour work weeks) have been making the rounds and stoking considerable schadenfreude in C-suites across Wall Street.

But the Solomon-hating hasn’t halted Goldman’s strong performance or its surging stock price.

Shares are up 132 percent over the past year compared with the 84 percent surge of banking giant JPMorgan the gold standard of Wall Street and the 62 percent spike in the S&P 500 index of big company stocks.

Only Morgan Stanley which has been on a buying binge of expansion is doing better with its stock surging 168 percent since last year.

Of course it’s hard not to make money on Wall Street in times like these. With the Fed keeping interest rates low and printing the currency at a feverish pace lower borrowing costs make it easier for Goldman to finance trades. Cheap money has led to a flood of stock and bond offerings for Goldman to underwrite.

Shares of blue-chip companies like Goldman and not-so-blue-chip ones like GameStop will go up when rates are so low because there’s no place else to park cash and earn a decent return.

Even so Solomon is quietly earning kudos for execution. The firm he inherited from the allegedly nicer Lloyd Blankfein in 2018 was profitable but over time became far less so. It fell under scrutiny for not matching its archrival Morgan Stanley in expanding into wealth and asset management.

It was slow going for Solomon at first. He was said to have considered a deal to merge with US Bancorp — a foray into commercial banking to look more like powerhouse JPM. The idea fizzled over control issues (Goldman’s market cap was lower and Solomon would have had to relinquish control.) Goldman’s stock sputtered. In 2020 things began to turn. Goldman recently announced that trading revenues hit a 10-year high last year matching those produced during the halcyon days under Blankfein just before financial-crisis regulations made it difficult to take balance-sheet risk.

Likewise investment-banking revenues hit new records; Solomon a dealmaker himself has retained Goldman’s long-held status as the go-to adviser on M&A.

“Solomon took over Goldman when it was a mess” veteran bank analyst Dick Bove recently told Lydia Moynihan of Fox Business.

“He knew exactly what he was doing and he made Goldman one of the most exciting companies in America.”

The big question on Wall Street is: Will Solomon’s mojo last? Probably. The Fed shows no signs of letting up on printing money which is usually good for banks. Unless it leads to massive inflation and higher interest rates which could crush stocks and make financing trades more costly.

Meanwhile the surging trading and I-banking revenues many bank experts believe continue to paper over blind spots in Goldman’s business model: It’s still largely a two-trick pony of investment banking and trading. It has a smallish consumer-banking division known as Marcus which five years into the experiment still loses money.

That’s why all signs are pointing to Solomon’s investment banking instincts kicking in soon. Goldman’s market value of $119 billion has now exceeded US Bancorp’s so maybe that deal is heading back on the table. Maybe it will make a run at PNC another largish bank that could give Goldman a competitive edge versus JPM and Morgan Stanley. Goldman could use its currency to buy a bunch of smaller banks or an asset manager.

One thing is certain: If Solomon keeps doing what’s he’s doing he’s going to be calling the shots for some time no matter how difficult he is to deal with.

“The fact he wants to use the company jet as his private plane — so what?” says Bove. “No one is going to get rid of the guy with the golden touch.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtY3Jhc2gtZHVyaW5nLWVjb25vbWljLTExMDAwMDQ1Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can the stock market crash during an economic boom?,"It's hard to believe it was only a year ago that the economy was essentially put on ice. There were quarantines. Shutdowns. Closures of businesses schools supply chains and our everyday way of life. This led to the worst quarterly economic contraction on record in the second quarter of 2020 clocking in at an annualized –34%.

[hotlink][/hotlink]

Yet somehow we are now on track for an economic boom.

Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent outlook piece they now expect 8% economic growth in 2021 and an unemployment rate of 4% by year-end. They think the unemployment rate could reach as low as 3.2% by 2023. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen thinks we could be back at full employment as early as next year.

Of course there is a reason for this lightning-quick turnaround. The government has helped keep things afloat by spending and sending out gobs of money. Trillions of dollars have been sent to businesses municipalities and individuals including the most recent $1.9 trillion stimulus bill.

So that enormous contraction was likely the fastest recession in U.S. history as well. And the sheer amount of government spending means we could see one of the biggest economic booms ever coming out of a downturn.

Investors have now gone from worrying about the potential for another Great Depression last March to the biggest risk being an inflationary spike from a combination of government spending supply constraints and pent-up demand as people get vaccinated.

Inflation can be harmful to the stock market but it's hard to imagine investors selling their stocks in the midst of an economic boom.

Has the stock market ever crashed as the economy soared?

It's rare but it has happened before.

Going back to the 1930s which is essentially when GDP as a metric was invented real economic growth in the United States has averaged roughly 3% per year. The stock market is not the economy but there is a relationship between GDP growth and the market over time especially when growth is high.

[fortune-iframe-embed src=""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NRoaf/1/"" height=""338""]

This is not a perfect relationship but you can see the higher real GDP growth goes the higher average annual stock market returns tend to go.

Averages can often hide outliers and the one outlier here was 1937. Real GDP growth came in at over 5% but the S&P 500 finished the year down 35%. However one of the reasons stocks fell so hard that year is the economy began to slow by the end of the year which led to a recession that lasted until 1938.

Story continues

The highest growth with a down stock market came in 1941 when GDP was up double digits year over year while the S&P 500 finished the year down almost 11%. This was an instance in which investors were spooked from World War II.

Otherwise stocks have generally seen strong returns when economic growth is so high. In seven out of the 11 years when real GDP growth was 8% or higher the stock market was up double digits.

So it's relatively rare for the stock market to fall concurrently with a booming economy.

There is one caveat that may apply with today's environment though. While it's rare for the stock market to fall during a booming economy it's also rare for the stock market to boom in the midst of a nasty recession like it did in 2020.

There is the possibility of a “sell the news” reaction by investors now that the market is already up around 80% from the bottom in late March 2020. That is a risk worth considering.

However betting against the stock market against the backdrop of what could be the strongest economic environment since the 1990s seems like an even riskier proposition.

Dozens of large businesses — from McDonald's and Chick-fil-A to a local DMV and car wash — couldn't accept credit card payments one afternoon in February — creating a flurry of confusion and frustrated customers.

The problem which only lasted a few hours can be traced to a backend system operated by just four companies that underpins much of the payments ecosystem. Most consumers know little to nothing about it.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

When customers slip their debit or credit cards into a machine at a business a little phrase pops up: ""authorizing payment."" Those two words reference an elaborate system that allows the multi-billion dollar payments processing industry to approve the charge for the customer.

It sounds simple but each processor — the companies that handle every card payment by communicating between the merchant and customer's respective banks — must use an elaborate system of backups to keep the consumer economy running each day preventing an outage that would leave many merchants scrambling to not lose sales from consumers who increasingly don't carry cash.

On top of that they're pounded by hacking attempts from criminals wanting to steal payment information meaning their cybersecurity must be top notch.

But in their most simplistic form ""you can think of them as being these huge data center-based companies that are processing billions upon billions of transactions 24/7 365"" said Lisa Ellis an analyst at MoffettNathanson.

On Feb. 26 when Fiserv one of those payments processors had an internet outage merchants across the US couldn't take electronic transactions until the issue resolved. The company services to a majority of fast-food restaurants which explains why Chick-fil-A McDonald's and Popeye's were some of the businesses affected that day.

Fiserv alongside FIS Global Payments and JPMorgan Chase account for about 80% to 90% of the payments processing industry in the US according to MoffetNathanson. That means each time you swipe your card there's about a 90% chance one of those businesses is responsible approving the payment.

A case of an ""outage"" in which many merchants can't process card payments is extremely rare according to Ellis and Robert Le an analyst at PitchBook. That's because the processors have backups for every single part of the process.

""The IT infrastructure of any large company has a whole backup plan to it"" Ellis said. It's ""a business continuity plan that says 'OK what's the redundancy that's built in here in case something goes down?'""

Payments processors have backup internet providers and backup data centers that process payments in case one data center goes down. If a card is taking longer than normal to authorize it might be because the payment is being routed to a data center farther away.

A spokesperson for FIS told Insider the company has heavily invested in its infrastructure ""to minimize the likelihood and impact of an outage."" It regularly tests backups like its ""auto failover"" that allows payments to move between data centers as needed they said.

Global Payments didn't respond to Insider's request for comment and a representative from JPMorgan Chase declined to discuss company operations and cybersecurity measures.

As for Fiserv which had the issues in February a company spokesperson said: ""Redundancy and resiliency are built into our solutions."" That includes multiple internet service providers and data center backups across the country they said.

In February despite the hours-long wait many merchants had in being able to once again accept digital payments Cave said Fiserv's internet backups worked as intended. She added that ""the initial internet service provider outage created a secondary impact for some clients.""

A widespread long-term outage at a payments processor is ""very rare"" Le the Pitchbook analyst said.

So rare in fact that when Visa a payments provider that works with the processors had an outage in Europe in September 2018 people thought it might have been a terrorist attack Ellis said. More than 5 million transactions failed over the 10-hour outage because of a rare data center malfunction Finextra reported at the time.

""People were freaking out"" Ellis said ""because it's so unusual.""

Though the Visa outage was a data malfunction payments processors and others in the network must be on top of cybersecurity to prevent service problems related to a hacking. They're ""bombarded constantly with cybersecurity attacking attempts"" because criminals are wanting to get payment information Ellis said.

""Aside from military agencies and stuff like that they've got to be some of the most attacked networks in the world because they contain payment information"" she said.

Outages though rare likely affect merchants the most considering the lost sales and damage to the brand reputation with customers according to Le.

""Consumers nowadays don't carry any cash"" Ellis said. ""So if you were in a store buying anything of a reasonable size and you couldn't use a card most consumers would just walk out.""

Over the years cash has become less widely used as card payments have taken over. Card penetration or the number of consumers using a card instead of cash is about 60% to 70% according to Ellis but that varies across the country. In New York City for example card usage is even higher.

If there was a big outage at a payments processor in the future it could ""lead to a call to bring cash use back into the system"" Le said. But in the long-term merchants are likely to look for support from multiple payments processors instead of just relying on one he said.

Large businesses in the US usually do have multiple processors so they have a backup in case one goes down. But smaller merchants generally don't Ellis said.

Democratic U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit Haley Stevens of Rochester Hills Debbie Dingell of Dearborn and Andy Levin of Bloomfield Township joined members of Teamsters Local Union 337 on the 10th day of the union's strike against 7 Up and its parent company Keurig Dr Pepper. .

Tlaib Stevens and Dingell joined the strike at noon and stayed for about an hour.

“You all deserve to be able to provide for your family"" Tlaib told the crowd. ""You shouldn’t have to beg them to do the right thing.”

Said Dingell: “We gotta make it really clear how simple these issues are. People are not being paid the same amount of money for the same job.""

Teamsters Local Union 337 began its strike at 8:30 p.m. March 11 after months of negotiations surrounding a two-tier pay system for warehouse workers and drivers at 7 Up. The pay scale means that people working the same job are paid different rates — workers that joined the company prior to 2005 are paid more than workers that joined after 2005.

“They gave us a last best and final offer and we had the option to accept that or strike and the contract offer was overwhelmingly turned down and it was the second time it was turned down so the membership decided it was best to strike"" Teamsters Local 337 recording secretary and business agent Tony Reisdorf said.

Race was also a topic of discussion surrounding the two-tier system as the Teamsters said most of the higher-paid tier workers were white while second-tier workers were Black.

“The fact that they are coming together no matter their diversity and their background this shows the power of the union"" Tlaib told the Free Press.

Strikers were also protesting to get Martin Luther King Jr. Day off. To this vice president of corporate communications Vicki Draughn said union workers had an option in their contract negotiations for nine paid holidays. On this list was MLK Day which is a paid holiday in other Keurig Dr Pepper locations including union locations.

""During negotiations Teamsters Local 337 are able to select MLK Day as one of their nine designated pay holidays as has been done at many other pay company sites"" Draughn said.

“It’s a good company. Our issue isn’t with local management"" said Reisdorf. ""These people work their tails off through the pandemic and this company has operated at 130% volume through the pandemic have made more money than they’ve ever made and we just want our fair share.”

Draughn said the offer made to union workers didn't affect pay structure; it increased pay across all tiers.

The Teamsters said they were also striking because the company wanted to start using drivers without commercial driver's licenses to cut costs. Currently all drivers are certified and drive tractor-trailers but Reisdorf said 7 Up wants to use non-CDL A drivers with commercial vans.

There has been one police incident since the beginning of the strike. A man went up to a striker and harassed him. Police reported that the man was not a member of the company or part of 7 Up's hired security personnel.

Reisdorf said hired security has flashed lights followed strikers to their cars and used other methods to scare strikers.

“Those intimidations create an unsafe environment for these workers to strike"" Tlaib told the Free Press.

Draughn said the company had a “contingency plan” in place in case of a strike and the warehouse has brought in teams from other locations to fill in.

Reisdorf also said Teamsters were financially prepared for this because of the recently passed stimulus check tax benefits union funds and savings.

""“We’re really in a pretty good position and the guys have prepared for this moment. They’ve been saving"" Reisdorf said.

Dialogue between the union and company is set to continue.

""We don’t want to be in this strike so we’re inviting the union to return to the negotiations table"" Draughn said.

Tlaib said lawmakers are currently debating the Protecting the Right to Organize Act which speaks to the issue at hand.

“We are pushing the PRO Act which passed the House and is in the Senate which really protects workers like this that are doing this fair share showing up to work but not being treated equally in the workplace.”

Meghan McNamara

Meghan McNamara

Meghan McNamara has worked tirelessly over the past year as the residential coordinator for Horizons Specialized Services. She works to protect adults with developmental disabilities — a particularly vulnerable population — from COVID through testing multiple times a week developing new policies and procedures coordinating vaccination clinics for the clients and staff and supporting her employees and residents through the ever-changing and incredibly challenging pandemic. She has truly been on the front lines for the past year — something her job would not typically require. While the residential coordinator position was already a full-time job before COVID dealing with COVID-related issues has absolutely taken over. She has had to find ways to comply with constantly shifting guidance from the state and translate that guidance to the several group homes she manages under Horizons. She coordinates and works multiple testing clinics a week. She jumps in to cover staff in the homes who have to quarantine. Meghan’s efforts are a huge benefit to the community. By putting in place so many precautions she has been able to protect the clients and staff who work in the group homes. She has led them through an incredibly difficult time and provided guidance and reassurance especially to those who many not understand fully what’s happening in our world. She not only talks the talk but walks the walk — with boots on the ground in the thick of testing and clinics and covering shifts in homes.

“This is a place that feels so far away. I mean you are surrounded by the sights and the smells and for a minute you almost feel like you are out of the city” she said. “And then the train comes by and you remember that you are just a walk away from your own home.”

What You Need To Know Concerned west Long Beach residents formed the Riverpark Coalition demanding city officials create a park in place of a new storage facility development along the Los Angeles River



Residents say there is a lack of green open space in the area and want to see more revitalization along the river



The city of Long Beach’s Development Services says the development site was never zoned as park space and city planners decided a storage facility was the best use of the lande



The site developer plans to build a new walking trail to the L.A. River a nature preserve offer free parking for those accessing the river and keep any environmental impact at the site to a minimum

Valenzuela has lived in the Los Cerritos neighborhood of Long Beach for 15 years and said green space like the wetlands is rare. It’s near two major freeways – the 405 and 710 – and the Los Angeles River. She said the waterway and surrounding land isn’t quite as revitalized compared to other parts 20 miles north.

“You’ll see rocks. You’ll see trees. You’ll see reeds. You’ll see a complete riparian environment where people are kayaking people are fishing” Valenzuela said. “And we’ve just begun to ask the question why shouldn’t that be the case for us here on the westside and northside of Long Beach?”

Valenzuela and dozens of other residents recently learned a parcel of land along the L.A. River was approved for a new self-storage facility development. They banded together to form the Riverpark Coalition demanding city officials create a park instead. They say the land was originally designated for that but Amy Harbin a project planner with the city of Long Beach’s Development Services said that is not the case.

“Our research on this has found that the property was never zoned for park space” she said. “It’s been zoned ‘IL’ light industrial has a consistent ‘General Plan Land Use’ designation that facilitates light industrial uses.”

Harbin said city planners decided a storage facility is the best use of the land a former toxic dumpsite. She said they considered many factors before approving the development.

“We reviewed lots of biological reports geotechnical reports traffic noise” Harbin said. “We looked for potential impacts that this project could have on the surrounding area.”

Paul Brown is the co-founder of InSite Property Group which owns the parcel of land and is developing the site. He said his company would build a new walking trail to the L.A. River and a nature preserve.

“We’ve also allocated parking that will be obviously free for people who would like to access the river walk from this location” Brown said. “In addition we do have a very large solar system that is being built around the project that is 2.2 megawatts and that benefit; we will be giving free electric car charging to anyone who parks at our location and accesses the river.”

Brown said he is also working with the city to clean up any toxic chemicals on site.

“My working generation right now understands the importance of cleaning things up and stopping any spreading of the contamination of the issues that are there” Brown said.

He said the site was deemed a mitigated negative declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act so any environmental impacts will be kept to a minimum.

Still Valenzuela said the Riverpark Coalition is asking city officials to do a broader study called an Environmental Impact Report. The group also plans to apply for grants and raise funds to purchase parcels of green space along the river.

The Long Beach City Council is scheduled to review the project on April 6 after several appeals were filed against the Planning Commission’s decision to approve the development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZWF1bW9udGVudGVycHJpc2UvbmFtZS9jYXJvbHluLXByY2hhbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02OTg5Mzk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carolyn Prchal Obituary (1944 - 2021) - The Woodlands TX - The Beaumont Enterprise,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/beaumontenterprise/name/carolyn-prchal-obituary?id=6989397 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZWF1bW9udGVudGVycHJpc2UvbmFtZS9jYXJvbHluLXByY2hhbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02OTg5Mzk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

President Joe Biden's closest advisors have ties to big business and Wall Street with some making millions of dollars in their careers leading up to entering the White House new financial disclosures show.

The senior Biden aides listed in the disclosures include chief of staff Ron Klain deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon senior advisor Mike Donilon White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeffrey Zients and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese.

These disclosures show that many of the president's closest aides have deep ties to the business world and have made more money in their past corporate careers than previously known.

These disclosures were provided by the White House to CNBC early Saturday morning after requesting the documents a day earlier. None of these positions were confirmed by the Senate. Many of these advisors have previous ties to Biden's campaign or former President Barack Obama's administration.

A White House spokesperson did not return a follow up request for comment.

Deese was previously the Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock before becoming the head of the National Economic Council. While at the investment firm Deese's disclosure shows he made over $2.3 million in salary and bonuses. His disclosure also suggests that through BlackRock's restricted stock plan Deese could have made an additional $2.4 million.

Klain who was an executive at the venture capital firm Revolution before joining the White House was listed as having a salary of $1.8 million. He started at the company in 2005.

O'Malley Dillon who ran Biden's campaign before following him to the White House was a co-founder of the consulting firm Precision Strategies. The founders of the firm are credited with helping reelect Obama in 2012.

O'Malley Dillon's new financial disclosure gives a glimpse into the corporate advisory work she did for the firm before coming to the White House. The filing lists Gates Ventures as a client of O'Malley Dillon's while she was at Precision Strategies.

According to PitchBook Gates Ventures is a venture capital firm founded by billionaire Bill Gates. The current deputy White House chief of staff also advised the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative the philanthropic arm of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan.

Other corporations that saw her guidance include General Electric and Lyft. O'Malley Dillon's deferred compensation and severance from Precision is listed as being over $420000.

Donilon was a managing member of MCD Strategies a media consulting firm prior to his role in the White House. His filing shows that he made over $4 million in income while leading his consulting firm. Donilon lists the Biden campaign and Democratic National Convention Committee as two of his clients.

Zients was the CEO of the Wall Street investment firm Cranemere before becoming a lead advisor to the Biden White House on the coronavirus pandemic. His financial disclosure shows that he had a combined salary and bonus of $1.6 million. As board member of Facebook the new report shows he made over $330000.

Before Jake Sullivan became Biden's national security advisor he was a senior partner at the consulting firm Macro Advisory Partners. His new financial disclosure form shows that Sullivan from 2017 until last year was a member of the Microsoft advisory council. The report says Sullivan was on the ""policy advisory council advising the president of Microsoft on key policy developments.""

Sullivan was paid over $135000 in advisory fees while at Macro Advisory Partners and he earned an additional $45000 in advisory council fees from Microsoft his new disclosure report says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

About the Finalist Communities



Lumsden Community Sports Centre in Lumsden Saskatchewan

Like so many Prairie towns Lumsden is a hockey community with an arena at its heart. Before the pandemic it was typical to see its parking lots packed full of cars on any given day. Lumsden is a feeder arena and residents from all over the immediate and surrounding communities have worked tirelessly over the years to sustain and develop hockey programs especially women’s hockey through countless hours of volunteerism. Lumsden is in need of arena upgrades that will make their hockey culture more vibrant and aid them in their effort to grow women’s hockey.

Saint Adolphe Community Club & Arena in Saint Adolphe Manitoba

The Saint Adolphe Community Club & Arena is the foundation of many friendships and a true sense of collective pride. It seems to locals that once folks get involved with the arena in any capacity lifelong friendships are made by adults and kids alike. This is evident in the history of the arena which was created in the late 1980s after the community came together to raise enough money to turn the outdoor rink to a fully functional arena. During the winter the arena is often fully booked up by hockey clubs ringette teams figure skating squads and public skating. In 2021 the City of Saint Adolphe is banding together in the hopes that the $250000 can help them tackle a mold problem update the dressing rooms replace the ice plant and complete other necessary improvements.

Bobcaygeon-Verulam Community Centre in Bobcaygeon Ontario

Bobcaygeon-Verulam Community Centre has been the focal point of local community life and spirit for over 50 years. Generations have learned team building social skills and a true sense of community by playing and coaching the game. But the pandemic is threatening the closure of this community keystone. Bobcaygeon is determined to preserve this important fixture for future and aging generations and make it more inclusive to all community members. If Bobcaygeon can win the title of Kraft Hockeyville 2021 they will work to remove barriers for both the young and young at heart by installing accessible washrooms improving changerooms and upgrading mechanical equipment and amenities.

Chief Young Eagle Recreation Centre in Elsipogtog First Nation New Brunswick

Elsipogtog First Nation one of Atlantic Canada's largest First Nation communities has always considered their arena as a catalyst for connection. Since it opened its doors in 1979 their rink played a special multi-functional role in the community. In addition to hockey it has been used for community meetings dances and even boxing matches. But the primary function has always been to play hockey. Some members of the community feel that the racism or daily challenges faced by First Nations fuel their commitment to the game and constant drive to play harder and better. Elsipogtog First Nations would use the $250000 prize to repair significant structural damage to their arena which remains inoperable today.

The Kraft Hockeyville 2021 grand prize winner will have an opportunity to host an NHL® Preseason Game and receive $250000 for arena upgrades. The remaining community finalists will also be awarded $25000 each for arena upgrades and the winner and each of the three-runner up communities will receive $10000 to purchase brand new hockey equipment for their minor hockey programs courtesy of the NHLPA Goals & Dreams fund.

Kraft Hockeyville a competition that sees communities from across Canada compete for money to help them fix up their local arenas was once again taking nominations.

""That was just the day after our minor hockey president had sent out an email to the whole town"" Stade said. ""[We needed] to somehow find enough money so that our kids could have somewhere to play.""

Now the St. Adolphe Community Club and Arena is among four finalists in the running to bring home the annual Hockeyville title: a win that would bring an NHL pre-season game and $250000 to the rink.

WATCH | In the running for Kraft Hockeyville prize:

St. Adolphe Arena in the running for Kraft Hockeyville prize Duration 2:09 A small town in Manitoba has a big shot at fixing the local hockey rink. St. Adolphe is a finalist in Kraft Hockeyville competition a national contest to win 250-thousand dollars in arena upgrades.

""It's such a huge honour"" Stade said. ""The whole community has had such a spirit among us just rallying together to have this chance at helping our arena.""

That rallying took weeks of physically distanced parking lot gatherings in February where community members worked together to come up with the best way to present St. Adolphe as a contender for the title she said.

Now as the only Manitoba finalist they're hoping to win the support of people across the province. People in St. Adolphe alone — who number somewhere around 1600 Stade said — won't be enough to help them win.

The broken ice plant isn't the only problem threatening the rink's future.

The community also recently had to tear down an arena wall because of a serious mould problem and limited change room space means visiting teams often have to share with the home team.

In St. Adolphe the arena is about more than just hockey Stade said.

It's where kids get jobs working at the canteen where people learn to skate and where — in pre-pandemic times — dance parties and birthday parties were a regular occurrence in the upstairs hall.

And it's where in 1992 community members spent their own time and money to bring the dream of such a place to life.

""They actually went knocking door-to-door to get donations to build this place"" Stade said.

""These are now their kids and grandkids that are volunteering and that are playing in this arena so it's a really special building. It is really the heart of the community.""

The St. Adolphe Community Club and Arena was built decades ago. Volunteers are hoping to win the $250000 prize to help them tackle a mould problem update the dressing rooms replace the ice plant and complete other necessary improvements. (Justin Fraser/SRC)

That's what Stade said she hopes people see when it comes time to vote for this year's Hockeyville winner.

""We're a small but strong community"" she said. ""This is a huge boost that would go a really long way.""

LOUISVILLE Ky. — Four Roses has released their special commemorative bottle celebrating this year’s Kentucky Derby Festival.

The single barrel bourbon bottle features a miniature image of the 2021 Derby Festival official poster designed by Louisville artist Andy Perez.

“This year’s poster really captures the spirit of the Derby Festival and now you can also find it featured on Kentucky’s favorite spirit” Matt Gibson Kentucky Derby Festival President and CEO said. “The bottle is a special collector’s item for Festival and bourbon fans alike.”

Reps from KDF along with Master Distiller Brent Elliott participated in a virtual barrel tasting and selection in January to choose their favorite barrel of Four Roses.

The bottle was released Friday at Kroger Wine & Spirits on Shelbyville Road in Middletown and is being sold for $74.99. Officials say limited quantities are available.

The “Going Up” Kentucky Derby Festival poster featuring a bold colorful Pegasus can be purchased there as well and at other Kroger stores throughout Derby season.

This is part of our Forest Watch activities that we Sierra Club conduct periodically. The Sierra Club looked at a stream and a pipeline right-of-way (ROW). This article summarizes what the Sierra Club found and reported to the U.S. Forest Service (FS).

The Gulf South Pipeline ROW goes from the southwest to the northeast through Compartments 110 and 111. The soils are sandy and there are shrubs seedling trees grasses and herbaceous blooming plants like bitterweed liatris aster coreopsis false foxglove species wooly croton American Beautyberry Sweetgum and St. Andrew’s Cross growing in the ROW.

Then the Sierra Club walked from the ROW south on a tributary of Tarkington Bayou through a mixed pine-hardwood forest. The stream-bed was dry in this ephemeral stream. A culvert had been exposed via erosion on the north side of the ROW. The Sierra Club recommended that the FS repair remove or replace this culvert.

Some of the vegetation that was seen on this walk along and in the stream-bed included Loblolly Pine White Oak Cherry Laurel Sebastian Bush Blackgum Yaupon Holly Sweetgum Southern Magnolia elephant foot American Beautyberry Inland Sea Oats Flowering Dogwood green briar species Japanese Climbing Fern American Holly hickory species (probably Mockernut) Southern Red Oak American Hornbeam Chinese Privet Water Oak Privet Forestiera (Forestiera ligustrina) White Ash Yellow Passion Flower Bracken Fern and Buttonbush. There were signs of feral hog rooting and wallowing which caused significant soil disturbance.

Along Forest Road (FR) 221 In Compartment 111 the Sierra Club found a trail about 6-8 feet in width that was eroded. The Sierra Club walked this entire trail which goes in a 200-yard arc from FR 221 to the Gulf South Pipeline ROW. This appears to be an illegal off-road vehicle (ORV) trail. The trail was bare red earth and was eroded. The Sierra Club recommended to the FS that this illegal ORV trail should be removed and the forest restored.

The Sierra Club also found what appears to be a second illegal ORV trail which goes south through the forest about 150 feet around a downed tree on the Gulf South ROW and then rejoins the ROW. The trail is about 6-8 feet wide and was mostly bare red earth. The Sierra Club reported this illegal ORV trail to the FS and recommended that it be removed and the forest restored.

About 200 yards east from Tarkington Bayou on the Gulf South ROW the Sierra Club found a series of at least five rutted areas which create large ponds on the ROW. The Sierra Club believes that this part of the ROW should be restored to match the topography and provide proper drainage for the ROW. Illegal ORV use may have caused compaction rutting and ponding on the ROW.

Finally the Sierra Club noticed that at the west side of the Gulf South ROW where it intersects with FR 221 the ROW gate/fence is recessed about 150 to 200 feet from the road. Within this space people have dumped trash including parts of cut trees. To reduce illegal ORV access and dumping in Compartment 111 and the ROW the Sierra Club recommended to the FS that the gate/fence be moved to within 40 feet of FR 221.

By conducting Forest Watch and reporting our observations to the FS the Sierra Club assists with protection of SHNF from illegal activities.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In a 2015 speech to the NSW Liberal Party State Council then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull declared “we are not run by factions”. It was a claim that had the party faithful rolling in the aisles. While Labor organises along strict Left-Right lines (with some smaller sub-factions often allied with a specific union) the Liberal Party is far more byzantine. Nevertheless factions or ideological groupings play an important role in organising the modern parliamentary party. To report this story The Sun-Herald and The Sunday Age conducted more than 50 interviews with 39 MPs in the 91-member federal parliamentary Liberal Party. What emerged was agreement on two key points. There are three broad groupings within the party – a Moderate or Modern Liberals wing with Finance Minister Simon Birmingham as its leader; a Morrison Club/Centre-Right grouping led by the Prime Minister; and a National Right group led by Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. The second key point is that MPs (except for the unaligned few) are drawn to one of these three groups by overlapping interests that span their state of origin and the region they’re from allegiance to a powerful individual faith ideology philosophical interests and their year of election. The NSW and South Australian divisions of the party are the most similar to Labor in that they have a factional structure (Moderate National Right and in the case of NSW Centre Right). In Victoria factional allegiances are largely based on personalities and the party has been riven by divisions for at least a decade since the faction led by former federal treasurer Peter Costello and powerbroker Michael Kroger fell apart. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg – close to Kroger and National Right powerbroker Michael Sukkar – leads the Victorian “ambition faction” after he thrashed his friend Health Minister Greg Hunt in the contest for the deputy Liberal leadership in 2018 while the Costello group has largely faded away.

The running joke among party moderates is that in Queensland WA and Tasmania there are no moderates – like Canberra’s version of the Tasmanian Tiger or the Grampians Puma there are people who swear they exist but they rarely break cover in public. So how do Liberal MPs align when it comes to “factions”? How can they be in more than one group? Who is in the “ambition faction”? Who is in the Prayer Group? And who are the Monkey Pod Lunch Conservatives? How do Liberals organise? To understand how the Liberal Party works a good starting point is former Howard government minister David Kemp’s 1973 essay A Leader and a Philosophy. “Liberal factions tend to be very different to Labor’s factions” Kemp says “they aren’t organised in the same way and they tend to cut across each other on different issues it’s not as clear-cut and there is much more fluidity. “The groupings in the Liberal Party tend to be around personalities and issues but you get people with similar views in different groups.” This observation is crucial. In the 1980s and ’90s there were the “dries” who emphasised free-market economics and conservative social policy and the “wets” who favoured more progressive social policy and bigger government but those groups are no more. These days the Moderate faction is the leading advocate of free-market economics whereas the National Right is more concerned with social issues: religious freedoms gender identity national security and until recently opposing same-sex marriage.

Climate change is still a lightning rod: the Moderates favour stronger action to mitigate it the National Right counts some sceptics among its number and the Centre Right takes a pragmatic middle-of-the-pack approach (as it does on many other issues). Personalities in the Liberal constellation of alliances and leaders accrue personal loyalty over time – especially from those they bring into parliament such as the 15 new MPs who won their seats in 2019. While the party’s factional lines are on clearest display during leadership spills the groups are always present working behind the scenes. And while the party does not rely on factions to organise and manage policy debates to the extent that Labor does the groupings play a key role in managing competing interests. Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister Ben Morton with Prime Minister Scott Morrison in May 2019. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen What faction is the Prime Minister in? Scott Morrison is the titular head of the Morrison Club/Centre Right group. Outside NSW where the Centre Right is an organised faction this grouping is the least formally structured of the three main groups. It doesn’t meet on a regular basis and is really several overlapping groups with shared interests and Morrison as its figurehead. The group’s unifying philosophy is pragmatism - that means an adherence to free-market economics (but with enough flexibility to splash billions to prop up the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic) and relatively conservative social values.

As one member of the group puts it “we realise you don’t win elections by yelling at people about abortion. We are dry economically and socially conservative but not in an ‘in your face’ way.” Morrison’s club primarily consists of MPs who entered parliament when he did in 2007: Alex Hawke the factional organiser of the Centre Right in NSW Queenslander Stuart Robert and West Australian Steve Irons. This core group is also defined by their shared faith (all are members of the Prayer Group – more on that below) and their “let’s get things done” approach. Loading Ben Morton another West Australian and like Morrison a former state division director is one of the PM’s closest and most able lieutenants but if Morrison were not in the parliament Morton’s philosophical home would be the National Right. In NSW Morrison and Hawke have five other rusted-on supporters in Hollie Hughes Melissa McIntosh Lucy Wicks Julian Leeser and Jim Molan. Environment Minister Sussan Ley also from NSW is part of the Morrison Club but historically has been a moderate and so isn’t considered a core member of the Centre Right. About half of Treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s Victorian group including Hunt Trade Minister Dan Tehan and a handful of others belong to the Morrison Club. A large cohort of Queenslanders many of them first-termers people of faith or both and some MPs from other states are also members of the Morrison Club. In all about half of the Prayer Group belongs to the Centre Right while the other half is in the National Right. Both Moderates and National Right members argue that some MPs self-nominate as members of the Centre Right because it’s the Morrison Club – personal loyalty to the PM matters particularly for the class of 2019.

MPs who have historically been moderates but are in the Morrison Club include Hunt Ley Hughes Anne Ruston Jason Wood Julian Leeser Sarah Henderson and Rowan Ramsey. On the day that Morrison leaves parliament it’s likely the Centre Right will begin to lose members back to the other two factions unless Frydenberg the clear heir apparent to the Liberal leadership can hold the club together. It’s important to remember that back in 2014 there was a (Joe) Hockey Club – but political trajectories can reverse in an instant. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg who is part of the Morrison Club and Finance Minister Simon Birmingham a Moderate. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Who are the Moderates and Modern Liberals? Simon Birmingham Marise Payne and Paul Fletcher are the three most influential Moderates in the federal Liberal Party. All three are cut from similar cloth and are quieter personalities than their factional predecessors Christopher Pyne Julie Bishop and George Brandis. The Moderates don’t have a weekly meeting when parliament sits. Instead they meet to discuss specific policies or legislation on a more ad hoc basis. A grouping within the larger is dubbed the New Guard Moderates or Modern Liberals. Elected in 2016 or 2019 they typically represent inner-city lower house seats or are in the Senate.

The crunch isn't just happening for high-performance leading-edge nodes as one might expect but tech companies are also jostling for wafers on much older processes as well. So with demand for older and more mature manufacturing technologies is still on the rise SMIC has announced that the Chinese chipmaker intends to build a new 28 nm fab in order to meet the increasing demand for lower-density chips.

The new fab will be located near Shenzhen and will process 300-mm wafers using 28 nm and larger process technologies. SMIC's goal is to eventually achieve production capacity of around 40000 wafer starts per month however the company does not specify when this goal is projected to be attained. Meanwhile SMIC does disclose that it expects to start production at the new fab sometimes in 2022. The company's manufacturing capacities already operate at a 95.5% utilization rate so especially during this chip crunch SMIC is in bad need of additional capacity.

Mature nodes account for the lion's share of SMIC's revenue. Over 95% of SMIC's sales in Q4 2020 were for wafers processed using 28 nm and larger fabrication technologies (see the table below the story). While modern PCs and smartphones rely on primary processors made using leading-edge nodes they also use a wide variety of support chips produced using older processes. Usually such chips (e.g. power ICs display drivers) have a very long lifecycle and are used for dozens of applications. To that end it makes a great financial sense for SMIC to build a fab that will expand its 28 nm 40/45 nm 55/65/ nm and older nodes production capacity.

SMIC said that the estimated new investment for the project will total $2.35 billion. Meanwhile the company's capital expenditures in 2021 will decrease to $4.3 billion down from $5.7 billion in 2020 and $5.9 billion in 2019.

Outfitting this new 28 nm fab will be a bit tricky but overall it shouldn't be too hard given the age of 28 nm technology. Since SMIC is in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List companies from the USA need to apply for an export license which runs the risk of being denied even though it's equipment for an older node. TrendForce reported earlier this month that Applied Materials Lam Research KLA-Tencor and Axcelis had applied for appropriate licenses earlier this year so if the licenses are granted then SMIC should have little trouble equipping its new fab with new tools. Otherwise it would have to seek tools elsewhere perhaps buying them from smaller Chinese chipmakers that ceased to receive aid from the Chinese government last year.

As usual SMIC will build and equip the new fab in partnership with local authorities in this case the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government and Shenzhen Major an investment company controlled by Shenzhen Municipal. The foundry expects to own about 55% of the fab 23% will be owned by Shenzhen Municipal and its investment company whereas the remaining 22% will be owned by third-party investors.

Enjoy this latest wave of Vegas casino resort openings,"With Circa opening in October Virgin Hotels Las Vegas debuting Thursday and Resorts World Las Vegas on deck for the summer the city is in the midst of a new wave.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

We’re in the middle of a wave of new casino openings which is perfect timing for Southern Nevada considering the need to emerge from the lost year of COVID-19.

Virgin Hotels Las Vegas opens its doors Thursday with some crowd-pleasing features highlighted by its restaurant lineup. Be assured that there’s not a single guitar or vinyl disc on any of the walls from the old Hard Rock Hotel that first opened in March 1995.

As openings go Virgin’s arrival will be a little different from the traditional ribbon-cutting although it continues a pattern that has been in place for the last three decades in our city: New casino openings often seem to come in waves of three.

The current trio includes Circa on Oct. 28 Virgin on Thursday and Genting Group’s Resorts World Las Vegas sometime in the summer.

So while many Virgin visitors will be looking for clues about what was where when the building existed as the Hard Rock others will just enjoy the fresh Virgin ambiance filled with imagery of a journey through the desert. It’s not quite the same as checking out a brand-new property but it’s still good.

It’s going to be interesting to see how that plays in Las Vegas in what will be the first casino operated by a tribal enterprise the Mohegan Sun group of Connecticut.

But back to that pattern of three that has been a part of our more recent history. It really started with the November 1989 opening of The Mirage although there were lots of casino-hotels already open before that.

The list of vintage properties starts in downtown with the Golden Gate (January 1906) the Golden Nugget (August 1946) and Binion’s (August 1951) with the Strip’s Flamingo sandwiched in there in December 1946.

After that came Sahara (October 1952) Tropicana (April 1957) what’s now The Linq (opened as Flamingo Capri in 1959) Planet Hollywood (opened as the Tally-Ho in February 1963) Four Queens (June 1966) Caesars Palace (August 1966) Circus Circus (October 1968) and Westgate (opened as the International in July 1969).

The ’70s opened with Harrah’s Las Vegas (July 1973) Bally’s (opened as MGM Grand in December 1973) Oyo (opened as a Howard Johnson in 1973) California Hotel (January 1975) Main Street Station (opened as the Holiday International in 1978) The Cromwell (opened as the Barbary Coast in March 1979) and D Las Vegas (opened as Sundance in July 1980).

Several other storied casino resorts with historic names came and went throughout those years: Riviera Stardust and Aladdin (which sat where Planet Hollywood is now) among them.

But it was in 1989 that things really got interesting when Steve Wynn opened The Mirage built at a cost of $630 million and critics said it was doomed to financial failure. They were wrong.

That first wave of development included The Mirage followed by the off-Strip Rio (January 1990) and Excalibur (June 1990).

The next trifecta wave was one of my personal favorites because the openings all occurred within three months of each other in 1993.

On Oct. 15 of that year the pyramid portion of Luxor with “inclinators” instead of elevators debuted. That was followed Oct. 26 by Treasure Island with a Hollywood panache only Steve Wynn could dream up coordinating cannon fire from one of the two sailing ships in front of the building with the implosion of the Dunes which was to become the site of Wynn’s next resort Bellagio.

The last of the three openings was the MGM Grand on Dec. 18 at the time the largest hotel in the world with a theme park that would open months later.

The next blast of openings were more spread out.

The Strat which saw multiple delays in its construction and once was the site of Bob Stupak’s Vegas World opened to the public in April 1996. That was followed by the Monte Carlo now known as Park MGM in June 1996 and New York-New York in January 1997.

The next wave of openings actually had four resorts opening within a year of each other.

Bellagio opened on a windy night in October 1998 — and the spray from the fountains rained on guests watching the show. Next came Mandalay Bay (March 1999) and The Venetian (May 1999) with openings coming full circle to Paris Las Vegas (September 1999) across the street from Bellagio.

One property the Palms opened in November 2001.

The last wave wasn’t much of a wave at all thanks to the Great Recession. Palazzo opened its doors in December 2007 M Resort in March 2009 and The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in December 2010.

The crest of the newest wave is fast approaching with details starting to emerge on Resorts World.

Is it available to purchase as memorabilia? I know when the Riviera was imploded they sold off casino floor and room furnishings and I wish I had bought a piece as it was my favorite old casino.

A:

There haven’t been too many implosions of consequence in recent years other than the Riviera which you mentioned. The Riv was imploded in 2015 just short of its 60th anniversary. Most of its furnishings including 2075 guest rooms and suites worth of furniture and fixtures all the gaming tables and stools from the casino the bar and restaurant furnishings a vast array of commercial kitchen equipment chandeliers office furniture pool and patio furniture sports memorabilia and on and on were ""re-marketed"" by National Content Liquidators in a $3 million sale. This is what happens to the furnishings from most hotels that close for one reason or another; in its business life NCL has conducted more than 1000 such sales.

Everyone was welcome to buy the items over the four-day sale. Admission just to get in to see it all was $10.

In the case of the Stardust brought down in 2007 Boyd Gaming spokesman David Strow says “All of the furnishings (and most of the other items) were sold after the property closed [presumably by a liquidator] but we did keep a few items around. Most notably we used some of the ‘stars’ from the Stardust marquee in the design of 90 Ninety one of our restaurants at the Suncoast. We do have a few small items left like dice cards and matchbooks … but that’s about all that is left now from the Stardust.”

Another famous implosion back in the day (1993) was Steve Wynn’s takedown of the Dunes. Recalls former Mirage Resorts spokesman Alan Feldman “In those days most old hotel furniture was sold to brokers like Guy Deiro who ran a pretty big auction company in Las Vegas. (He was also quite a character typical of old Vegas.). He in turn often packaged up the furniture in smaller lots and sold it to hotels and motels all over the country. I’m not 100 percent certain about the Dunes but that’s my best guess.

“A few years later when we remodeled Treasure Island all of that furniture went to Deiro. I asked him what on Earth he would do with 2800 sets of identical tables chairs headboards etc. He told me he was putting them in lots of 30-40 sets and selling them to Best Westerns across the country.”

Though it hasn't been imploded when construction on the Fontainebleau was shut down amidst bankruptcy proceedings its furnishings were sold off to the Plaza; the Downtown Grand brought several of its fancy escalators at fire-sale prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zaG93cy1zaWducy1vZi1yZWF3YWtlbmluZy1hLXllYXItYWZ0ZXItcGFuZGVtaWMtYmVnYW4tMjMxMDg1MS_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY2FzaW5vcy1nYW1pbmcvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXNob3dzLXNpZ25zLW9mLXJlYXdha2VuaW5nLWEteWVhci1hZnRlci1wYW5kZW1pYy1iZWdhbi0yMzEwODUxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas shows signs of reawakening a year after pandemic began,"Reduced COVID cases increases in vaccination numbers and the relaxation of restrictions are producing greater optimism that visitors will have fun in Las Vegas.

It’s like the week before Christmas for a tot who can’t wait to open presents.

In this case the present is a return to normal life in Southern Nevada and the sparkling wrapped gifts are the promises that things are going to get better sooner rather than later.

This is what pent-up demand looks like.

The evidence is all around with some indicators on the near horizon and some a little further away.

Trends hinting at Las Vegas’ return have been mounting over the past few weeks as COVID-19 case numbers fell.

Encouraging trends

Experts say the availability of vaccines should help make more Americans comfortable returning to destinations like Las Vegas.

“As more and more people are vaccinated more and more people are going to feel comfortable traveling and feel comfortable in crowds” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

The change of heart comes just after the travel industry’s U.S. economic output was estimated to have lost $1.1 trillion in 2020 according to a recent report from the U.S. Travel Association.

But many people — including those who have not yet been vaccinated — view the dropping COVID-19 case numbers as a green light to travel again. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still advising Americans to delay their vacation plans but tourism experts say many have a desire to travel that outweighs concerns about catching the virus.

“Everything is going in a better direction and there’s a lot of pent-up demand” said Debi Nutton a gaming consultant and former Wynn Resorts Ltd. executive.

Higher room rates

And as more visitors fill Las Vegas’ resorts the city is starting to return to some sense of normalcy.

Room rates shot up over the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament. Hotel rooms at Palazzo Linq and Planet Hollywood are available seven days a week again. Buffets and dayclubs — two major taboos at the height of the pandemic — are returning albeit with amended operations. Fans are back at Golden Knights games again. Nearly 40 shows are performing on the Strip.

The list goes on.

Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority President and CEO Steve Hill said the problem many entertainment venues are facing now is that to maintain social distancing crowds are greatly reduced and many shows including Cirque du Soleil performances need a full house to be profitable.

“Elimination of social distancing will be key to filling entertainment venues” Hill said.

“We think as we head into summer the opportunity to open up attendance to 100 percent should be there with the caveats that we want to make sure we don’t have some completely left turn with a variant and obviously in order for that to take place the vaccine rollout needs to continue with at least the pace we’re at now.”

Gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization said all of the trends that have been building up over the past few weeks are a sign that Las Vegas is on track to return to its former glory.

“In their own small individual way (these indicators) lead to a slow thoughtful building up of momentum and return to people actually coming to Las Vegas to enjoy themselves in greater numbers” he said.

“(These are signs) that point toward Vegas getting a little bit closer to what Vegas was in terms of America’s favorite place to come and enjoy yourself.”

Greater capacity

Loosened restrictions have helped open the doors for returning visitors. Restaurants and casino floors are allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity up from 25 percent a few weeks back and certain large gatherings that had been capped at 20 percent can fill up to half of their capacity.

“With Gov. Sisolak’s loosening of the capacity restrictions I think that has made (casino) companies even more confident that the recovery will continue” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

He added that even though booking windows are still short “Strip operators are just becoming more enthused about what the summer could look like.”

The positive trends seem to have come at an opportune moment. The tourist corridor’s newest property Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is set to open next week pool season is kicking off at resorts across the valley and the city is potentially just months away from seeing major conventions return.

“I think the COVID-related news has been positive of late and people are starting to travel again” said Nehme Abouzeid founder and president of marketing consultancy LaunchVegas LLC.

“My friends in entertainment tell me advance tickets are selling well” Abouzeid said. “The warm weather is arriving and the pools here look inviting. Quite rightly Vegas never stopped marketing itself to the world since we knew that while COVID was going to be serious and protracted it would still be a relative blip and that our core industry would have to find a way back. People still longed to come here — nothing went wrong structurally with consumer demand for Vegas; they were simply responding to the pandemic.”

The sense of optimism surrounding Las Vegas tourism is refreshing but experts warn that the city still faces a long road to recovery with possible bumps along the way.

For one weekday visitation is still struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels. Strip occupancies today hover between 70 and 90 percent but midweek rooms are typically only 40 to 60 percent full.

Those numbers aren’t expected to fully bounce back until the city sees the return of international visitors and meetings and convention bookings.

Truist gaming analyst Barry Jonas said in-person conventions are expected to return this summer but he expects a “more lagged” recovery for midweek business travel relative to the weekend leisure travel.

“We’re certainly starting to see a return of Las Vegas tourism” Jonas said but “the improvements are more pronounced on the weekends.”

Threat from variants

Another surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases could impede recovery. Some health experts worry about yet another spike in cases as variants of the virus continue to spread across the country.

That could lead to resorts facing strict operating restrictions again.

“While we are thankful that the destination is bouncing back well we need to be mindful that one slip in the numbers could reverse the trend as we saw last November when the governor imposed the cut in capacity” said Brendan Bussmann of Global Market Advisors.

The rapidly changing numbers in both reduced cases and vaccinations has resulted in some organizations having to speed up their plans to accommodate the pent-up demand.

Hill told a Nevada Commission on Tourism recovery subcommittee Thursday that the LVCVA and its advertising consultant R&R Partners is considering bumping up a paid advertising and marketing campaign to attract leisure travelers.

“We will evolve to telling our own message again … the governor’s decision to open up vaccinations to everyone on April 5 is also a signal for us to speed up from what we intended to do toward the end of April probably to the middle of April” Hill said.

“The trends on the leisure side have followed the health numbers almost exactly. As things have gotten better the interest in travel and the bookings we are seeing both now and in the future are really good showing a lot of improvement” he said.

There are other indications some of the long-term indications are looking good.

The Life is Beautiful music and arts festival scheduled for downtown Las Vegas Sept. 17-19 sold out 50000 passes in record time hours after they first went on sale.

World of Concrete approved

Organizers of the World of Concrete a major citywide convention that routinely draws 60000 people to Southern Nevada announced Wednesday that they had received permission from the Nevada Department of Business and Industry to stage their show from June 8-10 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Hill and other tourism leaders in the state had pointed to World of Concrete as the likely first major show to return to the trade show fold.

“The entire industry was watching to see if the World of Concrete could happen” Hill said. “The fact that it did has resulted in three shows approved in the last 24 hours following that.

“This will be the first major show to take place across the United States” he said. “Even though other states have been open to doing it those shows have not been able to move forward because of the health situation and getting exhibitors to commit to come and attendees to attend regardless of what the states’ protocols or rules were those major shows have not happened.”

And conventions can also be important to leisure travel.

“I think people are desperate to get out of their houses and go anywhere” said Pam Robinson chairwoman of the Commission on Tourism’s recovery subcommittee. “When people come for conventions they often add a day to their trips.”

Conventions and trade shows are big drivers of tourism for Southern Nevada. Executives for nearly every publicly traded Las Vegas-based company that have convention facilities — MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Inc. Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. among them — remarked during their fourth-quarter earnings calls how strong their convention calendars are looking for late 2021 2022 and 2023.

“We’ve been wandering in the abyss for almost a year now … and you can clearly see the light shining through at this point in Las Vegas” Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said during a February call with investors.

“We feel very good that we’ve seen the bottom in Vegas and in the business and that we’re only going to keep getting better.”

Anticipating eventual high demand the LVCVA tended to its convention infrastructure.

The organization months ago committed to having its new $987.1 million West Hall and its $52.5 million underground people-mover completed in time for the 2021 CES show. When the Consumer Technology Association operators of CES announced in July that it was canceling an in-person show the LVCVA went ahead and completed construction.

Trade shows that had been canceled or postponed began scrambling for available dates to stage their shows.

The LVCVA also moved ahead with its plan to purchase the Las Vegas Monorail Co. out of bankruptcy. Hill said the 3.9-mile elevated electric transit system is critical to moving conventioneers to shows when they return. As a result the LVCVA expects the monorail to resume operations around the Memorial Day weekend.

What could go wrong

While the Las Vegas reawakening shows blue skies in most areas there are still some reasons to doubt everything will go smoothly and many questions remain unanswered.

Clark County officials are hopeful that between 60 percent and 70 percent of its residents will get their vaccinations by the end of May. What if they don’t? What happens if the COVID-19 variants spread and the public has doubts that any vaccination would be effective?

Worse what if vaccinations aren’t effective against newly discovered variants?

While tourism leaders are confident that conventions and trade shows will come back strong what will attendance look like? Will a show that normally draws 50000 people see only 25000?

That’s one of the worries for shows that typically attract an international audience like CES. While Nevada and the United States are on track for more visitation there isn’t much they can do about travelers from Europe Asia and even Canada.

Nevertheless experts are optimistic for Las Vegas’ future.

“We don’t know what’s going to happen. … We may see some stops and starts” UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said. But “I think this is the beginning of a long-term recovery.”

Bussmann concurs.

“As long as this trend continues it bodes well for the long term recovery that will include the business and MICE (meetings incentives conferencing and exhibitions) customer coming back to Las Vegas” he said. “With World of Concrete set for June let’s hope the trend continues to allow this event to come off what has historically been one of the largest gaming shows in the destination. Assuming this happens and we have no set back it could make for a nice third and fourth quarter of bringing business back to Las Vegas.”

Encouraging numbers

The seven-day average for new cases reported in the U.S. was 53200 as of Friday according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a sharp decline from the seven-day average peak of 249389 in January.

The drop comes as more Americans are getting shots in arms; as of Friday about 16 percent of U.S. adults had been fully vaccinated.

The vaccination rate is expected to build as more age groups become eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Starting April 5 anyone 16 and over in Nevada will be able to get their shots.",,,,,,

The S&P 500 pulled back from all-time highs this past week on investor concerns about rising interest rates and inflation.

On Wednesday the Federal Reserve announced it is maintaining its target interest rate range of between zero and 0.25% and reassured investors that inflation “continues to run below 2%.” However the Fed also increased its full-year 2021 PCE inflation projection from 1.8% to 2.4% prompting 10-year Treasury yields to rise above 1.7% for the first time since January 2020.

Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. bank Wednesday to offer a select group of its wealthiest most risk-tolerant clients access to Bitcoin funds. Bitcoin prices hit $60000 for the first time last weekend but pulled back to around $58500 to close out the week.

On Tuesday Uber announced it will be reclassifying all of its U.K. drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. The change came after Uber lost a legal battle in the U.K. over driver classifications and the company is currently fighting a similar battle in the state of California.

Corey Taylor's concert announced Wednesday will be the first at the iconic Detroit venue since mid-November 2019 a few months before COVID-19 engulfed the nation and halted in-person gatherings. Taylor's CMFTour is scheduled to be among the first national acts coming to metro Detroit. Scores of other performers who have kept tentative holds on spring and summer dates in Michigan and elsewhere will be watching closely.

Harpos normally packs in more than 2000 people in the east-side Detroit venue but it will likely be at limited capacity and lacking many of the hallmarks of a traditional heavy metal show. There won't be any crowd surfing stage storming or mosh pits — more like mosh pods and a psychosocially distant experience.

""To be honest with you I'm nervous"" said Ruzvelt Stevanovski who bought Harpos five years ago but has been in the business 40 years. ""I had the ball rollin' man … 2019 was a successful year. Most of the shows were sold out. We had the momentum going until this happened. It's like we're starting all over again.""

Many local venue operators have had the same feeling of being frozen in time for the past year not knowing when they could reopen or if they could survive that long.

DTE Energy Music Theatre the 15300-capacity amphitheater in Clarkston and symbol of summer has sat empty for a year and a half but its books remain full. James Taylor and Jackson Browne are scheduled to play there June 12 kicking off a season of big shows that includes Dave Matthews Steely Dan Steve Winwood Santana Ted Nugent Kiss and Alanis Morissette among others. Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre at Freedom Hill in Sterling Heights also has a full slate of shows scheduled.

What's likely to happen industry observers say is that some of the schedule will be pushed like what happened in 2020. Shows on the second half of the calendar stand a better chance of going forward.

""We are basically in a holding pattern"" said Scott Hammontree co-owner of the Intersection in Grand Rapids who also represents Michigan members of the National Independent Venue Association. ""Really a wait-and-see in terms of what the state will allow us to do and at what capacity we will be allowed to operate.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVzaWMvMTQxMjg1MC9BbmRyZWEtQm9jZWxsaS13ZWRkaW5nLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXdpZmUtVmVyb25pY2Etc2luZy1tYW5hZ2VyLWNoaWxkcmVuLVZpcmdpbmlhLU1hdHRlb9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVzaWMvMTQxMjg1MC9BbmRyZWEtQm9jZWxsaS13ZWRkaW5nLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXdpZmUtVmVyb25pY2Etc2luZy1tYW5hZ2VyLWNoaWxkcmVuLVZpcmdpbmlhLU1hdHRlby9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andrea Bocelli wedding anniversary: Watch him sing with wife Veronica dance and kiss,"Andrea Bocelli promotes Believe acoustic album

He said: ""Big age gaps are a tradition in my family — my own father and mother have one."" They married at the Sanctuary of Madonna di Montenero in Livorno Tuscany on Virginia's second birthday. Andrea and Veronica's enduring love was displayed when they took to the stage at a special filmed concert at the grand Hollywood Dolby Theatre in LA.

Apart from the title itself the song is sung almost entirely in Italian but the sentiment is crystal clear. They harmonise perfectly until the bridge when they both sing the classic line ""Heaven I'm in heaven..."" Rather than complete the phrase ""when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek"" they demonstrate instead before ending the number with a romantic kiss. DON'T MISS

Back then Sting had no idea how great his escape would be. Now he embraces the world – not just geographically with homes in Tuscany Manhattan and Wiltshire but musically too. His new album of classy collaborations Duets includes a host of acclaimed international artists. Escape happened dramatically for young English teacher Gordon Sumner when in January 1977 he bundled his first wife and six-week-old son into a Morris Minor and fled to London to pursue his dream. He was singer and bass-player with Newcastle-based jazz-rock band Last Exit. A chance meeting with drummer Stewart Copeland changed the jobless 25-year-old’s life.

With Andy Summers on guitar they became The Police taking new wave energy and welding it to reggae – “a much more sophisticated and seductive thing”. Over five years they conquered the world with hit singles platinum-selling albums and global tours. Sting’s chiselled cheekbones adorned hundreds of magazines but he was never a standard pop star. His heroes were Sinatra Gershwin Hendrix Eisler and jazz musicians like Gil Evans. For decades now he’s worked with an eclectic range of stars including soul legend Sam Moore Annie Lennox and Shaggy – all featured on Duets. The compilation took so long in coming it could almost be called tantric. It opens with Little Something co-written by his guitarist Dominic Miller and co-starring Melody Gardot “a wonderful American jazz singer” says Sting 69. “I’ve been a fan for a long time. We were in different counties in different studios so it was very much a pandemic relationship. “We met when we made a video and we had a great rapport. We had a joke telling competition which she won – I won’t tell you the joke but it’s a lovely song. I love it.”

It’s Probably Me was co-written with Eric Clapton for 1987’s Lethal Weapon film. Then comes Stolen Car with Quebec-born French star Mylène Farmer. “I met the mysterious Mylène a few years ago” Sting recalls. “She asked if I had any songs we could record together. “I’d written this strange song about a psychic car thief who when he steals a car can channel the story of the family who own it. “The husband is having an affair and the wife suspects. So Mylène and I made a very sexy video in Paris I played the thief and she played the wife. It was Number One in France.” Desert Rose with Algerian musician Cheb Mami was another huge hit written as a homage to the North African music Sting had heard in Parisian clubs. In 1999 he met Cheb “who has a beautiful very strange and unique voice; Desert Rose was one of the biggest hits of the year. It was a hit in Arab countries it was a hit in Israel it crossed borders.” Sting’s lyrics were about longing and spirituality. He asked Cheb to write some words in Arabic and the music inspired him to come up with the same concept independently. “His lyrics had the same meaning” he says. “Music translates beyond language beyond culture.”

Rise & Fall by Craig David was based on Sting’s Shape of My Heart. “I’m always happy when a song is used as a template for other creative explorations” he says. Don’t Make Me Wait in LA with Shaggy launched the odd couple’s long friendship. Sting describes the reggae star as “a kindred spirit…I love his company he makes me laugh I even make him laugh! It’s a bromance yeah I’m not ashamed of that.” Whenever I Say Your Name was based on a Bach prelude. He wanted US soul star Mary J. Blige – “a wonderful unique powerful singer” for it but feared she wouldn’t turn him down. Instead “she did a fantastic job” he says. “It’s one of my favourites.” Sting met Congolese rapper GIMS at a festival in Cannes. GIMS played him Reste and asked him to sing on it. “I wrote a verse for the middle of the song. His singing was brilliant. He has a fantastic vocal technique.” He sings We’ll Be Together with Annie Lennox – a friend since 1977. “We both have passions about the world about human rights women’s rights and we toured together a lot.”

In the 90s they performed the song together every night on tour. Their version ended up on the Bridget Jones Diary soundtrack. The late French star Charles Aznavour suggested their duet over dinner but wanted Sting to sing in French. The result was L’Amour C’est Comme Un Jour. “It was an amazing privilege for me. He was an icon and I wanted to pay homage to French culture.” Sting recorded My Funny Valentine with Herbie Hancock – another old friend. They met when the jazz legend came to Sting’s show with the Blue Turtles in Paris. “My manager suggested we sang this. We did a lovely version of it very floaty and free. Herbie’s one of my favourite musicians.” Fragile is another oft-covered Sting number. “It’s a sad respectful and reflective song so when shocking things happen and people need to be soothed this comes on the radio” he says. “It happened a lot after 9/11 and after The Bataclan. “Julio Iglesias asked me to play guitar on his version. I don’t get asked very often to play guitar on people’s records but I’m always flattered when they do.”

He sings Mama with Lybian-born GASHI a refugee whose mother fled Kosovo for Brooklyn during the Yugoslav wars. There “he became a rapper so his story is really the dramatic story of what America is. “He told me I was one of the inspirations for his wanting to be a musician and asked if I’d sing on the song he’d written.

I’d forgotten the days of the week and I was just missing the change of the season. “September is that desire for seasonal change.

The late King of Pop Michael Jackson was survived by his three children when he died on June 25 2009. The singer lost his life to a drug overdose (acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication) a diagnosis which later caused the conviction of his personal physician Conrad Murray. His legacy continues with his children Prince Jackson Paris Jackson and Blanket Jackson.

Prince the eldest of the three recently appeared on a video interview where he discussed the incredible memories he has of his father. He even gave some insight into the wisdom he received from Jackson before his untimely death. The 24-year-old said: “You know there are so many nuggets there that are just so close to my heart that I feel like they're applicable at all times. “But the one that is my guiding principle is that 'You never stop learning.'""

The Space Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron said March 18 it hard confirmed the NOAA-17 satellite broke up March 10. The squadron said it was tracking 16 pieces of debris associated with the satellite and that there was no evidence the breakup was caused by a collision.

In a statement to SpaceNews March 19 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that the satellite had broken up having been notified about the incident by NASA’s Orbital Debris Program Office. “At this time the debris poses little threat to the International Space Station or to any other critical space assets” NOAA stated.

The spacecraft originally designated NOAA-M launched in June 2002. The spacecraft was designed to operate for three years but served in a primary or backup role for nearly 11 years until NOAA formally decommissioned it in April 2013.

Neither NOAA nor other agencies released the cause of the breakup. However NOAA-17 is similar to other polar-orbiting satellites that suffered breakups. In November 2015 the NOAA-16 satellite broke up nearly a year and a half after a “critical anomaly” ended operations. Two satellites in the Air Force’s Defense Meteorological Satellite Program DMSP F-13 and DMSP F-12 broke up in February 2015 and October 2016 respectively

The failure of DMSP F-13 was blamed on a design flaw in the satellite’s battery that is also found on other DMSP satellites. Those satellites along with NOAA-15 and NOAA-17 were built by Lockheed Martin.

When NOAA decommissioned NOAA-17 in 2013 the agency said it performed a “deactivation process” with the spacecraft. In a statement to SpaceNews NOAA said that process included disconnecting the batteries on the spacecraft as well as opening thruster valves and turning off its transmitters. “These steps were taken to ensure the satellite was as inert as possible and minimized the risk of radio frequency interference with other spacecraft after decommissioning” NOAA stated.

Those activities are among the federal government’s recommendations to passivate spacecraft at the end of their lives removing energy sources that could cause explosions. “All onboard sources of stored energy of a spacecraft or upper stage should be depleted or safed when they are no longer required for mission operations or postmission disposal” the U.S. government’s Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices document states.

The fact that a satellite could still break up even after following those best practices shows the limits of those guidelines. “I don’t doubt NOAA did what they could and think this is more a case of a legacy satellite that was designed in an era before we really cared much about debris mitigation” said Brian Weeden director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation.

While NOAA said the satellite is not a threat to the space station or “other critical space assets” it is in a sun-synchronous orbit used by other weather and Earth observation spacecraft.

Some of those satellites are not only threatened by such debris but also pose a threat of creating more debris. Weeden noted a report by NASA’s inspector general in January that found two NASA missions in polar orbits QuikSCAT and Terra not only fail to meet the 25-year threshold for deorbiting spacecraft after the end of their missions they also pose a risk of explosion because of batteries that cannot be disconnected or propellant tanks that cannot be depressurized.

That report found that “mitigation-only” activities to prevent the creation of new orbital debris were not sufficient to keep the space environment stable. “Rather to effectively address the orbital debris issue global mitigation and strategic remediation efforts are necessary” the report concluded recommending NASA support active debris removal efforts including funding technologies to enable such systems.

Weeden agreed. “I would hope this serves as yet another example why the U.S. and other governments need to invest in active debris removal capabilities to take legacy satellites that were never designed to comply with the debris mitigation guidelines and remove them from orbit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL3JhY2UtZm9yLWEtdXNhZi1oeXBlcnNvbmljLW1pc3NpbGUtb24tdHJhY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Race for a USAF hypersonic missile on track,"The race to develop a US Air Force hypersonic missile to match China and Russia faces its first crucial flight test within “the next 30 days” Northwest Florida News reported.

The upcoming test of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) developed by aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin was announced by the Air Force’s Armament Directorate at Eglin Air Force Base.

A next-generation weapon capable of traveling at multiple times the speed of sound the ARRW test is set for the Point Mugu Sea Range off the coast of Southern California the report said.

The test of the missile will not involve live munitions and is designed only to test the ignition of the missile and its ability to boost a payload toward its target.

It will be launched from a B-52H bomber flying at about 50000 feet.

The ARRW will carry only a “simulated glide vehicle” that “will not sustain flight and will safely disintegrate soon after separation” according to the Armament Directorate.

The US is aggressively pursuing development of hypersonic weapons which travel at speeds fast than Mach 5 making them difficult to defend against.

That pursuit is in conjunction with a switch in focus of the national defense strategy from efforts to root out terrorists across the globe to a great-powers orientation focusing on “near-peer” adversaries most notably Russia and China the report said.

Russia and China have recently unveiled hypersonic weapons although their numbers and operational status are not clear the report said.

But some military experts say America doesn’t need hypersonic missiles and is just pouring money down a hole.

“At the end of the day I am not sure about the value of hypersonic weapons” said one analyst who wished to remain anonymous.

“While they are very fast they also will generate a big heat signature and possibly a strong magnetic signal too (based on a rudimentary notion of physics).

“This means they will be detectable at some distance from the target and can be intercepted” he said.

“My other concern is the focus on them takes away from other important needs. DoD has a curious ability to flush billions of dollars down the drain with no sense of prioritizing needs.

“If you take what is wasted add it up we could double the size of our fighting forces and stay below the current budget.

“We don’t need to copycat the Russians and Chinese.”

The perceived threat prompted the Department of Defense’s Missile Defense Agency to award separate contracts of more than US$100 million each to Florida-based L3 Harris Technologies and Virginia-based Northrop Grumman to develop Earth-orbiting sensors capable of detecting and tracking hypersonic weapons from space the report said.

The Armament Directorate at Eglin is managing the Lockheed Martin hypersonic missile effort under a contract carrying a not-to-exceed cost of US$480 million.

Under the contract Lockheed Martin is working with the Air Force to design and develop the ARRW hypersonic weapon by Nov. 30 of this year.

The test follows a half-dozen previous “captive-carry” tests of the missile. In captive-carry testing the missile is not launched from its host aircraft but the performance of its electronics and other systems are assessed while it is attached to that aircraft.

The upcoming test will be conducted by the 412th Test Wing a unit of the Air Force Test Center at California’s Edwards Air Force Base.

Meanwhile across the world a Norwegian cruise missile has been air-dropped from the internal weapons of a Lockheed Martin F-35A test aircraft the Norway Defense Materiel Agency agency announced.

The anti-surface Joint Strike Missile (JSM) is a long-distance weapon that takes on heavily defended targets on land and at sea.

Developed by Raytheon Missiles & Defense and Norwegian defense company Kongsberg Defence Aerospace — it is the only fifth-generation cruise missile designed to be launched from the internal weapons bay of an F-35A.

Its long standoff range or distance from the launching aircraft to the target keeps pilots out of harm’s way Raytheon said on its website.

The JSM’s navigation system allows it to rapidly change course in flight and fly at low radar-evading altitudes.

Its imaging infrared seeker provides autonomous target recognition and a two-way data link offers retargeting and mission abort options.

The aircraft will be able to carry two such missiles internally while additional ones could be carried on the external wing pylons (obviously affecting the overall Low Observability of the aircraft) according to a report in The Aviationist.

“With this first drop it was checked that JSM can be separated from an F-35A in a safe way. For that we use an instrumented aircraft” says Brigadier Jarle Nergård who is head of the F-35 department in Defense Materiel.

“This aircraft is also equipped with three cameras inside the weapons bay and has mounted a separate camera pod on the wing with three more cameras. In order to be able to analyze exactly what is happening both the aircraft and the JSM missile are marked with special photo marks that are accurately positioned.”

The missile was also instrumented so that all telemetry data was recorded and sent via data link to the ground The Aviationist reported.

During the test AF-01 was chased by a two-seater F-16D with a cameraman in the back seat who filmed the separation of the JSM from the F-35 so that footage could be studied by the Norwegian team.

Following the first separation more tests will be conducted with the JSM that has already successful fit checks on all the F-35 variant external wing pylons as well as US Navy and Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18E/F Super Hornets The Aviationist reported.

Along with Norway Japan has also selected the missile for the JASDF (Japan Air Self-Defense Force) F-35As. Norway is expected to declare IOC (Initial Operational Capability) of the JSM in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLWFpci1mb3JjZS1mb3VuZC1hLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LWZvci1pdHMtaWNvbmljLWYtMTYtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzL9IBYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLWFpci1mb3JjZS1mb3VuZC1hLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LWZvci1pdHMtaWNvbmljLWYtMTYtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch US’ Latest Fighter Jets That Could Sideline The F-35s & Replace The Iconic F-16 Jets,"Even as the US Air Force is hunting for advanced jets to replace the iconic fleet of F-16s independent experts have floated a new design called ‘F-36 Kingsnake’ pitching it as America’s next fighter jet.

Last month US Air Force Chief Gen. Charles Brown said that the service was having a second thought on the earlier plan of replacing the sturdy F-16 fighters with the fifth-generation Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter jets.

While the F-35 is a highly sought-after aircraft across the world the fighter jet’s huge operating cost coupled with the history of problems may have forced the US to look at other alternatives.

“The Air Force will consider a ‘clean-sheet design’ for a new ‘four-and-a-half-gen or fifth-gen-minus’ fighter as a direct replacement for the F-16s currently in service” said Brown adding the service has already launched a study to look at possible alternatives.

While the study is expected to be finished by 2023 an aviation magazine Hush-Kit invited some experts to design the potential replacement for the F-16.

The magazine teamed up with aviation experts such as Stephen Mcparlin and James Smith who helped develop aircraft such as the Lockheed F-35 Lightning II and Eurofighter Typhoon and illustrator Andy Godfrey from the Teasel Studio.

What’s Wrong With F-16s?

Originally developed by General Dynamics the single-engine supersonic all-weather multirole F-16 fighter jet has remained the backbone of the US Air Force ever since its first flight in 1974.

However the USAF is now struggling to maintain an aging fleet of fighters and there is a need for a more advanced aircraft to provide support to the F-35 and F-22 Raptors.

According to Brown the new fighter jet should be an affordable lightweight one that doesn’t necessarily have advanced stealth features and hence a ‘fifth-gen-minus’ design.

Keeping all parameters in mind Hush-Kit and the team of experts designed a new fighter jet calling it ‘F-36 Kingsnake’.

The ‘F-36 Kingsnake’

Like the F-16 the F-36 Kingsnake would be a multi-role fighter jet capable of carrying out air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.

According to reports the new design has made provisions for missiles and guided bombs that could be carried in internal bays. The weapons that may be integrated include new generation long-range air-to-air missiles.

The F-36 fighter would also be equipped with a gun making it capable of strafing attacks against enemy forces on the ground.

It is believed the concept aircraft would use the F-22 Raptor’s F119 afterburning turbofan engine to attain a top speed of Mach 2. The fighter would be equipped with AN/APG-83 advanced electronically scanned array radar the same one used on the latest version of the F-16 fighter jet.

According to Hush-Kit the F-36 fighter jets’ wings are based on the wings of the F-16XL with the cranked arrow having an inboard section of increased sweepback.

The new fighter jet’s wing makes it efficient at high speeds enabling it to be faster than the F-35 stealth fighter jet. Moreover the design of the wing allows sufficient space for fuel and external hardpoints.

Bigger wings also provide instantaneous turn rate. The fighter is expected to have high energy maneuverability with low wave drag and a good thrust-to-weight ratio.

The brand-new SIGMA 11515 Frigates are part of a wider package offer by Damen in partnership with Thales Nederland with support of the government of The Netherlands.

It recently surfaced that the Hellenic Navy need was not limited to new-built frigates. Their need is so urgent that they require a “stop-gap” solution (consisting in the procurement of second-hand vessels or a lease of existing vessels) as well as an upgrade to the in-service Hydra-class frigates.

Naval News previously reported on the proposals from Lockheed Martin and Naval Group. This time around we contacted Damen to learn more about the Dutch proposal to Greece. Here is what we learned from Pieter Heijboer Manager Naval Sales Support at Damen Naval.

Naval News – What is the SIGMA 11515?

Pieter Heijboer – SIGMA 11515 is the next step in our well-known SIGMA class of ships in this sense it has been for some time in the drawing board. Already since some couple of years it has been presented to several customers as a possibility together with other ships in our portfolio. In particular the Hellenic Navy showed interest in this design during our initial talks more than one year ago.

The SIGMA 11515 represents an evolution from the SIGMA 10514 already in service within several navies who operate in challenging ops theatres. A clever standardization policy and anticipation to the market are key enablers to support a flexible portfolio that swiftly can serve specific requirements of a Customer.

The main advantages that the SIGMA11515 offers when compared with our other designs are:

• Increased payload with respect to other designs in our portfolio;

• Additional flexibility thanks to the use of dedicated flexible spaces for mission reconfiguration;

• Possibility to include modern developments in weapons and sensors

• risk reduction and clever and fast realization and project set up based on familiarity and commonalities with regards to the SIGMA 10514

Damen picture showing TNI AL (Indonesian Navy)’s PKR frigate also known as SIGMA 10514. The Mexican Navy also selected it for its POLA requirement. The new SIGMA 11515 is based on this design. In addition Damen is proposing two SIGMA 10514 built in a Greek shipyard at an accelerated pace in order to fill the Hellenic Navy urgent “stop gap” need.

Naval News – Can you please detail Damen’s offer in terms of new ships “stop gap” solution and Hydra-class Upgrade?

Pieter Heijboer – All the 4 SIGMA 11515 will be built locally in Greece. Our offer and project set up is based on domestic building and setting to work but also on preparing the life cycle support of the four frigates.

The intermediate solutions we have proposed are:

a. Two Karel Doorman class are offered to the HN directly from the Netherlands Government

b. Two SIGMA 10514 locally built. Building time of these vessels which fit perfect in the SIGMA line with SIGMA 11515 would be very short. This local building process is proven. We can compete in every aspect with all other second-hand class offers that we have seen. Second hand offers are not ready for operations and would probably also have to be adjusted and modernized to the Hellenic Navy requirements and latest technical standards. Fast new build solves these issues.

Damen together with Thales Netherlands are intensively studying the Hydra update requirements from the Hellenic Navy. The Damen/Thales combination will ensure quality of our proposal and possible execution of the contract in Greece and it will also provide commonality as much as possible with our SIGMA offer.

Naval News – Have you visited shipyards in Greece? Have you identified local partners already?

Pieter Heijboer – Damen visited all relevant shipyards in Greece where our surveys showed that SIGMA could be built making use of our experience in building SIGMA’s successfully worldwide. Our surveys also focused on the local supply chain. Because to build a ship like the Sigma and to provide support during the sustainment also local suppliers are essential for the success of this program.

Naval News – Is the Dutch government supporting your bid?

Pieter Heijboer – Indeed our bid is strongly supported by the Dutch government including a financing arrangement supported by Atradius (Dutch state export credit agency). Intrinsically there is a broader base of commonality with also other NATO/EU partners such as Germany and Belgium where we offer to have a similar Above Water Warfare System and sensors as projected on their new frigates. Therefore this offers already European cooperation in place since important parts of this proposal are fielded in other EU/NATO partners.

Naval News – Can you tell us more about the role of Thales?

Pieter Heijboer – Thales Nederland is our partner. This gives additional certainty in the project since we have a long-standing cooperation relation and actually as we speak this is underway in our projects for the German frigate programme F126 and the Belgian/Netherlands Frigate replacement programme. The sensors and weapons are a mix of European and US systems.

Naval News – Several local (Greek) media reports mention that the American and French bid are supposedly “ahead”. What is your response? Why do you believe Damen offers the best package?

Pieter Heijboer – Damen does not comment on claims or specifics of our competition but focuses on the Client.

a. The Client the Hellenic Navy still uses the Dutch designed and at Damen Schelde built Elli class with which they are operationally and technically very happy. That quality which results in force in theatre can be prolonged via our offer.

b. Specifications of the SIGMA 11515 fully serves Hellenic Navy requirements according to Hellenic Navy statements

c. Damen will build all 4 vessels locally in Greece. This offers a solid and long-lasting prospect for Hellenic naval shipbuilding. Damen is the only shipbuilding group that has proven to be able to build in country and at the same time is able to build up a capable yard to export. Damen has proven to be successful in this concept in Vietnam Indonesia Romania etc. In total Damen has built 1000+ ships at local non-Damen shipyards.

d. Pricewise Damen is competitive with pricing below 600 Million Euros per ship locally built. This includes an ILS package which safeguards solid in life support and maintaining up time of the vessels.

For the record France and Greece were involved in exclusive negotiations for a while for two FDI type frigates. However despite the signing of an LOI in October 2019 Greece decided to keep its options open and is now considering several designs. The designs being considered today in addition to Damen’s SIGMA 11515 are:

Lockheed Martin with the MMSC

Naval Group with the FDI/Belharra

TKMS with the MEKO A200NG (or MEKO A300)

Babcock with the Type 31/Arrowhead

Navantia (allegedly with the F-110)

Fincantieri (allegedly with the FREMM)

The procurement process doesn’t seem to be a “classic open tender” but rather government to government (G to G) discussions with each party."

Sunday 21 March 2021

Another day another incredibly tight fight at the top of the Moto2™ timesheets? Yup. Sunday at the Official Moto2™ and Moto3™ Qatar Test saw Sam Lowes (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) snatch P1 in the intermediate class but the top three was covered by just 0.048 as Marco Bezzecchi (Sky Racing Team VR46) took second and Remy Gardner (Red Bull KTM Ajo) third. All three will likely be starting the year expecting to challenge for wins and their tests only underlined their speed.

The conditions were fair on Sunday once again and Lowes’ best is the quickest lap of the test as preparations continued for the coming race weekend(s). The gaps one again show we have a stunner in store across the top three and throughout the timesheets. Lowes Bezzecchi and Gardner will leave the test happy and so too will Jake Dixon (Petronas Sprinta Racing) as the Brit rounded out Sunday in fourth. After a wrist injury that could have been a career-threatener getting straight back into the top five is no mean feat. That top five on Day 3 of the test was completed by Dixon’s teammate Xavi Vierge who was fastest on Saturday.

Sixth place goes to Bo Bendsneyder on Day 3 as the Dutchman continues to impress upon his move to Pertamina Mandalika SAG Team and Kalex. He was only 0.033 off Vierge as he made a late leap up the timesheets and is another who has been consistently improving. Nicolo Bulega (Federal Oil Gresini Moto2) ends Sunday in seventh another late to move up the timesheets but doing so in style.

Style is also a good word to describe the start of Raul Fernandez’ (Red Bull KTM Ajo) Moto2™ career. Fastest rookie throughout the Spaniard is on course for an incredibly impressive debut race weekend. So too now is Albert Arenas (Inde Aspar Team) though as the reigning Moto3™ World Champion shot up into the top ten on Sunday only 0.052 off fellow rookie Fernandez. Arenas’ teammate Aron Canet completes the top ten sliding down from second on Day 1 and Day 2 but another with some key consistency.

Stefano Manzi (Flexbox HP40) takes P11 by just 0.003 ahead of another impressive rookie in the form of Ai Ogura (Idemitsu Honda Team Asia) with yet another right behind him: Cameron Beaubier (American Racing). The American was only 0.016 off Ogura too… and pipped compatriot Joe Roberts (Italtrans Racing Team) by 0.011. Marcel Schrötter (Liqui Moly Intact GP) completed the fastest fifteen just edging out rookie teammate Tony Arbolino.

That’s it from the pre-season test for the Moto2™ class with the stage well and truly set for the first race of the season. Are Lowes Bezzecchi Gardner and their experienced compatriots ready for battle? And can the rookies edge ever closer as practice begins? Find out on Friday as the Barwa Grand Prix of Qatar begins.

Sam Lowes tops Qatar test to end pre-season in style

A busy but positive pre-season campaign came to a conclusion for Elf Marc VDS Racing Team riders Sam Lowes and Augusto Fernandez in Qatar this evening.

Lowes gave himself a huge confidence boost at the end of the three-day test by topping the overall timesheets in superb fashion while Fernandez concentrated on finding a better setting with the rear of his Kalex chassis.

Lowes and Fernandez will return to the Losail International Circuit in just five days for the opening Free Practice session of the 2021 World Championship which kicks off a scheduled 19-round title battle.



Augusto Fernandez

/// 24th: 1’59.739 29 laps

Fernandez dedicated much of his time on track today to working on rear set-up tweaks with the aim of finding more grip on corner exit and stability under acceleration.

Fernandez collected plenty of important data to analyse ahead of this weekend’s opening race and in the third and final session he clocked a personal best pace of 1’59.739.

The close nature of the competition coming up in 2021 was highlighted on the final timesheets with Fernandez finishing 24th but the Spaniard only missed the top 10 by 0.5s.

“I am sure we can show our potential in the race”

“It’s been a hard day and a shame to finish the test like this. I wasn’t feeling good on the bike and I also had a crash in turn six so it was a difficult session. We worked a lot on the rear of the bike to understand more about what we need for the set-up next weekend. We had two positive days and that means I need to quickly forget what happened today. I’m not that far away in terms of the times and with all the positive things we have worked on this weekend I am sure we can show our potential in the race.”

Sam Lowes



/// 1st: 1’58.655 34 laps

Lowes has been a main protagonist throughout the entire Qatar test and once again tonight he was constantly challenging for the top three.

The 30-year-old powered his Kalex machine to a stunning time of 1’58.655 which came during a very impressive race simulation and not a soft tyre time attack.

That lap was only 0.5s away from the official All Time Lap Record set by Joe Roberts in Q2 last year and only Marco Bezzecchi and Remy Gardner lapped within 0.1s of the British star.

“We’ve done a great job all winter”

“Today was a very good day and it’s always nice to finish fastest. We worked a lot on the bike over the first two days to give me a good feeling and in the last session tonight we put our best package together and did a race simulation. I had a really good rhythm and to be honest I didn’t expect to be fastest because I didn’t do a time attack. I just did the race run and my best time came in that so I’m very happy. The team did a great job because the bike felt great at the time we will be racing at on Sunday particularly with used tyres. We’ve done a good job all winter and now I can look forward to this weekend expecting to have a lot of fun to start the season.”

Italtrans Racing Team completed three productive days of testing in Qatar

The 2021 MotoGP season will officially start in a few days with the Qatar Grand Prix scheduled next week in Doha.

An important event for Italtrans Racing Team with the reconfirmed Lorenzo Dalla Porta and the new entry Joe Roberts after the extraordinary success with the conquest of the Moto2 World Title together with Enea Bastianini at the end of a 2020 of intense and thrilling emotions.

After the test at Jerez de La Frontera the team completed today the Official Test at the Losail International Circuit. Three days of hard work with positive results.

Despite the problems with the tyres both riders showed good sensations on the long run and single lap: Dalla Porta is determined to confirm his growth in Moto2 and Roberts is even more confident with the team.



Lorenzo Dalla Porta – 19

“It wasn’t the test we expected. I was very slow and after the last session with the new tyres I thought I could improve but they didn’t work as we wanted. We’re looking beyond that because these are not the results we want and we can get”.



Joe Roberts – 16

“The three days were important more days of riding and working with the team. I’m happy with making the progress: we didn’t quite get the lap time we want missing the last lap to get some clean track had lot of riders in the way. But I’m really happy for the way we worked and what we’re doing I think in race time will be very great”.

Giovanni Sandi – Technical Director

“We had some problems with the tyres and so we cannot take note of these results. The positive side is that with a “failed” tyre the guys did a good job. The classification gives a result that does not belong to us: we will show our potential next week in the race”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVjb3dib3ljaGFubmVsLmNvbS9hdGhsZXRlLXByb2ZpbGUtd2lsbC1sb3dlLW9uLWhpcy1sb3ZlLW9mLXJpZGluZy1idWNraW5nLWhvcnNlcy1zdWNjZXNzLWxvbmdldml0eS1nb2Fscy1hbmQtbW9yZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Athlete Profile: Will Lowe on his Love of Riding Bucking Horses Success Longevity Goals and More,"“I feel like every time I nod my head that I’ve got a chance to win a rodeo” says 3X Bareback Riding World Champion Will Lowe.

At 38 years old Will Lowe has been riding bucking horses professionally for nearly two decades. He’s made the NFR 15 times three world titles and two average titles.

On the key to success as a bareback rider he says “You’ve gotta want it. You’ve gotta want to ride bucking horses. I’m sure it’s the same with like MMA fighters or UFC guys or any of them — you’ve got to want to step in the arena and take a beating. You know you’re going to take a beating when you get in there and so if you don’t want to take that beating you’re not going to do good. You know you’ve got to kind of crave a little bit of that fight.”

In 2020 Lowe started out his season with an unfortunate injury in Denver where after looking strong in the semi-finals he was knocked out in the finals — literally taking a kick to the head from the powerhouse Virgil that resulted in a depressed orbital bone and 20 stitches. But Lowe was back in saddle by May and moved his way up the standings to finish 28th in the World Standings.

He’s currently No. 13 in the 2021 PRCA World Standings and shows no sign of slowing down.

“I think what speaks as strongly as the three world championships is his longevity” says rodeo producer broadcaster and TCC general manager Jeff Medders. ""... doesn’t wrap his elbow you know looks like he just started rodeoing last year fresh as a daisy and he’s been in it for a while.”

“I’ve left everything on the table so I’m not worried about anything” Lowe says. “But now I just enter what I want to enter but my goal actually is to win every time. Every time you nod your head you’re going to win that’s my goal. ... I’ve accomplished enough that I really don’t feel like I have to prove anything to anybody. So I just go to have fun and enjoy it. And ride bucking horses.”

That was set to be Lowes' first running of the year as a previous test at Jerez in January was rained out and the Englishman was also forced to miss a subsequent test at Portimao earlier this month (reduced to a single day by bad weather).

Kawasaki arranged for Lowes to join Honda pair Alvaro Bautista and Leon Haslam for two days of running at Jerez on Friday and Saturday with Rea sitting out the test in order to preserve his limited allowance of test days.

Continuing where he left off last year with the 2021-spec ZX-10RR Lowes completed just under 120 laps at the Spanish circuit during the test.

""I was not sure how much I would be able to do with my shoulder but we did a lot of laps - 65 I think on the final day - and I was able to continue the work that we started with the new package in November"" Lowes commented.

""This was positive because we did not know if we could be on a good enough pace to start working - but we were. We literally picked up where we left off the pace was good and we found some positive steps with the bike. Also with my riding as I have been focusing in the winter to be smoother on the exit of the corners.

""It was a really positive test and we ticked all the boxes we had set out for these two days. A big thank you to Kawasaki KRT and all the team for putting this extra test on for me after missing two with the injury. I am really happy to get 2021 back underway.”

Lowes' crew chief Marcel Duinker added: “Alex had not ridden the bike for some time but he was impressive from the second or third lap during his first pit lane exit [on Friday]. He was straight up to speed.

""One of the targets of this test was to check his physical condition after his little accident. We soon understood that he was on 99 percent. The other priority was to check one item with the chassis on the bike over distance and this is now done.

""He was fast consistent and did not complain about any physical limitation. We are right on schedule - on target. We missed some tests but in the end it has not affected us at all.""

Lowes being in action for two days this week means he has now used six of his permitted 10 days of private testing having completed four days of running post-season last year.

He made a commitment to seeing more pitches early during the exhibition season even at the risk of looking passive. When he does swing he’s been willing to wait to start things even if it makes things appear a bit leisurely.

It seems like an idea that may be right on time.

A plethora of called third strikes has become a bunch of barreled baseballs as the Rangers head into the final week of spring training. Over the weekend he had three opposite field hits including a homer and a double and a walk. For the week he reached five times in 13 plate appearances.

It’s a giant difference from the start of camp that included a 2 for 21 stretch with 10 strikeouts. Seven of them were on called third strikes.

“It’s kind of tough looking sometimes but it’s my program” Lowe said Sunday before the Rangers’ 7-2 loss to Cleveland in which he did not appear. “It can be difficult as a teammate or a fan to see [somebody] watch all three strikes. But if you don’t have plate discipline you don’t have the ability to see the ball and then you can’t hit it. I had kind of worked on it here and there [previously] but it makes a whole lot of sense. It doesn’t really look pretty at all but the most important part is that you are getting ready for opening day.”

One of the primary reasons the Rangers acquired Lowe from Tampa Bay in a six-player deal in December was because of what they saw as a refined approach at the plate. They traded for him with the intent of making him the first baseman.

Lowe planned to impress his new club by taking the approach and kicking it up a notch. He took patience to such extremes early in camp that manager Chris Woodward talked to him just to make sure of his plan.

“I’ve been a little wishy-washy about it in the past” Lowe said. “It’s uncomfortable sometimes to go out there and take good pitches to hit. But if you can’t see them and you can’t commit to that then how are you going to commit to being on your A game for 150-160 games?”

It was a fine plan. But the Rangers were looking for an upgrade — their words back in December — over incumbent Ronald Guzman. Meanwhile Guzman who is out of minor league options came to camp with a simplified swing and a productive winter. He’s only built on that this spring. The two very different starts only served to raise some angst levels around the club’s spring training facilities.

But not Lowe’s.

“He does not get caught up in the moment” Woodward said. “When we talk about at-bats he’s really calm in explaining his thought process. He’s pretty heady. He knows the strike zone and he’s able to keep the ball in the big part of the field.”

Maybe that’s on purpose. Maybe not.

Said Lowe: “I would call it getting beat correctly. I start late sometimes. And if the barrel is late but the ball is hit correctly then I guess we’ll call it opposite field power. It’s a blessing and a curse. But to be able to have that back there to get beat a little bit and still get the ball in the air and driving it like that that’s just part of my game.”

The Rangers have a little more than a week to finalize the first base situation. What’s clear is they need more production than they have received the last three years the span of Guzman’s career. While his defensive work has been superb the Rangers have the MLB’s fourth-lowest first base OPS (.718) during that time.

Despite Lowe’s recent mini surge there are still a lot of questions to answer like who’s going to play against left-handers. Over their careers Guzman and Lowe both left-handed hitters have combined for a .187/.256/.333/.589 OPS against lefties in 250 plate appearances. Lowe Woodward said had a better track record against lefties in the minor leagues.

On Sunday they tried right-handed hitting Eli White a middle infielder-turned-outfielder at first. He went 0 for 4 with four strikeouts. Andy Ibañez another right-handed hitter whose poor defense doesn’t make him attractive anywhere else may get a start or two. It’s getting kind of late for this.

That seems to be right around the time Nate Lowe likes to arrive.

Lowes was making his first appearance on track in around four months as he missed out on track action when teammate Jonathan Rea tested at the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve as he recovered from a shoulder injury as well as poor weather preventing KRT from taking to the track at various tests throughout the off-season. Lowes recovered to return to the Spanish circuit as his testing programme go back underway ahead of the 2021 campaign with Lowes looking to build on his debut campaign with KRT using the new-for-2021 ZX-10RR.

Lowes completed around 120 laps across the two days of testing at Jerez as the British rider looked to confirm some new parts on the machine including changes to the engine chassis and aerodynamic package. Lowes who was taking to the track for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury in February said: “I am really happy to be back on the bike for these two afternoons with the team. I was not sure how much I would be able to do with my shoulder but we did a lot of laps - 65 I think on the final day - and I was able to continue the work that we started with the new package in November. This was positive because we did not know if we could be on a good enough pace to start working - but we were. We literally picked up where we left off the pace was good and we found some positive steps with the bike. Also with my riding as I have been focusing in the winter to be smoother on the exit of the corners. It was a really positive test and we ticked all the boxes we had set out for these two days. We are looking forward to the official test now in Montmelo.”

For Honda the two-day test was about gaining and confirming data as they look to refine the CBR1000 RR-R for the Japanese manufacturer’s second season as a full factory outfit after returning to the Championship in 2020. With Leon Camier taking the reigns as Team Manager at HRC for the new campaign Honda will be hoping to build on their return last year with the Jerez test a crucial aspect of this for both Bautista and Haslam although Haslam saved half-a-day of testing available to him by not using the full second day available to him.

Reviewing the test Bautista said: ""We have done a lot of work over the last two days taking advantage of two sunny days with no sign of any fog or rain which unfortunately prevented us from doing any real work on the bike back in January. It was important to complete the entire testing programme which concerned bike set-up in general and specifics such as braking and electronics areas in which we concentrated a little more. The session was very useful in providing the information that the engineers need to continue working on the bike back in Japan. I'm very happy with work we have done and I think we now have a clearer idea as to where to focus during the next test.”

Haslam added: “It’s been a very positive test especially because last time out we were only able to make about ten laps with the 2021 bike due to the bad weather. So having this day and a half has been very important. We had a long list of things to try and we’ve been able to get through almost all of it. We’ve found some more consistency and I’m feeling a lot more confident. Now we head to Barcelona with everyone else where we will be better able to understand where we are and how the bike is working. We only did a half day today as we need to be careful considering the limited test days we have available.”

The night before his team had lost by seven points at home to a middling Charlotte Hornets squad and the Bucks’ new coach Jason Kidd was angry. Milwaukee who were hovering around .500 were slated to have the holiday off to spend with family but Kidd changed those plans and decided his roster should practice – as punishment. The players had to cancel flights and alert their family of the change – something of course they did not want to do. During the Christmas Eve practice Sanders went full-on. He didn’t lollygag but peeved he also didn’t back away from engaging his coach in confrontation. Afterwards while he was the last one left in the locker room his body started to break down.

“I was cramping from my ears to my toes” Sanders tells the Guardian. “Full body cramps.”

It was the second time that this stress reaction had happened to him during his young career and it forced Sanders to quickly seek medical treatment. Sanders was hospitalized that Christmas Eve and Christmas. He never returned to the Bucks practice facility again despite having signed a four-year $44m contract extension the year before. “I physically and mentally could not get myself back there” he says. “Nothing could get me in the car to go there. I had such a block.” The 6ft 11in center who’d averaged nearly a double-double and almost three blocks per game a few seasons before was now the one stifled. “I didn’t touch a basketball for the next two years. Not a shot not a dribble.”

Sanders was born on 21 November 1988 in Fort Pierce Florida and grew up “in the trenches”. There were gangs seemingly on every street in his neighborhood. His parents split when he was a kid and both suffered from untreated mental health issues. “They had all this trauma” Sanders says “all this pain. They were predisposed to a lot of violence [while] not understanding the power of therapy the power of meditation.”

As a kid Sanders loved to draw. It was his “getaway.” He wanted to illustrate comics and work for Disney. He had a deep interest in the ocean too won a grant to study oceanography and got to ride in submarines. He was tall but didn’t have any particular interest in basketball. But it was a basketball that would save him.

“Because I lived in the projects” Sanders says “automatically where you live there are places you can’t go [due to gang conflicts].” He found that if he rode his bike from his home to his grandmother’s or cousin’s house while carrying a basketball he was left alone. Gangs even brutal ones tend to respect the kids who can use the game to get out of the neighborhood.

“I had a ball everywhere I went” he says. “It was my pass. Like ‘Oh he’s going to play basketball he’s just going to the court. If I didn’t have that ball I would’ve constantly been getting checked. I would probably have had to attach myself to a gang to protect myself. But I didn’t even play.”

It wasn’t until high school that he began to really take to the game. He was already 6ft 6in by the time he was in the 10th grade but he was raw: In his first game he scored on his own basket. But he started watching the pros more. His idol was Tracy McGrady who played for the nearby Orlando Magic. Sanders wore arm bands like him modeled his game after McGrady’s. He soon managed double-digit blocks. Later during his 11th and 12th grades his team was dominant in the region. And as a senior he started playing AAU traveling as far as Las Vegas for games. It was the people he met then that he bonded and later enrolled with at VCU.

Sanders’ college team was a force. During his three years there his squad won 75 games and only lost 27. After his junior year he decided to turn pro and he was selected by Milwaukee with the 15th overall pick. Had he stayed in college he would have played for the VCU team that made the Final Four under coach Shaka Smart. Still he was excited for the NBA. “You shoot a million jump shots and you want to get paid” he says. But in the end the NBA wasn’t what he’d hoped it would be. “It was a blessing but it was also a lot” he says. “I come from nothing and then you become the one that has everything. People who are supposed to guide you become your dependents. And you’re too young for that.”

Sanders lacked a support system in the league and his personal life. “You get fed to the sharks in a lot of ways” he says. “You can find yourself in a very vulnerable position … It can feel like a setup it can feel like a trap. I felt so alone. It was so hard to even express what I was going through. At the time in 2012 no one said they had anxiety or depression – maybe Delonte West but everyone was outcasting him.”

During his second year in the NBA Sanders smoked a joint for the first time passed to him by teammates. The drug helped like medicine. But league drug testing led to suspensions rehabs and ostracization. (Today the NBA doesn’t test for weed.)

“Do I gravitate to some pills and other drugs or do I do alcohol?” he wondered then about substances that wouldn’t be detected. Not only that but his need to be creative was no longer thriving. He felt stymied. “I was yearning for support yearning to be heard. But there was nothing in the manuscript for what I was going through at that time.” Sanders became one of the first players to talk about mental health – though now thanks to others such as DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love it’s a much more accepted topic. However when you’re the first to do something you’re often judged harshly for it. “There was no way I was the first one [to have mental health issues]” he says. “But I was the first one to speak up.”

Today Sanders is glad he did. Not just vocally but by publicly stepping away from the game. That choice led to conversations people are having now. “I have three sons that could be in the NBA one day” he says. “To have their mental health be respected – sometimes you got to be the one to step out on a cliff. But it’s worth it.” It wasn’t that he didn’t love the game it was that he didn’t have what he needed while participating in it. “My body and my mind are elite” he says. “But my surroundings and my environment just wasn’t.”

When he decided to walk he had two kids and he knew that if he wasn’t in the right state of mind he couldn’t ensure they would be either. Later he went to another rehab facility. This time it wasn’t one selected by the NBA for marijuana – though even in those he made close relationships with patients who were there for additions to heroin and other narcotics. This one was designed around therapy and emotional wellbeing. That was the last facility he’s been to since.

After two years away from the NBA Sanders sought a comeback. He worked out for a few teams and landed a contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016-17 alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. But he still had a rehab stint he’d have to undertake for the league if he was to stay on and the team at the time had its own internal turmoil he says. He lasted only a handful of games before he was waived. Leaving the NBA for good despite still being in his prime in his 20s brought a great deal of criticism. But Sanders doesn’t stress about those comments. His philosophy is that if someone isn’t going to be there at your funeral why care about what they say? “One minute you’re larger than life” he says. “And the next [in their eyes] you’re lower than dirt.”

Still at his peak Sanders who is a member of and continues to work with the NBA Retired Players Association was regarded my many as one of the best defensive players in the league. He was stopping his heroes in the paint players he’d idolized. “I was their nightmare” he says. “I was like ‘I can really play this game. This game is really meant for me!’”

It took a lot to walk away from that. But today though things aren’t always “perfect” Sanders maintains gratitude. He also retains his love of creativity: he has a production company and a publishing company. He’s writing a memoir kids’ books a movie script he runs camps produces music has a foundation and a cannabis line and he even spends summers playing in the Big3. Sanders also keeps relationships with players who deal with their own mental health issues.

“Why I go so hard” Sanders says “is because this has to be a success story. I got to show kids that I made the right choice. That there is a way – more for us to do. That we can be successful without succumbing. All the power’s in the present.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgxMzQxL3dlc2xleWFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1ub3QtY2FsbGluZy1wb2xpY2Utc3R1ZGVudC1nYXphLWVuY2FtcG1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why I'm Not Calling the Police on My Students' Encampment,"The encampment now grown to roughly 50 tents may be fostering a sense of community among protesters but it hasn’t been kumbaya for everyone. Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUva2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BlbmluZy1wcm9qZWN0aW9uLTEyMzU5MDc3NzUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtYm94LW9mZmljZS1vcGVuaW5nLXByb2plY3Rpb24tMTIzNTkwNzc3NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Looks To Evolve Summer With $130M+ Global Opening – Box Office Preview,"The first Planet of the Apes movie under the Disney regime after absorbing Fox hits theaters this weekend with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes poised to do $50M+ domestic and $130M WW.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels.

As reported by Law.com the May 3 ruling comes after the incubator began its legal action back in 2015.

The case filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware claims that patents for networking and broadcasting were used in Activision's multiplayer title.

The publisher owes Acceleration Bay $18 million in copyright infringement for World of Warcraft and $5.4 million for two Call of Duty titles.

Jurors were asked two questions to reach a verdict among them was ""Did Acceleration Bay prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Activision's products as identified below infringe one or more claims of the following asserted patents?""

In response to the question the jury was then asked after verdict to ""reasonably compensate Acceleration Bay for Activision's infringement of Acceleration Bay's asserted patents.""

While the case against Activision Blizzard has been decided in favor of the tech incubator it has also filed similar patent infringement suits against EA Take-Two and Amazon Web Services.

In response to the ruling Activision Blizzard said ""While we are disappointed we believe there is a strong basis for appeal. We have never used the patented technologies at issue in our games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbWFuLXdoby1yZWNlaXZlZC0xMjVtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtaHBkLWFycmVzdGVkLWd1bi1jcmltZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF3YWlpbmV3c25vdy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9tYW4td2hvLXJlY2VpdmVkLTEyNW0tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1ocGQtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZ3VuLWNyaW1lcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who received $12.5M settlement from HPD arrested for gun crimes,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 38-year-old man getting paid $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit with HPD has been arrested for gun crimes according to Honolulu police.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

SWP launches campaign 'Workers need their own voice' – The Militant,"LOUISVILLE Ky. — “Working people need a voice and a movement” Margaret Trowe told Rebekah Dow of WLKY-TV as she interviewed the Socialist Workers Party candidate for mayor at a press conference outside City Hall March 12.

“Like the 18 other SWP candidates across the country I will use my campaign vigorously to build solidarity with workers in struggle for unions against racism for women’s rights” said Trowe.

“We traveled to Bessemer Alabama last weekend to support the Amazon workers’ unionizing drive there” she said. “We joined others to build support for the Harlan County coal miners who set up camp on the railroad tracks in 2019 after Blackjewel Coal with the blessing of the bankruptcy court clawed the last paychecks from their accounts. The success of those miners in getting their money back was a victory for all working people. They showed what we can do when we stand together.”

Trowe’s campaign was covered in a feature article March 15 in the online edition of Louisville’s daily paper the Courier Journal headlined “Socialist Workers Party Candidate Enters 2022 Louisville Mayor’s Race.”

“As a teenager Trowe said she became active in the movement to defeat Jim Crow segregation” the article said “and now wants to see charges against officers involved in Breonna Taylor’s killing on March 13 2020.”

“A year has passed since Louisville police knocked down Breonna Taylor’s door in a midnight raid and killed her. No one has been charged for her death” Trowe said in her announcement. “I urge all working people to demand that all those responsible for her death be charged and prosecuted.”

“We need broad disciplined and sustained protests of unionists and other working people churches and students to win this fight” she told the Courier Journal.

The article was accompanied by a picture from the Militant showing the Socialist Workers Party candidate in Harlan County speaking with Chris Rowe a leader of the Blackjewel miners during the miners’ encampment on the train tracks.

“The parties of big business — the Democrats and Republicans — act in the interests of the billionaire families who rule the U.S. Workers and farmers need to break from these parties and organize in their own interests” Trowe said in the television interview. “In this way we will transform ourselves on the road to ending the dictatorship of capital and establishing a workers and farmers government.”

“Is that really possible?” Dow asked. “Yes it’s possible and necessary” Trowe said pointing to the example of the revolution made by workers and farmers in Cuba.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWlsaXRhbnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjAvcHVlcnRvLXJpY28tZmlnaHRlcnMtY2VsZWJyYXRlLWxpZmUtb2YtcmFmYWVsLWNhbmNlbC1taXJhbmRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Puerto Rico fighters celebrate life of Rafael Cancel Miranda – The Militant,"Several events were held in Puerto Rico from Feb. 28 to March 7 to honor the life of revolutionary leader and independence fighter Rafael Cancel Miranda who died March 2 last year.

They also marked the anniversary of the 1954 armed demonstration by Cancel Miranda and three other Puerto Rican independence fighters inside the U.S. Congress organized to focus international attention on the struggle to free Puerto Rico from U.S. colonial rule.

The weeklong program began with a public event at the Casa Aboy cultural center in San Juan. It featured a talk by María de los Ángeles Vázquez Cancel Miranda’s wife.

On March 1 1954 Cancel Miranda — then 23 — joined Lolita Lebrón Irvin Flores and Andrés Figueroa Cordero all Puerto Rican Nationalist Party members to unfurl a Puerto Rican flag inside the U.S. Capitol. They fired shots to draw attention to the brutal realities of U.S. colonial rule and the fact that Washington’s claim the island nation was “self-governing” was a lie. A few months earlier the U.S. government had rammed through a resolution in the U.N. removing Puerto Rico from its official list of colonies on the basis that it was now a “commonwealth.”

Our goal was “to tell the world that there were Puerto Ricans who were willing to die for our independence” Cancel Miranda told the Militantin a 1998 interview.

Vázquez noted that Cancel Miranda had joined the liberation struggle at an early age and was first arrested in 1948 — at age 18 — and sentenced to two years in prison for defying the U.S. draft. He was sent to the federal prison in Tallahassee Florida.

“To me it didn’t make sense to be in the same army that invades your country and massacres your people” Cancel Miranda told the Militant. “If you’re going to fight you should fight them.” While he was in prison the U.S. war on the Korean people began and the colonial regime in Puerto Rico crushed an October 1950 revolt inspired by Nationalist Party leader Pedro Albizu Campos.

After completing his sentence Cancel Miranda returned to Puerto Rico. But he was threatened with arrest again if he didn’t comply with the draft and he took refuge in Cuba. In March 1952 Fulgencio Batista staged a military coup and imposed a U.S.-backed dictatorship in Cuba. Cancel Miranda was deported to Puerto Rico. The FBI jailed him again this time at the notorious La Princesa prison in San Juan.

Vázquez told the audience a little-known story about the revolutionary fighter. To get him out of jail “and make it possible for him to carry out a future action” he and the Nationalist Party decided Cancel Miranda would give the impression he would comply with the draft. “Rafael was sent to Camp Buchanan [in San Juan]. There during his brief stay he took part in various incidents and he told me that he had stirred up the draftees with his Nationalist speeches.”

Worried Cancel Miranda’s anti-colonial propaganda would fall on receptive ears in the midst of the Korean War the military brass “declared him unfit for military service” Vázquez said with a smile.

Political work in New York

By December 1952 Cancel Miranda was living in New York City helping to organize the Nationalist Party in the Puerto Rican community. He worked two jobs one in a factory in Brooklyn and one in Manhattan working for two French brothers who owned Édouard Custom Shoes which made shoes for Broadway actors.

In the days after the 1954 armed protest in Congress the U.S. media attempted to paint the Nationalists as dangerous outlaws. But Vázquez said Mr. Édouard told the press “he didn’t know anything about Rafael’s political activity but Rafael was a very decent person and when he got out of jail if he wanted he could come back to work at the store.”

Cancel Miranda and his three comrades spent a quarter century in U.S. prisons. As a result of a growing international campaign on their behalf President James Carter finally released Figueroa Cordero in 1978 and Cancel Miranda Lebrón and Flores a year later along with another jailed Nationalist Oscar Collazo.

Cancel Miranda spent the next four decades speaking out and joining actions for the freedom of Puerto Rico in defense of Cuba’s socialist revolution and other struggles the world over.

The week of activity sponsored by Casa Albizu Foundation and Cancel Miranda’s family included the launching of the website sembrandopatria.com (Sowing the seeds of the homeland) to make accessible his writings books and lifelong political record. Included on the site are 294 pages from the independence fighter’s extensive police files going back to when he was 16 — a record he always wore as a badge of pride.

One of the events featured a talk by prominent independence advocate Eduardo Villanueva on the political background to the 1954 events.

In the western city of Mayagüez where Cancel Miranda is buried a graveside ceremony and memorial Mass were held in his honor.

One of the solidarity messages to the events’ sponsors was sent by the Socialist Workers Party. It quoted from a letter sent last year to Vázquez and her family by Jack Barnes national secretary of the SWP: “We honor the life of comrade Rafael Cancel Miranda by continuing to educate working people as well as the youth who join them in battle about the road of revolutionary class struggle the only road to a free Puerto Rico and a socialist world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWlsaXRhbnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjAvMTk2NS1zZWxtYS1tb250Z29tZXJ5LW1vYmlsaXphdGlvbnMtd29uLXZvdGluZy1yaWdodHMtdmljdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1965 Selma-Montgomery mobilizations won voting rights victory – The Militant,"This month marks the 56th anniversary of the historic voting rights march from Selma Alabama to the state’s capital Montgomery. Together with the 1956 Montgomery bus boycott and 1963 Battle of Birmingham these actions were high points in the proletarian-led civil rights struggle that overturned Jim Crow segregation.

This victory changed the course of U.S. history strengthening the fighting capacities of the working class that nothing short of a counterrevolution could reverse. There is less racism today among working people than ever before.

The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee had been organizing efforts to win the vote for Blacks in Selma and surrounding Dallas County. Blacks made up the majority of the population but only 2% were registered. By early February 1965 over 3400 demonstrators demanding the right to vote were jailed. On Feb. 18 state troopers attacked SNCC-led activists in Marion shooting and killing protester Jimmie Lee Jackson.

In the midst of this Malcolm X visited Alabama to meet with young civil rights fighters. After addressing 3000 students Feb. 3 at Tuskegee Institute a university in Tuskegee members of SNCC invited him to nearby Selma the next day.

Addressing 300 youths at Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church Feb. 4 Malcolm offered his assistance to SNCC. He put the fight for Black rights in a world context saying “I pray that you will grow intellectually so that you can understand the problems of the world and where you fit into in that world picture.” He said a Klan segregationist hiding behind white sheets “is nothing but a coward” and “the time will come when that sheet will be ripped off. If the federal government doesn’t take it off we’ll take it off.”

SNCC and Martin Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference decided to organize a march from Selma to the state Capitol in Montgomery to demand arch-segregationist Gov. George Wallace protect Blacks registering to vote. Wallace ordered state troopers “to use whatever measures are necessary to prevent a march.”

When the protesters set out March 7 they were ruthlessly attacked by the troopers and sheriff’s deputies who used clubs tear gas whips and rubber tubing wrapped with barbed wire to assault the protesters.

That night ABC-TV was airing “Judgment at Nuremberg” a movie about the Nazi regime’s responsibility for the brutality of the storm troops in fascist Germany and the Holocaust. Nearly 50 million people were watching. The station interrupted the broadcast to show filming of the racist brutality in Selma.

There was an immediate reaction. Protests in solidarity with the voting-rights marchers took place across the country. SNCC and SCLC called for volunteers to come to Selma and Montgomery to fight for the right to march on the capital.

On March 15 President Lyndon Baines Johnson spoke before Congress saying he was going to submit a voting rights bill. A federal court ruled the march could take place. Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard and ordered it to protect the participants. The march swelling to over 25000 reached Montgomery March 25. The Voting Rights Act was signed on Aug. 6.

An inspiring example

The mobilizations in Selma and Montgomery “were an inspiring example of the determination and willingness to fight by Blacks there and volunteers like myself responded to the call to join them” Militant editor John Studer said in an interview. At the time Studer was an 18-year-old student at Antioch College in Ohio and a member of the Antioch Committee for Racial Equality. Studer and others from the school and the nearby historically Black college of Wilberforce jumped in their cars and drove down.

“When we got to Montgomery we joined in the daily protests and in big church meetings each night where what to do next was debated” Studer remembers. “A sheriff’s posse on horseback went after us with clubs on one of the marches but we were able to retreat into the Black community which they didn’t have the nerve to go into.”

On March 15 when Johnson gave his speech announcing support for passage of voting rights legislation “I watched it on TV with dozens of others crammed into a house in the Black community in Montgomery” said Studer. “We laughed when Johnson felt the pressure to use the slogan of the civil rights movement at the end saying ‘We shall overcome’ in his sharp Southern drawl.

“But everyone knew that coming from a Texas segregationist political figure it showed how powerful the mass mobilization led by Black working people was and the impact it was having throughout the country.”

Covering these developments at the time the Militant called for sending federal troops to Alabama to protect Blacks’ constitutional rights for the arrest and removal from office of local officials who sanctioned the bloody assaults and for the federal government to arm and deputize Black citizens there to defend themselves.

On March 21 court orders allowed protesters to begin their four-day 54-mile Selma to Montgomery march.

Nearly 50000 supporters — Black and Caucasian — rallied in front of the state Capitol in Montgomery when the marchers arrived.

In response to these mass mobilizations which included support actions in many other cities and towns nationwide Congress passed the Voting Rights Act a milestone on the road to the defeat of Jim Crow segregation.

Montgomery bus boycott

Nine years earlier the Montgomery bus boycott helped launch the modern civil rights movement. “Court Battle Reveals Turbulent Movement That Is Shaking South” headlined an article by Farrell Dobbs writing from Montgomery in the April 2 1956 Militant. Dobbs was the Socialist Workers Party candidate for president in 1956 and a leader of the fight by Teamsters in the 1930s to organize a union in Minneapolis and over-the-road truck drivers throughout the Midwest.

The SWP campaigned for workers and their unions to donate station wagons so workers could get to work while boycotting the Montgomery bus system. Dobbs drove one of the first ones down. “I have seen nothing like the rank and file outpouring of grievances here since my days in the rising union movement of the Thirties” Dobbs wrote. “Now as then a deep well of resentment has been tapped. A burning desire to seek redress has arisen. A growing determination to get action has taken hold.”

Dobbs further notes “If the Negro people are to win their democratic rights if the firm alliance of the unions and the Negro movement so imperative for the unionization of the South is to be forged then the freedom fighters of Montgomery must be supported to the hilt and all the way to their final victory.”

“We saw the same inspiring power there in 1965” Studer said. “These powerful class battles coupled with Blacks getting into industry and fighting for equal rights there decisively strengthened the fighting capacity of the working class in the U.S.”",,,,,,

The company which does business as Urb-E was founded in 2013 by Peter Lee and Sven Etzelsberger and manufactures electric bikes and scooters. It’s known to some Angelenos for a line of collapsible scooters introduced on the USC campus in 2018 but the company announced March 3 that it had raised $5 million to build out electric bicycle-based delivery networks.



Urb-E has already begun operating one of these networks in New York and Chief Executive Charles Jolley said the company plans to start facilitating deliveries in the Los Angeles area this year.



Jolley is a serial entrepreneur and formerly led Facebook Inc.’s Android division. He became an investor in Urb-E in 2019 when the company began to focus on deliveries. Jolley took over as CEO last year.



He said the complicated logistical demands of ecommerce businesses require more nimble solutions for last-mile deliveries.



“We’re replacing trucks and vans with electric vehicles engineered for every neighborhood” he said.



The company’s electric bicycles are hitched to small trailers that carry foldable storage containers that can be wheeled on and off to facilitate a simpler loading and unloading process.

Jolley said most of the funds the company has raised so far will go toward building out its first few delivery networks.

“The idea is to eventually have enough units out there that if people need to get one for a day or a single delivery they can” he said.

Urb-E isn’t the only company developing new technology to facilitate ecommerce deliveries but Jolley said one advantage the company has is that it designs and manufactures its fleet of bicycles in-house then manages rentals using proprietary software.

The company’s control over each aspect of its business model gives it the ability to scale at its own pace Jolley said.

“Structurally if we’re really going to move the needle and make this a product that can be deployed quickly a way to do that is to be vertically integrated to the point where we own the whole fleet” Jolley said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Marriott Los Cabos Resort says they charge guests using points a $30 redemption fee. This fee or loyalty tax applies only to free night awards and is not billed to guests paying cash.

All Marriott Bonvoy redemption nights are subject to a service charge of USD 30 per night.

Marriott bills members for hotel resort fees when using free night stays. That’s something that neither Hilton nor Hyatt do. But this is not a resort fee. The hotel doesn’t have one. Here’s the expense breakdown for a paid night at this hotel. No resort fee is listed.

What’s more the hotel doesn’t even disclose the $30 penalty for Bonvoy redemptions in the rate details for the stay.

Is this the most Marriott Bonvoy thing ever?

Prior to acquiring Starwood Marriott Rewards wasn’t an especially rich program for elite benefits – but they were known for consistency. Now the biggest problem with Bonvoy I think is hotel compliance with the loyalty program. Each hotel seems to do whatever it wants largely with impunity.

Since this particular tactic doesn’t seem to be consistent with program rules I imagine it will get fixed. Hotels can pass through resort fees to award guests (what a horrible practice not engaged in by competitors) but cannot charge such a fee only to those redeeming points. But that so many hotels seem to make up their own rules as they go and imagine they can do so at least until called out publicly is the very biggest problem faced by Bonvoy I think.

Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) ascent to record highs came to a halt on Sunday as the cryptocurrency's price fell more than 6% to $56306 (£40596). It made several attempts to soar past the all-time high price peaking at $59400 on Saturday.

It comes after the cryptocurrency climbed more than 5% last week to a high of $60322.60 according to Coindesk continuing a stellar rally this year. The move passed the previous all-time record of around $58330 set on 21 February.

So far Bitcoin has surged more than 65% last month alone and over 100% this year.

In late February it saw a retreat to as low as $43000 amid uncertainty in the traditional markets over stimulus expectations and their positive effects on US bond yields.

Bitcoin started 2020 at around $7000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.

However a survey published last month showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021.

According to a Trading Platforms report the number of Bitcoin ATMs around the world increased by 70% in the last six months hitting 16500 in March.

MANILA Philippines — Contactless payment methods are now widely recognized by Filipino consumers even though cash remains the main payment mode in the country according to a report by Mastercard Philippines.

Rowell Del Fierro country manager of Mastercard Philippines said the global technology company is committed to drive contactless solutions and digital payment usage among Filipino consumers and businesses.

This is in support of the thrust of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to promote the digitalization of payments in the country and to convert 50 percent of the total volume of retail payments into digital form by 2023.

According to the report more than 70 percent of those with contactless cards used their contactless card in-store over the past year with 40 percent making a contactless payment purchase at least once a week.

Additionally 40 percent of those who did not use contactless card payments in the past year cited security concerns as their reason for not using the payment method more often.

The result of the study showed that hacking and wireless skimming were the top security concerns for 86 percent and 82 percent of consumers respectively.

A key highlight in the study is the important roles that different stakeholders play in helping consumers to adopt this new payment technology as 21 percent of cardholders first learned to use their contactless cards through self-discovery.

Add in Mexico's 3-0 win over Costa Rica later on Sunday and head coach Jason Kreis' team booked a semifinal spot while chasing one of the region’s two berths in the upcoming Tokyo Summer Olympics.





Following a frustrating first hour at the Mexico-based Estadio Akron the US broke the scoreless deadlock in the 60th minute through captain Jackson Yueill. The San Jose Earthquakes midfielder made a run into the six-yard box and redirected home a low cross from winger Sebastian Saucedo giving the US a 1-0 lead.





The US got some breathing room in the 73rd minute as Minnesota United midfielder Hassani Dotson picked out the bottom corner for a 2-0 advantage. CF Montréal midfielder Djordje Mihailovic found Dotson after a powerful run on the left leading to a strong combination from the second-half substitutes.





Dotson scored his second goal in the 78th minute giving the US a comfortable 3-0 lead after again combining with Mihailovic. The 23-year-old collected a pass on the right-hand side of the penalty area and finished past goalkeeper Johan Guzman.





After twice playing provider Mihailovic found his goal in the 90th minute thanks to some industrious work from Orlando City SC winger Benji Michel on the right flank. Michel blew past several defenders and then crossed for Mihailovic at the back post sealing the 4-0 victory.





Kreis made six changes to the US starting XI that beat Costa Rica 1-0 to start the tournament rotating his 20-man roster to maintain freshness. As the Dominican Republic tired combined with Kreis’ own substitutes the US discovered their second-half scoring outburst.

OK it’s unusual but surely it’s not worthy of marking the anniversary? After all Sergio Agüero’s done it three times in the last seven years alone.

Well yes and no. The thing about Nicholl’s achievement was that the match was a 2-2 draw.

“If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two impostors just the same;

You’re probably an Aston Villa centre back playing against Leicester City” as Rudyard Kipling might have written.

There’s no denying it: football is a strange game. I once saw QPR beat Liverpool. That’s it. That’s the whole story. But it’s still bloody weird. Taking Nicholl’s extraordinary achievement as our starting point here is a look at the five strangest football matches of all time.

Leicester City vs Aston Villa 1976

Chris Nicholl was a very good centre back. You don’t get to play 648 league games (most of them in the top flight) or win 51 international caps for Northern Ireland if you’re bad. He captained Aston Villa to League Cup triumph in 1977 winning the final on the second replay a match in which he netted a 30-yard howitzer to take the game to extra time. But nothing matched his performance on 20 March 1976 with Villa playing Leicester City at Filbert Street. After 15 minutes Nicholl always a combative presence in defence forced his way on to the end of Brian Alderson’s chip and nodded past his own keeper John Burridge.

Five minutes before halftime Nicholl netted again this time at the right end getting on the end of a Brian Little header to hook the ball home from close range. Eight minutes into the second half the Chris Nicholl show began to reach farcical proportions as he latched onto a Frank Worthington cross with an acrobatic diving header into his own net. He has since described it as the finest goal of his career – it was just unfortunate that it was against his own team. (Worthington apropos of nothing was a famous lothario and wrote an autobiography called One Hump Or Two?)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbGVuY2lhY2YuY29tL2VuLW1hdGNoLXByZXZpZXctY2QtYWxjb3lhbm8tdnMtdmNmLW1lc3RhbGxhLTIwMjEtMDMtMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Match Preview: CD Alcoyano vs VCF Mestalla,"VCF Mestalla will visit CD Alcoyano on Sunday 21st of March at El Coyao at 12 pm kick-off time for the final fixture of the first group stage of the season on matchday 18 in group III-B of Segunda B.

Event History

While match play tournaments have a lengthy history on the PGA Tour – even outside of the Ryder and Presidents Cups the WGC-Dell Match Play is currently the only regular match play event on Tour.

Debuting in 1999 the same year the World Golf Championships series started the inaugural event was won by Jeff Maggert a 6 seed in his pool who impressively knocked off the gauntlet of Fred Funk Nick Price Bernhard Langer Tiger Woods and Steve Pate – before outdueling Andrew Magee in a marathon finale that required 38 holes (the 36-hole final plus two sudden-death holes) to complete.

In its 19 previous editions the tournament has produced one three-time champion (Tiger Woods) and a pair of two-time winners (Geoff Ogilvy Jason Day). Tiger had perhaps the most impressive victory in tournament history when he obliterated Stewart Cink 8&7 in the 2008 Finals.

From 1999-2014 the tournament was a strict straightforward single-elimination bracket with four regions composed of players seeded 1-16. In 2015 the event was reformatted and now contains 16 pools of round-robin before the 16 pool winners are reseeded by world rankings and go head to head in a single-elimination bracket.

Defending Champion

One year removed from getting absolutely obliterated by Bubba Watson in the championship match of the 2018 WGC – Dell Technologies Match Play Kevin Kisner mowed down a gauntlet of PGA Tour elites on his way back to the championship match but this time the resilient 35-year-old defeated two-time 2019 PGA Tour winner and former Match Play Champion Matt Kuchar by a 3&2 score.

Kisner’s day which ended with his third career PGA Tour victory began in impressive fashion when he shockingly defeated the red-hot reigning Open Champion Francesco Molinari in the semi-finals 1-up.

Kuchar joined Kisner in the championship match by nipping breakout star Lucas Bjerregaard the Dane who upset Tiger Woods in the quarterfinal 1-up in the other semi-final match.

Kisner started the week with a blip losing his first match in group play 2-up to Ian Poulter – one of the best match-play golfers of all-time. But then went 6-0 the rest of the week to claim his first WGC title.

On his way he knocked off Tony Finau and Keith Mitchell to finish group play got the better of Poulter in a sudden-death tiebreaker to advance to the Final 16 bracket where he dominated Haotong Li before knocking off Louis Oosthuizen in the quarterfinals.

Then came the semi-final victory over Molinari and the championship triumph over Kuchar.

“I was thinking out there it might be the hardest one just because you have the physical aspect more than any other week” Kisner told the Golf Channel immediately following his victory.

“It was grueling definitely with the winds the temperature today. Overall it was a long week but I prevailed… and World Golf champion.”

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. More challenges lie ahead in 2024.

The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep.

On Wednesday Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — alongside other Democratic House and Senate members — said they re-introduced the ""Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act.""

The legislation applies to businesses with more than $100 million in annual revenue and targets larger corporations where CEOs earn at least 50 times more than their median worker. The tax is determined by the size of the pay gap between them gradually increasing as the disparity worsens.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

If the CEO makes between 50 and 100 times more than the median worker corporate taxes increase by 0.5%. For those CEOS paid between 100 times and up to 200 times more than the median worker taxes would increase by 1% with a 1% increase for every order of 100. The highest increase would be 5% for companies where CEOs earn over 500 times their typical worker.

A 2020 report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI) looked at how CEO compensation has grown in contrast to workers' wages. Focusing on ""realized"" compensation for CEOs — which ""counts stock awards when vested and stock options when cashed in rather than when granted"" — EPI found that in 2019 the ratio between CEO pay and the typical worker's pay was 320-to-1.

And from 1978 to 2019 CEO pay grew by 1167%; meanwhile it grew by 13.7% for the typical worker.

Some big-name companies would owe millions extra under the legislation

Several widely-known companies would find their taxes hiked. In a press release for the bill several notable ones are highlighted.

If the legislation had been in effect last year some companies would have paid hundreds of millions more in taxes according to the press release: Walmart would have owed $854.9 million more; for Home Depot and JPMorganChase the additional taxes come to $550.8 million and $172.8 million. Nike would have paid an extra $147.7 million.

Meanwhile McDonald's would have forked over an extra $69.5 million and American Airlines an extra $22.6 million.

Notably Nike CEO John Donahoe was promoted to the new position in January 2020 and the company awarded him a much larger compensation package than his predecessor's 2019 pay (shown in the chart below) as part of the move. McDonald's also got a new CEO in 2019 and they calculated their pay ratio using a combination of the pay packages for incoming CEO Chris Kempczinski and departing CEO Steve Easterbrook.

Some conservative economists argue the tax would hit certain sectors harder such as fast-food and retail because of the low-wages commonly paid in those industries.

The legislation comes as Biden looks into potential tax increases

President Joe Biden has reportedly been eyeing some tax increases as he considers measures to fund a new infrastructure package. Democrats are moving to spend trillions on transportation roads bridges and waterways.

One thing he's doubled down on is a tax increase for higher-earning Americans. As Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig reported Biden has said that Americans earning over $400000 will see a tax increase of up to 39%.

Another increase he's been mulling over is the corporate tax rate. Part of his economic campaign plan included raising that rate from 21% to 28%. If Sanders and other progressives get their way the rate could increase for companies with larger CEO-to-worker pay ratios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy41bmV3c29ubGluZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL29uZS1tYW4tZGVhZC1hZnRlci1zaG9vdGluZy1pbi1jbGFya3N2aWxsZS81MjctYjM3ZmM2MmMtZGQ5MC00OTZmLWEzZTgtZmVhOTFmZTRkOTNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victim suspect identified in fatal Clarksville McDonald's drive-thru shooting,"22-year-old Raymond Knight of Fort Smith was pronounced dead at the scene after a single gunshot wound.

CLARKSVILLE Ark. — Clarksville Police responded to a call about a shooting at a McDonald's drive-thru on 1232 South Rogers Street Friday (March 19) night.

Upon arrival police found a male driver who had suffered a single fatal gunshot wound. The victim who has since been identified as 22-year-old Raymond Knight of Fort Smith was pronounced dead at the scene.

After investigating police found that the suspect 20-year-old Admad Rashad Robinson of Fort Smith was the rear passenger of the vehicle and that he had fled the scene. He is now in custody.

Robinson had a Bond Hearing on March 21 on the charge of First-Degree Murder. His bond was set at $250000.

And while public opinion on the new items seemed to be split with some loving them and others saying this is another unsuccessful chicken sandwich attempt for the burger giant McDonald's seemed to have benefited from all the hype nevertheless.

On the day of the launch McDonald's saw an impressive 19% jump in foot traffic when data from multiple locations was averaged together according to Yahoo! Finance. In the subsequent days interest remained heightened at McDonald's restaurants with in-store visits reportedly up by 29% the day after the new menu items launched and remaining up by an average of 16% for the remainder of the week.

McDonald's renewed popularity came at a time when the chain had seen a nearly 30% drop in year-over-year business the week prior to the sandwich unveiling.

Yahoo! Finance analyst Alexandra Canal suggested the pre-chicken sandwich slump in sales was a product of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as bitterly cold weather conspiring to keep customers home. However the chicken sandwiches proved successful enough not only to significantly increase restaurant visits but even leading to a more favorable evaluation of the McDonald's stock by Deutsche Bank.

McDonald's sales are expected to keep recovering thanks to the stimulus checks boost and the new sandwiches according to a poll among its franchisees who have reported great momentum in the first quarter. However whether or not McDonald's manages to beat out its Chicken Sandwich Wars competition in the long run is yet to be seen.

How Does It Rank All-Time?,"After two years without any high-school showcase game to celebrate we’ll back at it this spring/summer. And you better believe it because COVID or not everything has already been set in motion with the announcement of the McDonald’s All-American Game rosters involving the class of 2021 studs. Whether we will have a game or not it’s yet to be known but odds are we are (the NBA is on the G League just wrapped its season and we’re talking about a single game here) this one takes place later down the road.

As it is often the case the two named squads are loaded and packed full of talent and the 24 players chosen to build them can’t get much better. Or can they? I was curious to see where the 2021 class ranks in the all-time MCDAAG history of rosters judging by scouting services and prospect rankings so that’s what I tried to shed a little bit of light on.

Before jumping to that though let’s review the 24-man roster ahead of the game presenting the players named to it their rank in the 2021 class (per 247Sports Composite) and the positions they’re tagged with judging by their HS game.

Presenting the 2021 MCDAAG’s 24-man roster

No game last year no highlights uploaded to YouTube no fun had. Jeez this COVID thing... Anyways look at the bright side of the story: we’re about to enter the showcase-circuit after a two-year hiatus so we’re all super excited about what the upcoming MCDAAG will bring to our streaming devices and televisions.

Without further ado here are your 2021 MCAADG’s participants as currently ranked on 247Sports Composite:

2021 MCDAAG’s Roster Rk Name High School Pos Rk Name High School Pos 1 Chet Holmgren Minnehaha Academy (Minneapolis MN) C 2 Jaden Hardy Coronado (Henderson NV) CG 3 Paolo Banchero O Dea (Seattle WA) PF 4 Patrick Baldwin Jr. Hamilton (Sussex WI) SF 5 Jabari Smith Sandy Creek (Tyrone GA) PF 6 Hunter Sallis Millard North (Omaha NE) CG 7 AJ Griffin Archbishop Stepinac (White Plains NY) SF 8 Caleb Houstan Montverde Academy (Montverde FL) PF 9 JD Davison Calhoun Sch (Letohatchee AL) PG 10 Peyton Watson Long Beach Poly (Long Beach CA) SF 11 Daimion Collins Atlanta (Atlanta TX) PF 12 Harrison Ingram St. Mark's (Dallas TX) SF 13 Kennedy Chandler Sunrise Christian (Wichita KS) PG 14 Michael Foster Hillcrest Prep (Phoenix AZ) PF 15 Kendall Brown Sunrise Christian (Wichita KS) SF 16 Nathan Bittle Prolific Prep (Napa CA) C 17 Max Christie Rolling Meadows (Rolling Meadows IL) SG 18 Moussa Diabate IMG Academy (Bradenton FL) PF 19 Aminu Mohammed Greenwood Laboratory School (Washington DC) SG 20 Trevor Keels Paul VI Catholic (Fairfax VA) SG 31 Nolan Hickman Wasatch Academy (Mount Pleasant UT) PG 42 Kobe Bufkin Grand Rapids Christian (Grand Rapids MI) CG 47 Daeshun Ruffin Callaway (Jackson MS) PG 67 Jackson Grant Olympia (Olympia WA) C

Now that’s a loaded field of names. As a quick rundown of things we have:

Every player ranked first through 20th in the 2021 HS class. That’s is simply put insane. Compared to last year “only” the 1st-through-17th (at the moment of the announcement) kids made the list. Now you get why I needed to look at the history of the game with such a packed roster being selected this year

in the 2021 HS class. That’s is simply put insane. Compared to last year “only” the 1st-through-17th (at the moment of the announcement) kids made the list. Now you get why I needed to look at the history of the game with such a packed roster being selected this year The no. 31 prospect on the board and future Kentucky Wildcat Nolan Hickman.

on the board and future Kentucky Wildcat Nolan Hickman. Two 40-to-50 ranked kids in no. 42 Kobe Bufkin (Michigan commit) and no. 47 Daeshun Ruffin (Ole Miss).

in no. 42 Kobe Bufkin (Michigan commit) and no. 47 Daeshun Ruffin (Ole Miss). Only one player outside of the top-50 Washington’s commit and no. 67 Jackson Grant.

Just in case you weren’t convinced to tune in come April I guess all of that makes for a strong case to get you glued to the TV by the time these guys get to ball together.

How does the 2021 class rank among all-time MCDAAG rosters?

With all top-20 players at the time of the announcement making the list I was definitely curious to see where the full class would rank among all-time MCDAAG rosters. The truth is that even after achieving that excellent mark the 2021 class falls surprisingly short of what other past squads have accomplished. Seriously. For the purposes of this article I have looked at the 24 senior HS classes from 1999 to 2021 as those are the ones I have prospect ranks of.

The simplest way to check how good or bad a class was historically is to run a set of simple mathematical operations. Just add the ranks of all selected players and the lowest mark would be the best class among them right? There are the results if using that method.

Best Classes Judging by Combined-Overall Rk

As you can see this year’s class is pretty much average or middle-of-the-pack when it comes to the addition of all selected prospects’ rankings. That makes sense mostly because although it contains all top-20 players (thus the lowest possible score for the 20-first picked players (210 points) it also has two players outside of the top-40 and another one outside of the top-60. That hurts it. A lot.

Compared to 1999 the no. 1 class by this metric the difference is absolutely insane. But that comes with a small quirk: in my dataset there are only 21 players in the 1999 ranks that got picked to the game thus lowering the overall score.

The actual lowest/best class would be that of 2004 as it contained all-expected 24 players in it. In fact the 23 first players among those selected ranked precisely in that order by year’s end with only no. 30 Arron Afflalo breaking the trend. And let’s be honest judging by Aarron Afflalo’s yet-to-come pro-career it is not that his addition was precisely a bad one...

Best Classes Judging by Average Rk

While using the average rank of all selected prospects softens the lead of the 1999 class a bit it stills retains that asterisk-marked distinction. The same goes for the 2004 and 2001 classes although it is interesting to highlight the drop that the 2003 class suffers using this method.

Back in 2003 there were 23 players picked (this is the data that my dataset contains again). Of those 23 13 were ranked at the top of the list followed by the 15 17-to-19 prospects 21 22 26 28 34 and 44. That’s a great low addition of ranks overall. No player ranked outside of the top-45 and only one dropped below the no. 35. The problem is that on average four of those kids fell off the top-24 ranked players dropping the average of the group.

Best Classes Judging by Lowest Rk-Deviation

This is by far the metric that hurts our 2021 class the most. Boiling it down to the simplest of explanations what that high deviation mark means is that this year’s class is top-heavy in that it includes all top-20 prospects but then things fall off a cliff with the inclusion of four players outside of the top-30 list including two outside of the top-45 and no less than the no. 67 (!!!) at the time of the announcement.

There have been only three players in the MCDAAG since 1999 who carried a lower rank than no. 67 Jackson Grant: Luke Ridnour (no. 68) Elliot Williams (no. 77) and Demond Carter (no.78). If the McDonald’s AAG is about elite talent then the 2021 class wouldn’t even make the top-10 as far as that goes. Having a player outside of the top-50 ranks has only happened in 8 editions and the classes of 2000 ‘05 ‘06 and ‘11 boasted a couple each.

In fact no player ranked outside of the top-50 had been picked since 2013 when Kennedy Meeks made the roster as the no. 58 prospect in the nation. Yikes.

Best Classes Judging by Best 247 Composite Average Rk. Score

Finally and although there is no data in 247Sports Composite ranks prior to the class of 2003 I wanted to look at the average rank score of the selected prospects for each year. If you know how 247Sports Composite ranks work you know about this already; if not the closer to 1.0 a player’s score is the most-consensus the opinion is on how high he is ranked among the different scouting services that provide rank-data to the composite rank.

Looking at the rosters from this angle there was no class as consensus-highly ranked as the 2006 one and its prospects. That might have caught you by surprise. That class had two players outside of the top-51 but it also had two of the most-coveted prospects to ever come out of HS and two surefire pros (judging by their HS/college careers at the time of the NBA draft). Those two: Greg Oden the consensus no. 1 prospect as ranked by every scouting service back then and Kevin Durant who was widely considered the second-best kid to play senior HS ball that year.

On top of that the scouting businesses out there were very high on Brandan Wright Spencer Hawes Thaddeus Youn Chase Budinger and Ty Lawson. But looking at the actual addition of ranks things look a little bit different...

Best Classes Judging by Best 247 Composite Combined Rk. Scores

This is definitely closer to reality am I right? The 2017 2019 and 2004 classes rank at the top of the leaderboard. There was a clear-cut no. 1 prospect in 2004 Dwight Howard who made the jump straight to the pros that very year and became a no. 1 draft pick by the Orlando Magic.

After that there is a tie between the 2017 and 2019 classes: the two of them had a consensus no. 1 player (Marvin Bagley and James Wiseman) but they also had a ton of similarly-ranked kids below them in the likes of Michael Porter Mo Bamba and Deandre Ayton back in 2017; and Anthony Edwards Isaiah Stewart and Cole Anthony in 2019.

While the 2021 class also has no-brainer no. 1 in Chet Holmgren only two players are widely considered part of the top-3 (Jaden Hardy and Paolo Banchero) while things get a little bit more random and muddy going down the board. That’s why at the end of the day and looking at different MCDAAG rosters and squads from the past the most probable case for the 2021 class of HS seniors is one of an average crop of players that are far from the greatest of them all but that also rank higher than half of the squads that made the game in the past 23 years at least from a recruiting/HS point of view.

There is a lot—heck everything—yet to be written about all of those kids’ pro-careers and surprises are always waiting to pop down the ranks so this doesn’t mean that the 2021 class won’t produce some highly productive players that would thrive at the brightest of stages in 10 to 15 years. And that’s precisely the best part of this: we think we know a lot but we still don’t know anything about what lies ahead."

Sasso offers an interesting question about whether there is actually some middle ground of patent-related cases subject to dual Federal and State jurisdiction.

by Dennis Crouch

There are two different statutes regarding Federal Court exclusive jurisdiction over patent cases. One giving US district courts exclusive original jurisdiction over US patent cases and the second giving the Federal Circuit exclusive appellate jurisdiction over appeals in patent cases. 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) provides Federal district courts with “original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.” The provision goes on to make clear state courts do not have jurisdiction: “No State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.” Id. The second provision relates to appellate courts: The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction over final decisions from US district courts “in any civil action arising under . . . any Act of Congress relating to patents” or where a “compulsory counterclaim” has been asserted “arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.” 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a).

Lots of work over the years has gone into determining whether a particular cause of action meets the arising under requirement of these provisions. See for example Gunn v. Minton 568 U.S. 251 (2013) (patent litigation attorney malpractice lawsuit does not arise under the Patent Act). You’ll note here that the term “arising under” comes from the U.S. Constitution:

The judicial power [of US Courts] shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this Constitution the laws of the United States …

U.S. Const. Art. III Section 2. The Supreme Court has repeatedly found this clause to also limit jurisdiction — cases that do fit one of the enumerated frames cannot be heard by US Courts. An example is a breach of contract dispute between two parties from the same U.S. state. That case will typically arise under state law and thus not be the subject of a Federal lawsuit — barred by the US Constitution. Some contract cases to wind their way into federal courts — typically under a principle of citizenship diversity or supplemental jurisdiction.

The US Constitution link is important. The statute abuts and parallels the Constitution and that means statutory interpretation becomes constitutional interpretation. In the recent case of Gunn v. Minton for instance the court based its decision on general concepts of federalism and states rights. These are principles that regularly drive US Constitutional decisions but rarely control statutory interpretation.

The most recent dispute on point is Warsaw v. Sasso (Supreme Court 2021). The case adds an important layer: the doctrine of abstention.

Sasso licensed his patents to Warsaw (Medtronic). The parties had a dispute over which products were covered under the license and Sasso sued in Indiana state court for breach of contract (seeking money damages). The outcome of the contract claim (apparently) largely depends upon whether the products are “covered by a valid claim” of one of Sasso’s patents. So there probably should have been some detailed patent analysis in the case.

Medtronic wanted the case in Federal Court where it could use more sophisticated tactics to invalidate the patent or avoid claim scope. Medtronic first attempted to remove the case to Federal Court. However the Federal Judge remanded it back down. Sasso v. Warsaw Orthopedic Inc. No. 3:13-cv-1031 (N.D. Ind. Apr. 2 2014). Then Medtronic filed for reexamination and a number of claims were cancelled. (Note here that at this time Medtronic was owner of the patents and pursued ex parte reexamination as a “friendly” way to limit claim scope.) The state court apparently refused to consider these validity issues in the contract case.

Finally Medtronic filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal Court — asking for a declaration of “No Breach … Because No Valid Claim of the ‘313 or ‘046 Patent Covers the Medtronic Products for Which Dr. Sasso Seeks Royalties.” The district court refused to hear the case — but rather dismissed the case on grounds of abstention.

Discretion under the DJ Act: In particular the declaratory judgment act offers discretionary jurisdiction: “any court of the United States upon the filing of an appropriate pleading may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201. On appeal the Federal Circuit affirmed that the court acted appropriately. See Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. 515 U.S. 277 286 (1995) (“substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights of litigants”).

To be clear in its decision the Federal Circuit found that the DJ action filed by Medtronic did arise under the patent laws but that it was still appropriate to dismiss the case in favor of the state court action. “[T]his declaratory action is within the district court’s jurisdictional authority and we have jurisdiction to receive this appeal and to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in abstaining from exercise of declaratory jurisdiction.”

The outcome though creates a conundrum: If the Federal Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over patent cases how can a court determine that this is a patent case but still remand it for state court determination?

Now come the petition for writ of certiorari on the following question:

Whether a federal court with exclusive jurisdiction over a claim may abstain in favor of a state court with no jurisdiction over that claim.

[Warsaw Petition for Writ of Certiorari]. Although this appears to be a case of first impression Warsaw grounds its petition in the language of prior abstention cases. In particular a key focus in those cases is whether the dispute “can better be settled in the proceeding pending in the state court.” Wilton. Here Warsaw argues the state is actually precluded from deciding the key issues.

= = = =

Middle Ground Overlap: The statutes are worded in a way creates bright-line rules: Federal courts have exclusive authority over cases arising under the patent laws; Federal courts have no authority over patent-related disputes that don’t meet that threshold (absent other justification for Fed. Ct. Jurisdiction). The appellate decision in this case though appears to present a middle ground — cases where dual Federal/State authority is appropriate. Although this result is perhaps surprising there is nothing Constitutionally troubling about dual jurisdiction. At the same time the answer will almost necessarily come from analyzing and interpreting the Constitution.

“Starting out your degree with hands-on technical projects is definitely something that separates Louisiana Tech from other schools since many students do not get the chance to start projects until sophomore or junior year” she said of the Living with the Lab series. “I saw how well the degree meshed with things I do every day. I’m always trying to increase the efficiency of whatever I am doing and perform it in an organized manner which is a fundamental of industrial engineering. I also knew I wanted to direct myself toward a managerial role within an engineering team and Louisiana Tech’s Industrial Engineering program really prepares you for that.”

As a Louisiana Tech Industrial Engineering student Theriot has earned four professional certificates in Lean and Six Sigma practices and has completed internships with Medtronic which resulted in a patent application and with UPS. She and two classmates will present research that originated during her UPS internship at the digital University of Louisiana System “For Our Future Conference 2021” later this month.

“The Industrial Engineering program has done an excellent job of helping me learn about various processes. The program prepares you well for many positions that don’t have the words “industrial engineer” in the title. I qualified for my internship with Medtronic because everything I learned from my major and minor applied to what they were looking for.”

Theriot also spent four years as an active member of the Louisiana Tech College of Engineering and Science community committing time and effort to the College’s student chapter of American Society of Mechanical Engineers its Society of Women Engineers and its chapter of the national engineering honor society Tau Beta Pi. In the past year she has become a member of the national Order of the Engineer and was selected for Louisiana Tech’s Who’s Who and was the female 2021 Tenets of Tech awardee.

Last Saturday Theriot graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and minors in Mechanical Engineering and International Studies. She will carry her Louisiana Tech education and the skills she learned here to Europe where she plans to study product and innovation management at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands the University of Oulu in Finland or TU Dublin in Ireland.

What advice does she leave to her fellow Louisiana Tech Industrial Engineering students and anyone considering joining the program?

“Other students and the Industrial Engineering professors are here to help you succeed! Reach out to them for help with classwork or projects. Our professors can also help you with internship or career opportunities. If any company has a process you’ll be able to apply an industrial engineering degree to a job there. It is such a versatile degree in that way since you are able to go into so many fields. In addition take advantage of earning our certificates! Two are built into our curriculum and are obtained by earning an A or B in select classes. The other is obtained by taking an optional Black Belt Project class in conjunction with classes you already take. This class gives experience working with a company and other classes the program offers do as well so I feel that industrial engineering students get a great opportunity for building their real-world skills!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8va3V3YWl0dGltZXMuY29tL21pbmltZWQtNzgwZy1pbi1rdXdhaXQtdG8taGVscC1kaWFiZXRlcy1wYXRpZW50c9IBTGh0dHBzOi8va3V3YWl0dGltZXMuY29tL21pbmltZWQtNzgwZy1pbi1rdXdhaXQtdG8taGVscC1kaWFiZXRlcy1wYXRpZW50cy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MiniMed 780G in Kuwait to help diabetes patients,"MiniMed 780G in Kuwait to help diabetes patients

KUWAIT: Under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and the Kuwait Diabetes Society Medtronic the global leader in medical technology announced the launch of the MiniMed 780G system in Kuwait. This next generation advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL) insulin pump system anticipates the patient's insulin needs and self-adjusts the insulin delivery while also utilizing smartphone connectivity to allow easier access to information.

Dr Abdullah Al-Badr Assistant Undersecretary at the Ministry of Health said: ""Diabetes is currently a pressing issue which the current pandemic has highlighted further given that people with diabetes are more likely to have serious complications from COVID-19."" He continued: ""It is therefore vital that we continue to raise awareness around the importance of disease management and look at ways we can harness technology to improve the lives of patients. The health and safety of people living with diabetes is amongst one of our priorities and so we are grateful for the efforts of the Health Sector in Jassim Al-Wazzan Sons and Medtronic to ensuring this.""

""The launch of the MiniMed 780G is the latest example of how Medtronic uses smart algorithms to improve patient outcomes and simplify decisions for people living with diabetes leveraging the company's deep data science and AI capabilities"" said Majid Kaddoumi President Medtronic Central and Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa. ""From smart pump to smart pen our portfolio offers innovative tech-enabled solutions for people on different stages in their diabetes therapy journey.""

Dr Rashed Khazal General Manager of the Healthcare Sector of Jassim Al-Wazzan Sons General Trading Co the distributor of Medtronic products in Kuwait and one of the subsidiaries of Mezzan Holding Company said: ""With the pandemic exacerbating the need for new and smarter technologies we felt it was crucial to work alongside Medtronic to launch the MiniMed 780G so that type 1 diabetic patients can focus more on their lives and less on diabetes. We are already seeing the impact of this and have received positive feedback from physicians across the world who have noted the pump's simplicity which has enabled patients to adjust very quickly to this system giving them the freedom and control to improve their quality of life.""

Dr Waleed Al-Dahi; Consultant Endocrinologist and President of the Kuwait Diabetes Society said: ""Research has shown that the incidence of type 1 diabetes has doubled in Kuwait over the last 20 years highlighting the pressing need to address the burden of this disease. Medical technology is now considered the center for management of diabetes. With the new available technical breakthrough diabetic patients can manage their diabetes better and live a better life. Medtronic has always provided cutting-edge technology to help in better management of diabetes.""

Despite advances in technology and the growing use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) many people with diabetes especially adolescents struggle with glycemic control and the daily challenges of managing their condition. The MiniMed 780G system which is approved for use in people aged 7 to 80 years anticipates insulin needs and leverages the company's most advanced SmartGuard algorithm to automate the delivery of both basal insulin and correction boluses 24/7 every five minutes as needed helping more people with diabetes avoid highs and lows with greater ease and reach their glycemic targets with less effort.

The MiniMed 780G system includes Bluetooth connectivity allowing users to easily track pump and CGM information with customized options for alerts and real time glucose trends. In addition information is shared automatically and securely with care givers and health care professionals thanks to the CareLink Connect App.",,,

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Here's how,"Every pharmaceutical company is constantly searching for its next blockbuster — the billion-dollar drug that dominates a market brings in hordes of customers and deposits hefty profits in drugmakers’ bank accounts. But with every blockbuster too comes its expiration date.

Pharmaceutical giants including Merck Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie are set to lose key patents on some of their most lucrative drugs this decade. As the clock counts down to the end of that exclusivity more affordable generic and biosimilar alternatives are waiting to enter the market — taking a portion of the giants’ blockbuster business driving prescription prices down and giving consumers potentially better options.

With competition closing in these pharmaceutical companies are bracing for impact. But they’re also prepping their own playbooks healthcare analysts and industry academics say — and looking ahead to both survive business shake-ups and stymy their competitors.

What is a blockbuster drug?

A blockbuster drug is one that generates at least $1 billion in annual revenue — although in more recent years their potential for profits have climbed far higher. Best-selling drugs like AbbVie’s Humira for one have reached annual sales of more $20 billion annually.

“It’s very hard to try to replace that” said Matt Phipps a biotech analyst at investment bank William Blair. “The reason these companies became as big as they are is because they found that one drug that really worked and could drive growth to where they are now.”

Many of these blockbusters are known as small-molecule drugs which make up 90% of all medications sold. Typically when a small-molecule drug — which has a low molecular weight and is typically taken orally — loses it patent it can can also lose up 80% of its sales in one year according to Phipps.

But the upcoming sweep of patent expirations is also set to impact biologic therapies — a class of drugs developed from living materials such as blood proteins plants and microorganisms. These drugs are usually administered through an IV or an injection. Because they’re more complicated to replicate the pace of their diminishing sales is different than that of small-molecule drugs.

In the case of Humira — a biologic used to treat arthritis and other autoimmune conditions — the medication began facing competition from biosimilar alternatives last year. In 2023 sales of Humira fell fell 32% to $14 billion. More recently Humira sales continued to fall 9% to $2.3 billion in the three months ending March 31.

Now pharma giants are taking steps now to prepare for similar revenue losses when their patents start to expire in the next few years. But Big Pharma also has a plan in place — and a well-run playbook for delaying or offsetting impending generic competition.

The first play: File more patents

“Even six months of a $10 billion drug is worth a hell of a lot more than the first six months of a new therapy that’s launching” Phipps said. “Step one is always try to maximize what you have.”

Because drugs are patented years before they get regulatory approval and hit the market pharmaceutical companies try to extend their exclusivity rights as much as possible. Drug companies do this by filing not only patents on their medications but also on the manufacturing process and even how a drug is administered. All those patents add up — and can delay generic versions and biosimilars from entering the market.

But recently this strategy has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. “I don’t know if we’ll see quite as much of that [in the future] as we had in the past 10 years” Phipps said. In April the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the second time challenged what it called “junk” patents or improper patent listings in the Food and Drug Administration’s Orange Book — the official list of FDA-approved drugs.

Melissa Wasserman a professor at the University of Texas Austin who researches drug patent law said this is positive development. “Those patents that are listed in the Orange Book can have a blocking effect” Wasserman said. “You as a generic can’t come on until you basically deal with every patent that’s listed in the Orange Book for that drug.”

Another patenting strategy the companies deploy: Combine drugs then patent those new formulations. In one case Bristol Myers Squibb is losing several key patents in 2028 including its best-selling Opdivo. In 2023 the melanoma-fighting medication alone accounted for 20% of the company’s $45 billion in annual revenue.

In 2022 the company launched Opdualag a combination of Opdivo with the antibody relatlimab-rmbw after the combined drug was found to have increased efficacy for treating melanoma. It was “purely a patent extension technique” Phipps said although the combined medication does make it a bit easier to administer to patients. But sales of Opdualag skyrocketed 72% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024 reaching $206 million.

The second play: Offset losses with newer drugs

“Eventually all your patents run out and generic competition enters” said Mike Perrone a biotech specialist at healthcare management consulting firm Baird. What pharmaceutical companies turn to next he added involves relying on their internal pipelines.

After exhausting their options with patents pharmaceutical companies increase investment in their new and upcoming drugs to offset declining sales. But the timing has to be right given it takes a while for a new drug to reach blockbuster-status revenue.

AbbVie the maker of the world’s once best-selling drug Humira is a good example of this being pulled off properly. When the pharma giant lost exclusive rights to Humira last year sales of the drug fell 32%. But by preparing and launching new potential blockbusters a few years before the patent’s expiration the company has been able to offset Humira’s losses.

AbbVie’s Skyrizi a treatment for plaque psoriasis launched in 2019 saw its sales rise 48% year over year to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of Rinqov a treatment for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis that also debuted in 2019 soared 59% to $1.1 billion.

Meanwhile Merck the maker of Keytruda — which took the title of the world’s best-selling drug from Humira last year with $25 billion in sales — is now deploying a similar strategy. The U.S. FDA first approved Keytruda in 2014 to treat melanoma. Since then it’s received approval to treat several types of cancers including lung cancer and carcinoma. In the first quarter of 2024 Keytruda accounted for nearly 44% of Merck’s $15.8 billion in total sales.

With Merck’s patent set to expire in 2028 it’s perhaps no coincidence that this year the company is launching Winrevair a drug for adults who have high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. About 1% of the global population has the condition.

One more play: Snap up smaller companies and outsource

In one last strategic move pharmaceutical companies also acquire smaller biotech startups to absorb their drug pipelines. In effect the move allows them to outsource drug research and development — reducing their own financial risk as blockbuster revenue streams dry up.

“[T]he strategy over the past few years had been to buy things that had already been approved and were on the market so you don’t take any risk” Baird’s Perrone said. But companies have become more aggressive as of late he added — and have started to acquire startups based just on clinical trial results.

Take for example Bristol-Myers Squibb which is set to lose patents for three medications this decade: Eliquis Revlimid and Opdivo. Collectively these drugs accounted for 62% of the company’s total first-quarter sales of $11.9 billion this year. Perhaps it’s no surprise that in April during the company’s quarterly earnings report BMS also touted several of its recent acquisitions: Karuna Therapeutics RayzeBio Mirati Therapeutics and an exclusive license agreement with SystImmune.

In another case Merck — facing the expiration of Keytruda’s patent in four years — highlighted last month how it’s expanding its pipeline and portfolio of drugs with the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics.

Ultimately pharmaceutical giants have had a long time to prepare their plays for expiring blockbusters. “This has always been part of the ecosystem in the biotech world” Phipps said. “You never have a true long-term outlook for something. You always have to be innovating.” In other words it’s business as usual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tZXJjay1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLTIwMjQtZWFybmluZ3MtMTAyNzM4NTA3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck First Quarter 2024 Earnings: Beats Expectations,"Merck (NYSE:MRK) First Quarter 2024 Results

The league announced Thursday March 18 it’s renewing TV rights with all of its existing broadcast partners and adding Amazon Prime Video as an exclusive partner for its Thursday Night Football package. It’s the first time a streaming service will carry a full package of games exclusively. Amazon is paying about US$1 billion per year according to people familiar with the matter. Amazon’s deal runs 10 years and begins in 2023.

ViacomCBS Fox and Comcast (which owns NBCUniversal) are all paying more than US$2 billion per year for their 11-year-long packages while Disney (which owns ESPN and ABC) will pay around US$2.7 billion annually according to people familiar with the matter. Using these numbers the NFL’s new agreement projects to be more than US$100 billion — the richest US sports league media deal.

ViacomCBS is paying US$2.1 billion for its package and NBCUniversal is paying about US$2 billion the lowest of any of the partners but the highest increase over its previous deal the people said. NBCUniversal paid US$1.1 billion for its previous package including playoff games.

Fox is also projected to pay over US$2 billion in its new contact but will save US$660 million as it relinquishes the Thursday Night Football package. Morgan Stanley estimates that contact will be averaging US$400 million in annual losses in 2023 when Fox’s agreement expires.

Disney is paying more and receiving more NFL content including rights to exclusively air an international game each year beginning in 2022 one of the people said. In this pact the ESPN network keeps the Monday Night Football package and also has rights to air two Super Bowls on its ABC network. Disney can stream all NFL games that air on ABC and ESPN on ESPN+ the league stated.

Enjoy this latest wave of Vegas casino resort openings,"With Circa opening in October Virgin Hotels Las Vegas debuting Thursday and Resorts World Las Vegas on deck for the summer the city is in the midst of a new wave.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

We’re in the middle of a wave of new casino openings which is perfect timing for Southern Nevada considering the need to emerge from the lost year of COVID-19.

Virgin Hotels Las Vegas opens its doors Thursday with some crowd-pleasing features highlighted by its restaurant lineup. Be assured that there’s not a single guitar or vinyl disc on any of the walls from the old Hard Rock Hotel that first opened in March 1995.

As openings go Virgin’s arrival will be a little different from the traditional ribbon-cutting although it continues a pattern that has been in place for the last three decades in our city: New casino openings often seem to come in waves of three.

The current trio includes Circa on Oct. 28 Virgin on Thursday and Genting Group’s Resorts World Las Vegas sometime in the summer.

So while many Virgin visitors will be looking for clues about what was where when the building existed as the Hard Rock others will just enjoy the fresh Virgin ambiance filled with imagery of a journey through the desert. It’s not quite the same as checking out a brand-new property but it’s still good.

It’s going to be interesting to see how that plays in Las Vegas in what will be the first casino operated by a tribal enterprise the Mohegan Sun group of Connecticut.

But back to that pattern of three that has been a part of our more recent history. It really started with the November 1989 opening of The Mirage although there were lots of casino-hotels already open before that.

The list of vintage properties starts in downtown with the Golden Gate (January 1906) the Golden Nugget (August 1946) and Binion’s (August 1951) with the Strip’s Flamingo sandwiched in there in December 1946.

After that came Sahara (October 1952) Tropicana (April 1957) what’s now The Linq (opened as Flamingo Capri in 1959) Planet Hollywood (opened as the Tally-Ho in February 1963) Four Queens (June 1966) Caesars Palace (August 1966) Circus Circus (October 1968) and Westgate (opened as the International in July 1969).

The ’70s opened with Harrah’s Las Vegas (July 1973) Bally’s (opened as MGM Grand in December 1973) Oyo (opened as a Howard Johnson in 1973) California Hotel (January 1975) Main Street Station (opened as the Holiday International in 1978) The Cromwell (opened as the Barbary Coast in March 1979) and D Las Vegas (opened as Sundance in July 1980).

Several other storied casino resorts with historic names came and went throughout those years: Riviera Stardust and Aladdin (which sat where Planet Hollywood is now) among them.

But it was in 1989 that things really got interesting when Steve Wynn opened The Mirage built at a cost of $630 million and critics said it was doomed to financial failure. They were wrong.

That first wave of development included The Mirage followed by the off-Strip Rio (January 1990) and Excalibur (June 1990).

The next trifecta wave was one of my personal favorites because the openings all occurred within three months of each other in 1993.

On Oct. 15 of that year the pyramid portion of Luxor with “inclinators” instead of elevators debuted. That was followed Oct. 26 by Treasure Island with a Hollywood panache only Steve Wynn could dream up coordinating cannon fire from one of the two sailing ships in front of the building with the implosion of the Dunes which was to become the site of Wynn’s next resort Bellagio.

The last of the three openings was the MGM Grand on Dec. 18 at the time the largest hotel in the world with a theme park that would open months later.

The next blast of openings were more spread out.

The Strat which saw multiple delays in its construction and once was the site of Bob Stupak’s Vegas World opened to the public in April 1996. That was followed by the Monte Carlo now known as Park MGM in June 1996 and New York-New York in January 1997.

The next wave of openings actually had four resorts opening within a year of each other.

Bellagio opened on a windy night in October 1998 — and the spray from the fountains rained on guests watching the show. Next came Mandalay Bay (March 1999) and The Venetian (May 1999) with openings coming full circle to Paris Las Vegas (September 1999) across the street from Bellagio.

One property the Palms opened in November 2001.

The last wave wasn’t much of a wave at all thanks to the Great Recession. Palazzo opened its doors in December 2007 M Resort in March 2009 and The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in December 2010.

The crest of the newest wave is fast approaching with details starting to emerge on Resorts World.

Posted on: March 20 2021 03:14h.

Last updated on: March 21 2021 01:17h.

When Resorts World Las Vegas opens on the Strip this summer it will be at least the third hotel-casino on the resort corridor to ban or limit smoking on the property.

This latest addition to the roster of hotel-casinos placing a strict limit on smoking comes as resorts are experimenting with new concepts to attract customers. Adults-only casinos are another idea being explored during the city’s recovery from a pandemic-related economic slump.

Two hotel-casinos have staked out positions as adults-only properties banning anyone under age 21 from the site except in designated restaurants. These are Circa Resort in downtown Las Vegas and the Cromwell Las Vegas on the Strip.

Some experts believe the adults-only concept will work better at smaller properties than at the megaresorts that have massive hotel towers and thousands of guest rooms. Circa and the Cromwell both have fewer than 1000 rooms.

As this unfolds the smoke-free concept has started to take root on the Strip.

In the fall Park MGM announced it would be an entirely nonsmoking property. This occurred about the same time that the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas banned smoking from some public spaces but not the gaming floor. Resorts World will ban smoking throughout the property except in the casino. All three hotel-casinos are on the west side of the Strip.

Anton Nikodemus an MGM Resorts executive said the decision to go smoke-free at Park MGM was based on “continued guest requests.” Park MGM once known as the Monte Carlo is near T-Mobile Arena home of the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights.

‘Toxic COVID-laced Smoke’

Randy Hayden a Louisiana-based consultant for Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights said younger casino patrons don’t want to visit or work in casinos filled with smoke. This generation is “more health-conscious than the older generation that currently frequents a casino” he told Casino.org.

“Many of the casinos themselves have publicly stated their insistence they will provide a safe and healthy workplace for employees and customers during the COVID era. But this remains a dubious claim if they allow customers to pull down their masks and blow toxic COVID-laced smoke at a gaming table” he said.

Allowing customers to smoke could present a problem for Las Vegas as gaming proliferates nationwide Hayden said. There are about 1000 casinos across the country according to the American Gaming Association website. Many provide nonsmoking settings Hayden noted.

“Gamblers now recognize they can locally have a ‘what happens in Vegas’ outing and not have to choke their way through that experience” Hayden said.

Smoking a Business Decision

Others contend that banning smoking is a business decision that should be left up to each casino company.

Nevadans have addressed the smoking issue in an election before. In 2006 Nevada voters approved the Clean Indoor Air Act banning smoking in some public places but not casinos.

Gaming industry advocates contend a smoking ban drives customers to casinos in states where gamblers can light up.

When smoking was outlawed in New Orleans casinos in 2015 and Baton Rouge in 2018 revenue from those places fell by 15-17 percent Wade Duty executive director of the Louisiana Casino Association told Casino.org.

It’s like the week before Christmas for a tot who can’t wait to open presents.

In this case the present is a return to normal life in Southern Nevada and the sparkling wrapped gifts are the promises that things are going to get better sooner rather than later.

This is what pent-up demand looks like.

The evidence is all around with some indicators on the near horizon and some a little further away.

Trends hinting at Las Vegas’ return have been mounting over the past few weeks as COVID-19 case numbers fell.

Encouraging trends

Experts say the availability of vaccines should help make more Americans comfortable returning to destinations like Las Vegas.

“As more and more people are vaccinated more and more people are going to feel comfortable traveling and feel comfortable in crowds” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

The change of heart comes just after the travel industry’s U.S. economic output was estimated to have lost $1.1 trillion in 2020 according to a recent report from the U.S. Travel Association.

But many people — including those who have not yet been vaccinated — view the dropping COVID-19 case numbers as a green light to travel again. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still advising Americans to delay their vacation plans but tourism experts say many have a desire to travel that outweighs concerns about catching the virus.

“Everything is going in a better direction and there’s a lot of pent-up demand” said Debi Nutton a gaming consultant and former Wynn Resorts Ltd. executive.

Higher room rates

And as more visitors fill Las Vegas’ resorts the city is starting to return to some sense of normalcy.

Room rates shot up over the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament. Hotel rooms at Palazzo Linq and Planet Hollywood are available seven days a week again. Buffets and dayclubs — two major taboos at the height of the pandemic — are returning albeit with amended operations. Fans are back at Golden Knights games again. Nearly 40 shows are performing on the Strip.

The list goes on.

Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority President and CEO Steve Hill said the problem many entertainment venues are facing now is that to maintain social distancing crowds are greatly reduced and many shows including Cirque du Soleil performances need a full house to be profitable.

“Elimination of social distancing will be key to filling entertainment venues” Hill said.

“We think as we head into summer the opportunity to open up attendance to 100 percent should be there with the caveats that we want to make sure we don’t have some completely left turn with a variant and obviously in order for that to take place the vaccine rollout needs to continue with at least the pace we’re at now.”

Gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization said all of the trends that have been building up over the past few weeks are a sign that Las Vegas is on track to return to its former glory.

“In their own small individual way (these indicators) lead to a slow thoughtful building up of momentum and return to people actually coming to Las Vegas to enjoy themselves in greater numbers” he said.

“(These are signs) that point toward Vegas getting a little bit closer to what Vegas was in terms of America’s favorite place to come and enjoy yourself.”

Greater capacity

Loosened restrictions have helped open the doors for returning visitors. Restaurants and casino floors are allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity up from 25 percent a few weeks back and certain large gatherings that had been capped at 20 percent can fill up to half of their capacity.

“With Gov. Sisolak’s loosening of the capacity restrictions I think that has made (casino) companies even more confident that the recovery will continue” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

He added that even though booking windows are still short “Strip operators are just becoming more enthused about what the summer could look like.”

The positive trends seem to have come at an opportune moment. The tourist corridor’s newest property Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is set to open next week pool season is kicking off at resorts across the valley and the city is potentially just months away from seeing major conventions return.

“I think the COVID-related news has been positive of late and people are starting to travel again” said Nehme Abouzeid founder and president of marketing consultancy LaunchVegas LLC.

“My friends in entertainment tell me advance tickets are selling well” Abouzeid said. “The warm weather is arriving and the pools here look inviting. Quite rightly Vegas never stopped marketing itself to the world since we knew that while COVID was going to be serious and protracted it would still be a relative blip and that our core industry would have to find a way back. People still longed to come here — nothing went wrong structurally with consumer demand for Vegas; they were simply responding to the pandemic.”

The sense of optimism surrounding Las Vegas tourism is refreshing but experts warn that the city still faces a long road to recovery with possible bumps along the way.

For one weekday visitation is still struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels. Strip occupancies today hover between 70 and 90 percent but midweek rooms are typically only 40 to 60 percent full.

Those numbers aren’t expected to fully bounce back until the city sees the return of international visitors and meetings and convention bookings.

Truist gaming analyst Barry Jonas said in-person conventions are expected to return this summer but he expects a “more lagged” recovery for midweek business travel relative to the weekend leisure travel.

“We’re certainly starting to see a return of Las Vegas tourism” Jonas said but “the improvements are more pronounced on the weekends.”

Threat from variants

Another surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases could impede recovery. Some health experts worry about yet another spike in cases as variants of the virus continue to spread across the country.

That could lead to resorts facing strict operating restrictions again.

“While we are thankful that the destination is bouncing back well we need to be mindful that one slip in the numbers could reverse the trend as we saw last November when the governor imposed the cut in capacity” said Brendan Bussmann of Global Market Advisors.

The rapidly changing numbers in both reduced cases and vaccinations has resulted in some organizations having to speed up their plans to accommodate the pent-up demand.

Hill told a Nevada Commission on Tourism recovery subcommittee Thursday that the LVCVA and its advertising consultant R&R Partners is considering bumping up a paid advertising and marketing campaign to attract leisure travelers.

“We will evolve to telling our own message again … the governor’s decision to open up vaccinations to everyone on April 5 is also a signal for us to speed up from what we intended to do toward the end of April probably to the middle of April” Hill said.

“The trends on the leisure side have followed the health numbers almost exactly. As things have gotten better the interest in travel and the bookings we are seeing both now and in the future are really good showing a lot of improvement” he said.

There are other indications some of the long-term indications are looking good.

The Life is Beautiful music and arts festival scheduled for downtown Las Vegas Sept. 17-19 sold out 50000 passes in record time hours after they first went on sale.

World of Concrete approved

Organizers of the World of Concrete a major citywide convention that routinely draws 60000 people to Southern Nevada announced Wednesday that they had received permission from the Nevada Department of Business and Industry to stage their show from June 8-10 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Hill and other tourism leaders in the state had pointed to World of Concrete as the likely first major show to return to the trade show fold.

“The entire industry was watching to see if the World of Concrete could happen” Hill said. “The fact that it did has resulted in three shows approved in the last 24 hours following that.

“This will be the first major show to take place across the United States” he said. “Even though other states have been open to doing it those shows have not been able to move forward because of the health situation and getting exhibitors to commit to come and attendees to attend regardless of what the states’ protocols or rules were those major shows have not happened.”

And conventions can also be important to leisure travel.

“I think people are desperate to get out of their houses and go anywhere” said Pam Robinson chairwoman of the Commission on Tourism’s recovery subcommittee. “When people come for conventions they often add a day to their trips.”

Conventions and trade shows are big drivers of tourism for Southern Nevada. Executives for nearly every publicly traded Las Vegas-based company that have convention facilities — MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Inc. Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. among them — remarked during their fourth-quarter earnings calls how strong their convention calendars are looking for late 2021 2022 and 2023.

“We’ve been wandering in the abyss for almost a year now … and you can clearly see the light shining through at this point in Las Vegas” Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said during a February call with investors.

“We feel very good that we’ve seen the bottom in Vegas and in the business and that we’re only going to keep getting better.”

Anticipating eventual high demand the LVCVA tended to its convention infrastructure.

The organization months ago committed to having its new $987.1 million West Hall and its $52.5 million underground people-mover completed in time for the 2021 CES show. When the Consumer Technology Association operators of CES announced in July that it was canceling an in-person show the LVCVA went ahead and completed construction.

Trade shows that had been canceled or postponed began scrambling for available dates to stage their shows.

The LVCVA also moved ahead with its plan to purchase the Las Vegas Monorail Co. out of bankruptcy. Hill said the 3.9-mile elevated electric transit system is critical to moving conventioneers to shows when they return. As a result the LVCVA expects the monorail to resume operations around the Memorial Day weekend.

What could go wrong

While the Las Vegas reawakening shows blue skies in most areas there are still some reasons to doubt everything will go smoothly and many questions remain unanswered.

Clark County officials are hopeful that between 60 percent and 70 percent of its residents will get their vaccinations by the end of May. What if they don’t? What happens if the COVID-19 variants spread and the public has doubts that any vaccination would be effective?

Worse what if vaccinations aren’t effective against newly discovered variants?

While tourism leaders are confident that conventions and trade shows will come back strong what will attendance look like? Will a show that normally draws 50000 people see only 25000?

That’s one of the worries for shows that typically attract an international audience like CES. While Nevada and the United States are on track for more visitation there isn’t much they can do about travelers from Europe Asia and even Canada.

Nevertheless experts are optimistic for Las Vegas’ future.

“We don’t know what’s going to happen. … We may see some stops and starts” UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said. But “I think this is the beginning of a long-term recovery.”

Bussmann concurs.

“As long as this trend continues it bodes well for the long term recovery that will include the business and MICE (meetings incentives conferencing and exhibitions) customer coming back to Las Vegas” he said. “With World of Concrete set for June let’s hope the trend continues to allow this event to come off what has historically been one of the largest gaming shows in the destination. Assuming this happens and we have no set back it could make for a nice third and fourth quarter of bringing business back to Las Vegas.”

Encouraging numbers

The seven-day average for new cases reported in the U.S. was 53200 as of Friday according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a sharp decline from the seven-day average peak of 249389 in January.

The drop comes as more Americans are getting shots in arms; as of Friday about 16 percent of U.S. adults had been fully vaccinated.

The vaccination rate is expected to build as more age groups become eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Starting April 5 anyone 16 and over in Nevada will be able to get their shots."

The shortage in chips the “brain” within every electronic device in the world has been steadily worsening since last year.

Initially the problem was only a temporary delay in supplies as factories shut down when the coronavirus pandemic first hit.

However although production is back to normal a new surge in demand driven by changing habits fuelled by the pandemic means that it is now reaching crisis point.

Car manufacturers investing in tech-heavy electric vehicles the boom in sales of TVs and home computers and launch of new games consoles and 5G-enabled mobile phones have all driven demand.

Even the mighty Apple a $2tn company and the world’s biggest buyer of semiconductors spending $58bn annually was forced to delay the launch of the much-hyped iPhone 12 by two months last year due to the shortage.

“Chips are everything” says Neil Campling media and tech analyst at Mirabaud. “There is a perfect storm of supply and demand factors going on here. But basically there is a new level of demand that can’t be kept up with everyone is in crisis and it is getting worse.”

Ford recently cancelled shifts at two car plants and said profits could be hit by up to $2.5bn this year due to chip shortages while Nissan is idling output at plants in Mexico and the US. General Motors said it could face a $2bn profit hit.

Last month Sony which along with other console makers has struggled with stock shortages over the last year said it might not hit sales targets for the new PS5 this year because of the semiconductor supply issue. Microsoft’s Xbox has said it forecasts supply issues continuing at least until the second half of the year.

However the most telling example of the semiconductor crisis has come from Samsung the world’s second-largest buyer of chips for its products after Apple. Earlier this week the company said it might have to postpone the launch of its high-end smartphone due to the shortage despite also being the world’s second-largest producer of chips.

“It is incredible that Samsung sells $56bn of semiconductors to others and consumes $36bn of them itself finds it may have to delay the launch of one of its own products” says Campling.

Samsung’s co-chief executive Koh Dong-jin who also heads its mobile business unit highlighted a significant issue saying that there is a “serious imbalance” in the pecking order of who is getting the limited supplies of chips.

Car manufacturers who cut chip orders as vehcle sales fell last year found themselves at the back of the queue when they tried to reorder when the market rebounded. The entire global car industry buys about $37bn worth of chips with the biggest players such as Toyota and Volkswagen spending more than $4bn each making them relative minnows for semiconductor suppliers.

“The worst affected have been autos because they were last to the party; if Apple is spending $56bn a year and growing who are you going to keep supplies going to first?” says Campling.

The chip shortage looks set to persist for some time yet. It can take up to two years to get complex semiconductor production factories up and running and manufacturers are in the process of significantly raising prices for the second time in less than a year.

“There is no sign of supply catching up or demand decreasing while prices are rising across the chain” says Campling. “This will cross over to people in the street. Expect cars to cost more phones to cost more. This year’s iPhone is not going to be cheaper than last year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3NvdXJjaW5nLXByb2N1cmVtZW50L2FydGljbGUvMjEzNDIzMjcvYml0Y2FkZXQtY29tcGxhY2VuY3ktaXMta2lsbGluZy11cy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Complacency is Killing U.S. Manufacturers,"Manufacturing represents the best of us – fueling the U.S. economy with good jobs good pay and the path to a secure future for millions of Americans. That’s why it’s heartbreaking to watch an industry almost deconstruct for one simple reason – a failure to meet its customer’s buying expectations.

The numbers are pretty astounding. Today eight out of 10 manufacturers still primarily depend on their internal sales team to drive revenue; and less than one out of five offer a digital buying experience. It’s no surprise that buyers prefer to source vet and purchase from suppliers they find online yet manufacturers continually fail to meet them there.

What's driving this complacency? Fear.

Why is it so hard for manufacturers to meet this new buying demand? Fear of change and technology fear of losing revenue fear of inadequacy and fear of risking relationships with dealers/distributors. This grappling fear is paralyzing manufacturers.

Sure change is hard but manufacturers never shied away from investing in the quality of their products. However the average manufacturer lags behind 10-15 years when it comes to investing in sales and operational processes.

What’s the answer?

Digitizing an operation is more than building an e-commerce platform – it’s tying together all the back-end processes within a company’s supply chain to create a seamless experience. Companies are finding that selling direct requires commitment to the back-end operation to make sure all areas (sales finance engineering production logistics marketing HR etc.) are collaborating and the infrastructure is thoroughly in place.

Most U.S. manufacturers have an overwhelming amount of manual administrative processes engrained in their employee culture. For many employees especially those with a decade or more at the company a new way of operating is often stressful and many people are just resistant to change.

Yet of all industries manufacturing benefits the most from e-commerce. According to Digital Commerce 360 in 2019 U.S manufacturers’ B2B ecommerce sales grew by nearly 21% to $430 billion. That growth rate is nearly 20 times faster than the growth in total U.S. manufacturing sales.

While there are other options to list their products on third-party vendors’ sites this often removes pricing controls and dilutes the brand while forcing manufacturers to meet tight delivery deadlines.

COVID-19 impact on manufacturing

The manufacturing digital divide exacerbated by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is leading to a surge of bankruptcies. The pandemic has forced a number of manufacturers to digitize their operation and offer a self-serve experience from their website.

According to McKinsey and Company more than 75% of buyers and sellers say they now prefer remote human engagement over face-to-face interactions. They appreciate the ability to research information place orders and arrange service. In fact the majority hope to continue the self-serve model as business returns to “normal.”

E-commerce is not just for smaller ticket-items according to another study by McKinsey & Company. In fact 70% of B2B decision-makers say they are open to making new fully self-serve or remote purchases in excess of $50000 and 27% would spend more than $500000.

Add to this a changing demographic among buyers for vendors dealers and distributers. These professionals are now Millennials with less brand allegiance. Outside the United States manufacturers in Asia have also been quickly capitalizing on this change to game the market and drive out American competitors.

COVID-19 has revealed the gaping holes in supply chains and caused havoc among those manufacturers who have not been able to keep up with demand. The good news – and light at the end of the tunnel - is that companies with digitized operations are taking the lead and experiencing record growth during these hard times.

Manufacturing’s traditional selling processes are broken. The next chapter requires a savvy digital approach backed by a deep understanding of buyer expectations. In turn this empowers manufacturers to focus on what they do best – building amazing products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZGNleGVjLmNvbS9zb3VyY2luZy1wcm9jdXJlbWVudC9uZXdzLzIxMzMxMjE5L2F2ZXR0YS1mb3JtZXJseS1waWNzLWF1ZGl0aW5nLWF2ZXR0YS1zdXJ2ZXktZmluZHMtY3N1aXRlLWV4ZWNzLWNvbmNlcm5lZC1vdmVyLWhvdy1icmV4aXQtd2lsbC1pbXBhY3Qtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLXJlc2lsaWVuY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avetta Survey Finds C-Suite Execs Concerned Over How Brexit Will Impact Supply Chain Resiliency,"Nearly one-third (29%) of survey respondents anticipate changes in documentation and administrative processes; 16% on sales revenue; 11% on market/sector competition; and 10% on hiring permanent staff in accordance with Brexit yet only 5% saw an impact on engaging temporary staff and keeping sustainability environmental and social value commitments according to an Avetta survey.

Less than 24 hours after the earlier part of this article was to go live showing the glorious complexity yet promise of Optane Micron ended its program. I wanted to address why and some of the forward-looking comments on focusing on CXL.

The Micron Statement on Discontinuing 3D XPoint Operations

Here is the prepared statement from Micron’s executive team on discontinuing its 3D XPoint offering. If you have already read it feel free to skip the italicized quoted text and move to the analysis since this is a long statement.

One important challenge that 3D XPoint memory products face in the market is that the latency of access requires significant changes to data center applications to leverage the full benefits of 3D XPoint. These changes are complex and extremely time-consuming requiring years of sustained industrywide effort to drive broad adoption. In addition there are important cost-performance trade-offs that need to be characterized and optimized for each workload.

The value proposition of 3D XPoint was to operate as persistent memory at a lower cost to DRAM or as storage that is significantly faster than NAND.

In the years since 3D XPoint was first announced data center workloads and customer requirements have continued to evolve. As data-intensive workloads proliferate and AI ramps in data-centric applications the CPU-DRAM bandwidth has become an increasingly limiting factor of overall system performance. In addition as CPU architectures evolve to dramatically increase CPU core count more DRAM is needed to ensure adequate memory bandwidth per CPU core. This trend has driven ever-increasing server DRAM content.

The industry now stands on the threshold of a significant change in data center architecture — driven by the adoption of a new high-performance interface called Compute Express Link or CXL — that will connect compute memory and storage subsystems in the years ahead. This upcoming change creates a significant opportunity for Micron to take advantage of industry-leading innovation in technology and products to benefit our customers. We expect these new memory solutions to utilize the industry-standard CXL interface and enable our customers to achieve new levels of performance and improved total cost of ownership or TCO for data-hungry workloads.

On the storage front the significantly lower cost of NAND will remain a barrier for wide adoption of 3D XPoint. Therefore 3D XPoint-based SSD products are not expected to be anything more than a niche market over time. Memory was always the strategic long term market opportunity for 3D XPoint.

One important challenge that 3D XPoint memory products face in the market is that the latency of access requires significant changes to data center applications to leverage the full benefits of 3D XPoint. These changes are complex and extremely time-consuming requiring years of sustained industrywide effort to drive broad adoption. In addition there are important cost-performance trade-offs that need to be characterized and optimized for each workload.

As we develop new products using CXL our focus is on addressing data-intensive workload requirements while reducing barriers to adoption such as software infrastructure changes. Importantly our development model for these newer products will be significantly more cost-effective and we expect a higher ROI for our investments in these new technologies going forward. (Source: Micron’s prepared statements.)

Micron made a rational business decision but we have gotten a lot of questions on it. Why would Micron stop 3D XPoint? The answer is very simple it was losing $400M/ year and Micron has shareholders. I do not know Sanjay Mehrotra beyond shaking hands once but his daughter was a colleague at PwC when I did management consulting. She is bright and my assumption is that her father is also intellectually astute running a large semiconductor organization for years. At some point if there is no clear path to profitability it is a CEO’s responsibility to shareholders to cut losses even if the technology is “cool.”

When there is a discussion about the storage performance and latency hopefully we addressed this in how it works in the earlier part of this article. Instead in ceasing 3D XPoint operations Micron was focusing on Compute Express Link or CXL. CXL is not a replacement for 3D XPoint however it may be the future of this class of memory.

Why Micron is focusing on CXL

The CXL memory is important. In the next-generation of servers we will start to see PCIe Gen5 but also CXL atop of PCIe Gen5. Effectively the architecture we will get is that one can put a pool of memory in a system over CXL and then any CXL component in that system can use it as though it was its own onboard memory. The impact there is that instead of having to have massive amounts of memory for the CPU and accelerators then have to duplicate data and move it between the two memory sets we can instead have it reside in the CXL shared memory pool. Less memory total means less cost. A bigger pool means new capabilities. The extension of where CXL goes is that the CPU starts to lose its place as the dominant part of a server.

We have already covered a type of this when we discussed the IBM Power OMI which is a serial point-to-point connection at a high-level similar to CXL. One simply needs a memory controller and then one can have any medium. One could have a CXL to DDR5 but also a CXL to Optane or CXL to GDDR6 controller. Local caches and memory will be important but that is the game-changing feature.

Going back to our NAND SSD example and needing power-loss protection imagine what happens when the CPU or GPU writes data to fast persistent CXL memory then the DPU/ SmartNIC pulls the data directly from that CXL memory and pushes it over the network to disks in SSDs or large storage arrays finally deleting the CXL memory instance when the write is safe and acknowledged. No longer do we need in-SSD memory for caching nor power-loss protection. Our DPU may not need as much memory either.

Not only is this super-cool but it is also how the market is moving. When at STH you read that this is the last server generation before CXL disrupts this is why. It will take time but the industry is moving this way led by the hyper-scalers.

Since 3D XPoint is not as fast as DRAM Micron is pointing to the existential crisis at the door of Intel Optane. Should Optane occupy fast DIMM slots in a CPU or is PCIe Gen5/ CXL fast enough to service persistent memory? If PCIe Gen5 and CXL are a better fit then Intel can adapt the technology by adding a CXL to Optane controller and that is the model. Indeed this is what Micron is focusing on while opening the door to using other persistent memory technology.

For Optane PMem to survive and what Micron is responding to Intel must:

Expand accessibility. The “Optane Tax” for using M and L SKUs was reduced but it needs to disappear with Ice Lake Xeons. Also with Intel now behind other vendors on core counts and per-socket performance having a high-performance storage/ high-capacity memory solution limited to Intel is not helping the high-end market. The Intel DC P5800X with the AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” is an awesome combination but this is a next-step. Get cost-competitive with DRAM for main memory. Here the challenge is always DRAM pricing. Expanding the use cases for Optane will help drive volume here. It has to get competitive with CXL persistent memory which can be accessed across devices and vendors. This should be an “easy” path for Intel since it would simply need a CXL to Optane controller. By easy I mean logically easy to conceive the controller but I am not the one designing it.

That all assumes there is Optane Memory in the near future. This is and should be a question right now for Intel. The fab producing 3D XPoint is being sold so where the actual wafers come from is a question. For its part Intel gave us the following statement when we asked about the impact it will have:

“Micron’s announcement doesn’t change our strategy for Intel Optane or our ability to supply Intel Optane products to our customers.” (Source: Intel statement to STH)

So it seems business as usual despite the fact that the fab is being sold and so production seems to be one that we need to take Intel’s word for if we believe them. Our assumption is that Micron let Intel know that it would be stopping 3D XPoint efforts and Intel has taken mitigation steps to source supply from elsewhere. Again there are some assumptions that we hope to be correct but may not be.

Final Words

This piece was an idea in December for a short 500 word “here is how we use Optane” article for the holiday season. It has turned into a ~4500-word article that gets one level below the top-level “Optane is like memory and flash combined” mantra. It is still woefully high-level.

Still the fun part of 3D XPoint and Intel Optane is that it is still a relatively new technology. If you want persistent memory that is not a NVDIMM solution this is the easiest to purchase. You can even buy Optane DIMMs at Walmart.com today which is not true from upcoming competitors.

If the glorious complexity of Optane Persistent Memory was not enough from a technical implementation side we now get the commercial complexity of production capabilities. Perhaps we can thank Micron for adding mystique to the PMem 200 series that will take the technology further in the Ice Lake Xeon generation.

What is clear having now used and deployed the technology is that while it is more complex than one may expect it is great. There are no worries with capacitors or battery packs that we would have with NVDIMMs (albeit those are higher performance.) We get capacity that acts as a new tier of storage. All of this happens while replacing enough legacy components to lower our node costs by thousands of dollars. The twelve DIMMs in the system and the 24x first-gen DIMMs in the above photo are heading to our hosting clusters for a reason.

The road ahead certainly has challenges. Intel may discontinue Optane at some point. Still once you understand what persistent memory technology is and is not good for the possibilities for the future are nothing sort of tantalizing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vYWxsM2RwLmNvbS8xL2VwYXgtZTEwLXJldmlldy0zZC1wcmludGVyLXNwZWNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Epax E10: Specs Price Release & Reviews,This article is free for you and free from outside influence.

DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) allows DNS resolution to be performed over an encrypted HTTPS connection rather than through normal plain text DNS lookups.

As some governments and ISPs block connections to sites by monitoring DNS traffic DoH will allow users to bypass censorship prevent spoofing attacks and increase privacy as their DNS requests cannot be as easily monitored.

Microsoft Edge added support for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) in version 86 but the prepopulated DoH providers list/configuration pane was removed after users began reporting performance issues.

“Due to a performance issue recently discovered with DNS-over-HTTPS we have temporarily turned off the built-in list of providers and the auto-upgrade logic that looks at your OS’s DNS setting. Manually providing a resolver URL is still supported” Microsoft Edge engineer Alex Rowell explained in an Edge Insider forum post.

Microsoft has begun testing a fix for the DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) performance issues and you now access the built-in list of providers once again in the latest Microsoft Edge Canary and Dev builds.

Prepopulated list of DoH providers in Microsoft Edge

The current suggested DoH providers are CleanBrowsing Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) Quad9 (9.9.9.9) NextDNS Google (Public DNS) and OpenDNS.

How to enable DoH in Microsoft Edge

DoH support is included in all Microsoft Edge builds but the feature is not enabled by default. If you want to use DoH when making DNS queries you need to follow these steps:

Open Edge Settings. Head to the Privacy search and services tab. Under ""Security"" locate the ""Use secure DNS to specify how to lookup the network address for websites"" option. Enable it and use either your current service provider or choose an alternate DNS-over-HTTPS provider such as Cloudflare and Google.

If you select to use your current service provider and that provider does not support DoH your DNS queries will revert back to the normal insecure DNS protocol.

You can test if DNS-over-HTTPS is working correctly by visiting Cloudflare's Browsing Experience Security Check page which will report whether DoH is working as shown below.

Cloudflare's Browser Experience Security Check page

If your current provider shows that Secure DNS (DoH) is not working you can select one of the preconfigured DNS servers if on Edge Beta Edge Dev and Edge Canary and try the test again. Sometimes you may need to restart the browser after making a DoH change.

If you are using the current Microsoft Edge Stable which does not currently contain the prepopulated list to choose from you can select 'Choose a service provider' and manually enter one of the following DoH provider's URLs:

Windows 10 is getting native DoH support

Microsoft is also bringing DoH settings to Windows 10 which will allow you to browse all of your apps securely.

If you want to test built-in DoH settings in Windows 10 you need to join the Windows Insider program and download a beta build from the Dev Channel.

Once you've upgraded follow these steps:

On Ethernet (wired) connections open Settings > Network & Internet > Status. Click Properties and select Edit DNS server assignment  set it for Manual enter a preferred DoH DNS provider then select Encrypted only (DNS over HTTPS). Windows 10 DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) settings When done press the Save button to save your changes and exit.

For Wi-Fi (wireless) connections you can perform the same steps as above.

Microsoft’s latest Surface detachable made its first appearance at the tail end of 2019 and now well into 2021 has yet to be succeeded by anything newer. However if you’re still sporting an older model you may be curious as to what makes the Pro 7 different if not better.

This guide compares the Surface Pro 7 against the Surface Pro 6. The big difference lies within the underlying CPU but we make other comparisons to give you an idea of what changed between the two generations. Did the refresh make the Surface Pro 7 an imperative purchase? Read on to find out.

Design

You’ll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro 6. Both sport Microsoft‘s familiar Surface design aesthetic and build with silver-gray magnesium formed into a very robust thin and light tablet at 0.33 inches and around 1.73 pounds. Both devices feel like solid chunks of glass and metal.

That said the Surface Pro is probably the most elegant and modern Windows tablet around thanks in part to the most flexible and smoothest kickstand you’ll find today.

Both 2-in-1s share the same 12.3-inch display in the productivity-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio and a sharp 2736 x 1824 (267 pixels-per-inch) resolution. The displays use Microsoft’s latest Pixelsense technology which creates a very thin panel for images that pop and for pen and fingertip presses that are as natural as possible. The display has some of the best contrast you’ll find on a 2-in-1 today and over 400 nits of brightness.

However the Surface Pro 7 does improve connectivity over the prior generation. While both offer the same USB-A and Surface Connect ports the Surface Pro 7 swaps out the Pro 6’s Mini DisplayPort for USB-C connectivity — without Thunderbolt 3 alas.

Both detachables are compatible with the same optional $130 Type Cover. This keyboard offers a precise mechanism consistent backlighting and a very good (if a bit small) Microsoft Precision touchpad with reliable support for all Windows 10 gestures. As usual it magnetically clings to the slate and is propped up for a comfortable typing experience.

The $100 Surface Pen remains the same as well with the usual 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity tilt support and fast response time.

Finally both Surface Pro models ship in Platinum. However Microsoft serves up the Surface Pro 6 in Black whereas the Surface Pro 7 has a Matte Black option.

Performance

The big difference between the two models is the switch from Intel 8th-Gen “Kaby Lake R” CPUs in the Pro 6 to 10th-Gen “Ice Lake” chips in the Pro 7. The latter CPUs are faster and more efficient processors with integrated Intel Iris Pro graphics that rival entry-level discrete graphics in performance.

The Surface Pro 7 won’t be a bona fide gaming laptop but it will handle casual games along with creative apps like photo and video editing much better than the Surface Pro 6. If you do plan to game on the Surface Pro 7 you’ll see better performance on the Core i7 configuration that uses Intel’s integrated G7 graphics core.

On a more technical level the Surface Pro 6 model we tested in 2018 had Intel’s eighth-generation Core i5-8250U. It scored 4074 in the Geekbench single-core test and 13567 in the multi-core test. When we tested the Surface Pro 7 with a newer chip we experienced a 20% increased improvement in multi-core performance and 24% faster 4K video conversions in Handbrake.

Portability

The Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro 6 are the same size and weight. Neither will weigh you down even with the connected Type Cover and Surface Pen tucked away inside your bag.

However battery longevity clearly divides the two generations. One would assume that the Surface Pro 7 should see increased performance but that’s not the case. Even Microsoft admits that its newer model has less battery life than the Surface Pro 6. Where the company estimated 13.5 hours for the Surface Pro 6 you’ll only see an estimated 10.5 hours for the Surface Pro 7.

Our reviews point to this huge dividing factor. In testing the Surface Pro 6 saw 570 minutes in web browsing 849 minutes in our video loop test and 228 minutes using Basemark. Meanwhile the same browser test performed on the Surface Pro 7 revealed a shorter duration: One hour and 20 minutes less than the Surface Pro 6.

Overall you can expect 8.5 hours of battery life in light usage on the Surface Pro 7. The Surface Pro 6 however can blaze through a full 8-hour workday without a problem.

The Surface Pro 7’s jump in power wins the day

The Surface Pro 6 is rather old so it’s only available through third-party sellers like Amazon. The one we found costs $709 packing a Core i5 processor 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That’s just for the tablet potion — the keyboard is an added cost.

The top-tier Pro 7 from Microsoft has a much higher spec with an Intel Core i7 chip 16 GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. You’re paying for all that you get with a hefty price tag that averages out to about $2100 plus the cost of the type cover if you want to use it as a laptop.

The Surface Pro looks modern with its streamlined design and it performs as well as anything else on the market. The performance level of the Surface Pro 7 can’t be beaten but the Surface Pro 6 boasts a longer battery life so it holds its own when you compare them side-by-side.

Before you purchase a Surface Pro determine if you prioritize first-rate performance capabilities or want longer battery life instead — that answer will tell you if you need the Pro 7 or Pro 6. Remember a tenth-generation CPU will drain the battery faster than the Pro 6 chip.

Its latest step is updating the Microsoft Defender Antivirus so that it automatically mitigates CVE-2021-26855 which is the most critical vulnerability among the four. Since it serves as the entry point to be able to exploit the three other flaws preventing perpetrators from being able to take advantage of it takes priority. Customers don't need to do anything for Defender to start protecting their servers from attackers — that is other than installing the latest security intelligence update if they don't have automatic updates turned on.

The tech giant warns however that this is just an interim mitigation meant to protect customers while they're in the midst of implementing the comprehensive security update for Exchange it released earlier this month. While the original patches could be a bit complicated to deploy Microsoft has also released a ""one-click"" mitigation tool for small companies that's relatively easier use. The tool can mitigate against known attacks that exploit CEV-2021-26855 scan Exchange servers and attempt to reverse any changes made by the threats it identifies.

When Microsoft announced the patches for the Exchange vulnerabilities it said most of the attacks that exploited the flaws were carried out by a Chinese state-sponsored group called Hafnium. It's believed that the group infiltrated at least 30000 organizations in the US including police departments hospitals government agencies banks and credit unions. Other groups may have also exploited the vulnerabilities though including the ransomware gang that's reportedly holing Acer data hostage for $50 million."

(CN) --- If you leave Los Angeles by boat and head due west for the Hawaiian Islands about halfway you will reach The Great Pacific Garbage Patch a collection of floating trash comprised primarily of discarded plastic.

The rotation gyre of discarded rubbish has grown exponentially increasing ten-fold every single decade since 1945 to its present dimensions of 600000 square miles or roughly the size of Alaska. It weighs an estimated 87000 tons.

Despite images conjured in the press the giant floating garbage patch is difficult to detect. It was only discovered in the 1990s. You can’t spot it from satellites and it’s even difficult to espy from a boat.

Its relative inscrutability is due to the fact that it is composed primarily of plastic which continues to break down into smaller and smaller particles eventually lingering in the environment as microplastics. But plastic products which are nonbiodegradable never completely vanish.

Instead the microplastics accumulate in the ecology and often end up in the digestive systems of wildlife accrue in large oceanic gyres like The Great Pacific Garbage Patch or wash up along pristine beaches the world over sullying the ecological and aesthetic components of some of the globe’s most scenic places.

While many of the solutions proffered by various organizations focus on the technological innovations that make clean-up possible there is an environmental organization that has undertaken a novel approach to combating the scourge of global plastic pollution.

Earth Island Institute a Berkeley Calif.-based environmental nonprofit sued a collection of the world’s largest food beverage and consumer goods companies saying their use of millions of tons of plastic packaging has resulted in polluted oceans waterways and beaches.

“This is the first of what I believe will be a wave of lawsuits seeking to hold the plastics industry accountable for the unprecedented mess in our oceans” said Josh Floum Earth Island Institute’s Board President. “These plastics peddlers knew that our nation’s disposal and recycling capabilities would be overrun and their products would end up polluting our waterways.”

The lawsuit names Crystal Geyser Water Company The Clorox Company The Coca-Cola Company Pepsico Inc. Nestlé USA Inc. Mars Incorporated Danone North America Mondelez International Inc. Colgate-Palmolive Company and The Procter & Gamble Company as defendants.

But the novel legal theory at the heart of the case delves deeper than merely suing the above-named companies for plastic production; instead the Earth Island Institute has predicated its complaint on the little recycle symbol the companies place visibly on each plastic product.

“The misrepresentation claims are premised on the fact that when consumers see the recycle symbol on the plastic packaging they think that when they put it in a little blue bin it will be recycled” Noor Rahman an attorney for Earth Island told Courthouse News in a recent interview. “But 90% of the time it can’t be.”

Rahman said the general public is likely unaware that less than 10% of the plastics that are collected for the purpose of recycling are actually used as material to make recycled products most likely because the companies in question have been successful at marketing recycling as an environmental solution to single-use plastics.

“The way they’ve marketed their products has resulted in the mass proliferation of excessive volumes of plastic” Rahman said.

The problem has only increased since the advent of the coronavirus.

During the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 plastic manufacturers made about 129 billion face masks and 65 billion pairs of plastic gloves every month. Gloves and masks ended up in the ocean in large amounts where marine mammals and fish easily mistake the spindly items for jellyfish and other prey.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Glenn Darden's Baby Doll bested 29 other teams to secure the 2021 J/22 Midwinter Championship hosted by Southern Yacht Club in New Orleans LA.

All nine scheduled races were completed in mostly breezy and lumpy conditions on Lake Pontchartrain.

Company Overview

The app economy is one of the fastest-growing markets today with millions of apps available to billions of users who spend 83% of their time on mobile devices inside apps. Within the app economy games are the leading category of apps accounting for the majority of apps in the Apple App Store in 2020 according to Statista and ironSource has established a strong leadership position within this category focusing its product development and innovation on building core infrastructure serving mobile game developers.

ironSource powers the business growth of 87% of the top 100 games and has been ranked multiple times as one of the top 3 platforms for driving both quality and scaled user growth by leading industry indexes. In addition 14 of the 19 games published through the ironSource platform were ranked in the top 10 most downloaded games on either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store over the course of 2020 and one of them – Join Clash – was the most downloaded game in the world in February 2021.

""Our solutions cover the entire game growth cycle from growing your user base to generating revenue to reinvest in growth and then analyzing and optimizing the entire cycle to drive profitability"" said Omer Kaplan CRO and co-founder of ironSource. ""Using our platform game developers are able to unlock a flywheel of continuous growth and since our business model is aligned with our customer's success as they grow we do too. While this cycle is most often leveraged by mobile games it's easily transferable to apps outside of gaming and today 16% of our customers with more than $100000 of annual revenue are already from industries beyond games.""

The ironSource platform is made up of two solution suites ironSource Sonic (""Sonic"") and ironSource Aura (""Aura"").

""The Aura solution suite represents a unique value-add for developers allowing them to get their apps discovered on millions of devices worldwide"" said Arnon Harish President and co-founder of ironSource. ""Equally important however is our ability to help telecom operators with digital transformation enabling them to engage their users throughout the lifecycle of the device. By leveraging ironSource's core capabilities around content monetization and user engagement we were able to quickly build and deploy a solution suite for telecom operators that allows them to more fully participate in the app economy.""

The combination of these two solution suites serves to differentiate the ironSource platform making it the most comprehensive app business platform in the market and underpinning its market leadership. That market leadership makes ironSource the de facto choice for customers looking to grow their app and the breadth of its solutions means developers of all sizes and at all stages of growth have a way to leverage the platform. Once a developer starts working with ironSource they typically expand their use to multiple solutions within the platform driving a high dollar-based net expansion rate and gross customer retention rate.

""This is a very proud moment for us at Viola and for me personally. A company where we were the first investors thrives and goes public as one of the largest public tech companies in Israeli history"" said Shlomo Dovrat co-founder of Viola Ventures and board member at ironSource. ""We look forward to continuing to work with the amazing founding team of ironSource on their incredible journey.""

Low-level employees grouse that the chief executive makes them work around the clock through the pandemic to keep up with deal flow. White-shoe investment bankers complain that they get blasted when they miss out on business.

He uses the corporate jet to travel to his mansion in the Bahamas even as he indulges in hobbies that include pricey wines kitesurfing and DJing at nightclubs — all the while demanding that his people get back to the office as the COVID pandemic subsides.

And if you’re a Goldman associate and see him having lunch at some restaurant in the Hamptons don’t make the mistake (as one poor sap did) of stopping by to say hello. He will probably chew you out because in his worldview Goldman execs are supposed to eat only what they kill.

Yes he’s hated in many parts of Goldman’s sprawling empire on Wall Street — and it doesn’t matter. Solomon is becoming a much-beloved leader with another more important constituency: his investors.

These headlines (including an amazing story in Bloomberg detailing the plane use and the lunch incident on top of The Post’s coverage of Goldman first-year analysts’ grueling 100-hour work weeks) have been making the rounds and stoking considerable schadenfreude in C-suites across Wall Street.

But the Solomon-hating hasn’t halted Goldman’s strong performance or its surging stock price.

Shares are up 132 percent over the past year compared with the 84 percent surge of banking giant JPMorgan the gold standard of Wall Street and the 62 percent spike in the S&P 500 index of big company stocks.

Only Morgan Stanley which has been on a buying binge of expansion is doing better with its stock surging 168 percent since last year.

Of course it’s hard not to make money on Wall Street in times like these. With the Fed keeping interest rates low and printing the currency at a feverish pace lower borrowing costs make it easier for Goldman to finance trades. Cheap money has led to a flood of stock and bond offerings for Goldman to underwrite.

Shares of blue-chip companies like Goldman and not-so-blue-chip ones like GameStop will go up when rates are so low because there’s no place else to park cash and earn a decent return.

Even so Solomon is quietly earning kudos for execution. The firm he inherited from the allegedly nicer Lloyd Blankfein in 2018 was profitable but over time became far less so. It fell under scrutiny for not matching its archrival Morgan Stanley in expanding into wealth and asset management.

It was slow going for Solomon at first. He was said to have considered a deal to merge with US Bancorp — a foray into commercial banking to look more like powerhouse JPM. The idea fizzled over control issues (Goldman’s market cap was lower and Solomon would have had to relinquish control.) Goldman’s stock sputtered. In 2020 things began to turn. Goldman recently announced that trading revenues hit a 10-year high last year matching those produced during the halcyon days under Blankfein just before financial-crisis regulations made it difficult to take balance-sheet risk.

Likewise investment-banking revenues hit new records; Solomon a dealmaker himself has retained Goldman’s long-held status as the go-to adviser on M&A.

“Solomon took over Goldman when it was a mess” veteran bank analyst Dick Bove recently told Lydia Moynihan of Fox Business.

“He knew exactly what he was doing and he made Goldman one of the most exciting companies in America.”

The big question on Wall Street is: Will Solomon’s mojo last? Probably. The Fed shows no signs of letting up on printing money which is usually good for banks. Unless it leads to massive inflation and higher interest rates which could crush stocks and make financing trades more costly.

Meanwhile the surging trading and I-banking revenues many bank experts believe continue to paper over blind spots in Goldman’s business model: It’s still largely a two-trick pony of investment banking and trading. It has a smallish consumer-banking division known as Marcus which five years into the experiment still loses money.

That’s why all signs are pointing to Solomon’s investment banking instincts kicking in soon. Goldman’s market value of $119 billion has now exceeded US Bancorp’s so maybe that deal is heading back on the table. Maybe it will make a run at PNC another largish bank that could give Goldman a competitive edge versus JPM and Morgan Stanley. Goldman could use its currency to buy a bunch of smaller banks or an asset manager.

One thing is certain: If Solomon keeps doing what’s he’s doing he’s going to be calling the shots for some time no matter how difficult he is to deal with.

“The fact he wants to use the company jet as his private plane — so what?” says Bove. “No one is going to get rid of the guy with the golden touch.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjEva25vd2JlNC1nb2luZy1wdWJsaWMtYXMtY2xlYXJ3YXRlci1maXJtLWFpbXMtZm9yLTEwMC1taWxsaW9uLWlwby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KnowBe4 going public as Clearwater firm aims for $100 million IPO,"CLEARWATER — The cybersecurity firm KnowBe4 is going public and wants to raise $100 million.

The company filed a document Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that it has filed an initial public offering in the U.S.

KnowBe4 is valued at about $1 billion and has just over 1000 employees most of whom work in the firm’s downtown Clearwater headquarters.

The company has reported jumps in revenue over the past three years: $71.3 million in 2018 $120.6 million in 2019 and $174.9 million last year.

The lead underwriters are Morgan Stanley & Co. Goldman Sachs BofA Securities and KKR Capital Markets. The Tampa Bay Business Journal which first broke the story reported that KKR invested $300 million into KnowBe4 in 2019.

A KnowBe4 company spokeswoman said Saturday that the company would not comment about the initial public offering or IPO which allows investors and the public to buy shares. The company did not disclose how many shares will be offered or at what price.

KnowBe4 will be listed on the Nasdaq using the symbol “KNBE.”

CEO Stu Sjouwerman (pronounced shower-man) founded KnowBe4 in 2010 to tackle cybersecurity from the human side of the equation.

Companies hire his firm to train their employees to recognize and resist social engineering: when hackers use fake emails texts and voicemails to manipulate and trick an organization’s staff into giving up passwords and credentials that could be used to access networks.

“In effect by targeting human behavior rather than infrastructure social engineering attacks can be utilized by attackers to circumvent multiple layers of security” the company wrote in its SEC filing.

The company said more than 31000 entities use its security awareness training which can simulate phishing and other attacks that could leave companies vulnerable to hacking data theft and ransomware.

The Tampa Bay region is home to a growing cybersecurity and technology sector. Aside from KnmowBe4 cybersecurity firms like ReliaQuest and A-LIGN also operate locally and in January OPSWAT announced that it was moving its headquarters from San Francisco to Tampa.

Rebecca and Stu Sjouwerman are also philanthropists who have cut big checks to support community projects.

In November the couple pledged to donate $2 million to help Pinellas County meet the $10 million asking price to buy and preserve 44 acres once owned by philanthropist Gladys Douglas. The Dunedin property is at the top of Pinellas County’s preservation list but is coveted by developers.

After peaking on Feb. 19 2020 the S&P 500 dropped to 66% of its peak by March 23. The market has since recovered with the S&P 500 reaching 115% of the pre-crisis peak on Feb. 19 of this year. However the recovery has been highly uneven across sectors. Some recovered quickly while others are still below pre-COVID-19 levels.

The figure below shows how various sectors have performed since the 2020 peak with each sector normalized to 100 on Feb. 19 2020 for comparison.

Hardest Hit Sectors

The sectors that were hit the worst initially were energy industrials and financials with low points of 44% 58% and 57% of their index level on Feb. 19 2020 respectively. Regarding the energy sector specifically COVID-19 shutdowns pushed oil demand down in turn pushing down oil prices and oil company stock prices. As of Feb. 19 the sector had still only recovered to 84% of its level a year earlier.

Other sectors that had not yet recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels were utilities and real estate which were at 88% and 93% of their level on Feb. 19.

Sectors Faring the Best

During the initial market drop in March the health care and consumer staples sectors fared the best with low points of 72% and 76% of their level on Feb. 19 2020 respectively. The consumer staples sector includes goods and services that are viewed as necessities—such as groceries and nondurable household goods—and typically performs relatively well during recessions. Similarly it is no surprise that the health care sector fared well during a pandemic-induced recession.

Since the initial drop the strongest recoveries have been in the information technology consumer discretionary and materials sectors with index values at 133% 130% and 124% of the pre-crisis level. Many companies in the information technology sector—such as Amazon and Microsoft—benefited from the pandemic. The consumer discretionary sector—which covers goods and services that are considered nonessential such as apparel restaurants and automobiles—dropped more than the consumer staples sector at the beginning of the pandemic but has since performed well as economic conditions improved.

To sum up although aggregate market indexes such as the S&P 500 have fully recovered since the beginning of the pandemic not all sectors have performed equally well. Vaccine distribution and the lifting of pandemic restrictions will likely aid the remaining sectors to return to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Powell’s Fed Message Dot Plot Quadruple Witching

The U.S Federal Reserve did nothing unexpected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell continued to project near-zero interest rates at least through 2023 during its March meeting on Wednesday despite the mounting inflation worries in financial markets. Massive fiscal support and widening vaccinations have buoyed expectations that easy credit will overheat the economy such that rate hikes may need to happen sooner than later. However Powell who is not an economist was not unduly concerned by the rising yields and indicated that the Fed would not use economic forecasts to change policy pre-emptively but would want to see actual data instead. The danger with this approach is that real time data is not necessarily correct.

The new dot plot of interest rate forecasts submitted by each of Fed’s eighteen policy makers also showed seven officials forecasting a rate increase by 2023 although Powell intentionally downplayed the policy signals afterwards and made clear that the guidance resides with him.

Despite the dovishness Fed officials are growing more upbeat on the economy and upgraded GDP growth forecasts to 6.5% this year up from a prior projection of 4.2%. Stock markets were relatively flat this week as investors took the chance to recalibrate expectations with quadruple witching on Friday (3rd Friday of every quarter) where all four asset classes – stock index futures stock index options stock futures and stock options expired simultaneously.

U.S and China ‘Talk’ in Alaska

The first face-to-face meeting between the U.S and China since Biden administration took place in Alaska on Thursday. The 2-day meeting quickly escalated to a confrontational session with a strong smell of gunpowder as the top diplomats criticized each other over everything from trade to human rights. U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Beijing of undermining global stability while his counterpart Yang Jiechi replied that the U.S was not “qualified to speak to China from a position of strength.” The bickering appeared to be intentional for their domestic consumption on both sides as Biden seeks to display his tough stance on China to his supporters while Xi Jinping needs to satisfy his own increasingly nationalistic population. Following their initial exchange the delegates had several rounds of closed-door talks although it was unclear if the private discussions were more productive. As the two largest economies strive for a balance between conflict competition and cooperation there is a lot more work needed given that the relationship has deteriorated rapidly under Donald Trump.

What is NFT?

NFT stands for non-fungible token. In economics a fungible asset is something with units that can be readily interchanged – like money and if something is non-fungible it means that it has unique properties such that it cannot be interchanged with something else for example drawings and music. Although they have no tangible form of their own NFTs are “one-of-a-kind” assets in the digital world which they can be thought of as certificates of ownership for the “original” work. In recent weeks there have been a lot of excitement around using tech to sell digital art fuelling multi-million dollars sales. Twitter’s founder Jack Dorsey also hopped on the bandwagon and received $2.5m for his tweet sale. Only time will tell if NFT is a worthless magic bean that is sold for money.

According to a recent report by New Frontier Data cannabis sales in the U.S. are expected to grow by 21% annually between 2019 and 2025 ultimately reaching $41.5 billion by mid-decade. Meanwhile cannabis industry analytics company BDSA is looking for Canada to generate as much as $6.4 billion in annual weed sales by 2026 up from $2.6 billion in 2020 sales. Add in Mexico which is now waving the green flag on recreational cannabis and it's easy to see how the North American marijuana market could hit $50 billion in sales by 2025.

With legal cannabis sales expected to grow by a double-digit annualized percentage throughout the decade marijuana stocks are a natural favorite among investors.

Not all cannabis stocks are going to be winners

On the flip side we also know that not every company involved in a next-big-thing investment will be a winner. If you asked me six months ago to rattle off a list of pot stocks worth avoiding I would not have struggled to come up with candidates.

Canadian licensed producer Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) has long been a marijuana stock that I've stressed investors should avoid. Aurora's management team has a nasty habit of relying on its common stock as collateral when making acquisitions and funding its day-to-day operations. Between mid-June 2014 and the end of 2020 Aurora's outstanding share count ballooned by more than 13500%.

To boot Aurora Cannabis isn't anywhere near profitability despite some hefty cost-cutting that's seen facilities closed and jobs lost. Management has also pushed its goal of positive adjusted EBITDA down the line on a number of occasions.

And it's not just Canadian licensed producers that can be bad news for investors. U.S. multistate operator MedMen Enterprises (OTC: MMNFF) has emerged as one of the worst-run cannabis companies. MedMen's previous management proved far too overzealous with the company's expansion plans and wrecked its balance sheet. Without capital infusions from Gotham Green Partners it's unlikely that MedMen would even be solvent today.

Even cash-rich pot stocks would make the list. Despite landing a $1.8 billion equity investment from tobacco giant Altria Group in March 2019 Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON) has mostly been a money pit for investors. It looks to have grossly overpaid to acquire the Lord Jones cannabidiol-based beauty brand in 2019 and its cultivation activity is so minimal relative to its market cap that it only recently had its first quarter of more than $10 million in net sales.

This is the unquestioned worst pot stock you can buy

The point is there are a lot of bad marijuana stocks -- but one stands head and shoulders above the pack. In my view the absolute worst pot stock that money can buy is penny stock Sundial Growers (NASDAQ: SNDL).

Shares of Sundial a Canadian licensed producer are up about 1000% since late October on three developments. First there was the victory of Joe Biden in November and the subsequent retaking of the Senate by Democrats in early January. Democrats have a considerably more favorable view of cannabis than Republicans do making it more likely that we see some sort of cannabis reform enacted at the federal level in the months or years to come. Sundial investors are crossing their fingers for U.S. legalization which would allow all Canadian growers to enter the U.S. weed market.

Second investors seem pleased with Sundial cleaning up its balance sheet. As of March 15 the company had 719 million in Canadian dollars (about $580 million) in unrestricted cash. This implies that Sundial has more than enough capital to execute on its growth initiatives.

And third Sundial has benefited from being a core holding of the retail-investor-focused Reddit frenzy. It's consistently been one of the most short-sold stocks of 2021 making it a perceived candidate for a short squeeze among Reddit traders.

Though all three of these factors explain why Sundial Growers has tacked on a quadruple-digit gain in six months they don't come close to justifying the move.

Before Sundial I thought Aurora Cannabis was one of the worst serial diluters I'd ever seen but Sundial takes the cake. Although I'm still waiting for the company's official share count via its annual report filing in Canada at the time of this writing I'd estimate that following the exercising of 98.3 million warrants last month Sundial has at least 1.66 billion shares outstanding. This implies the company increased its outstanding share count by over 1.15 billion shares in roughly five months. I know its CA$719 million cash figure looks attractive but understand that it's been built by burying its most faithful followers under an avalanche of new stock.

With such overwhelming dilution here are two things to consider. First if and when Sundial does turn the corner to profitability it's going to need to generate CA$17 million in profit (about $13.7 million ) just to produce a single penny in earnings per share. Considering that the company yielded only CA$60.9 million in net sales ($49.1 million) last year it's highly unlikely that we're ever going to see a meaningful per-share profit from Sundial.

Second with the company also having a $1 billion mixed shelf offering at its disposal this dilution is almost assured to continue. The thing to realize is that share price is irrelevant and market cap is what matters. At the moment we're looking at a company with a $2.6 billion (that's U.S.) market cap that didn't even generate $50 million in net sales last year. Sure it may have a share price that's perceived to be low. But investors are paying roughly $2 billion (sans cash) for a company that's nowhere near profitable saw net sales go in reverse in 2020 and continues to dilute its shareholders. In other words Sundial is a good candidate to once again dip well below the $1 minimum share price required for continued listing on the Nasdaq exchange.

Emotions from young retail investors appear to be the only thing keeping Sundial Growers' stock above $1. If investors were to really dig into this company's operating performance and balance sheet I'm convinced they'd come to the same conclusion: Sundial is the absolute worst marijuana stock your money can buy.

Here's The Marijuana Stock You've Been Waiting For

A little-known Canadian company just unlocked what some experts think could be the key to profiting off the coming marijuana boom.



And make no mistake – it is coming.

Benzinga is pointing out some of the biggest names in a series on these ""FinTwit"" influencers.

This time it's ""SPAC King"" Chamath Palihapitiya.

Man Of The People: Like Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Elon Musk Palihapitiya uses Twitter to talk about stocks. His 1.4 million followers are regularly updated on his stock market moves and investment plans.

His advice is sought after for good reason. With a resume that boasts former high-level positions at Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK) Palihapitiya is a CEO venture capitalist special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsor and engineer.

Most famously known as the “King of SPACs” Palihapitiya has brought six companies public under his Social Capital Hedosophia umbrella including Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (NYSE: SPCE) Opendoor Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: OPEN) and most recently Clover Health Investments Corp (NASDAQ: CLOV).

Swaying The Crowd: Palihapitiya's tweets bring him both adoration and criticism. Like Musk he has earned fans with his populist approach and championing of everyday traders. Palihapitiya undoubtedly helped r/WallStreetBets and an army of retail traders fight hedge funds during the GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) mania.

“Lots of $GME talk soooooo.... We bought Feb $115 calls on $GME this morning. Let’s gooooooo!!!!!!!!” he tweeted Jan. 26. He followed that tweet up with “ride or die.”

Palihapitiya is also a big supporter of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) viewed by some as a tool for digital freedom and social justice because it isn’t controlled by government.

“When $BTC gets to $150k I will buy The Hamptons and convert it to sleepaway camps for kids working farms and low-cost housing” he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 30 taking a jab at the exclusive seaside home to some of the wealthiest Americans.

On Mar. 6 when Palihapitiya confirmed on Twitter he’d sold off his personal stake of 6.2 million shares of Virgin Galactic for $21 million in profits the share price of the company fell 36%. His followers were angry and worried he’d lost faith in the company but Palihapitiya took to Twitter to calm their nerves.

“I freed up some capital by selling some shares in $SPCE so I can keep investing at scale without impacting my pace and strategic view” he tweeted.

Palihapitiya is reportedly using the funds for a climate change venture in Britain. Retail investors will be watching closely to see if what's he working on becomes the next biggest thing to invest in.

Navigating Through Headwinds: He also calmed nerves in early February when short seller firm Hindenburg Research released a report criticizing Palihapitiya’s IPOC-Clover Health merger.

“For those following $CLOV trust the process and the facts” he wrote the following day.

The Financial Times took notice.

“He’s managed with poise to straddle a line between televised rants on Wall Street while also shilling risky reverse-mergers to retail investors on an almost bimonthly basis” the paper wrote at the time.

In the past year we’ve seen a massive spike in SPACs as an alternative to traditional IPOs but questions remain about whether they’re a good investment for the public.

What do these 5 people have in common?

Shaquille O’Neal (7’1” NBA legend) Scott Kelly (former astronaut) Paul Ryan (ex-congressman) Serena Williams (one of history’s greatest tennis stars) Bill Ackman (hedge fund billionaire)

Answer: They all have a hand in SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) one of the hottest financial trends on Wall Street.

In the past 15 months SPACs have seen a meteoric rise as an alternative way to take a private company public — one that bypasses many of the legal and regulatory “headaches” of the traditional IPO (initial public offering) process.

By the latest tally SPACs now outnumber traditional IPOs by a factor of 5x.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Many outlets have proclaimed SPACs to be the “new IPO” — and with good reason:

In 2020 248 SPACs went public (a 400%+ increase from 2019) collectively raising $83B from investors.

SPACs went public (a from 2019) collectively raising from investors. Just 3 months into 2021 we’ve already surpassed last year’s figures (275+ SPACs $84B+).

Prominent companies like DraftKings Virgin Galactic and OpenDoor have all used SPACs to go public.

But SPACs — which are generally subject to less regulation than IPOs — have also drawn controversy for the risks they pose to public investors: earlier this week the investment bank UBS banned its financial advisors from recommending SPAC stocks to clients.

What exactly is a SPAC? Why are so many companies choosing to go public via SPACs in lieu of a standard IPO? And how beneficial are they to businesses and investors?

How a standard IPO works

Before we get into SPACs it’s necessary to touch on how a standard IPO typically works.

Let’s say our pal Tony starts a donut shop.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

At first Tony’s happy just running one little shop in California. But his donuts get hyped and people start lining up for blocks to try them.

Tony uses his income to open a 2nd shop then a 3rd and a 4th — each more successful than the last. Eventually he takes some money from private investors and expands to hundreds of locations all over the US.

After years of hard work and luck Tony’s little donut shop becomes a full-fledged corporation with hundreds of employees and $1B in annual revenue.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Tony realizes that he has to raise more capital to sustain his growth. So he decides to take his company public via an IPO.

There are a few different types of IPOs. But if Tony goes the traditional route his company will partner with an “underwriter” (typically an investment bank) to navigate the mountain of legal paperwork regulatory documents and pricing models required to go public.

Usually the simplified process looks something like this:

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Going public offers several obvious advantages:

It allows a business to raise large amounts of capital. It offers a payout for private shareholders. It increases financial transparency and raises public trust.

But there are a few problems with the affair:

It’s pricey. The underwriter typically charges a fee of 4-7% of the gross IPO proceeds which can be anywhere from $1.5m to $100m+ depending on the deal size. Legal accounting printing and regulatory fees can cost millions more. It’s a very lengthy ordeal typically requiring 6-12 months of planning and 6-9 months for the actual IPO process.

The bulk of that time — up to 5 months — is tied up in filing an S-1 the standard registration form required by the SEC. The government often puts applicants through 2-5 rounds of revisions before approval.

An IPO also requires a ton of back-end work for a company like Tony’s Donuts — “roadshows” huge marketing investments and financial disclosures of every imaginable variety (balance sheets cash-flow statements income statements).

The goal of all of this due diligence? To provide as much transparency as possible to the public before they invest.

With an IPO investors know what company they’re betting on and ideally have the necessary information to make an informed buy.

But if Tony decides this process is too tedious he has another option…

Enter the SPAC

Let’s say Tony’s Donuts doesn’t want to mess with all that regulatory oversight. In lieu of an IPO the company might consider a SPAC.

In essence the SPAC process allows a company to bypass the rigmarole of an IPO by merging with a shell company (called a SPAC) that’s already gone public.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

A SPAC can usually get SEC clearance and IPO much faster than an established private company (~2 months) since it doesn’t have any historical financial documents to disclose.

Once public the shell company can take up to 24 months to identify a purchase target — like Tony’s Donuts — and enact a merger.

A SPAC allows a private company to go public in as little as 5-6 months compared to the 1- to 2-year timeline of an IPO.

On paper it can also be a tad cheaper and it offers a company both more flexible negotiation terms and more market certainty.

Sounds pretty decent for Tony’s Donuts…

But is it good for public investors?

When you buy into a SPAC IPO you almost always pay a set price of $10/share and get “warrants” or options to buy more shares in the future at a low price.

As a SPAC IPO investor you’re buying shares in a shell company and hedging a bet that it will merge with a desirable private firm in the future thus boosting the share price.

It’s usually a leap of faith — hence the moniker “blank check company.”

Most SPACs offer little insight into the companies they plan to merge with. Investors may be told something extremely general like “our focus will be on the technology industry in Southeast Asia or the United States.”

A SPAC filed in February 2021 uses typically vague language: “We have not selected any business combination target…[and] we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.” (Filing via SEC.gov; graphic: The Hustle)

The “blind” nature of these investments — and the reduced regulatory oversight they’re subject to — has drawn criticism that SPACs pose more dangers for retail investors than typical IPOs.

One case study frequently cited is Nikola Motors Co. which went public via a SPAC in June 2020 and shot up to as high as $66/share before allegations of fraud tanked the stock to $14.

As The Hustle has written SPACs have also attracted controversy for giving long-term revenue projections — something that’s strongly discouraged in the traditional IPO process.

But SPACs pay off? Like most stocks results are mixed.

A Bloomberg analysis of 24 SPAC stocks that went public between January 2019 and February 2021 found that more than half depreciated in value 1 month after a merger was announced.

Research by Bain has shown similar outcomes: a review of 121 SPACs showed that 60% underperformed the S&P 500 post-merger.

Data via Bloomberg Law; graphic: Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Among Bloomberg’s sample size of SPACs the average return was 22.9%. By comparison in 2020:

The S&P 500 index saw a gain of + 18.4%

Nasdaq saw a gain of + 43.6%

Traditional IPOs saw an average gain of +75%

If we examine longer-term data the results are a bit more sobering.

A study of 93 SPACs that went public between 2015 and 2020 found that common shares posted an average loss of -9.6% (vs. a 37.2% average return for traditional IPOs). Less than one-third of SPACs were in the green.

As Tony would say that’s a big ol’ donut hole.

Analysts and famous hedge fund managers are becoming unequivocal in their warnings that tech stocks are overpriced and inflating the already soaring valuations of the broader market affirming the fears that we might be in a bubble. Billionaire David Einhorn of Greenglight Capital recently said in his letter to investors that tech stocks without strong fundamentals are in an “enormous bubble.” The billionaire believes the mania we saw in the tech IPO landscape in the midst of the pandemic huge market caps soaring valuations and rising speculative instruments all confirm his theory that we are in a bubble.

The warning signs indicating the possibility that we could be in a bubble right now are plenty. Citigroup's famous “panic/euphoria” index – metrics of the index include NYSE short interest ratio margin debt Nasdaq daily volume composite average of Investors Intelligence and the American Association of Individual Investors bullishness data the put/call ratio the CRB futures index gas prices the ratio of price premiums in puts versus calls – currently reads its highest value on record.

Tech stocks are however starting to face signs of a correction. The NASDAQ slipped 3% on March 18 its biggest decline since February 25 as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasuries surpassed 1.75% and touched its 14-month high. Tech stocks belong to the category of growth stocks whose value recede when yields rise as tech stocks imply earnings far from the future.

One of the most shocking examples of the current market euphoria is Hertz Global shares rising after the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020.

The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Cailin Birch said in a report that investors have started to expect that the Fed and the Congress will “keep coming to the rescue with ever more stimulus.” However the analyst believes these programs only help the Wall Street and have “no positive spillover for Main Street.”

""The risk of an asset bubble bursting has risen significantly"" Birch noted.

From major news networks to morning talk shows and YouTube videos the public eye couldn’t look away from the exposé on what previously had only been rumor mill. Having been in my senior year of high school at the time it felt like an extra punch in the gut to learn about the sketchy “side doors” that the children of America’s elite used to blissfully enter the top institutions in the country while my classmates comforted each other through rejection as acceptance rates plummeted.

With college decision season upon us the 2019 college admissions scandal still seems very relevant. Apparently Netflix thought so too releasing “Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal” on Wednesday and allowing viewers to understand exactly how Rick Singer the operator behind the scandal managed to get hundreds of students into these universities for years and how the scheme fell apart.

Before we dive into the shocking details of the operation the style of the documentary should be noted. Director Chris Smith responsible for “Fyre” the exposé of the Fyre Festival scam and quarantine favorite “Tiger King” combines the information and cutaways of a classic documentary with narrative style that’s reminiscent of Netflix’s “Social Dilemma.” Alongside interviews from college counselors attorneys and the very people involved in the scandal Smith includes sequences of an actor who plays Rick Singer to give us a glimpse into how his “side door” process worked in real time. The script is directly taken from wiretapped phone calls he made with his clients.

The documentary begins with clips presumably taken from university YouTube channels of college acceptance reactions to represent students whose hard work earned them spots for the following academic year’s first year class at NYU Fordham Brown and UC Berkeley to name a few. Next clips of reactions to the admissions scandal news sets the stage for Singer played by “Stranger Things” actor Matthew Modine to explain his operation. In Singer’s terminology students usually have two ways of getting into a university: the front door a.k.a based on the merit of their application and the age-old back door practice of donating millions of dollars to a university as leverage. While the back door is certainly problematic it is legal because there is no guarantee of acceptance. Of course few universities that receive a check for millions of dollars will deny the child of said donor which Smith makes clear with his example of Jared Kushner but according to Singer this back door can cost $10-20 million at minimum and technically a child could still be rejected. Meanwhile Singer would charge a fraction of the cost ($100000-$500000) for guaranteed admission through what he labeled “side doors.” This illegal method consisted of fraudulent bribes and corroboration with the athletic departments at prestigious universities. Singer created a network with coaches and athletic-admissions liaisons who he would pay to vouch for his clients’ children to gain admission to schools that they had neither the academic credentials nor athletic abilities to get in by themselves.

According to the documentary parents collectively paid Singer approximately $25 million between 2011 and 2018. To make matters worse these transactions were considered as tax write-offs because Singer had created a fake nonprofit that claimed to serve underprivileged kids but in reality the foundation served the purpose of helping affluent families take acceptance spots while simultaneously receiving tax deductions.

Singer began his practice as an independent college counselor in Sacramento in the 1990s. In the beginning he really did serve the traditional role of reading students’ essays and working on their applications. However educators who knew him back then claim he was always looking to cheat sometimes by lying about students’ race and ethnicities on applications. After initial success he moved to Newport Beach CA to begin what would become the biggest scam in college admissions history and remain undetected for decades.

The documentary is not afraid to name drop-—-after all that’s what the majority of viewers want to know: how this happened and who participated in it. Most of the conversations between Singer take place with business executives such as Bill McGlashan of private equity firm TPG Capital wine mogul Agustin Huneeus and Hot Pocket heiress Michelle Janavs. Fortunately for them these corporate leaders flew under the radar with the general public who instead focused on the names they could put a face to: Influencer Olivia Giannulli (known as Olivia Jade) and her parents Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli and actress Felicity Huffman. These two families took the brunt of the scandal in terms of media coverage because they were already recognizable to the average American. As the face of the scandal Netflix would be remiss without including a segment of YouTube star Olivia Jade. While she certainly had an impressive social media presence Olivia would have been only known by her fans a niche market of those who enjoy beauty fashion and lifestyle videos (vlogs). Unfortunately the unlimited access to her insanely privileged lifestyle that attributed to her success in the first place made it all too easy for reporters and outraged high school students to unleash their wrath.

Smith introduces Olivia with a brutal juxtaposition between a rejected student who says with tears in her eyes “I know the people that got in are super deserving” and cuts to a clip of curling her eyelashes and going to parties. It becomes very clear that Olivia couldn’t care less about her education and actually begs to drop out of high school but her parents insist that she attend the University of Southern California (which had an 11.4 percent acceptance rate in 2018 the year she was accepted). While Olivia played an important role in the scandal—the documentary actually reveals a transcript that makes it clear she knew about the scheme—the focus of the documentary is on the parents who participated in it.

“The parents are applying to college and the kid is the vehicle through which they apply to college” independent education consultant Perry Kalmus said in the documentary.

These parents and most parents take personal pride in the college choices of their children and want them to attend the most prestigious universities in the country even if they weren’t qualified applicants. Even parents of those that were qualified such as Huffman’s daughter Sophia Macy who recently got accepted to Carnegie Mellon by her own merit were told that their children had zero chance of acceptance by Singer. Many children like Macy had no idea that their parents didn’t believe in them because Singer made it possible for their test scores to be changed after they took standardized tests like the SATs and ACT. According to the documentary parents were willing to pay up to $75000 for a test. In order to take the test privately or with extra time students falsified the need for accommodations reserved for those with learning disabilities.

Ultimately Operation Varsity Blues came to an end not because of a slip up in the scheme but because an outsider arrested for an unrelated securities charge ratted out former Yale soccer coach Rudy Meredith who exposed Singer. The charges against his impressive clientele is what broke the story as the seemingly untouchable elite were greeted by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials at their doors.

The documentary ended with a Great Gatsby-esque monoloque in which participants received minor charges and sentences yet the public was expected to be grateful for the “little bit of justice being served in a sea of injustice.” It was saddening to hear some of the dialogue from these individuals as they openly admitted to not caring about the morality component of their actions. Furthermore it was disheartening to witness the lengths these parents these adults would go through and the things they would say about their own children just to have them attend a name brand education. According to Kalmus a parent made a call the very week the story broke to see if he could pay $10 million to get his child into Harvard.

The fact of the matter is that the scandal simply made some ugly realities public and made universities that much more careful in dealing with the upper echelon of society. Many coaches embroiled in the inner workings of Singer’s scheme kept their jobs and some including Singer have yet to deal with any repercussions as they await their ruling. In my opinion Smith did a great job at peppering in the harsh realities of the American education system as an increasingly sought after commodity with prestigious universities depicted as an exclusive product and status symbol rather than the focus on the education itself. A former Stanford admissions counselor admitted to the falsehood behind the college ranking system created in the 80s and how there already exist so many advantages to those with more financial capital. From exclusive “country club” sports to the ability to afford private test prep the inequality between applicants increases and so does the entitlement. Smith does not play the blame game but instead highlights some very important problems including the pressure put on high school students massive wealth disparities fundamental flaws in the admissions process and more.

In light of the scandal and now this documentary it is easy to feel defeated by the college admissions process. However as attendees of such a prestigious and interdependently exclusive university it does its job of forcing us to think critically about the extent to which we can attribute merit to our path towards higher education. Vanderbilt’s early decision acceptance rate fell to 18.1 percent in 2021 and regular decision results will be released on April 1. To our knowledge the university was not implicated in Operation Varsity Blues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50cnlsaXZpbmcuY29tL2xpZmUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9nMzU4NDQwODIvY291bnRyeS1jb21mb3J0LW5ldGZsaXgtY2FzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Country Comfort' Cast - Who Are the Characters in Netflix's 'Country Comfort',"Netflix's Country Comfort is the feel-good family comedy we could all use right about now. The show follows Bailey (Katharine McPhee) as a down-on-her-luck country singer who lands on the doorstep of a widowed rancher and his five children only to be roped in to a job as their nanny. Bailey is unqualified for the position and makes some questionable (at best) decisions as the kids' caretaker but she has a big heart and quickly finds herself becoming a part of the family. As you binge-watch the 10-episode season which is full of heartfelt moments along with laugh-out-loud funny ones you'll likely find yourself wondering where you've seen some of the actors before. Netflix has not renewed the show (yet!) but after that season 1 ending we certainly hope to see more of Bailey Beau and the kids very soon.

The show features some familiar faces as well as some newcomers.

We seem to get a new email every day about it chatter has swirled on social media and I was even interviewed by a local college student writing an article for the Boston Globe about the show’s local flavor.

The big question seems to be: Is Wellsbury a thinly veiled reference to Wellesley? Or maybe a mash-up of Wellesley and Sudbury or West Newbury? An important and insightful Marie Claire article asks: “Is Wellsbury from Ginny & Georgia a Real Place?”

With my TV focus revolving around sports and movies I’m not the target audience for this show. Netflix’s description of what had been its #1 show since bumped to #2 is “Free-spirited Georgia and her two kids Ginny and Austin move north in search of a fresh start but find that the road to new beginnings can be bumpy.”

I’d heard enough about the drama-comedy-romance to know it’s seen by many as a newfangled Gilmore Girls the popular 2000-2007 show about a mom and her precocious teen-age daughter. I never did get around to watching that one. So I’m pretty much unqualified to review Ginny & Georgia and won’t attempt to do so. I know plenty of people including locals are enjoying it and could do a better job as critic.

But I’ve taken a peek at the show in the spirit of half-assed research and keeping up on all things Swellesley. I watched the first 20 or so minutes of episode one and a couple of weeks later skipped through most of episode four to watch a scene about a school auction that I heard smacked of Wellesley.

My first impression watching the mom and her two kids driving down a thoroughfare sandwiched between fancy and uniformly designed shops was that they were in the South or maybe Cape Cod. Wellesley Square’s largely hodgepodge shopping district architecture looks nothing like that to me. The houses didn’t scream Wellesley to me either.

I will say the hyper-organized school parents rang familiar and the auction scene during which two mothers bid thousands of dollars to have their kids become Principal for a Day gave me flashbacks to my first Hunnewell auction and its opening bids in the hundreds for a collage made by elementary school kids.

One Swellesley reader a former Wellesley resident who reached out to make sure we knew about Wellsbury said “I could only make it through 45 minutes but I agree on the school moms.”

Given that the show’s creator Sarah Lampert went to school in Newton it’s not farfetched to think she borrowed from Wellesley though one local blogger says the scene is obviously based on Newton itself. The show was largely filmed in Canada and references to Newton and Brookline are made during the shows.

One Swellesley reader a mom of three young children wrote to us: “My husband and I have enjoyed watching it so far and can’t help but notice the similarities to our town.”

I pressed the resident who asked not to be identified on what makes the show feel like it’s situated here.

“Besides its name Wellsbury’s similarities to Wellesley don’t stem from the filming location as it clearly wasn’t filmed in our town. However the show captures the essence of Wellesley—quaint pristine and uppity. Although there is a coffee shop that is prominent throughout the show that seems visually reminiscent of Altra Strada. The coffee shop has brick walls and it’s a popular meeting place for the Wellsbury residents.”

She also cited Wellsbury’s annual festival (similar to Wellesley’s Wonderful Weekend?) a popular country club and residents who compete to decorate their houses for Halloween. And about that auction scene:

“You’ll have to watch the episode but found it to be hysterical and so on point. They end up allowing both moms to win much to the chagrin of the mom who originally outbid the other thinking she was the winner. I can’t tell you how many local fundraisers I’ve been to where this has happened.”

The show has been a fun distraction for the woman and her husband during the pandemic.

“I’m looking forward to watching what happens” she says. “So far I’ve enjoyed noticing the similarities of Wellsbury to Wellesley and laughing about them and us!”

People in parts of Sydney’s northwest were ordered to flee their houses in the middle of the night on Sunday as heavy rains continued to batter Australia’s east coast triggering floods that caused widespread destruction throughout the region.

Authorities issued flooding risk and evacuation warnings in about 12 areas in the state of New South Wales (NSW) of which Sydney is the capital and warned of a potentially “life-threatening” situation in the region.

Dean Storey assistant commissioner at NSW’s State Emergency Services said people living in evacuation zones “must leave immediately”.

“This is a very serious situation” he said. “All communities need to be aware of their risk and plan and prepare accordingly.”

The orders came as the Warragamba Dam which provides much of the drinking water for Sydney spilled over on Saturday afternoon causing water levels to rise along the Nepean and Hawkesbury rivers.

Gladys Berejiklian the premier of NSW called the flooding a “one-in-100-year event”.

“While we don’t think things will worsen on the mid-North Coast definitely conditions will continue” she told a news conference.

Another 4000 people may be asked to leave their homes in the coming days she added.

The Bureau of Meteorology said the heavy downpour is set to continue for the rest of Sunday in Sydney and throughout the state with some areas expected to get up to 200mm (7.9 inches) of rain.

Emergency services said they had received about 600 calls overnight asking for help; more than 60 of those were pleas for rescue from floods.

Television and social media footage showed fast-moving water unmooring houses engulfing roads knocking down trees and damaging road infrastructure.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison lamented the “absolutely heart-breaking scenes” on Saturday and offered troops to help with the emergency effort.

Not long ago Nike produced an Air Force 1 shaped homage to “Indigo.” And though unique and novel at the time the pair was but a drop in the hat of a collection still growing to this day. Here we’re witnessing a new iteration on the aforementioned pair’s design with elements now shifted or entirely removed.

At a glance though the pair may seem near identical. The upper is still composed primarily of white canvas cork still outfits the counter and recycled rubbers support underfoot; even the Swoosh bears the same shade of light blue. But in the more minute details the tweaks are quite evident. The indigo embroideries now sit atop the side profile a more forward-facing spot relative to its previous tongue placement. As such a more standard woven label takes up that location matching the equally ordinary Nike Air that replaces the heel tab’s descriptive text.

Grab a close-up look at these via the official images below. A release is likely to hit Nike.com and select retailers soon.

Given that he now plays alongside two-time champion Kevin Durant he’ll now be paying homage to the Nike KD 4 “Weatherman” — a colorway that originally launched in 2011 which was inspired by Durant’s desire to become a weatherman had he not been an NBA player — through this forthcoming Kyrie 7 colorway.

To translate the Slim Reaper’s offering from 10 years ago Nike calls upon a bold green hue to take over the mesh netting that covers the side paneling toe boxes shoe laces and tongues. This comes complemented with volt patterns that lie beneath the aforementioned mesh in addition to notes of black that spill over the Kyrie tongue logos Swoosh outlines forefoot eye stays eyelets nearest the ankle and the all-seeing eye/”7” embroidery that graces the rear. The “7” accent here is clearly utilized to reflect Irving’s seventh signature shoe but it’s also a coincidence that this also happens to be Durant‘s jersey number with the Brooklyn Nets.

From there the topographic heat map patterns enliven the the heel counters and interior lining. Moreover the insoles split between a “The Forecast Calls For A Thunder Storm” hit on the left side while the right side prints out lightning bolt cloud and sun icons.

A release date for the Nike Kyrie 7 “Weatherman” is still unknown but it’s likely that that they’ll drop via Nike SNKRS and select retailers in the coming months for $130 USD.

The British rapper dropped an Air Max 97 BW and Air Max Deluxe in 2018 and then a Shox TL in 2019. Last year marked a hiatus for Skepta’s Nike collabs but now he’s back with his best shoe since their partnership began.

Skepta used his Instagram story to tease his take on the Air Max Tailwind V a silhouette Nike brought back last year and has since pushed modestly. Under his direction the nearly 21-year-old sneaker is made over with chrome and iridescent detailing and a bright blue upper that sits at the intersection of marbling and tie-dye.

In the photos Skepta shared he’s wearing his Tailwind Vs along with cuffed jogging pants for an ideal Roadman pairing. Last year rumors indicated the shoe would release in early 2020 — and once it does drop a lot of people will be saying “This trainer is gully innit?”

Skepta on Instagram

Beef up on the Tailwind V — Nike’s Tailwind series is among its most perplexing as there’s little in common for the original and its successors. The very first Tailwind released in 1979 and is often overlooked as the first Nike shoe to feature Air cushioning. It looked a lot like the Cortez and an update to the silhouette wouldn’t come until 1992.

Besides the name the Air Tailwind 92 may as well have been a completely different shoe. Upon its introduction its Air technology was not visible and it bore a shape much more in line with sneakers of the era than the shoe that preceded it. With wavy lines and largely neon colors new Tailwind sneakers would release on a yearly basis until the Tailwind V arrived in 2000.

While not as heralded as the Tailwind IV the Tailwind V is known for putting a quilted pattern on the upper with a hard “V” cage that sits underneath the collar and splits the shoe into two distinct halves. It would be the last Tailwind released until 2009 when Nike relaunched the series as Tailwind+.

Skepta

No quilts for Skepta — Skepta’s Tailwind V differentiates itself by putting cage-like paneling atop the upper without a blocky quilted pattern like the original or the wavier stitching that Nike has used since bringing back the sneaker last year. Like his previous sneakers it also gets special “Sk Air” branding.

The sneaker was originally slated to release last year but COVID-19 forced Nike to delay it. And while we still don’t know how much longer until the release one thing’s clear: Skepta’s Tailwind V was worth the wait."

The combined entity will be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC).

CP and KCS described the $US 29bn as “enterprise value” that includes the assumption of $US 3.8bn of outstanding KCS debt. The transaction which has the unanimous support of both boards of directors values KCS at $US 275 per share representing a 23% premium based on the CP and KCS closing prices on March 19 (and $US 270 per share representing a 26% premium based on the respective CP and KCS 30-day volume weighted average prices (VWAP)).

The transaction will combine the two railways to create the first rail network connecting the United States Mexico and Canada. While remaining the smallest of six US Class 1 railways by revenue CP and KCS say the combined company will be a much larger and more competitive network operating approximately 32000km of track employing close to 20000 people and generating total revenues of approximately $US 8.7 billion based on 2020 actual revenues.

The two companies informally notified the US Surface Transportation Board (STB) about the deal on the evening of March 20. The STB will need to approve the transaction. If approved the merger will be the first Class 1 transaction of its type since the late 1990s when Norfolk Southern and CSX acquired 56% and 72% respectively of Conrail.

“The combined network’s new single-line offerings will deliver dramatically expanded market reach for customers served by CP and KCS provide new competitive transportation service options and support North American economic growth” CP and KCS said in a joint statement. “The transaction is also expected to create jobs across the combined network. Additionally efficiency and service improvements are expected to achieve meaningful environmental benefits.”

CP will establish an independent voting trust to acquire the KCS shares. Former KCS president and CEO Mr Dave Starling has been appointed trustee. Upon shareholder approval of the transaction and satisfaction of customary closing conditions CP will acquire KCS shares and place them into the voting trust. This step is currently expected to be completed in the second half of 2021. Following the closing into a voting trust common shareholders of KCS will receive 0.489 of a CP share and $US 90 in cash for each KCS common share held. KCS common shareholders are expected to own 25% of CP’s outstanding common shares “providing the ability to participate in the upside of both companies’ growth opportunities. Following final STB approval KCS shareholders will additionally participate in the realisation of synergies resulting from the combination.”

To fund the merger’s stock consideration CP will issue 44.5 million new shares. The cash portion will be funded through a combination of cash-on-hand and raising approximately $US 8.6bn in debt for which financing has been committed. As part of the merger CP will assume approximately $US 3.8bn of KCS’ outstanding debt. Following the closing into trust CP expects that its outstanding debt will be approximately $US 20.2bn.

CP and KCS said the combination “is expected to be accretive to CP’s adjusted diluted EPS in the first full year following CP’s acquisition of control of KCS and is expected to generate double-digit accretion upon the full realization of synergies thereafter.”

Pro forma for the transaction CP estimates its leverage ratio against 2021E (expected) street consensus EBITDA to be approximately 4.0x with the assumption of KCS debt and issuance of new acquisition-related debt. In order to manage this leverage “effectively” CP will be temporarily suspending its normal course issuer bid programme and expects to produce approximately $7 billion of levered free cash flow (after interest and taxes) over the next three years. CP estimates its long-term leverage target of approximately 2.5x to be achieved within 36 months after closing into trust. The combined company “will remain committed to maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings while continuing to return capital for the benefit of shareholders.”

The merger comes as trade between the U.S. and Mexico is expected to increase as the two North American nations are enjoying far better relations following US president Mr Joe Biden’s inauguration.

“This transaction will be transformative for North America providing significant positive impacts for our respective employees customers communities and shareholders” said CP president and CEO Mr Keith Creel. “This will create the first US-Mexico-Canada railroad bringing together two railroads that have been keenly focused on providing quality service to their customers to unlock the full potential of their networks. CP and KCS have been the two best performing Class 1 railroads for the past three years on a revenue growth basis.

“The new competition we will inject into the North American transportation market cannot happen soon enough as the new United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) Trade Agreement among these three countries makes the efficient integration of the continent’s supply chains more important than ever before. Over the coming months we look forward to speaking with customers of all sizes and communities across the combined network to outline the compelling case for this combination and reinforce our steadfast commitment to service and safety as we bring these two iconic companies together.”

“KCS has long prided itself in being the most customer-friendly transportation provider in North America” said KCS President and CEO Mr Patrick J. Ottensmeyer. “In combining with CP customers will have access to new single-line transportation services that will provide them with the best value for their transportation dollar and a strong competitive alternative to the larger Class 1s. Our companies’ cultures are aligned and rooted in the highest safety service and performance standards.

Creel and Ottensmeyer jointly concluded: “We have been champions for the environment recognising the important role rail plays in lowering overall transportation emissions. This combination advances our shared science-based pledges in-line with the Paris Agreement to improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions in support of a more sustainable North American supply chain.”"

[Noozhawk’s note: One in a series. Click here for previous columns.]

In previous columns about the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation I’ve emphasized the international connections of the El Presidio de Santa Bárbara project with Mexico and Spain.

The Spanish connection came front and center in 1995 when we at the trust were notified through one of our board members Vie Obern that the Spanish consulate in Los Angeles was hosting the heir to the Spanish throne Felipe Prince of Asturias and now King Felipe VI who was touring the United States after finishing his graduate degree at Georgetown University.

Could we set up a tour of the presidio for him? Of course we answered with an emphatic “yes!”

Obern was to be out of town during the royal visit so I asked for assistance from Carmen Farreras who had moved to Santa Barbara several years earlier from Barcelona with her husband. She was connected to the consulate through commercial activities promoting Catalan businesses in California. She also had been involved with SBTHP organizing several Catalan events at El Presidio de Santa Bárbara State Historic Park and an exhibition at Casa de la Guerra.

We decided to go all out and proposed that the prince spend several hours with us for a tour of the presidio and Casa de la Guerra a ceremony at the statue of Charles III and a luncheon in the Presidio Chapel. Farreras was instrumental as our liaison with the consulate convincing Spanish officials to spend most of their time at the presidio. There were also stops planned at UC Santa Barbara and at the Santa Bárbara Mission Archive-Library.

I immediately began planning the event contacting the nearby Wine Cask restaurant to cater the luncheon in the chapel for around 90 guests. Northern Trust agreed to underwrite the meal and then-Assemblyman Brooks Firestone R-Los Olivos donated wine.

I also contacted our Soldados del Presidio de Santa Bárbara about participating in the event. I realized just how valuable the city’s colonial militia were to the park interpretation as we put together a program that included a special musket and canon firing to welcome the prince.

Don Felipe de Borbón y Grecia Prince of Asturias arrived around noon June 8 1995. Mayor Harriet Miller walked down to the car with soldado Jim Martinez to escort the prince to the chapel.

I wrote the following in a publication afterward: “The prince is tall — 6-foot-5 — slim elegant animated and speaks perfect English. His knowledge of our history was impressive as was his courtesy and genuine interest in the hundreds of honored guests who were to shake his hand during the next few hours.”

One of my favorite moments was when the soldados gathered at the chapel entrance and presented a proclamation to the prince with Jim Martinez asking him to serve as “honorary comandante of the Santa Barbara presidio.” The prince answered: “I accept as long as it is honorary.”

Inside the chapel an exquisite lunch was served followed by speeches from myself Farreras and the prince and then a presentation of gifts and a city proclamation. I noticed a buzz among the Spaniards regarding the presence of Firestone and our serving his wine. Someone told me that Firestone was a familiar name in Spain because of the popularity of Firestone tires.

After lunch we proceeded to a ceremony outside at the statue of Charles III with commentary by SBTHP board member Paul Mills who had been instrumental in having the statue gifted to Santa Barbara by the then king of Spain Juan Carlos I Felipe’s father.

At the statue the prince greeted several dozen presidio descendants. Interestingly the statue is on the site of the outdoor cemetery where presidio soldiers and their families are buried.

Our delegation next walked through the Presidio Northeast Corner project that was under construction at the time then continued to Casa de la Guerra and El Paseo. I showed the prince El Paseo’s Street in Spain where the plaque commemorating his visit would be installed.

Inside Casa de la Guerra which was still being restored we examined an exhibit of the De la Guerras. The prince was very familiar with the De la Guerra origins in Cantabria an autonomous community adjacent to the province of Asturias.

All told the prince’s visit was extraordinary lasting more than three hours. I later heard from Farreras that after the stops at UCSB and the Santa Barbara Mission she and the prince and a few others left the fanfare behind that evening and strolled down State Street stopping in various stores. I liked that after all the pomp and circumstance it was time for a little casual fun in Santa Barbara.

The story doesn’t end there however as the prince was to make a return visit in 2013. By then he was married to his wife now Queen Letizia and had two young daughters.

In the intervening years the Santa Barbara Presidio also had established itself as a place to visit whenever Spanish officials were in Southern California. Among those I provided tours for was Mariano Rajoy who later served as Spain’s prime minister from 2011 to 2018.

The prince’s 2013 visit to Santa Barbara was in connection with a conference of the United States-Spain Council held at what is now The Ritz-Carlton Bacara in Goleta. The council consists primarily of Spanish and American business executives promoting commercial relations and developing a young leaders program of mutual understanding between the two nations.

The prince carved out some time for SBTHP holding a special reception for our members at the Four Seasons Resort The Biltmore Santa Barbara. Among the guests were Spain’s ambassador to the United States Ramón Gil-Casares; Foreign Minister José García-Margallo y Marfil; and Enrique Ruiz Molero then the consul general in Los Angeles.

It was a splendid evening. Mayor Helene Schneider made some remarks and a city staffer showed the prince the decoration of the Order of Charles III Santa Barbara being the only U.S. city to have received the award. The late UCSB professor Giorgio Perissinotto presented the prince with publications of SBTHP and I made a few remarks as did Jim Martinez.

The evening was topped off with Mike Hardwick dressed in his Spanish uniform and portraying Spanish California Gov. Felipe de Neve. The interlude included some enjoyable repartee between the prince and Hardwick about the governor looking pretty good for his age.

Several months after the reception King Juan Carlos abdicated and the prince was crowned his successor as King Felipe VI on June 19 2014. I will have something to add of a personal note regarding King Felipe VI in a future column.

Sardauna’s prison life in the city is one secret

Many factors contributed to the present status attained by Zaria as host to several tertiary and research institutions. The gleam that Zaria would become a citadel of learning started even before the coming of colonialists. Daily Trust Saturday reports.

The city of Zaria in Kaduna State earned the rank of a fortress of scholarship many centuries ago. The city which attracted students of Islamic jurisprudence from different parts of Nigeria and beyond and has produced renowned Islamic scholars.

In the same vein Zaria has played host to institutions with Western orientation since the days of colonialism hence the acceptance of the city by the colonial masters as a conducive environment for teaching and learning of Western education ahead of its peers in Northern Nigeria.

Before the establishment of Western schools in the North institutions such as the Depot Nigerian Army (Depot NA) were established in Zaria. The city also hosted the camp of soldiers going to World War II (WW II) in the Kongo area of the city.

Furthermore the first centre for agricultural research in the North was set up in Zaria. The foregoing in addition to several other factors combined to give Zaria advantage over other cities hence the setting up of numerous federal tertiary and research institutions in the ancient city.

Therefore to establish the reason behind the presence of these tertiary and research institutions in Zaria there is need to go down history lane.

Politics of succession in Zazzau (Zaria) Emirate’s led to the invitation of colonialists to the city by Sarki Kwasau. The invitation was said to be the genesis of the presence of these institutions in the city.

Succession intrigues

Sarki Kwasau was said to be under pressure and had no option than to invite the colonialists to assist him to protect his emirate against incursions by the Sarkin Sudan of Kontagora in present day Niger State Umar Nagwamatse. This marked the first contact of the colonialists with the city.

The Security Adviser to the Emir of Zazzau and an expert on the history of Zaria Alhaji Usman Dalhatu said after the death of Sarkin Zazzau Yero of the Bare-Bari Dynasty his son Kwasau was desperate to take over the throne.

At that time according to findings it was the Sultan of Sokoto Abdulrahman that ruled all the Muslim communities and their kingdoms.

Alhaji Dalhatu said “Sultan Abdulrahman was employing a kind of autocratic leadership style. This earned him the alias of Abdulrahman Danyan Kasko. He determined who became emir in all the emirates under the sultanate. Unfortunately for Kwasau Danyan Kasko was against his becoming the next Emir of Zazzau.

“Sultan Danyan Kasko’s candidate was Madaki Ali from the Mallawa Dynasty but Madaki Ali was bedridden and the sickness led to his death. Therefore the princes of Zazzau rallied round to support Kwasau to become the next emir largely because of his power influence and threat of violence.

“When Sultan Danyan Kasko sent his waziri (deputy) to oversee the coronation of a new emir Kwasau confronted the waziri and threatened that ‘You either crown me as the new emir or I will cut off your head and send it to the sultan in Sokoto.’ This happened shortly before the arrival of the colonialists. Therefore the waziri had no option than to crown Kwasau as emir.

“Despite Kwasau’s insubordination Sultan Danyan Kasko did not wage war against Zazzau despite having the wherewithal to do so probably because Sokoto was at war with Kano and Bauchi.

“Therefore the sultan used his brother Sarkin Sudan of Kontagora Umar Nagwamatse to be attacking Zaria as punishment for Kwasau’s action. Kwasau did not retaliate Nagwamatse’s attacks because Zaria waging war against Nagwamatse would be like waging war against Sokoto; which was like an abomination.”

Records indicate that while the tension between Zazzau and Kontagora reached its peak colonialists came to Bida and Minna in Niger State and that Kwasau sent emissaries to them requesting their assistance in defending his emirate. When the colonialists came to Zaria around 1902 they stopped Nagwamatse’s incursion and even dethroned him.

Dalhatu further explained that “As time went on Kwasau realised the anti-Islam posture of the colonialists. He therefore confronted them. Before the skirmishes that ensued between Kwasau and his former allies his representative in Keffi present day Nasarawa State Magaji Danyamusa killed the Abuja Resident colonialist Captain Moley.

“Danyamusa ambushed Captain Moley at his palace and cut off his head. After the incident Sarkin Keffi requested Danyamusa to leave the town for fear of a reprisal. He attempted to go back to Zaria but Kwasau directed him to Kano instead.

“The Emir of Kano Alu who was at loggerheads with the colonialists organised an elaborate reception for Danyamusa.

“However Lord Lugard felt the reception was a confrontation with England and so intercepted it. He used that opportunity to continue his plan of the forceful annexation of Northern Nigeria. One of the measures taken by Lugard was dethronement of Kwasau. After Kwasau’s removal Zaria remained without emir for about six months.”

Zaria as conducive settlement for colonialists

After the conquest of Zaria and other Northern cities by the colonialists which led to the exile of Sultan Attahiru of Sokoto the colonialists saw Zaria as a conducive city for their activities and so decided to have a permanent settlement there.

Therefore after the coronation of Alu Dan Sidi as the Emir of Zazzau the colonialists began to settle in Zaria. However before that time missionaries were already in the city and other parts of the North.

In Zaria the colonialists were given Durumin Mai Garke close to Wazirin Zazzau’s official residence as their settlement.

Dalhatu explained that “Because of the way the colonialists perceived Zaria Depot NA was set up. The way Zaria residents accommodated the depot it further confirmed the colonialists’ perception of the city as a conducive environment for them.

“This made the colonialists to attempt to set up the first Western education school in Zaria but unfortunately the people resisted largely because of the conversion of many residents to Christianity. Therefore the school was taken to Kano and named Makarantar Dan Hausa. It became the first Western school in Northern Nigeria headed by Hanss Gischer. The place is now a cultural centre called Gidan Dan Hausa.”

However according to findings because of the development in Kano Western schools were later set up in Zaria despite the people’s resistance and so Babban Dodo area hosted the first Western school in Zaria. It was followed by Town School No 1 Kofan Kuyan Bana. It is now LEA Primary School Kofan Kuyan Bana. Town School No 2 was also set up in the Magajiya area.

Western education continued to gain ground in Zaria and this led to the setting up of Zaria Middle School then known as Kamfawul which is today Alhudahuda College. It was established in 1910.

This development gave the colonialists more confidence that Zaria had accepted Western education.

Dalhatu explained that “Western education was seen as a taboo and that was why the people then composed the famous song of:

‘Dan makarantar bokoko

Ba karatu ba sallah

Sai yawan zagin malam’

“Which means:

‘Student of Western education

That does not read or pray

Except abusing his teacher.’”

The development of Western education continued under Sarki Alu Dan Sidi before he was removed as emir by the colonialists.

Western education continued to receive attention under Sarki Dalhatu Sarki Ibrahim and Sarki Jafaru.

Sardauna connection

Before Sarki Aminu ascended the throne of Zazzau he was the District Head of Sabon Gari. His ascension coincided with the time that the Sardauna of Sokoto Ahmadu Bello was convicted for misappropriating jangali (animal tax). He was charged by Sultan Abubakar III and was sent to the Zaria prison.

Sardauna’s stay in the Zaria prison marked the beginning of his relationship with Sarki Aminu.

Dalhatu said “In fact they went for an appeal and Sardauna was later acquitted and discharged from prison. Sarki Aminu became emir after the Government of the Northern Region under Sardauna was formed. Similarly Zaria became a hot bed of politics. Both the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) and the Northern Peoples Congress (NPC) struggled to gain ground in Zaria.

“Similarly when the issue of setting up of an agricultural research institute came up Zaria was chosen in 1921 which is today known as Division of Agricultural Colleges (DAC). It was followed by the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR). Before then the Zaria Pharmaceutical School (ZPS) was established around 1910 in Tudun Wada which is now Barau Dikko Hospital. It was the first pharmaceutical school in Northern Nigeria where R.A.B. Dikko the first medical doctor from the Northern Region worked.

Kongo where the College of Administration of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) is located also contributed to the development of Western education and setting up of tertiary institutions in Zaria.

Soldiers going to WW II were camped there. The soldiers were meant to go to Congo as part of Africa’s World War II contingent and this was how the name Kongo came about.

After WW II the Northern Clerical School (School of Administration) was set up in the area before the establishment of ABU in 1962.

An elder statesman and former Bursar of ABU Alhaji Muhammadu Jibo confirmed this in an interview with Daily Trust Saturday.

When Nigeria got independence the Sardauna who was now Premier of the Northern Region saw the need for the establishment of a university; mainly because other parts of the country had established theirs. This marked the beginning of the setting up of many institutions that Zaria is now proud of.

Zaria as median of the North

Another very important reason why Zaria is host to many institutions is attributed to when Sarki Aminu advised the government to determine the geographical location of the city in the Northern Region. It was discovered that Zaria is at the centre hence it was suggested that the establishment of major institutions in the area would amount to being fair to all the citizens of the Northern Region.

While Sardauna did not hesitate to pick Zaria for the establishment of the first university in the North Sarki Aminu provided the vast land needed for it.

Dalhatu explained that “Sardauna was challenged by his counterparts in other parts of Nigeria that the North did not have competent people to study in a university. So together with his friend Sarki Aminu they proved the adversaries of the North wrong as ABU today is one of the best liberal and cosmopolitan universities in Nigeria Africa and even beyond.”

Some of the institutions:

ABU

The first institution that comes to mind when Zaria is mentioned is ABU. It was officially opened on October 4 1962. It got its name from the first and last Premier of the Northern Region Sir Ahmadu Bello (Sardauna of Sokoto).

Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT)

The establishment of ABU motivated the coming on board of many other institutions. One of these is the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) which was founded in 1964. It was then known as the Nigerian Civil Aviation Training Centre (NCATC). The college offers training in flying air traffic control aeronautical telecommunication aircraft maintenance aviation correspondent courses among many others.

The college according to findings was founded to assist Nigerians obtain aviation training locally instead of going abroad.

Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT)

NITT was established on March 14 1986 to among others address the problems of the transport sector. These problems include inefficient and low productivity fast depreciation of capital investment deficient management and maintenance of infrastructure low level of professionalism and high expenditure on overseas training.

Federal College of Education (FCE)

The FCE was established in 1962 as Advanced Teachers College (ATC). It is the North’s premier College of Education (COE).

Centre for Energy Research and Training (CERT)

Nuclear development across the world informed the decision of Iya Abubakar the then Vice Chancellor (VC) of ABU to set up a committee that looked into the possibility of setting up a nuclear centre. This led to the formation of the Centre for Nuclear Science and Technology (CENTECH) and renamed CERT with the mandate to develop nuclear science and technology in Nigeria.

National Research Institute for Chemical Technology (NARICT)

NARICT is a parastatal under the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology. The institute engages in innovative research of converting indigenous raw materials into valuable chemicals and chemical products. It is now mainly involved in renewable energy research catalysis and treatment of industrial effluent waste among others.

Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology (NILEST)

NILEST was founded in 1964. It was initially named Hides and Skin Demonstration and Training Project (HSDP). The institute offers courses on leather and leather products and also engages in research.

Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH)

ABUTH is under the Federal Ministry of Health but it is also part of ABU. It offers medical services to the public and trains different cadre of medical personnel.

National Board for Arabic and Islamic Studies (NBAIS)

The board was founded by Sardauna in 1960. It was later transferred to ABU in 1969 and in 2011 it became a national examination body. This led to the movement of its headquarters to Kaduna but it still operates and conducts most of its activities in Zaria.

Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR)

IAR was established in 1922 as the research division of the Department of Agriculture of the Northern Region. It was later transferred to ABU. The institute now engages in research that produces many varieties of maize sorghum cowpea cotton et cetera.

National Animal Production Research Institute (NAPRI)

The formation of NAPRI can be traced back to 1928 when the Shika Zaria Cattle Study Farm (SZCSC) was established. Its mandate included selection of indigenous breed of bulls for breeding of local herds. In 1962 it became Shika Grassland Station (SGS) under the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR).

The institute transformed to NAPRI on July 1 1976. It conducts research on cattle breeding dairy equine and camel feeds and nutrition poultry ruminants et cetera.

National Agricultural Extension Research and Liaison Services (NAERLS)

NAERLS was established in 1975 with the mandate to collate evaluate and disseminate agricultural technologies. It also conducts research on agricultural extension methods.

Zaria also plays host to Kaduna state-owned and private tertiary institutions like the Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic and the Ameer Shehu Idris College of Advanced Studies.

Indeed these institutions have attracted Nigerians and foreigners who now see Zaria as their “second” home. There is no gainsaying the fact that the institutions boost both social and economic life of the city.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1uby1ldmlkZW5jZS1wbGFuZXMtZHJvcC1hcm1zLWZvci1nb2xkLWluLXphbWZhcmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INVESTIGATION: No evidence planes drop arms for gold in Zamfara,"Locals and security sources also offered hints on how the bandits operating in the state acquire weapons

Interviews with locals security agents aviation experts government officials community leaders an ex-bandit and persons involved in mining gold in Zamfara State have revealed that the claim that helicopters and jets fly in arms in exchange for gold in Zamfara State is not true.

A Daily Trust reporter who visited some mining communities in the state and interacted with locals and security personnel reports that a number of persons who should know about such flights described the claim as laughable even as no witness was found to corroborate the claim made by the National Security Adviser (NSA) Major General Babagana Monguno (Rtd) at the end of the quarterly meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) earlier this month.

Evidence also showed little or no connection between the activities of the bandits operating in the state and gold mining. A senior security source who pleaded anonymity told Daily Trust that bandits did not engage in mining because of the labour and expertise required.

The closest to gold mining the armed men come according to multiple sources were occasional raids of sites for money and other valuables from the miners.

NSC’ decision

At the end of the NSC meeting which was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari on March 2 2021 Gen Monguno announced a declaration of Zamfara State as a no-fly zone to stop “arms for gold” deals going on which further fuel banditry in that part of the country.

A no-fly zone or a no-flight zone (NFZ) or Air Exclusion Zone (AEZ) is a territory or area established by a military power over which certain aircraft are not permitted to fly.

Aircraft that violate a no-fly zone may be shot down by the enforcing state depending on the terms of the NFZ. Aviation experts also said international airlines avoid the area because of safety concerns.

Gen Monguno told newsmen at the end of the meeting that “His Excellency the president has approved based on our recommendation the imposition and enforcement of a ban on all mining activities in Zamfara State with immediate effect until further notice.

“He has directed the Minister of Defence and the National Security Adviser (NSA) to deploy massive military and intelligence assets to restore normalcy to that part of the country. He has also approved that Zamfara State be declared a no-fly-zone with immediate effect.”

Presidential spokesman Mallam Garba Shehu later told Daily Trust that the decision to declare no-fly zone over Zamfara was because private aircraft were being used to supply weapons to criminal gangs in exchange for gold.

Mallam Shehu said “Even in Zamfara there is a strong suspicion that some of those choppers are being used to ferry arms for bandits and also to evacuate gold and illegally smuggle out of the country. So the country loses everything in the mining.”

An old theory

The claim that planes are being used to ferry arms to criminals is not a new one. For many years the rumour had gone on in many parts of Northern Nigeria afflicted by security challenges such as the Boko Haram in the North East and banditry in the North West.

Security experts who spoke with Daily Trust wondered how what started as heresy would now get official acceptance at the highest security body in the country without any of the alleged perpetrators being netted in or any of the planes shot down.

The earliest mention of this theory was from the North East where a group of Borno and Yobe elders led by a former Chief of Air Staff (CAS) Air Vice Marshall Al-Amin Dagash (Rtd) addressed a press conference in 2014 under the aegis of the Borno Yobe Peoples Forum (BYPF). The group lampooned the then government of President Goodluck Jonathan alleging that Boko Haram was allowed to flourish to the extent of having helicopters aiding its operations.

In March 2014 the Senator representing Katsina South Abu Ibrahim reported during a Senate plenary that helicopters were being used to bring in bandits and arms to some parts of Katsina State to attack villages.

Contributing to a debate on a motion brought to the senate by Senator Barnabas Gemade on the violence in several northern states Senator Ibrahim revealed that attackers of some of the affected places were not local people but were air-dropped from somewhere else.

Sen Ibrahim said “We have reports that helicopters were used to ferry the people who carry out attacks. They landed in the forest and dropped the attackers.”

In January 2015 some residents dislodged from Monguno town told reporters that they witnessed instances of helicopters dropping boxes containing supplies allegedly meant for the insurgents.

In August 2019 a bandit arrested in Katsina Aliyu Musa told journalists that his gang got their weapons delivered to them by a helicopter.

Twenty-year-old Musa told journalists that he once saw a helicopter drop weapons for his boss inside Dinya Forest in Kankara LGA of Katsina State.

Musa said “I once saw an aircraft with fans on its head (helicopter) drop weapons for my boss while we were inside the forest at Dinya.”

The theory is not unique to Nigeria. In 2018 AFP Fact Check delivered a verdict on a 2015 blog post on a helicopter allegedly downed in the northern part of the country on its way to deliver arms to Boko Haram. The picture was widely circulated in Cameroun and other parts of French West Africa.

Findings

A number of persons spoken to in Gusau Maru Shinkafi Bukkuyum and Anka LGAs some of the areas famous for gold mining as well as banditry said they were unsure of the use of helicopters and jets for delivery of arms or picking up of gold. Some of them described the insinuation as outright falsehood.

A senior security source in the state capital described the allegation as “mere conjecture being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs.”

He said there were no formal or informal reports confirming the arrival or departure of any suspicious aircraft in any part of the state.

A police officer described the allegation as funny saying “It is not true. I never heard about it and even outside the police; we work as a team DSS police army air force no one has mentioned it to me. If this was happening I could have known but to be honest with you I have never heard this issue being mentioned.”

He also faulted claims that bandits are engaged in mining activities proceeds of which they exchange for arms.

He said “Bandits cannot do this work. You need to go and see how this work is done; you will pity them. A bandit who is used to cool cash cannot afford to suffer that much for what you are not even certain of.”

A resident of Shinkafi Abdullahi Labbo said the forest area which was infested with bandits had never witnessed suspicious movements of aircraft.

Labbo said “We have heard that but I can tell you it is not true. We have never witnessed it here in reality.”

A leader of the bandits in Zamfara Shehu Rekeb told Daily Trust from his Sububu Forest base that they had banned mining activities in all the areas they operate.

Rekeb said in the past “white people” went to the mines with security escort to work but that they had stopped going adding that herders in the forests were not involved in mining.

He further said “We only stopped the government. We have banned it but herders do not know how to mine. The only persons we allow are the villagers who are poor and have nothing to live on. We allow them into some places to get what they can survive on.”

A motorcyclist in Kanoma in Maru LGA Yunusa Ali told Daily Trust that he routinely used to see an aircraft on Mondays going West of the village where a den of bandits was located to deliver supplies to them.

But a local leader in the town Adamu Wakili said he was not aware of any aircraft going to the area other than the military jets.

Wakili said “What comes around here is the military jet and it usually comes as reinforcement and anytime it comes the bandits get scared and run away.”

He further said the area was now enjoying peace following a recent peace pact with bandits.

A member of the disbanded vigilante group in the state who pleaded anonymity said although he never witnessed the landing or taking off of planes he had heard the accounts of some persons who said they had had seen unauthorised choppers.

He explained that “About two months ago a relative of mine who lives in a village called Gobirawar Kwaca told me and he swore by God that he saw a plane land on a mountain called Bagana. He said a few days later a Fulani man came to them with a new rifle which he confessed was brought by the plane.”

The Public Relations Officer of Zamfara Gold Buyers and Sellers Association Alhaji Ayuba Ahmad Muhammad said there is no correlation between banditry and mining activities in the state.

Claim untenable – NAMA source

A senior official of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) who spoke to Daily Trust on condition of anonymity said it was impossible for planes to come in and out of Nigeria without being sighted by any of the country’s airspace radars.

The NAMA official said “My first reaction when I heard that was that they are indicting themselves.”

According to him there was never a time that any security outfit in the country reported suspicious movement of any alien plane in that area.

The source explained that from its Kano station NAMA had total view of the whole of Northern Nigeria and parts of Niger Republic.

He said “Our radar in Kano covers 600 kilometres. We have a facility in Zamfara feeding the Kano radar. We have a radar in Maiduguri another one in Abuja and also in Kano. They all feed the system in Kano. With these it is not possible for any aircraft to move unnoticed. It must pass through any of our radars.”

The official further explained that with the primary surveillance radar stationed in Kano NAMA officials could detect movement of aircraft even if the moving plane had no transponder for communication.

He said “In addition to these there are three surveillance helicopters stationed in Katsina and some others in Sokoto. Their job is to patrol these areas from Katsina to Zamfara and Sokoto. Should there be anything they are expected to report. I can tell you authoritatively there was never a time we got any report of something like that from them. Never!”

Pronouncement shows failure of intelligence – retired Air Force chief

Group Captain John Ojikutu (Rtd) said the revelation by the NSC exposed failure of intelligence on the part of responsible entities.

He said if any unauthorised aircraft was getting access into an area it should be failure of intelligence not failure of aviation.

Ojikutu said “If there is a problem it is the job of the national intelligence to inform the Nigerian airspace management or the air force but from what I gather they did not inform anyone before bringing out this no-fly zone order.

“If they have credible intelligence they can share it with the agency responsible for managing the airspace. But unfortunately this thing is now being mismanaged over the airwaves. If you have intelligence pass it to the people who will work on it but you don’t have intelligence and you just release instructions on the pages of newspaper. It is not done that way.”

No-fly zone may be costly for Nigeria

An aviation expert who pleaded anonymity told Daily Trust that declaring no-fly zone over any part of the country could affect the nation adversely in the global aviation industry; with attendant loss of revenue.

He said “If a territory is declared no-fly zone what that tells the operators is that that area is not safe for airplane movement.

“I understand the people at NCAA and NAMA have worked out 12000 feet as mark for the ban of aircraft movement. Long distance aircraft can actually pass over the area but for safety concerns many may have to cancel these routes; which will mean a loss for Nigeria in terms of revenue.”

‘How arms come’

Locals and security sources who spoke to our reporter offered hints on how the bandits operating in the state acquire weapons.

A local in Shinkafi who pleaded anonymity said it was an open secret that majority of weapons came in through Niger Republic via Sabon Birni in neighbouring Sokoto State.

A senior police officer who also spoke on condition of anonymity said smuggling weapons into the country was easy because of the vast and porous Nigerian border with Niger Republic.

An ex-bandit who spoke with our reporter dismissed the allegation of the use of planes to deliver arms saying the “government knows the truth and we all know how these weapons come in” adding that a lot of weapons came in through Niger Republic.

In a recent interview with Daily Trust a repentant bandits’ leader Auwal Daudawa said getting weapons was as easy as buying bread. He said weapons came in from Niger Republic and southern part of Nigeria.

Ban will not end banditry – Commissioner

The Zamfara State Commissioner for Environment and Solid Minerals Dr Nuraddeen Isah said the no-flight zone would not bring about the expected change in the security situation in the state because it was off the mark.

Dr Isah said it was ridiculous for anyone to draw such conclusion noting that such things could only happen in a banana republic.

He said “This is even an attack on us as a country. Are you telling me our sovereignty and integrity as a country is being breached? How will the rest of the world take us? Are we saying as a nation we don’t have record of movement of planes which come in and go out? In this state we don’t have an airport we don’t have an airstrip. We only have a helipad which is within town.”",,,

The service has awarded a contract to aerospace giant Northrop Grumman to carry out the necessary modifications on the aircraft.

The contract will include modifications of the E-2D’s mission computer and displays software to obtain the ability to control UAVs.

Developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Northrop Grumman the E-2 Hawkeye is an all-weather carrier-capable tactical airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft.

The E-2D AWAC in particular carries AN/APY-9 a disc-shaped rotating radar dome on its back that is used for early detection and tracking of aircraft and cruise missiles.

The Hawkeye has friend or foe identification capabilities electronic support measures and sensors for target identification.

The experiment for flying E-2D along with UAVs was announced on March 17. Earlier the US Navy said it wanted to move some command-and-control activities of future carrier-based drones off-ship through manned-unmanned teaming technologies.

The Boeing MQ-25A Stingray in-flight refueling tanker is also part of the plan. Vice Admiral James Kilby deputy chief of naval operations for warfighting requirements and capabilities said “There is going to be a control center on the carrier for our unmanned air vehicles

“But ultimately in the future let’s say there’s a fueling area for a strike [aircraft] or some other mission area it’d be great if a manned pilot saw the weather and we could divert and move that [UAV] and not have to go to the carrier to do that control.”

The US Navy has plans for the MQ-25A tanker so that it can extend the reach of the Navy’s fifth-generation Lockheed Martin F-35C stealth fighter jets.

The advanced fighter jets currently have an unrefuelled range of about 1200nm. The US Navy’s experiment can significantly increase their range.

The work will see the EA-18G receive a number of improvements says Boeing. The Airborne Electronic Attack System Enhancement’s modification will be applied to the Growler’s Northrop Grumman ALQ-218 receiver which will allow for operations in increasingly complex electromagnetic environments.

The upgrade will also enhance the Growler’s ability to transfer data more rapidly to other aircraft and platforms and processing speeds will be boosted. Preparations will also be made for the aircraft to eventually operate the developmental Next Generation Jammer.

Overall 160 USN Growlers are expected to be upgraded in five years with full-rate modification work to start in June 2021.

“We’re excited to have the Growler industry team here working on capabilities that will bring the fleet enhanced electronic surveillance enhanced data link and the ability to carry the Next Generation Jammer pod” says Captain Chris Bahner commander Electronic Attack Wing US Pacific Fleet.

The work is taking place at NAS Whidbey Island in Washington State. Several of the capabilities to be added are consistent with the USN’s programme to upgrade the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet on which the Growler is based to the improved Block III standard.

“As the world’s premier electronic attack platform we’re starting this programme for the EA-18G Growler in solid partnership with the navy” says Mark Sears Boeing vice-president of Fighters & Strike Product Support.

“These modifications will position it to meet the threats of today and those in the future.”

In May 2019 Boeing initiated design work related to upgrading the EA-18G. At the time Boeing said the upgraded aircraft would be designated Growler Block II and include features such as the advanced cockpit system and conformal fuel tanks as well as improved sensors and an upgraded electronic attack package.

World’s Largest Military Ship : Construction began on 11 August 2005 when Northrop Grumman held a ceremonial steel cut for a 15-ton plate that forms part of a side shell unit of the carrier. The keel of Gerald R. Ford was laid down on 13 November 2009.

She was christened on 9 November 2013. Gerald R. Ford entered the fleet replacing the decommissioned USS Enterprise (CVN-65) which ended her 51 years of active service in December 2012. Originally scheduled for delivery in 2015 Gerald R. Ford was delivered to the Navy on 31 May 2017 and formally commissioned by President Donald Trump on 22 July 2017.

She is expected to leave on her first deployment around 2022. As of 2017  she is the world’s largest aircraft carrier and the largest warship ever constructed in terms of displacement.

USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) is the lead ship in the Ford-class of aircraft carrier the first new class in more than 40 years and will begin the phased replacement of Nimitz-class carriers.

CVN-78 honors the 38th president of the United States and pays tribute to his lifetime of service in the Navy in the U.S. government and to the nation. During World War II Ford attained the rank of lieutenant commander in the Navy serving on the light carrier USS Monterey (CVL 26). Ford became president and served in the country’s highest office from 1974-1977.

Former Chief of Armenia’s army General Staff Movses Hakobyan said in November that the fighters were without missiles intended for them as Russia prohibits the sale of missiles for the Su-30SM to other countries. The Armenian authorities remained silent about this matter until recently.

“Yes we bought the fighter it was delivered in May [2020] and yes we did not have time to buy the missiles before the war [in Karabakh]. Would you buy planes so that we could buy missiles? Why did the 26-year-old state [Armenia] not have fighters?” Pashinyan said at a Saturday meeting with residents of the country’s Aragatsotn region.

At the end of September 2020 hostilities resumed in Nagorno-Karabakh which became a continuation of the long-term conflict and led to casualties among the civilian population. The sides made several attempts to sign a truce but only the tripartite agreement reached overnight to November 10 2020 turned out to be successful.

With the mediation of Moscow Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed to completely ceasefire and exchange prisoners and bodies of the dead. Yerevan also transferred the Kalbajar Lachin and Agdam districts to Baku. Russian peacekeepers were stationed in the region.

The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh began in February 1988 when the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region announced its secession from the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic.

During an armed confrontation in 1992-1994 Azerbaijan lost control of Nagorno-Karabakh and its adjacent areas. Since 1992 talks were ongoing on peaceful settlement of the conflict with the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group led by Russia the United States and France."

The vessel will homeport in the popular eastern Caribbean port of St. Maarten. Are we now seeing a shift away from U.S. homeports?

Celebrity Millennium Out of St. Maarten

Celebrity Cruises has announced its comeback and it’s not out of the United States. After more than a year of suspended operations the cruise line will begin cruises in the Caribbean this June.

So the Celebrity Millennium will begin sailings from her new homeport of St. Maarten on June 5 2021. She will offer seven-night itineraries departing through August.

Celebrity Cruises President and CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo said:

“Returning to the Caribbean after more than a year away is such a significant moment for us. It marks the measured beginning of the end of what has been a uniquely challenging time for everyone. We have been in constant contact with the leadership of St. Maarten these past months to support each other and share learnings and best practices. That we’re able to offer people the opportunity to safely vacation onboard the revolutionized Celebrity Millennium is incredible and that we will sail from the magical island of St. Maarten is very special. I am forever grateful for the support and collaboration of the St. Maarten Government.”

There will be two different Caribbean itineraries Celebrity Millennium will offer. One week-long itinerary will include calls at Aruba Curacao and Barbados. The other itinerary will include visits to Tortola St. Lucia and also Barbados.

St. Maarten

Minister of Tourism Economic Affairs Transportation and Telecommunication (TEATT) Ludmila de Weever declared:

“Having a major cruise line such as Royal Caribbean Group’s Celebrity Cruises homeport here is a significant economic milestone for St. Maarten. It’s an historic agreement the fruit of continuous dialogue and a testament to the strength of our longstanding relationship” “Celebrity Cruises homeporting here will help rejuvenate our economy and drive opportunities for our people. I would like to thank the management team at the Royal Caribbean Group for their commitment to St. Maarten and their confidence in the Ministry of TEATT as a reliable and responsible partner. I look forward to the successful re-launch of their Caribbean cruising.”

The sailings will be open for booking from March 25 2021. Guests can take advantage of special air and sea pricing offering exceptional savings on all Summer 2021 St. Maarten sailings starting at $1999* per person for a veranda stateroom.

The offer applies to new bookings and flights must be booked through Flights By Celebrity and prices include airfare and taxes.

Who Can Cruise?

So the big question is who can go on the cruises out of St. Maarten? Adults will need to be vaccinated before being allowed to cruise but children under the age of 18 will also be able to sail as long as they have a negative test result within 72 hours before embarkation.

There will be strict health protocols in place to make sure guests and crew remain safe. Parent company Royal Caribbean group has developed measured with guidance from the joint Healthy Sail panel with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9yZWZsZXgtZGVzdHJveXMtcmFkZW9uLWJvb3N0LWxvdy1sYXRlbmN50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's Reflex Technology Beats AMD's Radeon Boost Counterpart: Report,"Last year in a bid to increase system responsiveness in competitive video games both Nvidia and AMD released new technologies to reduce input lag for improved system performance: Nvidia's Reflex Low Latency and AMD's Radeon Boost. Both Nvidia and AMD say their respective technologies' performance gains are significant but how true is that really?

Fortunately YouTuber Battle(non)sense recently published a full rundown of both technologies and compared them side by side to see how they actually perform.

How Do These Low Latency Boosters Work?

Latency can be reduced with two methods: First by increasing your frame rate and second by optimizing the pipeline between the CPU and the GPU.

AMD's Radeon Boost uses the first method to improve frame rates. Radeon Boost will intelligently reduce your in-game resolution only while there's motion to spike your frame rate super high to give you a lower input latency. If you're just standing still and not moving your mouse your resolution will return to its default state.

Nvidia's Reflex technology on the other hand works by improving CPU to GPU communication to reduce latency. Here's why this is helpful; in a traditional video game with no latency boosters active the CPU will send frames to the GPU as fast as it possibly can which is perfectly fine and something we want.

But here's where a problem can occur; if the GPU becomes ""GPU-bound"" (where utilization is basically maxed out) the GPU will not be able to render frames as fast as the CPU feeds them. This causes a pipeline bottleneck where the frame buffer gets queued with frames that the GPU needs to work on at a later time. This causes latency to spike.

Nvidia's Reflex technology solves this problem by preventing that pipeline bottleneck from occurring as much as possible. Instead the game engine will only send frames to the GPU when the GPU is ready to accept a new frame from the CPU thus keeping latency low.

Also there are two more additional low latency modes that Nvidia and AMD offer outside of Radeon Boost and Nvidia Reflex: Nvidia Low Latency Mode and Radeon Anti-Lag.

In basic terms these technologies also try to deliver what Radeon Boost and Nvidia Reflex try to offer; however they do it at the driver level only. The advantage is that you can apply these technologies to any video game you want. However it can be less effective because the game engine is not involved. Nvidia Reflex and Radeon Boost require game developers to implement the technology into the game engine for the features to work.

The Unexpected Low Latency Booster: Frame Rate Cap

But the low latency modes don't end there — you might be surprised to hear this but capping your frame rate can be an effective way to reduce input lag.



This method works like Reflex in that it uses by optimizing the CPU-to-GPU pipeline to reduce latency. When your frame rate is capped GPU utilization decreases so you are no longer ""GPU bound."" This alleviates the CPU & GPU pipeline allowing the GPU to render frames as fast as it's been fed by the CPU because the CPU is also being limited by the frame rate cap.



Now the question is which of these five low latency boosters is best?

Benchmarks:

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: YouTube) (Image credit: YouTube)

In Battle(non)sense's first test the channel tested a frame rate cap against Nvidia's Low latency mode (not Nvidia Reflex). Surprisingly this led to the frame rate cap winning against the driver-level low latency feature from Nvidia.

But moving to the next slide -- the situation changes after swapping to Nvidia's Reflex technology; Nvidia's more advanced low latency tech is on par if not slightly better than a frame rate cap providing excellent low latency numbers without needing to fiddle with a frame rate cap.

The YouTuber also tested AMD's Anti-Lag against Nvidia's Low Latency mode and found both to have identical performance.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: YouTube) (Image credit: YouTube) (Image credit: YouTube)

Next up is Nvidia's Reflex technology against AMD's Radeon Boost and the results are unquestionable. Reflex easily beats AMD's Boost technology by a significant amount.

This test shows us that the optimized pipeline method of reducing latency is the most reliable way to lower latency. AMD's solution falls apart because the GPU is still GPU bound and forced to work on frames queued up in the frame buffer. Even worse your resolution AND latency are constantly changing which can lead to inconsistent gaming performance.

Not to mention that AMD's Boost technology is not stable in both Fortnite and Apex Legends as Battle(non)sense discovered in his tests. In Fortnite the game would freeze up after firing 90 shots and Apex Legends' implementation of Radeon Boost is completely unreliable causing lag spikes that make the game unplayable.

Conclusion:

Thanks to Battle(non)sense we've learned that optimizing the pipeline between the CPU and GPU is a much better way of lowering latency than simply pumping up the frame rate.

Plus we've also learned that using a frame rate cap can significantly reduce input lag enough to where it's on par with Nvidia's Reflex technology. That makes this solution absolutely perfect for the vast majority of titles that do not support Nvidia Reflex.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy83ODM0NS9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA3MC10aS10ZWFzZWQtOGdiLWdkZHI2eC1hbmQtZW5kLW9mLW1heS1yZWxlYXNlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti teased: 8GB GDDR6X and end of May release,"NVIDIA rumored to release GeForce RTX 3070 Ti towards the end of May with 8GB of GDDR6X memory and the Ampere GA104-400 GPU.

NVIDIA is reportedly working on a GeForce RTX 3070 Ti graphics card with VideoCardz sources sharing ""the latest information"" that they have on the purported GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.

According to their AIB sources we're looking at NVIDIA using the Ampere GA104-400 GPU for the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti graphics card with 6144 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6X memory. We are told to expect the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti on shelves -- I don't think there'll be enough numbers for them to actually touch the shelves -- by the end of May.

Rumor has it NVIDIA did consider Ethereum mining limiters for both the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and the freshly-rumored GeForce RTX 3080 Ti but those plans could've been changed. We've now since seen that NVIDIA is changing its drivers behind the scenes with ETH hash rate limitations removed in new drivers on the GeForce RTX 3060.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LW1pbmluZy1saW1pdC1ieXBhc3NlZC11c2luZy1kdW1teS1oZG1pL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LW1pbmluZy1saW1pdC1ieXBhc3NlZC11c2luZy1kdW1teS1oZG1pL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Cryptocurrency Mining Limit Bypassed Using Dummy HDMI Fools The GPU/Driver Handshake Easily,"In the weeks after the unintentional NVIDIA GeForce Driver leak that enabled cryptocurrency mining on the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU miners have found additional ways into bypassing the GPU / Driver hand-shake to break the hash rate limiter on Ampere GPUs.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Hash Rate Limit Bypassed Using Dummy HDMI Breaks GPU/Driver Handshake & Enables Full Cryptocurrency Mining Rate

So we all know that NVIDIA accidentally published its GeForce 470.05 driver on its developer web-page that allowed users to bypass the hash rate limiter but later removed it. However as soon as the driver was highlighted to enable the full cryptocurrency mining rate of Ampere GPUs it spread like wildfire and is currently available to download everywhere in public domains.

Surprisingly new discoveries have been made by the Editor of Hardwareluxx Andreas Schilling who confirmed through his testing that the driver can still restrict hash rate on the GeForce RTX 3060 when running multiple GPUs. For this purpose the GeForce RTX 3060 was run alongside a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. The RTX 2080 Ti was used as the primary display adapter while the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was used as a secondary card. You can see that the hash rate limiter kicks in pretty soon forcing the ETH rate down to 21-22 MH/s instead of up to 50 MH/s which this card delivers.

This is definitely an interesting way of blocking cryptocurrency mining when running multiple GPUs as it detects which GPU is being used as a display adapter while simultaneously checking if multiple GPUs are running alongside it and if mining algorithms are being run on them. In most cases the cryptocurrency mining rigs feature a low-end or budget card as a display adapter while running a range of GPUs for mining crypto.

To bypass even this limit set by NVIDIA all you have to do is get dummy HDMI connectors which can trick the driver into thinking that the other cards are also being run for display adapters and allow for full mining rate. Andreas goes on to provide a demonstration of this on his Twitter feed and shows the same GeForce RTX 3060 which was limited when running alongside the RTX 2080 Ti working at its full cryptocurrency mining hash rate.

Users in Korea have also provided a demonstration of this by putting four NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards to the test using the dummy HDMI connectors. The miners confirm that there is no mining hash rate drop in Ethereum (or any Crypto algorithm to say) when using dummy HDMI connectors. These HDMI dummy connectors are readily available to purchase and are quite cheap but given that they can become popular after this news goes out we can expect a slight rise in the prices. The miner also says that he hasn't yet tested the cards with dummy DVI connectors but that might work too. Other than that you also need a PCIe link of x8 or beyond to bypass the limit.

Graphics cards such as the unreleased NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti are also expected to feature the hash rate limit but if modders can bypass the RTX 3060 it's sad to say that the limit will also be bypass on the RTX 3080 Ti too.

Those have since evolved into what is now called their “Studio” drivers but they’re essentially the same thing; versions of their drivers that are geared more towards content creation rather than gaming.

They’ve seen a lot of changes over the last couple of years especially since the launch of their first series RTX cards and now their new March 2021 version of the Studio drivers focus heavily on the latest AI-powered tools from Adobe including the new Super Resolution feature as well as the newest neural engine in Blackmagic’s DaVinci Resolve 17.

The March 2021 update NVIDIA says provides a nice performance boost for Adobe’s new Super Resolution feature currently available in Adobe Camera Raw and coming soon to Lightroom and Lightroom Classic as well as all of the recently added Neural Filters. The Neural Engine in DaVinci Resolve 17 as well as new features like the Magic Mask also see a bit of a boost.

They say that there are also benefits for 3D artists although the only software I can see mentioned by name is Blender’s AI-powered OptiX denoising (which is pretty awesome btw).

For those who use NVIDIA graphics cards but don’t game choosing to go with the Studio drivers is a no brainer but many people still don’t know they even exist. The company’s Game Ready drivers are typically installed on new machines by default – or even if you install them yourself but go with the “Express” installation – but they’re well worth taking advantage of showing some big performance boosts over the standard gamer drivers for many creative applications.

If you’re not running the Studio drivers yet or you are but haven’t updated to the newest release head on over to the NVIDIA blog to find out more and download it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtY291bGQtcmVpbnRyb2R1Y2UtaXRzLWFtcGVyZS1nYTEwMC1ncHUtdW5kZXItY21wLWh4LW1pbmluZy1zZXJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA could reintroduce its Ampere GA100 GPU under CMP HX mining series,"Please note that this post is tagged as a rumor .

NVIDIA might be planning a GA100-based CMP HX mining card.

Known leaker @kopite7kimi suggests NVIDIA is evaluating the possibility of launching its flagship Ampere compute card for cryptocurrency mining.

NVIDIA Cryptomining Graphics Cards (CMP HX and P104) Source: VideoCardz

NVIDIA A100 was the first Ampere GPU released months ahead of the GeForce RTX 30 lineup. Unlike the gaming-oriented models the GA100 solution was designed solely with compute workloads in mind. According to Kopite the A100 is a “mining monster” without sharing any hash rates or mining performance figures. He claims that NVIDIA will introduce a fifth CMP HX model with said GPU:

I mean we will meet a new CMP HX card based on A100. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) March 21 2021

NVIDIA A100 also known as A100 Tensor Core GPU was introduced in SXM form factor. Later on NVIDIA introduced a PCIe-based model with passive cooling. Data centers solutions (formerly Tesla series) have actually a lot in common with mining cards. Both require powerful compute GPUs lack display connectors and have a very specific purpose.

Ampere GA100 GPU being a compute-oriented architecture would undoubtedly offer better mining performance than GA102+ gaming GPUs. However miners will only consider this solution if the price is attractive which might be a problem considering that NVIDIA A100 PCIe currently retails at 10000 USD. A CMP-based model would obviously have to cost a lot less. It would probably also lack support for the data center NVIDIA software solutions that make these compute cards so expensive. Otherwise launching a GA100 based mining card wouldn’t have made much sense to both NVIDIA and miners but for different reasons.

The A100 Tensor Core offers up to 19.5 TLFOPs in single-precision calculations. The card is also equipped with high-speed (1.6 TB/s) 40GB HBM2 of memory. Both values are very important in mining. GA100-based mining solution probably wouldn’t need all five stacks of HBM2 memory a single 8GB HBM2 stack would suffice. Current DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) size 3.49 GB for Ehtereum and 3.58 GB for Ethereum Classic. A reduction to single stack HBM2 would have noticeably reduced the cost of such a solution.

Kopite has not provided any more information on the CMP A100 mining card. The current roadmap is to introduce 30HX and 40HX Turing-based models by the end of March with 50HX and 90HX coming in the second quarter.

In the next few weeks The SmithGroup an integrated design and engineering firm the city hired in January will begin the process of creating a master plan for the $1 billion Kenosha Innovation Neighborhood project at the former Chrysler Engine Plant site.

The plan is to foster neighborhood opportunities in education workforce training entrepreneurial development and job placement according to Mayor John Antaramian. They will focus on connecting residents to opportunities in high-growth digital fields as well as science technology and math occupations.

Master plan goals

The master plan will define land use and zoning and include multi-mode transportation plans as well as proportions for residential housing as well as commercial buildings for the parcel. The plan is expected to be finalized in June according to Ed St. Peter the city’s project manager.

The multifaceted project envisions a $19.5 million innovation center with an intrinsic connection to its surrounding neighborhoods — Lincoln Columbus McKinley Wilson Roosevelt and Uptown. It is intended to provide opportunities for education workforce training entrepreneurial development and job placement in high-growth digital and STEM fields.

Neighborhood discussions will also begin later this month.

Antaramian said the discussions will center on integrating the six neighborhoods into the innovation design concept of “live work and play.”

State proposes $10M for construction

In late February Gov. Tony Evers announced that the city under his proposed capital budget would receive nearly $10 million in state funding to develop the innovation center. Evers has recommended that the state Legislature approve the city’s request as a part of a proposed $2.38 billion recommended in budget investments in his 2021-23 capital budget plan. The proposal looks to capitalize on low bond rates and would support major projects across the state in 31 counties.

“I’m very happy with the governor’s support and the legislators’ support for this project. It’s something that I believe long term will be a huge benefit to Kenosha and the State of Wisconsin” Antaramian said upon learning of the announcement. “This is the first of a number of grants we expect to be coming our way. We believe there is more to come that people will see.”

The city’s request for $9.75 million in capital funding from the state represents half the cost of the proposed center which the city would then match.

The former Chrysler plant site is owned by the city. It closed in 2010 when the automaker declared bankruptcy and was demolished two years later.

According to the capital budget the city-owned parcel is located in an Opportunity Zone that is supported by an existing tax incremental financing district with about $6M in federal grants being pursued to initiate Phase I site work and infrastructure development.

Infrastructure funding

The project will also include infrastructure development site improvement and construction of the facility.

Earlier this year the City Council reaffirmed its commitment to fund more than $7.4 million of the $12.4 million infrastructure project at the site.

The city is expected to commit up to at least $7418661 in funding for roads and utilities based on approval of up to $4945774 from the federal Economic Development Administration. The city’s portion of funding would come from bonds issued within the site’s tax incremental financing district.

Site remediation

Also this spring San Clemente Calif.-based Regenesis Bioremediation Products Inc. will begin a second-phase effort to further neutralize contaminants left behind after Chrysler closed.

The first phase involved soil excavation to remove areas with the highest contamination on the 107-acre property that lies east of 30th Avenue between 52nd and 60th streets.

The contract includes a combined $2.6 million for remediation and $400000 in contingency funds to cover unforeseen costs.

Among the contaminants found in the soil and groundwater at the former engine plant site were petroleum compounds chlorinated solvents hydraulic fluid and polychlorinated biphenyls. Metal contaminants including lead chromium and zinc were also found according to state environmental assessments.

Education business partnerships

In December the University of Wisconsin-Parkside signed on as a partner committing to the city’s revitalization efforts and was in the early stages of discussions to provide equitable access to education and training at the proposed innovation site.

Parkside Chancellor Deborah Ford said she was proud to join the more than 25 community and industry partners that are creating the innovation hub with the city.

“We look forward to collaborating with the city on addressing the socio-economic disparities in Kenosha and to partnering with the mayor in developing an assertive and actionable plan to bridge gaps in training and opportunity” she said.

Also partnering with the city is Milwaukee-based genera8tor an accelerator program for business startups. Earlier the city worked with gener8tor in applying for grant funding for startups in under-served areas through the Economic Development Administration.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Kenosha in the effort to support more minority-led businesses” said gener8tor’s co-founder Joe Kirgues.

State 79-58 in the first round of the WNCAA tournament at Strahan Arena on Sunday afternoon.

The Aggies who came into the game the No. 16 against the top-seeded Wolfpack had their minds on an epic upset as they led 37-31 with four minutes remaining in the first half. The Pack put together a 13-0 run to end the first half to take a 44-37 halftime lead.

NCSU's momentum flowed into the second half where the Pack eventually took a 20-point lead 64-44 going into the fourth quarter.

Graduate senior Chanin Scott led the Aggies with a game-high 23 points to go along with seven rebounds three assists and three steals on 11-for-19 shooting from the field. Senior forward Jayla Jones-Pack added 11 points three rebounds and three blocks on 5-for-8 shooting.

The Aggies (14-3) shot 42.9 percent from the floor after shooting 57.1 percent in their impressive first-half showing live on ESPN. NCSU recovered to shoot 53.8 percent including 61.9 percent shooting in the second half.

Behind five points from Shayla Nelson  the Aggies took a 15-13 lead with 3:18 remaining in the first quarter. The Pack scored the next six points to take a 19-15 lead. But the Aggies closed the first quarter out on a spurt to take a 21-20 lead going into the second quarter.

NCSU (21-2) increased their lead to 27-22 in the first 90 seconds of the second quarter. The Aggies caught fire over the next six minutes.

Freshman D'Mya Tucker had five points and Scott and Jones-Pack scored four points apiece in a 13-2 run that gave the Aggies a 35-29 lead with 5:22 remaining in the first half. After a Pack jumper to cut the lead to four points 35-31 with 4:55 remaining in the first half Jones-Pack made a layup to increase the lead to 37-31 before the Pack made their run to end the half.

NCSU scored the first six points of the third quarter to increase to take a 50-37 lead over the first 2 ½ minutes. A Darks layup snapped the Pack's 19-0 run but the NCSU's hot shooting continued. The Pack outscored the Aggies 18-5 over the next 10 minutes of play to take a 68-44 lead going into the fourth quarter.

NCSU's lead to as many as 26 at 77-51 with 4:13 remaining in the game.

The Keydets who have played all Southern Conference foes are 4-0 for the first time since 1981.

With Samford (2-3) ahead 37-30 hobbled VMI quarterback Reece Udinski threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Jakob Herres on fourth-and-3 in overtime then completed a 2-point conversion throw to Michael Jackson in the back of the end zone to win the game.

Udinski completed 40 of 57 for 353 yards three touchdowns and an interception. The Bulldogs’ Liam Welch was 37 of 59 for 570 yards four TDs and two interceptions.

Samford scored 20 straight points to go ahead 30-17 with 8:34 left in regulation and Udinski got hurt soon after a 16-yard touchdown pass to Jackson cut the deficit to 30-24. But he threw a 17-yard TD to Herres down the right sideline on fourth down to tie the score at 30 with 1:11 remaining. Jerry Rice hooked the PAT attempt off the left upright keeping the Keydets from going ahead.

Welch threw a 13-yard TD pass to Montrell Washington on the first overtime possession but never got the ball back."

The shortage in chips the “brain” within every electronic device in the world has been steadily worsening since last year.

Initially the problem was only a temporary delay in supplies as factories shut down when the coronavirus pandemic first hit.

However although production is back to normal a new surge in demand driven by changing habits fuelled by the pandemic means that it is now reaching crisis point.

Car manufacturers investing in tech-heavy electric vehicles the boom in sales of TVs and home computers and launch of new games consoles and 5G-enabled mobile phones have all driven demand.

Even the mighty Apple a $2tn company and the world’s biggest buyer of semiconductors spending $58bn annually was forced to delay the launch of the much-hyped iPhone 12 by two months last year due to the shortage.

“Chips are everything” says Neil Campling media and tech analyst at Mirabaud. “There is a perfect storm of supply and demand factors going on here. But basically there is a new level of demand that can’t be kept up with everyone is in crisis and it is getting worse.”

Ford recently cancelled shifts at two car plants and said profits could be hit by up to $2.5bn this year due to chip shortages while Nissan is idling output at plants in Mexico and the US. General Motors said it could face a $2bn profit hit.

Last month Sony which along with other console makers has struggled with stock shortages over the last year said it might not hit sales targets for the new PS5 this year because of the semiconductor supply issue. Microsoft’s Xbox has said it forecasts supply issues continuing at least until the second half of the year.

However the most telling example of the semiconductor crisis has come from Samsung the world’s second-largest buyer of chips for its products after Apple. Earlier this week the company said it might have to postpone the launch of its high-end smartphone due to the shortage despite also being the world’s second-largest producer of chips.

“It is incredible that Samsung sells $56bn of semiconductors to others and consumes $36bn of them itself finds it may have to delay the launch of one of its own products” says Campling.

Samsung’s co-chief executive Koh Dong-jin who also heads its mobile business unit highlighted a significant issue saying that there is a “serious imbalance” in the pecking order of who is getting the limited supplies of chips.

Car manufacturers who cut chip orders as vehcle sales fell last year found themselves at the back of the queue when they tried to reorder when the market rebounded. The entire global car industry buys about $37bn worth of chips with the biggest players such as Toyota and Volkswagen spending more than $4bn each making them relative minnows for semiconductor suppliers.

“The worst affected have been autos because they were last to the party; if Apple is spending $56bn a year and growing who are you going to keep supplies going to first?” says Campling.

The chip shortage looks set to persist for some time yet. It can take up to two years to get complex semiconductor production factories up and running and manufacturers are in the process of significantly raising prices for the second time in less than a year.

“There is no sign of supply catching up or demand decreasing while prices are rising across the chain” says Campling. “This will cross over to people in the street. Expect cars to cost more phones to cost more. This year’s iPhone is not going to be cheaper than last year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC10cmVuZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTI2MTI0L2NoaW5hcy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9ycy1ob3ctd3VoYW5zLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItY2hpbmVzZS1jaGlwLWNoYW1waW9u0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vdGVjaC90ZWNoLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMjYxMjQvY2hpbmFzLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3JzLWhvdy13dWhhbnMtY2hhbGxlbmdlci1jaGluZXNlLWNoaXAtY2hhbXBpb24?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Wuhan’s dream chip project became a nightmare,"On a rainy and windy Friday afternoon this month the Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (HSMC) campus in Wuhan was empty and silent. The difference from pre-pandemic times in late 2019 could not be more striking. “The streets were very crowded full of all kinds of food stalls and all parking spaces were full” a former HSMC employee told the South China Morning Post.

The promises of semiconductor glory were music to the ears of local authorities that had been trying to claim the high ground in China’s burgeoning semiconductor manufacturing industry. Their dream of claiming the number one spot however has over the past 12 months turned into a “nightmare” of unfulfilled promises.

When Cao Shan promised he could build a chip plant to challenge China’s reigning chip champion Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) the Wuhan local government was quick to jump on board.

But it was not the pandemic that killed HSMC once considered a rising star in China’s chip industry. The project broke ground in the capital city of central China’s Hubei province in early 2018. Backers boasted that the finished plant would produce 30000 wafers a month using advanced 14 nanometre technology for chips used in smartphones and smart cars according to a cached version of the company’s now inactive website.

Three years after its birth the pride turned to humiliation as the whole project was revealed to be built on broken promises the latest in a string of scandals along China’s long road to chip autonomy according to reporting by the Post based on visits to the campus interviews with HSMC employees and its former chief executive and a review of local media reports and government documents.

Cao and the other senior executives behind HSMC have since disappeared. Not a single chip has been produced by the project despite three years of investment. On the Post’s latest visit to the site there were unfinished buildings with bare bricks and steel bars exposed as well as prefabricated houses for workers and wide but empty asphalt roads. The only people visible were some former employees seeking compensation after an abruptly announced dismissal plan.

One HSMC engineer in his 20s dressed in a white hoodie and a grey jacket who declined to be named because he signed a non-disclosure agreement told the Post that he joined the company in 2019 and thought there was a chance the project could go ahead.

“The only thing we lacked was money. It was a really good team. If [the investors] were able to get us the manufacturing equipment I think we could have started production by now” he said.

Building an advanced wafer fab of the kind envisaged by HSMC requires billions of US dollars a highly skilled workforce and many months of fine tuning the complex chip fabrication process before volume production can be achieved. According to a local government report issued last July HSMC’s phase one factory which covered more than 390000 square metres was partially completed but needed more capital and construction of its phase two facility had barely started. As a result the company was not able to apply for central government funding.

All hopes that the facility could still proceed faded after more than 240 HSMC employees including the engineer in the hoodie were asked to resign by March 5. An internal message posted by the company on February 26 and seen by the Post said it has “no plans to resume work and production”.

After Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the country to reduce reliance on imported hi-tech components especially semiconductors the central government rolled out supportive policies from tax breaks to fiscal subsidies for new chip projects. As well city governments across the country rushed to start their own semiconductor projects even though many lacked experience.

“Some local governments that are eager to launch hi-tech projects lack relevant experience and clear understanding of project risks” said Liu Yushi senior analyst at Shanghai-based research firm CINNO. “They simply use generous subsidies and large amounts of capital to attract projects. They should deepen their understanding in relevant industries.”

Wuhan where Covid-19 first struck in China is an industrial powerhouse known for its steel semiconductor and automotive industries. The city is home to Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co and a branch of display panel maker BOE Technology Group.

The failure of HSMC was a setback but it won’t deter China’s push for self-sufficiency in chips according to analysts. Beijing reiterated its goal to become self-sufficient in the technology in its latest five-year plan for 2021-2025.

“There is a lot of money willing to invest in semiconductors [in China] but whether it can be made the best use of or invested efficiently is a big question” said Roger Sheng a semiconductor analyst at research firm Gartner.

In 2014 the central government set up the China National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund known as the Big Fund which has since completed two rounds of financing and raised capital of 138.7 billion yuan and 204.1 billion yuan respectively. Local governments in China including Beijing Shanghai Guangdong Sichuan Hubei Jiangsu and Fujian have also provided guidance funds totalling more than 300 billion yuan to support their own semiconductor industries according to public reports.

China’s Nasdaq-style Star Market is another funding channel for the chip industry with the sector accounting for 30 per cent of its total market value according to Winsoul Capital a tech investment firm. In the private market Winsoul said there were 413 semiconductor-related equity investments last year worth more than 140 billion yuan a nearly fourfold increase over the previous year.

“I call it an engine and gearbox problem” said Warren Zhou Hualin senior investment manager at Decent Capital a venture capital firm founded by Tencent co-founder Jason Zeng. “Since 2018 large-scale investments in the industry have provided enough energy for the engine but our gearbox is not good enough … and China is slowly tuning it.”

First announced in November 2017 as part of a local government investment plan HSMC’s facility would create 50000 jobs directly or indirectly and have an annual output of 60 billion yuan (US$9.25 billion) once running at full capacity local authorities said at the time.

The Dongxihu district government put up the initial 200 million yuan investment in HSMC but the company’s owner – a Beijing based firm – has still not fulfilled its commitment to inject capital of 1.8 billion yuan into the project according to corporate records.

The first cracks appeared in 2019 when a Wuhan court put a three-year hold on HSMC’s use of 220000 square metres of land that had been designated for its phase two project. It followed a complaint by a construction contractor who said the chip company and its main contractor still owed it millions of yuan for the first phase of construction.

Regardless HSMC’s leaders staged a high-profile event in December 2019 to celebrate the purchase of its first piece of high-end equipment: a lithography system from ASML  the Dutch firm that makes the expensive machines that use wavelengths of light to print circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. But HSMC management quickly pledged the new system as collateral to borrow more than 500 million yuan from a local bank.

HSMC scored another coup in 2019 when it recruited industry veteran Chiang Shang-yi as its chief executive. That gave the project instant credibility as Chiang was once the R&D director at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) the world’s biggest chip foundry. Two ex-HSMC engineers told the Post that they agreed to join the company mainly because of Chiang’s involvement but soon sensed something was wrong after they heard rumours about funding problems.

On the surface it all seemed fine. “Before the pandemic hit over 2000 workers came in and out every day to build the wafer fab and everything was in full swing. There were people everywhere” said one of the engineers the Post spoke to. Even after the coronavirus outbreak HSMC continued to pay staff salaries while other companies in the city were laying people off and cutting salaries during the citywide lockdown from late January to early April.

A major setback came in June when Chiang suddenly announced he was leaving. He later told the Post in a written message that his experience at HSMC was a “nightmare” and that he was unaware of the extent of its financial difficulties until the local government exposed the problem in the July 2020 report.

The HSMC engineer told the Post that despite the rumours and media reports about the company’s funding issues it was still hiring engineering staff last May and June and employee numbers peaked at more than 400 around that time. The engineer himself was busy through to September of last year communicating with equipment suppliers in the US Japan and Singapore.

In December the HSMC project was taken over by the Wuhan city government which brought in a new management team. One former employee said the new people were not known in the semiconductor industry.

HSMC may be a high profile failure but it is not the first case of a poorly planned semiconductor project in China. Earlier last year a US$100 million plant set up by US chip foundry GlobalFoundries and the Chengdu city government ceased operations after remaining idle for almost two years . In the country’s east a US$3 billion government-backed chip project owned by Tacoma Nanjing Semiconductor Technology went bankrupt in July after failing to attract investors.

After more than 10 high-profile government-sponsored semiconductor projects were reported to have gone bust over the past two years the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in October that Beijing would strengthen supervision of new entrants into the “chaotic” industry.

Shanghai-based research firm Icwise reported that companies in traditional industries – including some involved in the production of cement clothing and even decorations – have made high-profile announcements in semiconductor-related projects.

“[The chip industry] is going through a similar path as the solar power and new energy vehicle industries” said Xu Mengnan assistant general manager for TMT investment at Hengqin Financial Investment. “In the early stage there are lots of aggressive investments and support [which lead to] various problems. However it’s a necessary process for the tide to wash out the sand and leave the gold on the shore.”

As of March 5 most HSMC employees had resigned receiving one-month’s salary as compensation. The company logos and signage have been taken down but former employees will likely rebound quickly as chip making expertise is in high demand in China. The first ex-HSMC engineer said he and most former colleagues have already got new job offers.

For the Wuhan government it has been a painful lesson. “For China’s hi-tech industry it’s not necessarily a bad thing” said Zhou from Decent Capital. “HSMC is like a whale. After its death its corpse – the talent and equipment – will soon be digested by others [in the ocean] so it’s not a waste for the entire ecosystem.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdHJpY2ttb29yaGVhZC8yMDIxLzAzLzIxL29uLXNlbWktYnJpbmdzLWxpZGFyLXRvLWF1dG9tb3RpdmUtc2Vuc29yLXBvcnRmb2xpby13aXRoLW5ldy1zaXBtLWFycmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ON Semi Brings LiDAR To Automotive Sensor Portfolio With New SiPM Array,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2021/03/21/on-semi-brings-lidar-to-automotive-sensor-portfolio-with-new-sipm-array/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdHJpY2ttb29yaGVhZC8yMDIxLzAzLzIxL29uLXNlbWktYnJpbmdzLWxpZGFyLXRvLWF1dG9tb3RpdmUtc2Vuc29yLXBvcnRmb2xpby13aXRoLW5ldy1zaXBtLWFycmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzUxNzYyOTgzLTAwYmMtNDAxNy1hZWFiLTEyYmU4MDJjM2NjNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renesas warns of hit to global chip supply after factory fire,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Meet the tech geek brothers from Co Tipperary who currently share a combined fortune of €23 billion.

Brainboxes Patrick and John Collison are now technically Ireland's second richest people being pipped at the top for the moment by Hilary Alannah and Galen Jr Weston and family whose companies include Penneys Brown Thomas and Selfridges.

Fresh-faced Patrick (32) and John (30) still have quite a jump to make it into the top ten list of billionaires who earned their wealth from technology.

But the brothers from Dromineer about 10km from Nenagh are on cloud nine having turned Stripe an online payments processor into the most valuable private company Silicon Valley has ever produced.

Stripe is an internet payment procurer which allows companies to quickly process online payments from customers.

Handling almost 5000 transaction requests a second it takes a cut of around 1.4 per cent and a flat fee of 20c per transaction and thanks to lockdown its usage has gone off the charts.

It's a far cry from playing cops and robbers when growing up in a sleepy hamlet on the shores of Lough Derg where they lived in a remote area mostly populated by cows.

Every day they'd each check out at least two books from the local library on everything and anything which they'd devour in a night and return the next morning.

One day Patrick selected a couple of books about the internet and computer programming - and that was that.

""Instead of using the internet I used to borrow books from the library about the internet"" he recalls. ""I read everything I could find. It was like staring through the glass to this amazing world out there but none of it was available.""

At the ages of 13 and 11 Patrick and John researched prepared and delivered a formal pitch to their parents proposing that they buy a special German satellite connection that would finally give them access to the World Wide Web.

""After that we were off down a rabbit hole"" smiles Patrick.

Meanwhile their parents both from scientific backgrounds and entrepreneurs busy with their own projects - their father ran a 24-room hotel and their mother set up a corporate training company - left them to blossom.

Suddenly every minute of their spare time was spent programming teaching themselves coding and for a bit of extra fun hacking each other's websites to reinforce the importance of cyber security.

After being ranked runner-up when he was 15 in 2004 Patrick was crowned Young Scientist of the Year in 2005 for developing a programming language and artificial intelligence system.

He managed to complete his Leaving Cert cycle in 20 days rather than over two years and enrolled in MIT in Boston at the age of 16.

John followed him to America a couple of years later and won a place in Harvard.

Together again they spent their spare time developing iPhone apps and working on a software company and dropped out of college to concentrate on Auctomatic Inc a software company that built tools for eBay which sold in 2008 for $5m when they were just 19 and 17.

Two years later having spotted a gap in the market they set up Stripe which within a couple of years was being touted by developers and investors in Silicon Valley as the company to watch.

While Patrick insists they didn't set out to build a large company just solve the problem of a lack of a global payment mechanism for internet trading companies Stripe has far exceeded all expectations.

Founded in 2010 Stripe's valuation has almost tripled in the past year surpassing anything achieved by companies such as Facebook or Uber before they went public and according to John Collison the company is now 'bigger [by payment volumes] than the entire ecommerce market' was when they started working on it.

The Collison brothers now own a company worth $95 billion which boasts former Bank of England governor Mark Carney on its board.

Nine of the 20 wealthiest people in the world are tech tycoons and here's who the Collisons will be chasing in the years to come.

News of in the wild exploitation comes on the heels of a proof-of-concept exploit code that surfaced online earlier this week by reverse-engineering the Java software patch in BIG-IP. The mass scans are said to have spiked since March 18.

The flaws affect BIG-IP versions 11.6 or 12.x and newer with a critical remote code execution (CVE-2021-22986) also impacting BIG-IQ versions 6.x and 7.x. CVE-2021-22986 (CVSS score: 9.8) is notable for the fact that it's an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability affecting the iControl REST interface allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands create or delete files and disable services without the need for any authentication.

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a full compromise of susceptible systems including the possibility of remote code execution as well as trigger a buffer overflow leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

While F5 said it wasn't aware of any public exploitation of these issues on March 10 researchers from NCC Group said they have now found evidence of ""full chain exploitation of F5 BIG-IP/BIG-IQ iControl REST API vulnerabilities CVE-2021-22986"" in the wake of multiple exploitation attempts against its honeypot infrastructure.

Additionally Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team said it found attempts to exploit CVE-2021-22986 to install a variant of the Mirai botnet. But it's not immediately clear if those attacks were successful.

Given the popularity of BIG-IP/BIG-IQ in corporate and government networks it should come as no surprise that this is the second time in a year F5 appliances have become a lucrative target for exploitation.

Last July the company addressed a similar critical flaw (CVE-2020-5902) following which it was abused by Iranian and Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue an alert cautioning of a ""broad scanning activity for the presence of this vulnerability across federal departments and agencies.""

""The bottom line is that [the flaws] affect all BIG-IP and BIG-IQ customers and instances — we urge all customers to update their BIG-IP and BIG-IQ deployments to the fixed versions as soon as possible"" F5 Senior Vice President Kara Sprague noted last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWN1cml0eS9mb3J0aW5ldC1hY3F1aXJlcy1jbG91ZC1hbmQtbmV0d29yay1zZWN1cml0eS1zdGFydHVwLXNoaWVsZHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fortinet Acquires Cloud And Network Security Startup ShieldX,"Fortinet Acquires Cloud And Network Security Startup ShieldX

‘I cannot think of a better landing spot for ShieldX than Fortinet ... I know this transaction has the potential to be incredibly good for all involved’ ShieldX CEO Ken Levine wrote on LinkedIn late Friday.

Fortinet has quietly purchased cloud and network security startup ShieldX to give customers a more comprehensive view of end users workstations and OT devices.

The Sunnyvale Calif.-based platform security vendor closed its acquisition of San Jose Calif.-based ShieldX March 10 a Fortinet spokesperson told CRN but the company hadn’t publicly announced the deal. ShieldX CEO Ken Levine posted about the Fortinet transaction on LinkedIn late Friday which followed a Monday LinkedIn post on the deal by Dave Karp ShieldX’s SVP of product management and marketing.

“I cannot think of a better landing spot for ShieldX than Fortinet” Levine wrote on LinkedIn Friday. “I know this transaction has the potential to be incredibly good for all involved.”

ShieldX’s relationship with Fortinet started at the February 2020 RSA Conference according to Levine. He said on LinkedIn that the Fortinet team was an “absolute pleasure to deal with even if appropriately tough on some matters!!”

Fortinet is not disclosing how much it paid for ShieldX according to a company spokesperson.

“After 18 months at ShieldX I can say with certainty that … this was as smart and as talented and as passionate a team one could wish to be part of” Levine wrote on LinkedIn. “Adding [in] an exceptional board and advisors it was a privilege to be CEO.”

The combination of Fortinet and ShieldX has created an integrated offering to address lateral movement prevention as well as the convergence of OT campus and multi-cloud data center segmentation ShieldX wrote on a blog posted to the company’s website March 8. ShieldX said it can extend perimeter security and campus segmentation with east-west lateral movement prevention.

The joint company can better protect data and applications across all environments thanks to the combination of Fortinet’s network security and ShieldX’s customer visibility and controls the company said. Fortinet’s threat intelligence and alerts combined with the analysis of traffic flowing east-west in the data center should lead to faster response times according to ShieldX.

ShieldX said it can autogenerate security policies for proper segmentation as well as provide context and quantify risk for all assets communicating with applications. The company said its patented microservices architecture allows the platform to elastically scale security while recording all changes in a report to ensure compliance.

The company said its unsupervised machine learning can generate security policies based on the risk score associated with vulnerabilities in the application structure. ShieldX said it can also automatically prevent exploits from attacking the vulnerabilities through deep packet inspection as well as the automated creation and deployment of security policies.

This is Fortinet’s third deal in the past eight months and comes three months after the company bought Panopta for $34 million to automate management of servers containers applications databases cloud infrastructure and virtual appliances. The company also bought Opaq for $8 million in July to strengthen distributed network protection from data centers and branch offices to remote users and IoT devices.

ShieldX was founded in 2015 raised $34 million of outside funding and employs 43 people down from a high of 64 employees in April 2019 according to LinkedIn and Crunchbase. The company closed a $25 million Series B round in December 2017 led by Bain Capital Ventures and followed that with an August 2019 investment for an undisclosed amount from Thomvest Ventures.

The company has a number of high-profile board members including FireEye Founder Ashar Aziz former Symantec President and COO Michael Fey former Palo Alto Networks President Mark Anderson NTT Security CEO Matthew Gyde and Aspect Ventures Co-Founder Theresia Gouw who lead the firm’s early investments in Cato Networks Exabeam and Forescout.

The same month Thomvest invested Levine joined Shield X as CEO following nearly five years leading Waltham Mass.-based data protection vendor Digital Guardian. “It did not take long for me to recognize that ShieldX is where I wanted to be if the founders and board would have me” Levine wrote on a ShieldX blog at the time of his arrival.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3Mvd2h5LWh1bnRyZXNzLXdhbnRzLXlvdS10by1icmVhay1vdXQteW91ci1oYWNrZXItaG9vZGllLWFuZC1nZXQtc2hhZHkvMjAyMS8wMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Huntress Wants You to 'Break Out Your Hacker Hoodie and Get Shady',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/why-huntress-wants-you-to-break-out-your-hacker-hoodie-and-get-shady/2021/03/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3Mvd2h5LWh1bnRyZXNzLXdhbnRzLXlvdS10by1icmVhay1vdXQteW91ci1oYWNrZXItaG9vZGllLWFuZC1nZXQtc2hhZHkvMjAyMS8wMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtpbmZvc2VjdXJpdHkuY29tL2hhY2tlcnMtYXJlLWV4cGxvaXRpbmctY3JpdGljYWwtZjUtbmV0d29ya3MtdnVsbmVyYWJpbGl0eS1hLTE2MjM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Attackers Exploiting F5 Networks' BIG-IP Vulnerability,"3rd Party Risk Management  Breach Notification  Cybercrime

Attackers Exploiting F5 Networks' BIG-IP Vulnerability

Flaw in Network Traffic Security Management Platform Ranked as Highly Critical

Attackers are exploiting a critical remote code vulnerability in F5 Networks' BIG-IP platform tracked as CVE-2021-22986 for which the company released patches on March 10.

See Also: Digital Transformation: Better Ops Agile Apps Faster Business

The vulnerability which has a CVSS ranking of 9.8 out of 10 - highly critical - is a remote command execution flaw in BIG-IP a network traffic security management appliance.

By exploiting the flaw unauthenticated attackers can gain access to BIG-IP’s management interface and self IP addresses and execute arbitrary system commands create or delete files and disable services F5 Networks says.

On Thursday security firm NCC Group said attackers were chaining multiple BIG-IP vulnerabilities with CVE-2021-22986. NCC added that an exploit for the vulnerability is likely to be available in the public domain soon.

In another alert on Friday security firm Palo Alto Networks said a Mirai botnet variant is chaining the BIG-IP with another flaw as part of an attack although the company did not clarify if the Mirai attacks were successful.

We are now observing the Mirai variant from https://t.co/ZDTVwtdYlq attempting to exploit CVE-2021-22986 an unauthenticated RCE in F5 BIG-IP & BIG-IQ products and CVE-2020-28188.



IOCs for the new activity available at:https://t.co/bc0IySEAEk pic.twitter.com/ZsUqxq60XO — Unit 42 (@Unit42_Intel) March 19 2021

NCC Alert

The NCC Group report notes the attacks exploiting the flaw unfold in two stages. In the first stage the attackers leveraged the BIG-IP flaw to gain an authenticated session token; this was then used to interact with the application API endpoint.

Using the token the attackers extract browser cookies that allow the threat actors to access a web-based interface which then enables them to remotely control the application.

The second step of the attack occurs when the victim’s device calls the attacker-controlled API. The report further notes the attackers have been using this method to access honeypots set-up by the researchers.

""Starting this week and especially in the last 24 hours [March 18] we have observed multiple exploitation attempts against our honeypot infrastructure"" the NCC report notes. ""Fortunately the attackers got the details of the exploit wrong and attempted a chain of events that could not possibly work.""

Other Vulnerabilities

Researchers and government agencies have warned of several other significant vulnerabilities found in various popular products this month.

For example Microsoft issued emergency software patches for four zero-day vulnerabilities in its Exchange email server (see: Microsoft Patches Four Zero-Day Flaws in Exchange).

Following the Microsoft alert the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency warned that scanning activity for the vulnerabilities had picked up in recent days. It stressed that federal agencies and private firms should apply patches or disconnect internet-facing systems until the bugs are fixed.",,,

The online payment platform PayPal has warned users in France and Belgium of a new scam by which crooks try to harvest your personal and financial details using a fake email.

The technique is known as phishing and involves criminals posing as a trusted entity like a company in order to gain your trust and convince you to hand over details that will then allow them to crack your financial accounts.

Typically that takes the form of an email explaining some catastrophic breakdown and asking you to follow a link where you are asked to provide crucial details such as email password account password or bank details.

The phishing email looks official with a PayPal logo and reads as follows (but in French):

“Your account is the subject of suspicious transactions. We have temporarily restricted your account due to this suspicious activity until the issue is resolved. If you have not authorised this transaction please dispute the transaction as soon as possible by clicking the button below.”

Standard practice for the scammers is first of all to sow the seeds of panic in the mind of the recipient knowing that a panic reaction immediately makes the recipient less wary of possible risk. The message concludes by suggesting an easy solution: click on a link and all will be well.

Of course the recipient disputes the transaction listed as it has been invented by the thieves and never took place. But once they have visited the link concerned they are vulnerable to other kinds of fraud including the installation of malware.

Despite appearances there is one way to check if the email is really from PayPal or from fraudsters: the headers will reveal that the mail is coming from an @skynet address.

PayPal warns recipients that it always sends communications to customers from an @paypal address and certainly not from Skynet – an old domain owned by Proximus.

The platform advises recipients to report the email to the authorities via safeonweb.be then delete it.

It’s called Stripe and this week the latest round of investments in it have given it a valuation of $95bn (£68.5bn). It was founded in 2010 by two smart young lads from rural Ireland – the brothers John and Patrick Collison – who were then aged 19 and 21 respectively. The latest valuation of their company – based on a recent investment of $600m from investors including Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency Fidelity and Sequoia Capital – means that each now has a net worth on paper in the region of $11.5bn.

The Collisons hail from Dromineer a small town on the shores of Lough Derg in County Tipperary. When they were growing up it was too remote to have an internet connection and initially the only way they could get decent broadband was via an expensive satellite link. In some ways they look like young prodigies from central casting. As a teenager Patrick discovered Lisp the programming language that was once the lingua franca of early AI programmers and used it to create a conversational system that won him Ireland’s young scientist of the year award in 2005 at the age of 16. His brother two years younger got the highest scores ever recorded in the Irish school leaving certificate.

When John was 15 and Patrick 17 they launched their first startups: Auctomatic – a software-as-a-service platform for big sellers on eBay to track inventory and traffic – and an iPhone app providing an offline copy of Wikipedia (which they described as “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”) on the phone. They sold Auctomatic for $5m to a Canadian company where Patrick worked for a year (he had dropped out of MIT in the time-honoured geek fashion) while John was at Harvard.

Listening to Patrick tell the story – as he does in a terrific 2012 interview on YouTube – one is tempted to reach for a keyboard and begin writing the screenplay for a Local Hero sequel. And yet there’s a hard edge of reality to it. The two entrepreneurs were inveterate tinkerers who stumbled on a problem that bugged nearly everybody on the net at the time but which nobody had solved: the fact that while it was easy to sell stuff online setting up a system that could securely take customers’ money was infuriatingly difficult and expensive. It involved getting a merchant account with various credit card companies frustrating delays (the usual “five working days”) and very high transaction fees. All over the internet there were startups that had (as one founder put it) “a growing wait-list of people that wanted to give us money but couldn’t”. The Collison brothers realised Patrick said that “the online payments industry was an unusually compelling example of an entire industry that is going to have its lunch eaten”.

Having discovered such a tempting meal they proceeded to feast on it. Stripe was designed to make it as easy to set up an online payment system as to tick a box on a website. Its software made it simple for any website or app to accept payments without having to obtain its own licences or strike deals with the many different banks and card operators. In return Stripe levies a fixed 2.9% fee. Given that it was predictable that online businesses large and small went for it like ravening wolves – including people one wouldn’t have predicted.

Writers for example. As traditional journalistic outlets have withered and as even those still standing have become unable or unwilling to pay writers new blogging platforms such as Medium and Substack have emerged with different ways of enabling writers to earn a crust. The daily version of my blog for example is on Substack and it’s free to subscribers. But if for some reason I decided to charge a monthly fee all I’d have to do is click on a button and Stripe would do the rest. And it turns out that many well-known writers and journalists have clicked that button in that past year or so.

It’s easy to see why. Some of them (like Andrew Sullivan or Glenn Greenwald or Scott Alexander to name just three) have many thousands of subscribers. Just as a thought experiment do the numbers: an author has 2000 subscribers willing to pay £5 a month. That’s £10000 a month gross income. Stripe takes its 2.9% (£293) and Substack its 10% (£1000) – which leaves £8700 to keep the wolf from the door. All from clicking on a button.

Stripe’s current valuation may or may not turn out to be optimistic. The industry that it has disrupted may have been dozy once but it will get its act together and the Collisons will find themselves operating in a more competitive marketplace. On the other hand one of the few certainties in life at the moment is that online commerce is going to grow. And however large it gets the two lads will have a slice of it. Three per cent of a big number is also a big number.

Bellingham’s club team-mate Jadon Sancho would have been in the same situation but the 20-year-old has been ruled out through injury.

Germany’s strict travel regulations had led to a number of Champions League fixtures being moved to neutral venues in recent weeks with Manchester City and Liverpool playing German opposition in Budapest earlier this month.

England face three World Cup qualifiers in the coming days with both San Marino and Poland due at Wembley either side of a trip to Albania.

Bellingham made his England debut in November appearing as a second-half substitute in the 3-0 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland becoming England’s third youngest full international in the process.

On Saturday Bellingham revealed he had been the target of racist abuse on social media with both Dortmund and the FA issuing statements in support.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY3J5cHRvbm9taXN0LmNoLzIwMjEvMDMvMjEvY291bnRyaWVzLXRoYXQtYWNjZXB0LWJpdGNvaW4tYXMtcGF5bWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Countries that accept Bitcoin as payments,"There is no doubt that Bitcoin is the world’s most famous and widely-used cryptocurrency and because of its rising value merchants and countries started to accept Bitcoin as a payment method.

Nowadays several countries made it legal to use Bitcoin as a payment method and made it possible to get profit through Bitcoins as well. In this article you’ll get information about the countries and cities which adopted Bitcoin as a payment method and are using it in everyday life.

Until going into depths it should be said that the number of well-known companies that are allowing their customers to pay with Bitcoin is growing rapidly. For instance a luxury US hotel chain Uber allows customers to reserve their preferred hotel by using Bitcoin. What’s more one of the most prominent companies PayPal allows its users to buy and sell Bitcoins through PayPal accounts.

The United States of America

The United States is one of the countries which allow people to use Bitcoin as a payment method. However it should be said that as long as it’s a federal country the jurisdiction for each state is different. So while trading through Bitcoins traders need to find whether it is legit to trade with Bitcoin in a certain state or not.

The USA has taken positive changes about using BTCs as a payment method since 2013. There are several cities in the USA which are Bitcoin hotspots including San Francisco which is home to several cryptocurrency trading platforms. More specifically more than two dozen merchants are adopting Bitcoin as a payment system.

Bitcoin payments in European Union

Most of the EU countries are allowing residents to use Bitcoin while paying. However there are some exceptional countries like Germany that prohibit Bitcoin trading. One of the most famous countries in the EU where it’s allowed to use BTC as a payment method is the Netherlands. The capital city of the Netherlands – Amsterdam is home to one of the most well-known hardware makers Bitfury. In Amsterdam where the number of residents is 840 000 the above-mentioned digital currency is widely used and enables people to pay for numerous services. What’s more one of the most prominent EU countries which are using BTCs for payments is Slovenia. Ljubljana which is the capital of the aforementioned country is the place where the prominent bitcoin exchange Bitstamp was established. The number of the city’s residents is around 290 000 and there are more than 200 service suppliers that are adopting BTCs as the main payment method.

Since there are many countries which adopt BTCs and allow people to pay through digital currencies more and more people are starting to get Bitcoins. Therefore people’s interest in where and how to buy Bitcoin is growing respectively. There are several sites and platforms that furnish people with different services. So people have to research and see what are the main advantages of getting BTCs through a certain platform. What’s more every process for buying Bitcoin is conducted in an online way.

Switzerland

Switzerland is the prominent country among those states which allow people to use BTCs for taxation purposes. It can be said that Switzerland is one of the pioneer countries which accepted digital currency as a payment for some public services. Switzerland started the trial scheme from the town of Zug which is also known as the crypto-valley because of its attitude towards cryptocurrencies. What’s more Zug wasn’t the first location in Switzerland where it was adopted paying taxations through BTCs. Zermatt which is also one of the most resided municipalities allowed swiss people to use BTCs for payment purposes including for public services. Moreover Swiss Federal Railways which is a government-owned railway company allows people to buy tickets with Bitcoins.

Countries where the BTC is legal

Numerous countries around the world permit people to trade with BTCs. Some of them are the above-mentioned countries.

JACKSONVILLE Fla. — We've heard all about studies on how effective coronavirus vaccines are against preventing severe disease and a first-of-its kind study out of Israel looked at how effective the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is for those who are asymptomatic.

The study looked at people who got the Pfizer shot in Israel from January through March 6 of this year. It showed the vaccine is 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infection.

“I got my second Pfizer shot March 17th"" Elizabeth Gans said.

Elizabeth Gans has been spending the past year gardening doing puzzles spending time with her Maine Coon Toby and looking forward to having a little more normalcy with her husband Jerry.

“Yes! My husband and I can go out. We can eat. We can start traveling. It’s a freedom we haven’t had for a year"" Gans said.

Both Elizabeth and Jerry got their vaccines this month.

“I was so happy to read about the high percentage of how effective it is"" Gans said.

Gans is happy to learn the study shows the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine could help prevent her from asymptomatically spreading the disease to others.

“So if we know that these vaccines and this vaccine specifically is effective against asymptomatic infection you can interpret that as it may lead to decreased asymptomatic transmission to others"" said Dr. Mohammed Reza an infectious disease specialist.

The study also showed the Pfizer vaccine is 97% effective in preventing severe COVID-19 cases hospitalizations and death.

“The U.K. variant was the predominant variant in Israel when this study was performed so that’s important since that variant is going to become the predominant variant in the United States by the end of this month"" Reza said.

Reza said even though the study is promising you should still take safety precautions.

“It’s been a big political fight going back and forth with masks and that you don’t have to wear a mask if you’ve been vaccinated. No that’s not true"" Reza explained. ""The important point is yes if you’ve been vaccinated and you’re two weeks out there is a low risk of you having a poor outcome but we can’t say the same with the different variants that we’re seeing.”

Reza also says the UK variant was the predominant variant in Israel during the study and that's significant because he predicts that variant will also be the predominant variant here in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L2NvbW11bml0aWVzL25vcnRoc2hvcmUvbmV3cy9mb3gtcG9pbnQvMjAyMS8wMy8yMS8ybmQtZG9zZS1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLWNvbW11bml0eS1jbGluaWMtZm94LXBvaW50LzQ3OTM2OTYwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2nd Dose COVID Vaccine Community Clinic in Fox Point,"FOX POINT NEWS

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhcnRhbnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9saXN0LW9mLXNjaG9vbHMtbXN1LXRyYW5zZmVyLXBnLWFqLWhvZ2dhcmQtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1jb25zaWRlcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of schools MSU transfer PG AJ Hoggard is reportedly considering,"Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard has reportedly cut the lists of schools he’s considering to only five programs.

He will long be remembered as a pioneer and visionary of the pulp and paper industry and holds a special place in the heart and history of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

Recognized for his remarkable business and socio-environmental activity Lorentzen was one of the pioneering members of the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD now WBCSD) in the early 1990s and in 1997 founded BCSD Brazil (CEBDS Conselho Empresarial Brasileiro para o Desenvolvimento Sustentável) with Eliezer Batista. He was an early believer in developing business with social and environmental responsibility and in realizing the true value of our natural resources.

In 1992 Lorentzen penned the chapter on forestry and agriculture in the ground-breaking book Changing Course: A Global Business Perspective on Development and the Environment invited to do so by Stephan Schmidheiny as part of the BCSD taskforce. The book marked the first time that global business formulated its views on sustainable development following the 1987 Brundtland report which had laid down the guiding principles for the practice.

Lorentzen had been inspired by the tenets of sustainable development some years earlier through his own efforts to create jobs and improve social conditions in Brazil in an environmentally sound way. Aracruz founded by Lorentzen in 1972 is considered Brazil’s first pulp mill.

His commitment to changing business for the better never faltered. At the Rio Summit in 1992 following the publication of Changing Course Lorentzen urged Schmidheiny and Council Members to reconsider the disbanding of BCSD which was due to happen after Rio. He recalled what he had said to Schmidheiny in an interview with Lloyd Timberlake for Catalyzing Change: A Short History of the WBCSD in 2006: “We should see if we can continue to be of value. If we can’t then OK let it die. But not at this moment when all of us are the most excited and there is all this momentum. We should try to keep it going. There is so much more to do.”

As a result a new organization with a commitment to making a difference was founded and in 1995 BSCD merged with the World Industry Council on the Environment (WICE) and about 120 member companies then to become what we now know as WBCSD today. Lorentzen’s significant role in charting this course is irrefutable.

He continued to pioneer a path ahead of his time. Through Aracruz he was dedicated to planting more trees than were being cut down and harvested only planted (not old and ancient) trees. This passion led him to found WBCSD’s first sectoral project for forestry company members – and an independent study into the issue of global forest pulp and paper companies.

The resulting report by the International Institute for Environment and Development Towards a Sustainable Paper Cycle in 1996 returned a series of recommendations and conclusions covering forest management to recycling. These supported Lorentzen’s thesis about the soundness of plantation strategy. Aracruz had been following most of the report’s advice before it was published.

This as Timberlake wrote was the first time that an industry had taken the initiative to have an independent party produce standards and recommendations it could use to police itself around environmental concerns. The report also led to the creation of the Forest Solutions Group still run by WBCSD today.

Norwegian by birth but Brazilian at heart Lorentzen continued to remain active in the Brazilian forest sector long after the sale of Aracruz in 2009 and was still inspiring others well into his 90s sharing his ideas at BCSD Brazil’s conference Sustentável (Sustainable) in 2016.

Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) as the name suggests are an essential set of patents used for the implementation of a standardized technology. This set of patents renders it impossible to implement or operate standard-compliant equipment without infringement. Does that mean every patent declared by any company is essential? In a word no. This article intends to address this aspect in detail and pave way for licensees to save costs and pay for what they use in their implementations.

Standards-Based IP Rights

The issue of standards-based IP rights has been extensively discussed over the years. However it still contains intricacies that are often overlooked. Patent-specific standards and IP rights comprise the core strategy of a company to achieve a global presence and acquire the market muscle. Standards Setting Organizations (SSOs) such as the International Telecommunication Union – Telecommunication (ITU-T) International Telecommunication Union – Radiocommunication (ITU-R) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) and IEEE- Standards Association (IEEE-SA) are responsible for announcing the patent submissions received from portfolio owners as per their underlying patent policies.

While the process of setting standards acts at the heart of technology promotion it poses several challenges at the time of standard creation and adoption. The first challenge arises with the screening of declared patents as the declarant company may over-declare in the pursuit of revenue generation given the underlying policy structure of SSOs.

Similarly patent pools organize the licensing for SEPs to mitigate transactional costs and prevent royalty stacking. The two SEP licensing frameworks and the diversions from their underlying motivations are discussed in further detail below.

SSOs’ Declaration Policies

The common patent declaration policy statement for ITU-T ITU-R ISO and IEC which may be located on the ITU’s official website explicitly disassociates itself from being in a position to give authoritative or comprehensive information about evidence validity or scope of patents or any similar rights.

Similarly the ETSI policy statement reads no different and continues to add a scope for over-declarations as it reads “the submitted patent may be or may become essential in ETSI works”(though it doesn’t ask for blanket disclosures like others). On similar lines the IEEE-SA’s patent declaration policy statement reads “the submitter may but isn’t required to identify one or more of its patent claims that it believes might be or become essential.”

Although SSOs exist as a driving force for industry innovators to work in collaboration and select the most promising innovations for future industry they have miserably failed to evaluate and screen the declared SEP disclosures. For instance recent studies have found that only 28% 29% and 50% of patent families declared essential corresponding to the ETSI’s 2G 3G and 4G telecom standards respectively were found to be essential to the standardized implementations. This essentially means that it’s only the trust factor that binds the declarants towards fair declarations.

Similarly in the Unwired Planet v. Huawei decision the court noted: “A very significant reason why one cannot just count up declared patent families is recognition of the problem of over declaration.” The issue was the same in the TCL Communication v. Ericsson case where the essentiality of the declared patents was questioned.

How Beneficial Have Patent Pools Been?

Patent pools are created to assist technology-implementing organizations in averting the risk of being sued by patent holders and offer market convenience allowing licensees coverage under as many patents as possible. However there’s no assurance that all essential patent holders with their patents have been included.

Take the case of HEVC (H.265) for which there have been three separate patent pools. These organizations include MPEG LA (which includes Canon Apple Samsung Electronics and JVC Kenwood Corp) Velos Media (including Ericsson Panasonic Qualcomm Sharp and Sony) and Access Advance (including Warner Bros. Entertainment Dolby Labs Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Samsung Electronics).

Here a patent holder is free to join any pool or put their trust in different or multiple patent pools. For instance Samsung Electronics has become a member (licensor/ licensee) of both Access Advance HEVC/H.265 Licensing Program and MPEG LA’s patent pool.

In contrary to the very purpose of patent pools multi-channel video providers have frequently reiterated that the cause of delayed HEVC deployments is the existence of multiple patent pools and their complex methods of royalty schemes — a licensee may need to purchase a license from multiple pools as well as other patent owners unaffiliated to any of the pools.

These two differently-structured collaborations aiming to contribute towards the noble cause of creating industry and innovator cooperation appear to have failed in accomplishing their underlying mission. There is an increasing need for fine-tuning the working of both to bring fairness into the much-claimed fair reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) licensing.

The Way Forward Under Current Policy Structure

Under the current policy structure licensees end up paying elevated royalties (not all declared patents are SEPs). There have been instances when declared patents were not adopted in the final version of a standard or its features were not essential in a particular implementation of the standard. Before taking any licenses determining the actual value placed on the essentiality of a patent can be greatly beneficial.

Meanwhile the onus is on licensees to ensure that the claimed FRAND terms are fair to their products and implementations.

Hempfield plant,"Specialty foods executive Mike Thompson was used to brushing off the one inquiry he’d get every month or so from some firm or another that was interested in buying his Lancaster Fine Foods.

But when he got inquiries from five firms in a single month last August he decided it was time to start listening. And when he took that step rising to the top “very quickly” was California-based Stir Foods.

That’s how the contract manufacturer of sauces dressings and condiments for other food companies ended up getting acquired last month for an undisclosed price a transaction that will lead to a sizable expansion for the small business.

“Stir Foods allows us to grow to the benefit of our customers employees and stockholders” Thompson said Thursday. “It’s a great opportunity (for us to join) with a company that has a very similar culinary philosophy on packaged goods.”

After emerging from bankruptcy reorganization in 2018 Lancaster Fine Foods generated $15 million in annual revenue. That ended when the pandemic began last year and slashed revenue to $10 million. Nonetheless Lancaster Fine Foods retained all of its 53 employees and kept them all working full time.

But as Stir Foods Lancaster the local plant is destined to bounce back bigger since it’s the only East Coast site of its new owner. That positions the plant to assume production for Stir Foods’ customers on the East Coast and deliver product to them more quickly and cheaply than Stir Foods can do from its five California plants and one in Toronto.

Producing for those Stir Foods customers on the East Coast as well as projected growth in sales to the plant’s existing customers is expected to result in at least $30 million in additional annual revenue to the plant within three years.

That upswing in turn is expected to lead to 80 new jobs at the Lancaster site in that same time frame said Thompson now president of Stir Foods Lancaster after being CEO of Lancaster Fine Foods which he co-founded in 2008.

To meet the new demand Stir Foods Lancaster anticipates investing $4 million to $5 million in additional production equipment a project for which it’s seeking financial support from the state Thompson said.

“Our plan” said Stir Foods CEO Milt Liu “is to invest into Lancaster and leverage our combined capabilities and customer bases to grow the Lancaster facility as one of our ‘flagship’ locations.”

The local operation has room to grow right where it is — inside its leased location in a multitenant building at 501 Richardson Drive off Columbia Avenue (Route 462). It now occupies 80000 square feet in the 200000-square-foot building.

Besides its East Hempfield facility East Coast location and culinary expertise the Lancaster site’s skilled diverse and enthusiastic workforce also appealed to Stir Foods said Alex Thompson director of sales and administration as well as Mike Thompson’s son. “They saw we have a great work ethic and a great culture” he said.

Stir Foods Lancaster which counts Auntie Anne’s Starbucks and Casablanca Foods among its customers also is optimistic because of rising consumer interest in specialty culinary products such as the sauces dressings and condiments it makes.

“We feel consumers are more demanding (than in the past)” Mike Thompson said. “They want products that add excitement to their meal.”

The acquisition is the fourth for Stir Foods based in Orange California since it was purchased in 2017 by Chicago-based private equity firm Wind Point Partners and Liu a food-industry executive. Liu had been a Target grocery division executive and president of airline-meal provider Flying Food Group.

The Stir Foods product line includes sauces and dressings as does the Lancaster plant’s repertoire plus soups and salsas. Stir Foods’ revenues are undisclosed but are estimated at several hundred million dollars annually.",,,,,,,,,

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

But Stephen Procter’s large stoneware garden vessels some as tall as five feet and incorporating 250 pounds of clay are nevertheless functional pottery — even without the soil and the plants.

In the clay world he said there’s always talk about functional versus nonfunctional pottery attempting to draw a line between the two. Mr. Procter a Vermont-based ceramist has seen his and other such outsize garden sculptures in action though.

“An object that invites contemplation and inspires and offers this kind of mysterious sustenance is functional in a deep and important way” he said. “Not functional that you’re going to drink your coffee out of it but the work has high purpose in the landscape and in the world.”"

Jack is survived by his brother James Charles Thalman and sister-in-law Heather J. Richey Thalman of Bainbridge Township Ohio; his sister Anne Elizabeth Thalman of Shaker Heights Ohio; and his nephew James (Jamie) Richey Thalman of Los Angeles CA. He was pre-deceased by his brother Robert William Thalman of Houston Texas and his parents Virginia H. Thalman Kinney and Alfred John Thalman of Shaker Heights Ohio.

Jack graduated from Shaker Heights High School. While he was a student there his extracurriculars included developing his skills at tennis swimming sailing and figure skating. Jack enjoyed teaching young students to swim while working for Shaker Recreation during his college summers. Growing up in Shaker Jack was a member of Plymouth Church Cleveland Skating Club Mentor Yacht Club and Cleveland Yacht Club. When he was a student at Colgate University Jack developed his love of pianos popular music and skiing. Jack returned to Cleveland to attend Case Western Reserve School of Law. After graduating Jack finished his education by earning an MBA at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.

Jack returned to Shaker Heights to begin his career in law and finance in the trust and estates department at Cleveland Trust. He later went on to work at Firestone Coca Cola Fifth Third Bank and Progressive Insurance. Jack worked in both Chicago and Atlanta but he preferred to come home to Shaker Heights to live his life with his many friends and athletic activities.

When he returned to Cleveland Jack became an active member of The Junior Council on World Affairs The John Hay Forum and The English Speaking Union and St Paul’s Episcopal Church. Jack loved local Cleveland history hosting parties enjoying good food talking to people and connecting people to each other. Along with his closest friends Jack organized and held large parties at Clubs around the East Side. Later in life he hosted an annual Christmas Party at his home that was one of the highlights of his year. Earlier this past autumn a close friend of Jack’s remarked that quite a number of couples in their social set met their spouse at one of Jack’s parties!

While at Law School Jack joined The Country Club of Pepper Pike where he became a longtime member. He played regularly in both the Inner Club Tennis and the Platform Tennis Leagues. In later life he helped to organize and host The Speaker Series at The Country Club. He brought in local Clevelanders and Club members to speak on different subjects including historical house architecture and furnishings prominent local art and book collections and the personal reminisces of a member’s conversations with numerous United States Presidents. Jack also arranged for musical evenings at The Club featuring his beloved piano music. Jack kept his love for tennis alive by promoting the Nenner Cup Championship held at the Club each summer. At home Jack enjoyed his passion for pianos by collecting and refinishing player pianos as his hobby. His favorites were his Steinways and Chickering grand pianos.

Jack was an extrovert with an extraordinary memory. He was always upbeat energetic and enjoyed talking for hours. His family history and the history of prominent Clevelanders and their historic houses were a favorite subject for him to share with family and friends. On his maternal side Jack was descended from multiple Mayflower passengers and Revolutionary War officers. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Society Sons of the American Revolution. On his paternal side his Swiss grandparents immigrated to the United States during WW I via Paris.

A celebration of Jack’s life will be held later. Details to be announced at a future date. The family prefers that those who wish may make donations to The Shaker Historical Society 16740 South Park Blvd. Shaker Heights Ohio 44120 or call 216-921-1201 or www.shakerhistory.org"

Chip-maker Qualcomm led the worldwide smartphone application processor (AP) market on 2020 with a revenue share of 31 per cent thanks to popular demand of its Snapdragon series according to a new report.

Apple was second with a 23 per cent share after its A14 Bionic the world's first 5-nanometer AP got a boost from the launch of the iPhone 12 according to according to market researcher Strategy Analytics.

China's HiSilicon with 18 per cent AP market share was third while Taiwan's MediaTek was narrowly behind HiSilicon to rank fourth also with an 18 per cent share.

Samsung which makes the Exynos chipsets was the world's fifth-largest smartphone AP vendor last year with 9 per cent market share.

Apple maintained its tablet AP market leadership with a 48 per cent revenue share in 2020 followed by Intel with 16 per cent and Qualcomm with 14 per cent.

""Notwithstanding the Covid-19 pandemic trade war and shortages the smartphone AP market posted all-time high revenue in 2020. Increased shipments of higher-priced 5G and 5nm AP shipments contributed to this growth"" said Sravan Kundojjala  Associate Director at Strategy Analytics.

""An increased mix of mid-range and low-end 5G APs from Qualcomm MediaTek Samsung LSI and Unisoc will inevitably pressure smartphone AP average selling prices (ASP) in 2021"" he added.

The worldwide smartphone AP market grew 25 per cent to a record $25 billion last year.

5G AP shipments surged in 2020 and accounted for over one-quarter of total smartphone AP shipments in 2020.

TSMC led the smartphone AP foundry market with over two-thirds of the market share in 2020 followed by Samsung Foundry. Both foundries saw strong demand for 7nm and 5nm APs.

""Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to be a key part of smartphone AP vendors' strategy and shipments of smartphone APs with on-device AI engines reached crossed 900 million in 2020"" the report mentioned.

Between the new CPU GPU machine learning image processing a 5G modem and sensor hub components there’s an awful lot to dive into. The bottom line is that the chip promises to be faster and more energy-efficient. It also introduces new features not found on the previous generation chips of many 2020 flagships.

Check out the link below for a full rundown of the Snapdragon 888’s deeper ins and outs. But stick with us here if you’re after a key overview of the top five Snapdragon 888 features. Take a closer look: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888: Everything you need to know

5nm manufacturing is good for power efficiency The mobile industry remains at the cutting edge of chipset manufacturing booking up slots on the best manufacturing lines ahead of other processor designers. Qualcomm joins Apple HUAWEI and Samsung in manufacturing its latest chipset on a 5nm process.

Smaller 5nm manufacturing techniques offer superior transistor density. This means taking up less silicon area and improved energy efficiency compared to last-gen 7nm chips. Combined with the efficiency gains of Arm’s Cortex-A78 CPU and revamped machine learning processors the Snapdragon 888 should be Qualcomm’s most efficient flagship chip to date.

Qualcomm notes that the Snapdragon 888 wins not just in terms of performance. It bests last years’ Snapdragon 865 for power consumption too. Phones powered by the chip should provide more screen-on time than the previous generation. This is great news considering 2020’s trends in 5G mmWave and high-refresh displays have proven to be a little on the power-hungry side.

More gaming power than ever before

The Snapdragon 888 boasts 35% more graphics performance with 20% better efficiency. That’s a big deal. It can be the difference between stuttery mid-40 frames per second and smooth 60fps or jumping from 90fps to 120fps while gaming.

Performance is one thing but the Snapdragon 888 also supports new cutting-edge gaming and graphics features too. 10-bit HDR graphics forward rendering and 144fps refresh rates are augmented with new Variable Rate Shading engine support Qualcomm Game Quick Touch for lower input latency and display features like sub-pixel rendering for smoother looking images.

The new CPU cores will certainly increase overall system performance too. However the Snapdragon 888’s biggest performance win appears to be in the graphics department. Gamers rejoice!

An integrated 5G modem (at last) It’s been a long time coming but the Snapdragon 888 integrates Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X60 modem into the same chip. Previous flagship chips required an external modem while the mid-range Snapdragon 765 integrated a slower 5G modem. Read more: Why there’s no integrated 5G modem in the Snapdragon 865

Qualcomm previously stated that it wasn’t possible to bring all its high-end 5G features to an integrated modem with the Snapdragon X55 due to its sheer size and power consumption. The move to 5nm is not only good for power efficiency and heat but also for transistor density. This has made it easier for Qualcomm to integrate a powerful modem onto the same piece of silicon.

Integrated components tend to be more power-efficient as there’s less power wasted moving data between external chips and memory. Similarly less area taken up by multiple components means more space inside smartphones for other hardware or bigger batteries. Battery life should therefore be a big winner here. Likewise high-end 5G bill-of-materials may be slightly lower with just one chip. Although when asked Qualcomm refused to comment on component pricing.

Doubling down on machine learning Machine learning is a core part of modern processor platforms and Qualcomm has revamped its AI capabilities in the Snapdragon 888.

It has fused its AI components together offering up to a 3x improvement to performance per watt and up to 26TOPs of computing across the entire heterogeneous system. The Snapdragon 888 also pushes AI capabilities into its always-on sensor hub assisting with voice recognition and other features in a tiny power budget.

Of course better hardware is all well and good but developers need tools to make the most of it. Fortunately the new Qualcomm AI Engine Direct acts as an entry point for Android NN TensorFlow Lite and Qualcomm SDKs. Qualcomm’s AI platform also now supports the open-source TVM compiler enabling developers to program in Python rather than C or assembly. It’s easier than ever to leverage the entire Qualcomm AI engine.

The bottom line is that your Snapchat filters and fancier machine learning use cases will run better while consuming less power than ever before.

Making the most of triple cameras

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

Triple cameras have been a staple of flagship smartphone photography for a few years now but that doesn’t mean they can’t be made even better. Qualcomm has revamped the image processing capabilities inside the Snapdragon 888. It has moved from two to three processing units for a whopping 2.7 gigapixels per second of processing power.

This means the Snapdragon 888 can now simultaneously process images and videos from three cameras. This makes it possible to record from the main wide and telephoto lenses all at once or take pictures from the front and back cameras at the same time. The Snapdragon 888 can also run more advanced processing on a single camera with even tighter integration with the chip’s machine learning capabilities.

The chipset also supports 10-bit HDR video 4K HDR computational video and 120fps 12MP burst photographs for sport and action shots. Ultimately though it comes down to Qualcomm’s partners to implement these new features. So we’ll just have to wait and see what ends up in next-gen phones. With more efficient processing and networking enhanced gaming features and big improvements to AI and multi-camera support these Snapdragon 888 features are a notable upgrade over the Snapdragon 865. Although as with most tech these days it’s still more of an evolution than revolution. The good news is that there’s not long left to wait until the first smartphones sporting the chip arrive in Q1 2020. Next: Snapdragon SoC guide: All of Qualcomm’s smartphone processors explained

The world is starting to feel a little bit safer.

If you're preparing to cure your cabin fever don't forget that you need proof of a negative COVID-19 test to travel to many destinations -- and to get back into the US if you plan on traveling abroad.

Though COVID-19 tests aren't in short supply anymore some places still won't test you if you don't have symptoms or known exposure. That said there are plenty of locations you can get tested for COVID-19 before traveling as detailed below.

Community testing centers

Chances are there's a park or parking lot near you reserved for drive-through COVID-19 testing. Some community testing sites are managed by state or local governments others are managed through private companies and others may be a partnership between the two.

Color for example is a medical testing company that has several community testing sites across California.

To find community testing sites near you check your local department of health website. If you can't find a testing site that way a quick Google search of ""COVID-19 testing near me"" or ""COVID-19 testing in [city]"" should do the trick.

You may have to pay for a test at a community testing center because tests are generally reserved for people who have symptoms (and recreational travel is still not encouraged). However some testing sites may offer free tests even if you don't have symptoms.

A drive-through test might be the most convenient option. Hyundai

Urgent care

Most urgent care centers offer both PCR and rapid antigen COVID-19 tests. You can check the website of local urgent care centers or call to find out if testing is available. Most cities have multiple urgent care centers so you shouldn't have any trouble finding a test this way. Again whether or not you pay depends on each urgent care center's particular policy.

Doctor's offices and clinics

Your primary care provider may be willing to test you for COVID-19 if you don't have symptoms although your insurance may not cover the test or the cost of the office visit for this purpose. It can't hurt to ask.

Passport Health a travel medicine and immunization agency with clinics across the US offers COVID-19 testing specifically for travel. The agency has locations in 33 states.

Pharmacies

Most large pharmacy chains offer COVID-19 testing for travel but you'll probably have to pay out of pocket. Walgreens CVS and Rite Aid all have COVID-19 tests available for travel. The exact cost you incur may vary but out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 tests generally hover between $100 and $150.

Kroger and Walmart pharmacies also offer COVID-19 testing in some states and the same rule applies: The test is free if you have symptoms but you have to pay for travel recreation or simply peace of mind.

If you go to a local pharmacy (not a chain) give the location a call to see if they offer COVID-19 testing for travel. There's a good chance they will have tests available but it might cost more to get one from an independent business versus a large corporation.

Medical labs

Cut out the middleman and head straight for a medical laboratory for your COVID-19 test. Quest Diagnostics the lab where many tests go for processing anyway offers drive-through COVID-19 testing. The lab requires you to pay for the test if you aren't showing symptoms.

Curative is a new medical lab that was founded in January 2020 to develop a new type of sepsis test. The company quickly pivoted to making COVID-19 tests that March and it now offers COVID-19 testing at more than 10000 locations throughout the US. Curative processes all of its tests at its labs in San Dimas California; Pflugerville Texas; and Washington DC.

Hotels

Some travel destinations offer COVID-19 tests for guests. Call your destination to see if they offer return testing -- that is the test you need to get back into the US. Keep in mind you still need to arrange your own test to get to your destination.

Airports

Many airports offer travel COVID-19 tests for passengers. Whether or not it'll cost you depends on a number of factors including what entity exactly is providing the test; whether or not they bill health insurance; and whether people showing symptoms are prioritized.

To find out if the airport you're flying out of offers COVID-19 testing search the airport's official website. You may also have some luck checking the website of your preferred airline. Delta has a handy tool where you can find a list of airport testing locations based on the country you're traveling from. United has information specific to certain cities and countries.

Just keep in mind that some airports might not offer rapid tests which means you shouldn't wait until the day of your flight to get your test. Not only could you miss your flight due to a long line but if you can't get rapid results you may not be able to board at all.

At home

If you have some time to spare consider buying an at-home COVID-19 collection kit instead of venturing out for a test.

There are more than 10 at-home COVID-19 tests available for people without symptoms or known exposure including those from Everlywell LetsGetChecked and Picture from Fulgent Genetics.

You can even order one on Amazon or call your local drugstore to see if they're stocking the new over-the-counter COVID-19 test from Ellume.

From the time you order one of these tests it'll take five to seven days to get your results so this option is best for people who plan ahead.

At home with a health care professional

Ready a new urgent care telehealth platform backed by GV Google's investment arm offers in-home rapid COVID-19 testing. Book your appointment online and a qualified health professional will show up at your door to administer the test. You can also mail-order a test and take it while a health care worker supervises via a video call.

BeeperMD offers a similar service but only in Florida at this time.

When to get your COVID-19 test for travel

Time -- or more accurately timing -- is of the essence when it comes to getting a COVID-19 test for travel. The exact guidelines you need to follow will vary based on where you're going where you're coming from and whether or not you're visiting multiple locations.

In general it's a good idea to take your COVID-19 test so that you receive results within three days of travel. This means you can take a rapid antigen test 24 to 72 hours before traveling or you can take a PCR test four to six days before travel. PCR tests usually take 24 to 72 hours to process.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sasha Banks and Bianca Belair skipped past Lana and Naomi for a title shot at Elimination Chamber only to come up short. Despite that for some reason they are getting another chance to win the Women's Tag Team Championship.

This rematch screams of WWE not knowing what to do with The Boss and her challenger for WrestleMania more than having a game plan involving Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler. The tag team champions are only here to play foils to the two babyfaces so neither Banks nor Belair looks too villainous.

Most likely The Boss will turn on The EST of WWE and cost them the match to make a statement about how she will beat her at WrestleMania. At worst the titles will change hands only for Jax and Baszler to win them back on SmackDown.

This isn't about the tag titles. It isn't even about Reginald who has been one of the focal points in the SmackDown Women's Championship picture for months.

The only goal is to force Banks and Belair to start fighting each other.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3BvcC1jdWx0dXJlL2Eva2hhbC9iaWctZS13d2Utb3VyLWhlcm9lcy1yb2NrLWludGVydmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black to the Future: WWE Superstar Big E Talks Animated Hip-Hop Sci-Fi Black History Series 'Our Heroes Rock!',"You’ve been rocking Schoolhouse Rock-influenced gear in the WWE for a minute. When was the genesis of this project?

It really goes back to the murder of George Floyd. That was this watershed moment for me. Once again I had no distractions. It wasn’t like “Oh man this is horrible this is tragic but I have to get on a plane.” I had—like so many of us who were stuck at home—this time to sit and think about this. Think about police brutality. To think about what kind of country that we want to leave for our children for generations after us. It was the first death that really affected me. That really touched me in a way where I was just couldn’t get it off my mind of someone who I’d never met who I’d never known. I felt helpless. How am I to topple systemic racism and police brutality and inequities in housing and employment because systemic racism is just that it’s a whole system. There are so many things to tackle. I felt like I have a voice I can do something. I’m blessed enough to have a platform. I have this great career with WWE and I felt like I needed to do something. For a while I was going on walks and these were these meditative moments for me to get out of the house [and] be away from people and just kind of think and clear my head. And I thought “What if we did something akin to Schoolhouse Rock for important Black people?”

One of the things that I’ve loved is we’ve been able to work with Jonathon Davenport for The New Day’s gear since 2015. We’ve used our wrestling gear to express our love for nerd culture. You see Jonathan Davenport he’s the one who designed the crazy ring gear that Kofi and [Xavier] Woods wore the Mortal Kombat stuff. That’s what I love with gear; you can really express the things that you love and that you’re into. But I thought “If we can take the time to express being Black nerds why can’t we also use that time to express our empathy?” My really good buddy Andreas Hale reached out to me and said “This should be much more than just wrestling gear” so the three of us put our heads together and eventually decided on making a short film and that’s kind of where it went. [Then] we realized that this is a very very expensive endeavor. The beautiful part with Kickstarter is you’re able to show that there’s an audience for this.

You worked on Lazor Wulf a couple of years ago. Did that work help inform you on the possibilities of turning this project into an animated series?

Yeah. I think in many ways probably subconsciously it did. What I loved is that it’s a show with just a ton of really dope Black voices. It’s Vince Staples who I’m a big fan of. Quinta Brunson who’s incredible. Reginald Veljohnson JD Witherspoon there are so many just really dope Black voices. It’s just an unapologetically Black show but it doesn’t beat you over the head with its Blackness as well. It’s really like this Afro-futuristic weird kind of off-the-wall show that has a really dope voice to me. I think too often I have been a person who’s not brimming with self-confidence and believing like “I can do all these things. I can be a filmmaker.” I’m really fortunate to have just really been surrounded by so many really talented and creative people who have helped to show me like “We can all be a part of this movement and getting these voices and messages out there.”

As WWE Intercontinental Champion it’s great to see you as a Black man who is unapologetically himself. It’s been important to see Apollo getting to show his roots. We’ve also got the Street Profits Hurt Business Sasha Banks Bianca Belair. Naomi’s back. It’s been very important to see. How do you feel about just being able to not just be a certain place on the carpet being a champion within this current time?

We definitely talk about that and it’s beautiful to see. If you look at the roster from SmackDown to RAW to NXT it’s really beautiful to see how vibrant it is. One of the things that you haven’t mentioned is the amount of Japanese talent we have. When you look at Io Shirai or Nakamura. Asuka to me when you say one of the best women’s wrestlers in the world you don’t need to qualify [she’s] one of the best wrestlers in the world period.

Sometimes I wonder about the word “diverse”; it can be a weighty term. It’s one thing to be diverse in “hey we have a lot of Black Latino and Asian talent.” But are they in positions of prominence? Are they being represented the right way? I think is we’re really moving in the right direction. There’s always more work to do but I do really believe [that] representation really does matter.

You look at Bianca you look at Sasha they’re undeniable. They’re clearly there because of the merits not because of their skin color. And that’s what we all strive for. I never wanted an opportunity simply because I was Black. I wanted it because I was the best at what I did. And I think that that goes for every facet of every occupation and career: we want these opportunities that we have been denied in the past but don’t give it to me simply because of my skin color. Give it to me because I’m the best at what I do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vaXRyd3Jlc3RsaW5nLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NoYXduLW1pY2hhZWxzLXJldmVhbHMtd2hldGhlci1oZWxsLWV2ZXItd3Jlc3RsZS1hZ2Fpbi1leGNsdXNpdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shawn Michaels Reveals Whether He'll Ever Wrestle Again [Exclusive],"WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels has laid to bed speculation that he might return to the ring in the future with Mr WrestleMania telling Inside The Ropes‘ Lead Writer Gary Cassidy that he won’t be chasing the dragon of a satisfying final match.

Michaels would return to the ring in 2018 having retired as a result of his WrestleMania XXVI clash with The Undertaker – something The Deadman would look at with envy during The Last Ride as he struggled to come to terms with his own impending retirement.

“No no! Like I said I guess that’s the thing – I can compartmentalise that. I don’t know if it’s fair but I can. I think that’s one of the reasons I was able to walk away and be at peace unlike a lot of people who have struggled with that. And I do understand it.”

Undertaker would eventually retire at Survivor Series 2020 following a Boneyard Match at WrestleMania 36 with AJ Styles giving The Deadman his curtain call. The Phenomenal One has long been rumoured as the opponent for Michaels if “one more match” happens – but it now looks unlikely.

The Heartbreak Kid would comment on his “comeback” match in Saudi Arabia which saw Michaels return to the ring for the first time in eight years as nothing more than a “high school reunion” to have an “experience” with Triple H Undertaker and Kane.

“Even that second one it felt like its own entity unto itself. It had nothing to do with really to me “one more match.” It was about going out there and having an experience with my guys. “I mean it was sort of like just a… I don’t know. It’s like somebody saying ‘You graduated high school?’ ‘Yes. But I’m going to go back to my ten-year reunion’ and I’m still going to do that but it doesn’t mean I’m going back to high school and I want to go through it again. So I guess that’s how I looked at it was it was an experience that I just wanted to have – special – with these guys.”

Michaels went on to say how he looks back at his retirement and career with “complete joy and satisfaction” – while acknowledging the struggles many other have with knowing when to hang up their boots.

Night two airs the following night exclusively on Peacock.

The two-night NXT event is a major part of WrestleMania Week which culminates with two nights of WrestleMania 37 (streamed live on Peacock on Saturday April 10 and Sunday April 11) from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

For Gonzalez Shirai and the NXT roster the opportunity to showcase their talents to the WWE Universe during the pro wrestling juggernaut’s biggest week can’t be understated. WWE reported last year’s WrestleMania Week viewership at 967 million views across all platforms.

The opportunity hasn’t been lost on Gonzalez the 6’ former DII basketball player at Texas A&M Kingsville. Since making her NXT debut at last year’s TakeOver in Portland Gonzalez has gotten leaner stronger quicker all in an effort to prove she’s worthy to carry the NXT torch.

“Physically I’m more agile and I run a lot more” she explains. “My endurance is higher my jumping is higher. A lot of stuff has just become a lot easier for me.”

She adds: “Io you’re brave girl but I don’t think you’re ready for a competitor like me. The last powerhouse she faced was Rhea Ripley — and that was months ago. I know she is the best in the world and to be the best you have to beat the best. So I’m coming in with the most excited and anticipated mindset that I can.”

In the gym with the help of former strongman and current WWE Superstar Braun Strowman Gonzalez switched from a full-body CrossFit-type routine to a more traditional bodybuilding training style. She’s also added plenty of yoga and massage therapy to aid flexibility and recovery efforts.

“I’ve been doing a lot of movements that I know I’m going to use in the ring when it comes to throwing around people” Gonzalez says. “And Io is probably half my size so I know I’ll be throwing her around a lot for sure.”

With less than three weeks till the big match Gonzalez says her preparation credits the confidence to her recent change in diet that has her feeling at the top of her game. She’s begun counting her macros more switching to a diet of whole foods consisting mainly of lean meat rice red potatoes and egg whites as well as drinking at least a gallon of water a day. She’s gone from a high of 200 pounds to hovering around the 180- to 185-pound mark these days.

Before the two battle for the title at Stand and Deliver Gonzalez and tag-team partner Dakota Kai who became WWE NXT’s first women’s tag-team champions after winning February’s Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic at NXT TakeOver: Vengeance Day will get one more up-close-and-personal showdown with Shirai who will partner with Zoey Stark in a tag-team match on this upcoming week’s WWE NXT.

“This is going to kind of be my checking out the scene type of thing” Gonzalez says. “Mentally for me this is going to be an opportunity for me to really fill up my arsenal with what I need to bring when it does come time for that NXT Women’s Championship match.”"

Those have since evolved into what is now called their “Studio” drivers but they’re essentially the same thing; versions of their drivers that are geared more towards content creation rather than gaming.

They’ve seen a lot of changes over the last couple of years especially since the launch of their first series RTX cards and now their new March 2021 version of the Studio drivers focus heavily on the latest AI-powered tools from Adobe including the new Super Resolution feature as well as the newest neural engine in Blackmagic’s DaVinci Resolve 17.

The March 2021 update NVIDIA says provides a nice performance boost for Adobe’s new Super Resolution feature currently available in Adobe Camera Raw and coming soon to Lightroom and Lightroom Classic as well as all of the recently added Neural Filters. The Neural Engine in DaVinci Resolve 17 as well as new features like the Magic Mask also see a bit of a boost.

They say that there are also benefits for 3D artists although the only software I can see mentioned by name is Blender’s AI-powered OptiX denoising (which is pretty awesome btw).

For those who use NVIDIA graphics cards but don’t game choosing to go with the Studio drivers is a no brainer but many people still don’t know they even exist. The company’s Game Ready drivers are typically installed on new machines by default – or even if you install them yourself but go with the “Express” installation – but they’re well worth taking advantage of showing some big performance boosts over the standard gamer drivers for many creative applications.

If you’re not running the Studio drivers yet or you are but haven’t updated to the newest release head on over to the NVIDIA blog to find out more and download it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjAvdmlkZW8tcmFtLXRyYW5zcGxhbnQtZG91Ymxlcy1ydHgtMzA3MC1tZW1vcnktdG8tMTYtZ2Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video Ram Transplant Doubles RTX 3070 Memory To 16 GB,"Making unobtainium graphics cards even more unobtainable [VIK-on] has swapped out the RAM chips on an Nvidia RTX 3070. This makes it the only 3070 the world to work with 16 GB.

If this sounds familiar it’s because he tried the same trick with the RTX 2070 back in January but couldn’t get it working. When he first published the video showing the process of desoldering the 3070’s eight Hynix 1 GB memory chips and replacing them with eight Samsung 2 GB chips he hit the same wall — the card would boot and detect the increased RAM but was unstable and would eventually crash. Helpful hints from his viewers led him to use an EVGA configuration GUI to lock the operating frequency which fixed the problem. Further troubleshooting (YouTube comment in Russian and machine translation of it) showed that the “max performance mode” setting in the Nvidia tool is also a solution to stabilize performance.

The new memory chips don’t self-report their specs to the configuration tool. Instead a set of three resistors are used to electronically identify which hardware is present. The problem was that [VIK-on] had no idea which resistors and what the different configurations accomplished. It sounds like you can just start changing zero Ohm resistors around to see the effect in the GUI as they configure both the brand of memory and the size available. The fact that this board is not currently sold with a 16 GB option yet the configuration tool has settings for it when the resistors are correctly configured is kismet.

So did it make a huge difference? That’s difficult to say. He’s running some benchmarks in the video both Unigine 2 SuperPosition and 3DMark Time Spy results are shown. However we didn’t see any tests run prior to the chip swap. This would have been the key to characterizing the true impact of the hack. That said reworking these with a handheld hot air station and working your way through the resistor configuration is darn impressive no matter what the performance bump ends up being.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzc2RyZXZpZXcuY29tL2hhcmR3YXJlL3N5c3RlbS1idWlsZHMvdHNzZHItYXNyb2NrLXRhaWNoaS16NDkwLWludGVsLWk5LTEwOTAway16b3RhYy1ydHgtMzA4MC10cmluaXR5LXdoaXRlLXRlc3QtYmVuY2gtYnVpbGQtbmVhcmluZy1wZXJmZWN0aW9uLzYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building the Ultimate TSSDR Z490 Test Bench - We achieved Top 1% of the Passmark/3DMark Communities!,"ZOTAC GAMING GEFORCE RTX 3080 TRINITY OC WHITE GPU

Without a doubt one of the highlights of this Test bench just has to be our Zotac RTX 3080 Trinity OC Graphics Card which has caused quite a stir since even before its purchase. First off this was a business purchase and a huge thank you to Cherry and Zotac for finding availability when it just isn’t there worldwide. My better half will be the first to explain the price of this card in ‘all-inclusive paid vacations’ as CA/US exchange taxes shipping and import fees easily made this the most expensive business purchase this company has made to date. Gotta admit; it is one very attractive card.

The Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 Trinity OC is a PCIe 4.0 x16 10GB GDDR6X graphics card with a Engine Clock Boost of 1740MHz and a memory clock of 19Gbps. It has HDCP 2.3 support fully capable of supporting a quad display system has 320W power consumption and has a 2 x 8-pin power assignment.

Its display outputs consist of 3 x Display Port 1.4a (Up to 7680×4320@60Hz) and HDMI 2.1 capable of same with a ultra high speed HDMI cable. A 750W PSU is recommended for this card it has IceStorm 2.0 cooling and it’s supported OS is Windows 10 64-Bit (build 2004 or later).

Testing the Trinity in 3D Mark with Time Spy it placed in the 99th percentile of all GPUs ever registering results for this test with a Graphics Score of 17030 and a overall score of 16553.

We decided to push it with the newest 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme as it is optimized for CPU’s with 8 or more cores and is able to utilize AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets. Let’s top this software off with the test at the level of our system monitor 4K graphics.

Even in the tougher environment the trinity pushed out Graphics scores of 8499 and an overall score of 8133 still placing better than 94% of all GPUs tested at this level.

These results seem to fall in line with performance testing also conducted with PassMark 2D and 3D Graphics Performance Benchmarks. We had also posted the AIDA64 GPGPU results a bit earlier with the Intel CPU for reference.

Price and availability. Right now there are no RTX 30 series GPUs available worldwide short of a lucky order placement and significant wait before receipt. The price of GPU’s has gone sky high the result of crypto-mining. Checking Amazon there are plenty there but you are going to be paying well above double the cost simply to get your hands on that card. Hopefully we will see this ease up soon enough and get pricing to where it should be.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LW1pbmluZy1saW1pdC1ieXBhc3NlZC11c2luZy1kdW1teS1oZG1pL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LW1pbmluZy1saW1pdC1ieXBhc3NlZC11c2luZy1kdW1teS1oZG1pL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Cryptocurrency Mining Limit Bypassed Using Dummy HDMI Fools The GPU/Driver Handshake Easily,"In the weeks after the unintentional NVIDIA GeForce Driver leak that enabled cryptocurrency mining on the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU miners have found additional ways into bypassing the GPU / Driver hand-shake to break the hash rate limiter on Ampere GPUs.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Hash Rate Limit Bypassed Using Dummy HDMI Breaks GPU/Driver Handshake & Enables Full Cryptocurrency Mining Rate

So we all know that NVIDIA accidentally published its GeForce 470.05 driver on its developer web-page that allowed users to bypass the hash rate limiter but later removed it. However as soon as the driver was highlighted to enable the full cryptocurrency mining rate of Ampere GPUs it spread like wildfire and is currently available to download everywhere in public domains.

Surprisingly new discoveries have been made by the Editor of Hardwareluxx Andreas Schilling who confirmed through his testing that the driver can still restrict hash rate on the GeForce RTX 3060 when running multiple GPUs. For this purpose the GeForce RTX 3060 was run alongside a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. The RTX 2080 Ti was used as the primary display adapter while the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was used as a secondary card. You can see that the hash rate limiter kicks in pretty soon forcing the ETH rate down to 21-22 MH/s instead of up to 50 MH/s which this card delivers.

This is definitely an interesting way of blocking cryptocurrency mining when running multiple GPUs as it detects which GPU is being used as a display adapter while simultaneously checking if multiple GPUs are running alongside it and if mining algorithms are being run on them. In most cases the cryptocurrency mining rigs feature a low-end or budget card as a display adapter while running a range of GPUs for mining crypto.

I had to try it out for myself even though it's really obvious. An HDMI dummy bypasses the reduction in mining (#Ethereum) performance of the #GeForceRTX3060 as a secondary card. pic.twitter.com/HbfvtyPI9F — Andreas Schilling (@aschilling) March 19 2021

To bypass even this limit set by NVIDIA all you have to do is get dummy HDMI connectors which can trick the driver into thinking that the other cards are also being run for display adapters and allow for full mining rate. Andreas goes on to provide a demonstration of this on his Twitter feed and shows the same GeForce RTX 3060 which was limited when running alongside the RTX 2080 Ti working at its full cryptocurrency mining hash rate.

Users in Korea have also provided a demonstration of this by putting four NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards to the test using the dummy HDMI connectors. The miners confirm that there is no mining hash rate drop in Ethereum (or any Crypto algorithm to say) when using dummy HDMI connectors. These HDMI dummy connectors are readily available to purchase and are quite cheap but given that they can become popular after this news goes out we can expect a slight rise in the prices. The miner also says that he hasn't yet tested the cards with dummy DVI connectors but that might work too. Other than that you also need a PCIe link of x8 or beyond to bypass the limit.

Graphics cards such as the unreleased NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti are also expected to feature the hash rate limit but if modders can bypass the RTX 3060 it's sad to say that the limit will also be bypass on the RTX 3080 Ti too.

It was Swinmurn who first came up with the novel idea of selling shoes online; before launching Zappos he solicited an investment from Hsieh who was already a wealthy angel investor due to his prior success with LinkExchange the startup he sold to Microsoft in 1998 for $265 million. Though initially skeptical of the business model Hsieh would ultimately infuse $2 million into Zappos joining the firm shortly after its launch. The brilliant yet famously troubled entrepreneur then spent the next 21 years as company CEO.

Swinmurn cut professional ties with Zappos in 2006 weary of the growing company’s increasingly corporate culture and looking for fresh new startup challenges though it seems certain his remaining equity holdings still allowed him to attain stratospheric wealth when Zappos was sold to Amazon in 2009 for $1.2 billion. Since then the now 48-year-old has founded or cofounded a whole host of companies to varying degrees of success; none have come close to reaching the Zappos level of fame and fortune.

Long based in California’s Bay Area — he owns a sumptuous estate in the prestigious Silicon Valley of Hillsborough acquired in 2017 for $6.8 million — Swinmurn is expanding his residential footprint down to Montecito where records reveal he’s dropped $8.6 million on a lavish estate near the proverbial heart of town just a quick jog to the homes of other financial heavy-hitters like Oprah Ellen DeGeneres and Meghan Markle.

Why it matters: Many of us quite literally owe our lives to the skill and dedication of the researchers who fought COVID-19 and the young winners of this year's contest should give us faith in the future of science in the U.S.

What's happening: 40 high school seniors from across the country competed virtually earlier this week in the final round of the 2021 Regeneron Science Talent Search.

Over $1.8 million in prize money was at stake with first place — and $250000 — ultimately going to 18-year-old Yunseo Choi of Phillips Exeter Academy.

How it works: Choi studied matching algorithms that work for a finite number of couples... to see how it would work for an infinite number... which means...

Background: The Science Talent Search has run every year since 1942 and its alumni — who include prominent scientists like geneticist Eric Lander and physicist Lisa Randall — have gone onto win 13 Nobel Prizes and 22 MacArthur Foundation Fellowships among other major science prizes.

Eshani Jha gets the top award; Gopal Goel Vetri Vel and Alay Shah among winners.

Washington DC March 20 2021 – Four Indian American budding scientists are among the top winners of the Regeneron Science Talent Search (STS) the nation’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors drawing exceptionally qualified entrants who attempt to tackle compelling issues facing humanity through their awe-inspiring scientific projects.

The Indian American award recipients – Eshani Jha 17 of San Jose California; Gopal Goel 17 of Portland Oregon; Vetri Vel 16 of Bangor Maine; and Alay Shah 17 of Plano Texas — were among 40 finalists who over the course of a week March 10 to17 presented their innovative research projects to eminent judges competed for more than $1.8 million in awards interacted with renowned scientists and displayed their work to the public in an online event on Sunday afternoon. Winners of the top ten awards ranging from $40000 up to $250000 were announced Wednesday evening during a live-streamed virtual awards ceremony designed to keep the finalists and their families safe in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

Jha secured third place in the rigorous competition administered by the Society for Science and was awarded $150000 for designing an accessible and affordable water purification system.

In an online chat with the press and public on Sunday Jha recalled “On a trip to India a few summers ago I noticed the grotesque deformities resulting from water contamination in the slums of my home state. When I asked my relatives why so many people were thus affected they told me that such maladies were commonplace due to limited access to water filters. Market research revealed that commercial water filters are inaccessible to those who need them most due to tradeoffs between cost and effectiveness. And thus my journey began” she said.

Responding to a query if her research can be used in places like Flint Michigan to purify drinking water she answered in the affirmative. “The major pollutants in Flint’s water were heavy metals especially lead” she noted. “But my research also explores the removal of microplastics pharmaceuticals and pesticides” said the young innovator who plans to major in chemical engineering when she heads to college.

Currently a senior at Lynbrook High School Jha has been conducting research on water contamination since middle school. “So a lot of this work is built on my previous findings” she said. “The doping and testing of enhanced biochar was conducted over a span of almost one year”.

Goel a student at Krishna Homeschool secured fourth place in the competition and was awarded $100000 for studying the mathematical properties of random matrices.

About his project the teen explained “The idea is that random matrices model the error in data especially from natural phenomenon”.

The homeschooler believes his math research is useful in the field of meteorology nuclear physics and quantum field theory. “Researchers explicitly showed how the model I am studying can be used specifically for meteorological data” he told viewers during the virtual Public Exhibition of Projects which opened on Sunday and will be on display until the end of the month.

When asked about the most important keys to success for science research he replied “finding opportunities” by applying to research programs emailing professors “and working really hard once you find these opportunities”.

Looking ahead to college Goel plans to major in math and physics.

In sixth place was Vel who received a $80000 award for developing a fall detection system to help the elderly. At 16 he was the youngest among the top 40 finalists in the current edition of the Regeneron STS.

At the Public Exhibition on Sunday Vel told online viewers “I was inspired when I heard that my grandmother had fallen in India and thankfully my grandpa noticed and she got help. However it made me think about older adults who may not get help for a long time after falling. When I asked my neighbor had a story about her elderly mother falling breaking her hip and lying on the floor for nearly a day. This made me think about a better solution for fall detection”.

Vel focused on heat sources using thermal imaging explaining that “it preserves privacy works in the dark and makes it easier to see humans in the images. The system would just be wall-mounted in a room. It would continuously capture images and classify them using a trained neural network. When a few different criteria are met the system calls for help over the internet by sending a text message for example” he said.

When Covid-19 restrictions are lifted the promising young scientist hopes to test the system for a longer duration in a nursing home to find out how reliable it is and to make refinements if any issues crop up.

Referring to residents in long-term care facilities Vel said “I think it (his system) would improve their quality of life because if they fell at any time during the day or at night they would get help immediately. This is also because nursing homes tend to be short-staffed so each individual only gets checked on at scheduled points during the day which leaves lots of gaps.”

He added “Applying engineering and machine learning techniques is really satisfying for me because while I love learning theoretical concepts I also want to be able to use them to accomplish something and improve people’s lives”.

Vel believes the most positive facet that he has learned from the STS is “there are many like-minded students across the country that are engrossed in math and science and improving the world”.

He credits the STEM program at Bangor High School for helping him to embark upon his research and learn how to communicate it effectively.

“My advice to pursuing STEM is to find a problem in the world or questions you find intriguing then dive into the math and science as you try to solve these problems” he said.

Shah earned seventh place and took home $70000 for developing a diagnostic tool that tracks eye movements to identify neurological disorders.

During the virtual Public Exhibition he told viewers “I got interested in eye movements by watching football. I noticed how when players get hit hard they are taken aside for a quick eye test. It’s to see whether they have a concussion. But I started thinking about how we can use eye movements for other disorders.”

His findings revealed specific patterns between neurotypical patients and those with Parkinson’s dementia multiple sclerosis and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder more commonly known as ADHD. He noted “in Parkinson’s we see these quick tremors occurring and in ADHD we see inaccurate and poor predictions.”

Shah tested his tool on 200 patients at a local neuroscience practice. The participants were split into eight groups with 25 in each: Parkinson’s; dementia; multiple sclerosis; ADHD; and four neurotypical age ranges. Each participant underwent four trials.

Replying to a question on the challenges he faced the whizkid replied it was finding patients willing to participate in the trial. “I got in touch with my 200 participants by cold communicating neuroscience labs and crowd funding” he disclosed.

“I use machine learning because of its many applications but I’m mainly interested in AI because of how it mimics neuroscience” he said. “Right now I’m working on developing new MRI and concussion technology. But in the future I’ll be working on neural engineering projects.”

Oregon governor Kate Brown tweeted “Congratulations to the top 40 finalists in #RegeneronSTS 2021 including Vedanth (Iyer) Gopal and Wenjun (Hou) from Portland! Thank you to Regeneron and Society for Science for supporting our student scientists.”

The top award of $250000 was conferred on Yunseo Choi 18 of Exeter New Hampshire for showing how her matching theory logic has numerous real-life applications. In second place was Noah Getz 17 of New York awarded $175000 for his research which adjusts the way computer models identify promising pharmaceutical compounds that could make the discovery of new drugs faster and less expensive.

Congratulating the winners Maya Ajmera President and CEO of Society for Science noted “Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic students like Yunseo have shown incredible resilience and perseverance in the face of new obstacles conducting rigorous research while navigating an uncertain world. These young people are the stewards of our future and I could not be more inspired by their hard work and pure grit.”

Hailing the scientific prowess of the winners Dr. George Yancopoulos Co-Founder President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron affirmed “Your curiosity and passion for science – as well as your unique genius for it – has now been validated.”

Dr. Yancopoulos credits his experience as a winner of the 1976 STS for being an important early step on his path to a life devoted to using the power of science to do good. It led his team to invent medicines to treat blindness allergic diseases Ebola and Covid-19.

“I hope you now take on the responsibility of using your powers and ingenuity to help address some of the truly existential challenges facing humanity from disease to climate change” he told winners of the current competition.

The finalists hailed from 37 schools and one home school across 15 states. In January 300 scholars were selected from a pool of 1760 applicants from 611 high schools in 45 states Washington DC Puerto Rico and ten countries. The semi-finalists were awarded $2000 each in addition to their school receiving a grant of an equivalent amount.

Of these ‘Top Scholars’ 40 finalists who received a minimum award of $25000 were then named including eight Indian-origin teens: Laalitya Acharya 17 of Mason Ohio who created Nereid a cohesive device that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) processing to determine if there are contaminants in a sample of water; Akhilesh Balasingam 17 of San Jose California whose research focused on optimizing a device which can simultaneously perform memory and arithmetic operations. It enables hardware that can speed up algorithms while consuming little energy; Vedanth Iyer 17 of Portland Oregon who explored a cost effective solution for improving lithium-ion battery performance; Anushka Sanyal 17 of Cupertino California for leveraging RNA systems to tackle neurodegeneration; and the four top ten winners – Jha Goel Vel and Shah.

The Science Talent Search a program of the Society for Science since 1942 was formerly known as the Intel Science Talent Search (1998-2016) and earlier was supported by Westinghouse (1942-1997). Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. a leading biotechnology company headquartered in New York took on the STS from 2017 and ever since has been giving over $3 million in awards annually. Founded by STS alumni the company has committed $100 million in funding over a decade.

Reflecting on the most positive lesson she gained from the STS Jha mentioned it was from the alumni dinner featuring award-winning puzzle-maker and board game designer Wei-Hwa Huang. “His keynote speech was about characterizing success and how all lessons can be found in all our life experiences even day-to-day ones” she said.

Her advice for students looking to pursue research is: ask questions. “Science can explain baffling idiosyncracies and be used to explore the world on macroscopic and microscopic levels. When you find something that can’t be explained or have an idea that you find exciting that can make for a great research project” Jha said.

For decades these countries as with the rest of the world were accustomed to a linear way of producing consuming and discarding plastic products. Now they are taking regional leadership to move toward plastic circularity and combat the economic environmental and social consequences of marine debris. This marine plastic study series addresses the critical need for country specific market assessments of plastics recycling in Thailand Malaysia and the Philippines. While reuse/refill and other business model aspects of plastic circularity are briefly evaluated the studies focus on recycling as a scalable private sector solution for diverting plastic waste away from landfills and the open environment. The studies use a plastic value chain approach to engage key stakeholders compile baseline data develop material flow analyses identify plastic recycling barriers and opportunities and develop actionable recommendations.

METHODOLOGY

Each study delineates the size and scale of the country’s plastics production and recycling industry focusing on four key recyclable resins: Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Polypropylene (PP).

The study team consulted with resin manufacturers brand owners converters aggregators and recyclers across the plastic value chain to compile and develop baseline data for each targeted resin.

These on-the-ground activities were complemented with additional data from secondary desk research and government agencies to develop material flow and material value loss analyses to quantify the untapped market potential for each resin. The pressures that contribute to this material value loss were identified for each country.

These findings were used to inform public and private sector interventions and near- and long-term actions to help each country address the unique plastic circularity policy and market barriers identified.

KEY FINDINGS

Less than 1/4 of the total amount of key plastics resins available for recycling in Thailand Malaysia and the Philippines are being recycled into valuable materials.

More than 75% of the material value of plastics is lost (valued at nearly US$6 billion per year across all three countries) when plastics are discarded after single use rather than recovered and recycled representing a significant untapped business opportunity if key market barriers can be addressed.

While the barriers to plastic recycling are unique to each country there are common interventions and actions that could help Thailand Malaysia and the Philippines unlock additional material value by implementing recommendations such as:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZGJhbmsub3JnL2VuL2NvdW50cnkvcGhpbGlwcGluZXMvcHVibGljYXRpb24vbWFya2V0LXN0dWR5LWZvci1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1wbGFzdGljcy1jaXJjdWxhcml0eS1vcHBvcnR1bml0aWVzLWFuZC1iYXJyaWVycy1yZXBvcnQtbGFuZGluZy1wYWdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philippines: Plastics Circularity Opportunities Report,"In the Philippines the plastics industry is not only vital to the national economy (contributing US$2.3 billion in 2018) but plastics also provide low-cost consumer goods to poor and middle-income families. However a high dependence on single-use plastics like multilayer sachets and pouches has led the Philippines to become a “sachet economy” that continues to worsen the alarming levels of marine plastic pollution in the region. By some estimates the Philippines consumes a staggering 163 million pieces of sachets every day.

Like many rapidly developing countries the Philippines grapples with unsustainable plastic production/consumption and insufficient solid waste management infrastructure. A staggering 2.7 million tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines each year and an estimated 20 percent ends up in the ocean. Comprised of more than 7500 islands the livelihoods of the Philippines’ coastal communities and the fishing shipping and tourism industries are especially vulnerable to the impacts of marine debris.

Understanding the urgent need to address the growth of the plastics industry and mismanagement of plastic waste the Philippines is developing and transitioning toward a circular economy. This study uses a plastic value chain approach to evaluate the Philippines’ plastics recycling industry and its role in supporting a circular economy. It identifies major challenges market drivers and opportunities for scaling-up recycling efforts via targeted public and private sector interventions.

The key plasThe Philippines recycled just 28% of key plastic resins in 2019.78% of the material value of the key plastic resins– upwards of US$890 million per year – is lost in the Philippines when recyclable plastic products are discarded rather than recycled into valuable materials.

78% of the material value of the key plastic resins– upwards of US$890 million per year – is lost in the Philippines when recyclable plastic products are discarded rather than recycled into valuable materials.

The Philippines had a large recycling capacity gap of 85% in 2019 (compared to Malaysia and Thailand across all four resins) and is a net exporter of plastic scrap.

Several structural challenges cause a market failure for plastics recycling:

High logistics costs limit recyclers from sourcing feedstock across the archipelago.

High electricity costs (38-67% higher than regional counterparts) especially burden recyclers that operate with low-efficiency equipment.

Intense competition from the informal recycling industry distorts the market for formal recyclers.

Significant material value is locked in low-value and hard-to-recycle flexible packaging which represents more than half of the plastics packaging used.

Low landfill tipping fees disincentivize local governments from investing in waste management solutions.

The small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that dominate the domestic recycling market are unable to meet multinational buyers’ requirements.

Other factors that exacerbate the market failure for plastics recycling include:

Fluctuations in virgin resin and oil prices

Lack of local recycled content requirements for key plastic resins

Challenging short- and long-term collection economics for the informal sector

Lack of “design for recycling” standards

Fragmented implementation of waste management

Lack of organic waste treatment facilities

Many of these challenges are amplified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in consumption patterns and low waste collection rates have led to supply reductions in the recycling industry while low oil prices have made it cheaper to use virgin rather than recycled plastic.

For example do organic waste diversion mandates result in in higher levels of physical contaminants such as glass plastics and other non-compostable materials? Are there added levels of chemical and biological compounds from the mandates as well including emerging contaminants (those compounds not yet regulated)?

The answers to these questions are important for several reasons. First composting and anaerobic digestion facility operators believe they are seeing increased non-compostable contamination which they say overburdens their operations and adds costs.

But another concern revolves around introducing contaminants harmful to humans such as heavy metals and pathogens back into the food system. For example food and other organic wastes can be turned into soil amendments through composting and used on gardens and fields. But that means any contaminants still residing in the waste could be reintroduced back into the food chain through crop production.

Recycling is further challenged because both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)hope to divert 50% of food waste going to landfills by 2030.

With funding provided by the Environmental Research & Education Foundation (EREF) researchers at the Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions at the University of Maine set about finding answers to these questions by collecting and analyzing food waste from two mandated food separation states (Massachusetts and Vermont) and one unregulated state (Maine). They also sampled waste from six different sources – groceries hospitals schools restaurants retirement communities and residential pick-up and drop-off locations. The food waste was processed in an industrial-grade food processor stored at -20°C and then shipped to the Maine Soil Testing Lab at the University of Maine for analysis. Seventy-one samples were submitted.

In addition to sampling different food wastes the researchers also wanted to know what perceptions food waste handlers had about the waste they were processing. For example were their suspicions that mandated food separation was contributing to an increase in physical biological and chemical contamination backed up by the science? And what were their perceptions about which kinds of chemical and biological contaminants were being collected along with the food waste?

The overall results surprised both the researchers and processors.

First the researchers found that mandated food source separation had no appreciable effect on contamination rates. In fact both mandated and non-mandated communities had similar levels of contamination whether it was physical (such as plastics) biological (such as common foodborne pathogens like Salmonella) or chemical (such as Per- and poly-fluorinated organics (PFAS)). Researchers suggested the results could have been from effective communication and outreach strategies in the roll-out of the food waste diversion efforts in Massachusetts and Vermont.

Second the perceptions of the composting and anaerobic digestion facility operators were different than reality. The operators believed there was appreciably more contamination rates in the communities where food waste diversion was mandated.

As far as the different types of contaminated materials that were found in the samples they broke down into several distinct groups: heavy metals organohalogens PFAS and antibiotic resistance genes.

HEAVY METALS

Eighty-two percent (82%) of the samples had some form of contamination whether they came from a state with mandated separation or one that was unregulated. Furthermore samples in both environments had similar non-compostable materials such as plastics gloves and fruit stickers. There were some variations in terms of where the food waste originated. For instance residential samples had significantly higher copper than retirement community and hospital samples which were higher than restaurant or school samples.

As for what chemical or biological contaminants were found in the samples researchers discovered a number of different compounds. For example researchers found a number of heavy metals in the samples such as lead chromium cadmium nickel tin and titanium. However the concentrations were all below the most stringent regulatory limits for soil used for comparison (75 and 25 mg/k) with the average concentrations being 21 and 4 mg/k and the maximum concentration being 71 and 14 mg/k respectively.

PATHOGENS

The samples were screened for three common foodborne pathogens as well -- Listeria monocytogenes non-typhoidal Salmonella and shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) – and while the pathogens were found in two of the samples researchers concluded that there was a relatively low incidence of pathogens in the food wastes they tested.

ORGANOHALOGENS

They also screened for organohalogenated compounds which are synthetic organic compounds that contain chlorine bromine and fluorine. Due to their persistence and bioaccumulative nature these compounds lead to environmental contamination and human exposure through multiple pathways such as direct skin contact inhalation drinking water and primarily food. Most of the sample however were below the detection limit of 5 mg/kg wet weight but 10 samples had measurable values that ranged from 5 – 89.7 mg/kg (ww) with all but the highest (ME restaurant) less than 12 mg/kg.

PFAS

Also found in the samples were different versions of PFAS (Per- and poly-fluorinated organics) a widely used industrial chemical compound. Fourteen of the samples had detectable perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) average 0.6; range 0.11-1 μg/kg); two contained perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) 0.11 and 0.15 μg/kg); and one contained perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) 0.28 μg/kg). The fact that a large number of the samples contained a PFAS compound was of concern to researchers because of the impacts these chemicals have on health and their potential to bioaccumulate.

Researchers also observed that food contact papers could be a source of contaminants such as PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) particularly at facilities that accept and compost coated papers with their food waste. This is an important finding as regulations are being proposed in different states to manage PFAS exposure. For example the state of New York recently enacted a law prohibiting the use of PFAS chemicals in food packaging.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE GENES

Another area of concern for the researchers was antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microbes evolve mechanisms that protect them from the effects of antimicrobials. When antibiotics are used in humans or animals approximately 80 - 90% of the ingested antibiotics are not broken down but pass through the body intact and enter the environment as waste. Thus they retain their ability to affect bacteria and promote antibiotic resistance even after they enter the soil or water as a waste product.

Three ARGs were screened in the study due to the use of the corresponding antibiotics in livestock (penicillins and tetracylines) -- tet(M) blaTEM and mcr-1. Sixty-eight (96%) samples were positive for tet(M) although 11 were below the researchers’ limit of quantification.

BlaTEM was also detected in 97% of samples although six of these detections were below their limit of quantification. β-lactams and tetracycline antibiotics are among the oldest antibiotics have been extensively used including in livestock rearing in the US and resistance genes were detected and isolated in food for a number of years. This could help explain the near ubiquitous detection of these antibiotic resistance genes in their food waste samples.

FOOD WASTE COMPOSTING AND ANAEROBIC DIGESTION

To better understand the perceptions of facilities that manage food waste related to contaminants the researchers sent surveys to 118 composting and anaerobic digestion facilities in Maine Vermont and Massachusetts from which they received 33 responses (28% response rate). The majority of respondents accepted waste from food processors followed by material from grocers restaurants institutions and residences.

What did the researchers learn?

Facilities who responded to the survey were primarily concerned about physical contamination a problem confirmed with the results (82% of samples contained non-food waste). However some did mention potential trace chemical and biological contamination but without much of a sense of the magnitude of the problem. Researchers also noted that much of their concern was about contamination of the carbon sources added to food waste during composting (wood chips hay bedding) which was not measured.

The food waste handlers also thought that the greatest risk of contamination came from institutions (e.g. colleges schools hospitals) followed by restaurants and residential sources.

Add in Mexico's 3-0 win over Costa Rica later on Sunday and head coach Jason Kreis' team booked a semifinal spot while chasing one of the region’s two berths in the upcoming Tokyo Summer Olympics.





Following a frustrating first hour at the Mexico-based Estadio Akron the US broke the scoreless deadlock in the 60th minute through captain Jackson Yueill. The San Jose Earthquakes midfielder made a run into the six-yard box and redirected home a low cross from winger Sebastian Saucedo giving the US a 1-0 lead.





The US got some breathing room in the 73rd minute as Minnesota United midfielder Hassani Dotson picked out the bottom corner for a 2-0 advantage. CF Montréal midfielder Djordje Mihailovic found Dotson after a powerful run on the left leading to a strong combination from the second-half substitutes.





Dotson scored his second goal in the 78th minute giving the US a comfortable 3-0 lead after again combining with Mihailovic. The 23-year-old collected a pass on the right-hand side of the penalty area and finished past goalkeeper Johan Guzman.





After twice playing provider Mihailovic found his goal in the 90th minute thanks to some industrious work from Orlando City SC winger Benji Michel on the right flank. Michel blew past several defenders and then crossed for Mihailovic at the back post sealing the 4-0 victory.





Kreis made six changes to the US starting XI that beat Costa Rica 1-0 to start the tournament rotating his 20-man roster to maintain freshness. As the Dominican Republic tired combined with Kreis’ own substitutes the US discovered their second-half scoring outburst.

THE BIG PICTURE: Knowing that Mexico awaits in their third Group A match the US faced pressure to earn a maximum six points through their first two games. While it wasn’t always pretty against the Dominican Republic it’s mission accomplished in that respect. Looking to reach their first Olympics since 2008 the US are on decent footing as the knockout round nears.

The woman was walking through the park around 11 a.m. when police said Kevin Caballero 30 is suspected of shoving her to the ground from behind holding her down and trying to remove her pants according to Sgt. Steven Carbajal a spokesperson for Tempe police.

The woman fought back as police say Caballero made comments about sexually assaulting her. Two people passing by then intervened and detained Caballero until police arrived and arrested him Carbajal said.

The woman had minor injuries and was treated for emotional trauma from the attack police said.

Tempe police are working with surrounding agencies to investigate if Caballero is involved in any similar incidents police said.

Recently the City of Tempe changed its plan to scale back on uniformed security presence at city parks.

Last fall City Council approved a plan to staff more social workers at parks instead of park security guards and officers but an updated proposal said security guards would have a more active role at parks for a more consistent and visible uniform presence.

The initial plan approved in the fall included staffing Human Services employees including the city's CARE 7 crisis team and HOPE team but would allow park security and officers to be called upon as needed.

Mayor Corey Woods said that the council's goal is to have Human Services staff at the front line with guards or police in the background to provide assistance as needed.

The plan is part of the city's efforts to reimagine public safety in the city and comes after Tempe first deployed armed private security guards to parks in 2018 and faced concerns that it militarized parks and criminalized homelessness.

In October the council also directed staff to temporarily extend the city's contract with global security company G4S while staff explored other security options. Assistant Police Chief Mike Pooley said staff recommended continuing the city’s contract with G4S because the city has seen a decrease in calls for service and arrests at parks since they were deployed.

Security guards are part of a strategy to increase park safety and cleanliness and connect people camping in park with services. Other proposals include increased homeless outreach additional mental health and substance abuse resources and park maintenance.

The amazing Robert Lewandowski scored a first-half hat-trick as the 10 men of Bayern Munich restored their four-point advantage at the top of the Bundesliga with a convincing 4-0 victory over Stuttgart.

The straight red card shown to Alphonso Davies for a dangerous foul after just 12 minutes meant with added time factored in Hansi Flick’s side played 80-odd minutes with a man disadvantage. But it only motivated the Bavarians who ruthlessly chalked up a four-goal lead before the interval.

Serge Gnabry set up Lewandowski for the opener before the provider turned goalscorer to double Bayern's advantage just four minutes later.

Less than 60 seconds later Lewandowski got his second with a pinpoint header from Thomas Muller's cross and he completed his treble six minutes before the break following a driving run from Leroy Sane.

That was number 35 for the season for Lewandowski who took a significant step to breaking Gerd Muller's record of 40 goals in a single campaign set back in 1972.

And the Poland international had a golden opportunity for a fourth after the restart but scuffed his shot over the bar with just Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel to beat.

Bayern were unable to add a fifth despite the best efforts of Leroy Sane and substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. But this was another supreme performance from Hansi Flick's side their numerical disadvantage only emphasising their undeniable quality. And with it they move to 61 points four ahead of RB Leipzig in second. Stuttgart meanwhile drop to eighth.

TALKING POINT - Ruthless Lewandowski closes in on record

Hat-tricks in back-to-back home games has the sensational Lewandowski within touching distance of a record-breaking league campaign. Not since 1972 has anyone scored 40 or more goals in the Bundesliga but almost everything the Bayern hitman has touched this season has turned to gold and he's now well on course to make history.

But perhaps he has an even bigger landmark in mind. Last week Lewandowski equalled Klaus Fischer as the second-highest scorer in Bundesliga history with his 268th goal. He still has some ground to make up to catch Muller on 365 but at the age of just 32 and considering how few injuries he's had you couldn't rule out the possibility of Lewandowski achieving such a feat.

With the Ballon d'Or controversially axed last season Lewandowski was robbed of football's biggest individual prize. But with 42 goals in just 36 appearances in all competitions already this term he simply cannot be overlooked for the 2021 award.

MAN OF THE MATCH - Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich)

Who else? The 32-year-old had four chances and scored with three of them.

KEY MOMENTS

12' - Red card! Oh my Bayern are down to 10 men! Davies is sent off for a lunge on Endo. Initially the referee shows the Canadian a yellow but it goes to VAR and the card is upgraded to red. It was dangerous and high and that's probably the right call.

18' - GOAL! Bayern Munich 1-0 Stuttgart (Robert Lewandowski): Goal number 33 for Lewandowski! Despite being down to 10 men Bayern have the lead. Stuttgart deal with the initial corner delivery but Gnabry has it back and runs down the left delivering a low cross for Lewandowski and he finishes with an instinctive effort past Kobel.

22' - GOAL! Bayern Munich 2-0 Stuttgart (Serge Gnabry): What a lovely team goal to make it two! One and two touch football from the hosts as Sane sets up Gnabry who slots it home with conviction!

23' - GOAL! Bayern Munich 3-0 Stuttgart (Robert Lewandowski): Stuttgart are in complete disarray as Bayern score again! Straight from kick-off the hosts win the ball Muller stands up a pinpoint cross and Lewandowski arrows a header into the top corner. Madness!

39' - GOAL! Bayern Munich 4-0 Stuttgart (Robert Lewandowski): A first-half hat-trick for Lewandowski! Goal number 35 for the season unbelievable! From Stuttgart's free-kick Bayern break Sane leading the charge down the right. His pass finds Goretzka inside the box but it breaks to Lewandowski who fires it into the bottom corner.

63' - A chance for Lewi's fourth! Perhaps he's human after all! With just the goalkeeper to beat Lewandowski has a golden opportunity to score his fourth but he scuffs his shot over the bar!

Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick as 10-man Bayern Munich kept its four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a 4-0 win over Stuttgart.

BERLIN March 20 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich restored its four-point advantage atop the Bundesliga standings after beating Stuttgart 4-0 thanks to Robert Lewandowski's first-half hat-trick on Saturday.

However the game started differently than expected as Bayern's Alphonso Davis saw a straight red card for a foul on Wataru Endo with only 12 minutes played.

Two minutes later Sasa Kalaidzic had a golden chance to open the scoring but the striker failed to beat Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.

Bayern then suddenly sparked to life and broke the deadlock out of the blue as Serge Gnabry found Lewandowski who made no mistake from very close range in the 18th minute.

Gnabry remained in the thick of things as he made it 2-0 only four minutes later after a combination with Thomas Muller and Leroy Sane allowed the German international to slot home from 12 meters.

To make things worse for Stuttgart outnumbered Bayern made it 3-0 within five minutes after Lewandowski headed home Muller's pinpoint cross into the box with 23 minutes gone.

Stuttgart wasn't able to put up any resistance while Lewandowski wasn't done with the scoring as the Bundesliga's top striker made it 4-0 to mark his 35th goal of the season.

The deal was sealed within the first 45 minutes as Stuttgart posed no threat to Bayern's well-positioned defense.

Kalaidzic's header on target in the 53rd minute was no challenge for Neuer while at the other end an unmarked Lewandowski untypically pulled wide from a promising position at the hour mark.

The Bavarians increased the pressure in the closing stages but Sane and Leon Goretzka lacked in accuracy.

With the result Bundesliga leaders Bayern defend its four-point advantage atop the standings while Stuttgart remain in eighth place.

""A huge compliment to my team. They played very well despite the deserved red card for Davies in the early stages of the first half. It was really outstanding how my team worked out the goals"" said Bayern head coach Hansi Flick.

Elsewhere Wolfsburg cemented its third place in the table after securing its 14th win of the season with a 2-1 victory over Werder Bremen.

Fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt returned to winning ways as the Eagles moved 5-2 past Union Berlin and Borussia Dortmund was held to a 2-2 draw with relegation-threatened Cologne.

There’s a huge demand for video marketing content with one recent HubSpot report showing some 54% of people want to see more video from companies and products they are interested in and 87% of advertising groups rely on skilled video and audio employees and freelancers.

One of the best sites for this is Lynda.com which is now called LinkedIn Learning.

As more and more people move to working remotely emotional intelligence or EQ is a much sought-after skill. If you have trouble connecting with someone over Zoom or get more frustrated than ever trying to read between the lines of “reply all” emails getting a refresher course here might boost your morale and your paycheck.

According to global EQ training company TalentSmart people with strong emotional intelligence earn on average $29000 more than those without. Udemy offers a master class in emotional intelligence for $13 and EdX.org offers a class (through UC Berkeley) that teaches empathy and emotional intelligence which is free if you don’t want the ($129) certificate.

No matter what your current job skills are there are always ways to boost your bank account. At the very least you might have fun picking up a new skill. But at best? You might even add another figure to your annual salary.

(AP) — Juwan Howard got the win in his first NCAA Tournament game since taking over at Michigan guiding Mike Smith and the top-seeded Wolverines to an 82-66 victory over Texas Southern on Saturday.

Smith scored 18 points and Hunter Dickinson added 16 as Michigan rolled into the second round without Isaiah Livers who is out with a foot injury. Eli Brooks and Brandon Johns Jr. had 11 points apiece.

Howard is back in the tournament for the first time since his stellar playing career with Michigan including back-to-back Final Four appearances in 1992 and 1993. It's his second season in charge but the NCAA Tournament was canceled last year because of the pandemic.

Howard and the Wolverines (21-4) had little trouble with the No 16 seed Texas Southern but the absence of Livers could lead to adversity down the road. Next up is No 8 seed LSU on Monday.

Livers a 6-foot-7 senior forward is sidelined indefinitely with a right foot stress reaction injury and he ambled down from his seat to timeout huddles while wearing a protective boot. He also wore a black T-shirt with the slogan #NotNCAAProperty part of a social media effort to raise awareness about inequities in college sports.

The Wolverines used their depth to replace his 13.1 points per game and floor leadership against the Tigers (17-9).

Michigan never trailed in building a lead that reached 24 early in the second half. The 7-1 Dickinson provided the inside power against the smaller Tigers while Smith and Brooks offered long-distance punch by knocking down 3-pointers.

It wasn’t perfect as Texas Southern outscored Michigan 42-30 in the paint and got within 12 late causing Dickinson to re-enter the game. Dickinson fouled out but the Wolverines had more than enough to close it out.

Michael Weathers had 24 points for the Tigers who were coming off a First Four win over Mount St. Mary's that gave the Southwestern Athletic Conference school its second NCAA victory.

Texas Southern's win on Thursday was part of an historic day for historically Black colleges and universities. Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference member Norfolk State ousted Appalachian State on the same court marking the first time SWAC and MEAC schools won NCAA Tournament games on the same day.

TSU faced a much taller task against a Michigan squad bent on rebounding from its Big Ten Tournament semifinal loss to Maryland. The Tigers stayed close for the early minutes before the Wolverines eventually pulled away.

BIG PICTURE

Texas Southern: The Tigers didn’t wilt despite the big deficit and drove their way to paint points. That was needed with their perimeter game finishing just 1 for 12 from behind the arc.

Michigan: The Wolverines won the glass 38-28 and forced 10 turnovers leading to 19 points which helped them lead throughout. They need to finish better as the road becomes tougher from here on out.

Signet Jewellers Ltd. which owns chains such as Kay and Zales said this past week it will expand in off-mall locations while continuing to pull back from the old-school gallerias where it has long had a major presence. The company also plans to add more kiosks in underserved markets.

The move brings “an opportunity for a better economic model” Joan Hilson Signet’s chief financial officer said in an interview. “The foot traffic for off-mall locations is better than what we’re seeing in the mall certainly in this time. It’s really important and we see that shift continuing.”

Retailers are abandoning enclosed malls in growing numbers as the rise of online shopping transforms the industry — a trend that has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. Almost a third of retail CFOs are planning to scale back their mall presence according to a recent survey from consulting firm BDO USA.

That’s throwing into question the future of hundreds of traditional malls already financially struggling before the pandemic as they grapple with expensive real estate and fewer tenants who want to be there.

“Even the ones that haven’t been distressed are being hurt by the lack of foot traffic in the mall” said David Berliner head of the restructuring and turnaround practice at BDO. Some are talking about relocating stores from malls to nearby centres anchored by merchants like Walmart Inc. “because they’re going to get more foot traffic than they’re getting at the mall now.”

Signet exemplifies that kind of shift. The company closed 395 stores last year mostly in malls and plans to shutter another 100 this year. At the same time it has shifted 33 mall stores to off-mall locations. Some of its outlet stores primarily Zales locations are now in so-called lifestyle centres — open-air markets with dining and other activities — and in locations next to popular stores like Ross Dress for Less. Signet’s Kay bridal business in particular is doing better in off-mall locations than the enclosed shopping centres.

Similarly Gap said in October that it’s pulling back from malls where its brands have long been staples due to high rent and weaker performance. The company which owns Banana Republic and Old Navy in addition to its namesake chain wants 80 percent of its stores to be outside of enclosed centres by 2023.

Department-store chain Macy’s said it’s testing off-mall locations in Dallas Atlanta and the Washington metro area; Bath & Body Works is also looking to add more off-mall locations. Beauty retailer Sephora plans to open dozens of freestanding stores in addition to 200 shops this year inside Kohl’s Corp. which operates almost entirely off-mall.

For retailers there are many advantages to leaving the old-school shopping centres. Rent can be “substantially” lower elsewhere the hours of operation are more flexible customer parking is easier and building costs are lower said Ivan Friedman chief executive officer of RCS Real Estate Advisors.

Bath & Body Works also cited “significantly higher conversion rates” — a reference to the proportion of shoppers who make a purchase — in a recent earnings call. Same-store sales a key metric were about twice as high in its off-mall locations last year it said.

The pandemic has accelerated what some see as a long overdue culling of locations.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Everybody felt before Covid that they had 20% too many brick and mortar stores” Friedman said.

That’s hurting malls disproportionately. Occupancy rates in the third quarter were about 87 percent at malls — meaning roughly one in every eight storefronts was empty — compared with about 92 percent at off-mall locations according to a report from real estate data firm Green Street. Landlords in 2020 also collected a higher proportion of rents from tenants at off-mall centres suggesting their better financial health.

Enclosed malls have already seen a pullback in specialty shops like record and card stores making them overly concentrated in apparel a category that has struggled during the pandemic. As Friedman put it “How many different shoe stores can you go to?”

That feeling of sameness is driving shoppers instead to a newer generation of open-air centres that include housing or office space BDO’s Berliner said.

“A lot of these mixed-use centres now are trying to recapture that town hall feel” he said. “That’s where people want to go again instead of just these rectangular indoor boxes where everything is the same.”

It's easy and will only take a moment.

Lidl's deposit return scheme is being trialled now ahead of a wider rollout which will include Ross-shire stores.

A SUPERMARKET's trailblazing deposit return scheme is set to reach Ross-shire next year after it is trialled in a pilot project now under way.

Lidl's scheme will allow shoppers to claim back up to £2.50 in vouchers to use in-store simply by returning bottles and cans which have been bought there.

The retailer has launched what it calls its ""landmark"" deposit return scheme trial at selected stores ahead of the Scottish Government’s nationwide rollout next year.

It has unveiled money-back recycling stations at four central belt stores.

Deposit return schemes are already established in many countries where they are helping to tackle climate change and reduce litter.

In a bid to encourage more Scots to recycle the eco-friendly trial by Lidl will see many shoppers use reverse vending machines for the first time.

As part of this testing phase Lidl says it will gather key insights ahead of installing the innovative recycling facilities across all of its 105 Scotland stores by July of next year.

Ross Millar its regional director for Scotland said: “This is a huge milestone for Lidl and one we have been working towards for several years. We’ve made a significant investment to install large scale contactless user-friendly and future-proofed machines for our valued customers.

“This initiative reinforces our commitment to sustainability enables our shoppers to redeem money to spend in-store and supports the Scottish Government in reaching its waste reduction targets.

“The trial will help consumers get to grips with these recycling stations the first of their kind in the GB by showcasing the benefits and ease of using them. We look forward to rolling out the best performing solutions to all of our Scotland stores in the year ahead.”

Undamaged empty bottles and cans originally purchased in Lidl can be returned to dedicated recycling stations at selected stores where shoppers will be rewarded a redeemable voucher.

""Just by taking back your empty bottles and cans you’ll be helping to put a stop to the waste of raw materials that are driving the climate crisis.” – Iain Gulland chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland

Included in the recycling scheme are undamaged soda bottles and cans water bottles wine bottles beer bottles and all aluminium cans each worth 10p with a maximum voucher value of £2.50 redeemable to spend back in the store.

Once collected the bottles and cans are then recycled to become new drinks containers creating a circular economy and using fewer natural resources and less energy.

In preparation for the trial Lidl worked closely with the Scottish Government and its key delivery partners including Zero Waste Scotland.

The environmental body has supported the implementation of the deposit return scheme by consulting throughout the development process since 2018.

Commenting on Lidl’s trial launch Iain Gulland Chief Executive of Zero Waste Scotland said “Scotland’s deposit return scheme will make it easy for everyone to do something good for the environment.

“It’s great that this trial will give people the chance to give it a go for themselves and see just how straightforward it is. Just by taking back your empty bottles and cans you’ll be helping to put a stop to the waste of raw materials that are driving the climate crisis.”

Seajets is a Greek/Cypriot ferry company that bought a lot of ships from British cruise line Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV). SeaJets plans on sailing them in inter Greek trips or turning them around and selling to a third party.

Empress of the Seas has been purchased by Indian cruise Cordelia Cruises but Majesty's owner has not announced its purchase.

The ship was last spotted in Piraeus Greece.

Majesty of the Seas was the last Sovereign Class cruise ship left in Royal Caribbean's fleet and joined the fleet in 1992.

Majesty has sailed a variety of routes in the Caribbean having sailed from many homeports to different destinations. Most often she sailed from somewhere in Florida and offered short cruises to the Bahamas and Caribbean.

She was only one of two Royal Caribbean ships to visit Cuba in the limited time Americans could visit the island.

Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley was vocal in his admiration and sorrow following the decision to sell Majesty and Empress of the Seas ""Saying goodbye to these two beloved ships is a major moment in Royal Caribbean’s history – one that is difficult but necessary.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWxhd25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZGlzZWFzZS9hdm9pZGluZy10aGUtY2RjLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi10by1iZWdpbi1jcnVpc2VzLWZyb20tdGhlLWNhcmliYmVhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avoiding the CDC Royal Caribbean to Begin Cruises from the Caribbean,"On Friday Royal Caribbean Cruises announced that it will begin cruising from Nassau. Starting on June 12th Royal Caribbean will sail its Adventure of the Seas on seven-night cruises from the cruise ship’s new home port in the Bahamas. The cruise line also announced that its sister company Celebrity Cruises will start sailing the Celebrity Millennium cruise ship on week-long cruises from St. Maarten on June 5th.

The Miami Herald explains that the Adventure of the Seas (photo above) will stop at Royal Caribbean’s private island CoCo Cay (photo right) in the Bahamas as well as Grand Bahama Island and Cozumel Mexico. The Celebrity Millennium cruises will visit Aruba Curaçao and Barbados on one itinerary and Tortola St. Lucia and Barbados on another.

Vaccinated Adults / Un-Vaccinated Children

For all such cruises crew members and passengers older than 18 will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Minors however will be permitted to sail without a vaccine provided that they submit proof of a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours of boarding.

Frustrated with the CDC

Royal Caribbean’s announcement that it intends to resume cruising from these new home ports in the Caribbean reflects its frustration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) whose orders directly affect only cruise ships sailing from U.S. ports. The CDC announced last October that cruise lines sailing from U.S. ports must comply with the conditions set forth in the CDC’s conditional sail order.

The first part of the order requires cruise companies to test crew members for COVID-19 weekly and report the results to the CDC. However there are still companies with ships in U.S. waters which have not complied with this part of the order a CDC representative CDC spokesperson told the Miami Herald. After this is completed cruise lines must then obtain agreements with local health authorities and port authorities to arrange for housing and medical treatment for those crew members and passengers who become infected during cruises.

“I think we’re increasingly anxious and a little impatient waiting for (CDC) guidance” Royal Caribbean International President Michael Bayley told the Washington Post in an interview last Friday. Royal Caribbean’s frustration with not being able to sail its ships without CDC restrictions has led to it deciding to resume cruising in jurisdictions where it can basically do as it pleases such as St. Martin and the Bahamas. This permits the company to substitute its thought process for that of the CDC regarding such things as the wearing of masks social distancing and the capacity of its ships among other issues. The Miami Herald reports that Royal Caribbean “is still determining whether it will require crew and passengers to wear masks and how full the ships will be.”

Will Royal Caribbean Still Follow Its Healthy Sail Panel Recommendations?

Royal Caribbean has invested in COVID-19 protocols which are found in a comprehensive report prepared by its so-called Healthy Sail Panel. As reported by USA Today last September Royal Caribbean said that it’s also Healthy Sail Panel recommendations would including face coverings and other protocols. But there is no indication that the company will follow these protocols on cruises that do not leave from or call on a U.S. port.

This sets up a potentially disastrous situation where Royal Caribbean may subsequently not require its crew or passengers to wear masks which polls indicate are unpopular with guests. Of course COVID-19 vaccinations do not mean that the crew members or passengers cannot be infected or transmit the virus. The CDC requires the wearing of masks on all forms of transportation whether involving a train plane or ship including all transportation hubs.

The fact that Royal Caribbean is permitting minors to cruise only on a showing of a negative COVID-19 tests within three days of cruising is also potentially dangerous. As cruising outside of the U.S. has revealed coronavirus tests can yield false results and/or there is always the risk of infection after the test while traveling in public spaces to the cruise terminal. There is a risk of a minor becoming infected after he is tested while flying to the Caribbean port. To the extent that the passenger is tested after arriving in Nassau that test may not pick up recent infections and there also remains a chance of infection while in the terminal en route to the cruise ship.

Several Millions of Children Have Been Infected with COVID-19 in the U.S.

COVID-19 infection is children is a very real phenomenon that is not often discussed by the major media outlets. The American Academy of Pediatrics has compiled detailed data which indicates that there have been 3284531 child COVID-19 cases reported in the U.S. comprising 13.2% of the 24806402 cases in the U.S. to date. There have been several hundred deaths of children due to COVID-19 as the data shows.

Children who cruise will undoubtedly interact with other unvaccinated children as well as with vaccinated adults who can still transmit the virus while traveling through airports and on planes to the Caribbean and on the cruise itself. This is a recipe for infection.

There is also no indication whether the cruise guests will be barred from going ashore on excursions thereby increasing their own risk of infection as well potentially exposing the citizens in the port communities. There are no such restrictions mentioned in Royal Caribbean’s on-line advertisements.

Few Vaccinations in the Bahamas and Mexico

The Bahamas vaccination rate is extremely low with less than one (1) percent of Bahamians vaccinated to date. Mexico’s vaccination rate is also very low with less than four (4) percent of its citizens vaccinated. There have been at least 2193600 cases of the coronavirus in Mexico with 197827 people dead due to the virus according to the New York Times.

Sending children who are unvaccinated into these countries with such low vaccination rates is utter folly. Royal Caribbean is asking the public to ignore the CDC’s recommendation that “all people avoid travel on cruise ships” notwithstanding the agency’s jurisdiction over air carriers flying from and to U.S. cities.

No Local COVID-19 Infections in Singapore

The Points Guy interviewed Royal Caribbean’s senior vice president of hotel operations Mark Tamis about the fact that the company was skirting the CDC’s jurisdiction by resuming its U.S. cruise operations from ports in the Caribbean. Tamis coyly wouldn’t say “if the agency approved of the move.”

Tamis touted Royal Caribbean’s success in cruising from Singapore but this could not be a more misleading comparison. Singapore currently has virtually no local coronavirus cases (with only a dozen or so imported cases). It has the world’s lowest COVID-19 mortality rate of only 30 deaths for the past year of its over 5700000 inhabitants due to its excellent mask culture compared to over 542000 deaths of U.S. citizens with nearly 30000000 infected in the U.S. over the last year.

No Boarding or Medical Arrangements Made So Far – Who Will Pay the Costs When a Passenger Become Infected?

By establishing home ports in St. Martin and the Bahamas Royal Caribbean is able to avoid the CDC’s requirement that cruise lines make pre-arrangements to house those cruise guests who become infected with facilities ashore to provide housing and medical treatment. It is unclear what if any arrangements Royal Caribbean has made if and when a guest become ill during a cruise from St. Martin or the Bahamas. If a child or other passenger becomes symptomatic while the ship is in Bahamian waters where will Royal Caribbean quarantine the passenger and his close contacts? Where will the guests be quarantined when the ship is sailing to Mexico? I can not think of any other country less likely to provide quality medical treatment than these two countries no matter how gracious their citizens may be. And who will pay for the accommodations and the cost of medical treatment as well as the costs of flying home? If left to its own devices Royal Caribbean will likely pass these costs on to its guests.

Cruising From Nassau – Increased Costs and Risk of Infection

A reader of this blog send me the link to Royal Caribbean’s announcement of these cruises on its so-called Volunteers of the Seas Facebook page  which struck me as disturbing. This comment from a Royal Caribbean fan of the page is perhaps most insightful: “This is the most ridiculous thing I have heard of! Can’t wait to see the prices for this…pay for a flight to Bahamas just to cruise through and around the bahamas pay for coco cay fly on a plane with unvaccinated people and cruise with children unvaccinated while still able to contract the virus and spread it. Then find out you did contract it from either plane or child and not be sick at all but have to have a covid test before fly home and then get stuck in the bahamas until you can prove a negative covid test! I’ll just take a regular vacation thanks!”

The fact that Royal Caribbean decided to resume its U.S. cruising from ports in the Caribbean aligns perfectly with its basic business model. It incorporated in Liberia (Africa) and registered its ships in the Bahamas in order to avoid all U.S. income taxes U.S. labor and wage laws U.S. occupational health and safety laws and U.S. environmental protections. Dodging science-based health and safety restrictions by the CDC is just more business as usual by this Liberian corporation.

The vessel will homeport in the popular eastern Caribbean port of St. Maarten. Are we now seeing a shift away from U.S. homeports?

Celebrity Millennium Out of St. Maarten

Celebrity Cruises has announced its comeback and it’s not out of the United States. After more than a year of suspended operations the cruise line will begin cruises in the Caribbean this June.

So the Celebrity Millennium will begin sailings from her new homeport of St. Maarten on June 5 2021. She will offer seven-night itineraries departing through August.

Celebrity Cruises President and CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo said:

“Returning to the Caribbean after more than a year away is such a significant moment for us. It marks the measured beginning of the end of what has been a uniquely challenging time for everyone. We have been in constant contact with the leadership of St. Maarten these past months to support each other and share learnings and best practices. That we’re able to offer people the opportunity to safely vacation onboard the revolutionized Celebrity Millennium is incredible and that we will sail from the magical island of St. Maarten is very special. I am forever grateful for the support and collaboration of the St. Maarten Government.”

There will be two different Caribbean itineraries Celebrity Millennium will offer. One week-long itinerary will include calls at Aruba Curacao and Barbados. The other itinerary will include visits to Tortola St. Lucia and also Barbados.

Minister of Tourism Economic Affairs Transportation and Telecommunication (TEATT) Ludmila de Weever declared:

“Having a major cruise line such as Royal Caribbean Group’s Celebrity Cruises homeport here is a significant economic milestone for St. Maarten. It’s an historic agreement the fruit of continuous dialogue and a testament to the strength of our longstanding relationship” “Celebrity Cruises homeporting here will help rejuvenate our economy and drive opportunities for our people. I would like to thank the management team at the Royal Caribbean Group for their commitment to St. Maarten and their confidence in the Ministry of TEATT as a reliable and responsible partner. I look forward to the successful re-launch of their Caribbean cruising.”

The sailings will be open for booking from March 25 2021. Guests can take advantage of special air and sea pricing offering exceptional savings on all Summer 2021 St. Maarten sailings starting at $1999* per person for a veranda stateroom.

The offer applies to new bookings and flights must be booked through Flights By Celebrity and prices include airfare and taxes.

Who Can Cruise?

So the big question is who can go on the cruises out of St. Maarten? Adults will need to be vaccinated before being allowed to cruise but children under the age of 18 will also be able to sail as long as they have a negative test result within 72 hours before embarkation.

There will be strict health protocols in place to make sure guests and crew remain safe.

Now that we are a year into the pandemic we know how difficult traveling has become. With constant rules changes new regulations and the constant enforcement and repealing of restrictions travel has quickly changed from the best thing in our lives to something that can be a bit of a nightmare. It’s the same for businesses too having to deal with restrictions that have simply left many unable to operate.

Yet where there are problems there are solutions too – and we have started to see cruise lines think outside of the box by changing their home ports in order to be able to restart travel. Here’s a look at why you might not have to wait that long for your next vacation on the waves.

At present many of the major cruise lines have their home ports in the USA. Whilst this makes sense in a typical year with many American travelers able to access these ports and begin their journeys from there we know this is far from a typical year. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a no-sail order in March of last year an order which has been extended and despite the CDC stating that it would take a “phased approach to resuming cruise ship passenger operations in US waters” a plan has yet to surface.

However major cruise lines Celebrity Cruises and Royal Caribbean have found a way around this. Rather than leaving from the US and being subjected to the CDC’s regulation the cruise lines have moved their homeports to places in the Caribbean allowing them to resume their cruises and circumvent any US-based regulations.

Royal Caribbean’s New Homeport – Information for Travelers

Royal Caribbean has announced its return to action with seven-night cruises this summer on its ship Adventure of the Seas leaving from its new homeport of Nassau in The Bahamas. The journey will take passengers to various destinations in The Bahamas including Royal Caribbean’s private island CocoCay as well as visiting Cozumel in Mexico.

The route which is due to start on June 12th will be available to book from March 24th. Both the staff and the passengers on the cruise will need to be vaccinated. Many cruise lines have started to make this a requirement and Royal Caribbean themselves have previously made it a requirement for their trips in Israel. At present US travelers heading to The Bahamas must have a negative Covid-19 test taken five days before arrival as well as applying for a Bahamas Travel Health Visa.

Celebrity Cruises’ New Homeport – Information for Travelers

Celebrity Cruises’ a sister-company of Royal Caribbean has also moved its homeport to circumvent CDC regulations relocating to St. Maarten in the Caribbean. Two cruise offerings will be available both taking place on the Celebrity Millennium ship and will start from June 5th. One itinerary will see passengers visit Aruba Curaçao and Barbados whilst a second will head to Tortola St. Lucia and Barbados.

The crew on board will all be vaccinated whilst the cruise will only be available to vaccinated adults and children under the age of 18. Americans heading to St. Maarten to take part in the cruise will need to have a negative PCR-test in order to be able to enter.

If Japan’s Best Car can be believed Toyota thinks so and it’s dusted off the circa 2015 Toyota S-FR concept for production with the help of Daihatsu and Suzuki—two small car specialists the former of which is a Toyota subsidiary. Do we want to believe?

Of course we love the MX-5; we are enthusiasts who love sporty cars and Toyota’s no stranger to the segment. The last car it built in this class was the MR-2 Spyder a nominal Miata competitor that appealed to the quirkier and more hardcore enthusiasts. It had less curb appeal and more “budget Elise” mojo. But the S-FR (well the concept which is old) has one thing the MR2 Spyder doesn’t: undeniable cuteness. Rather than an amphibian shape made out of Duplos the S-FR is funky and organic—more Kermit and less Kerbal.

Forbes’ Japan-based reporter put hands on the exclusive Best Car report and from this we understand that the appeal of shared development costs and partner automakers is what makes the revival feasible. Well rumored revival. The evidence is thin to be clear. The Daihatsu Vision Copen apparently previews the bones of a future S-FR and seems an appropriate basis; the windshield surround and the doors look very S-FR. It’s rounded and cute. Toyota-izing it would be a simple task.

After all if Daihatsu is making a small convertible already it wouldn’t be difficult for Toyota to create a larger more powerful version at a different price point. Bringing in Suzuki’s small engine expertise would help reduce costs as well. Consider the BMW underpinnings of the latest Supra and the co-development of the GR86 and the Subaru BRZ. Toyota has signaled it won’t build a sports car without some aspect of it being shared or already in existence.

Best Car pegs the upcoming S-FR to debut in 2026 or 2027 with tweaked styling but a similar overall vibe to the 2015 S-FR concept and a 150-hp 1.3-liter turbo I-3 engine under the hood.

Plausible? Maybe. Probable? That’s another story entirely. And as for the U.S. market don't expect a Daihatsu-based anything to make it here; besides Toyota has the GR86 already which is essentially a roofed Miata fighter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaC5lZHUvdW5odG9kYXkvMjAyNC8wNS9lbGl6YWJldGgtcy1jaGlsdG9uLW5hbWVkLTIxc3QtcHJlc2lkZW50LXVuaXZlcnNpdHktbmV3LWhhbXBzaGlyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth S. Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor.

She was born on October 27 1931 in Memphis Tenn. to Mildred Borum and DB Woollard Jr. The first year of her life was spent in Memphis and then the family moved to West Memphis Ark. When she was five years old her father DB Woollard Jr. drowned while on a fishing trip. Her mother Mildred Woollard elected to stay in West Memphis and was appointed Postmistress of the West Memphis Post Office. Mrs. Woollard later married John A. Cooper Sr and the family remained in West Memphis where Boyce attended and graduated from West Memphis High School. She then attended the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and graduated in 1955. Her first marriage to Charles Morgan Jr. ended in divorce. Boyce and her son Chuck moved to Cherokee Village Ark. where her family had started a small real estate development named Cherokee Village Development Company. Having received her college degree in Finance Boyce worked in the business office there to support herself and her son. The family company was later Named the John A Cooper Company and is now known as Cooper Communities Inc. In 1959 Boyce married George M. Billingsley of Memphis and Cherokee Village. He had served four years in the Navy returned to the University of Arkansas to finish his degree and then moved to Cherokee Village and joined the salesforce of the family real estate company. They had two daughters Boyce Ann and Kelly. In 1965 the family moved to Bella Vista Ark. to help start Bella Vista Village. They led an active social life and more involved in community service. The Billingsley‘s supported the Bentonville School System and the Bentonville-Bella Vista Boys and Girls club. Mrs. Billingsley served on the Bentonville School Board for 10 years and served as a Girl Scout Neighborhood Chairman for several years. She was on the Board of Directors of the Mildred Borum Chapel in Bella Vista. She was also a charter member of the Bella Vista First United Methodist Church as well as the Cherokee Village First United Methodist Church. She was supportive of the Arts serving as Board member on the Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville. Boyce and George were generous supporters of the University of Arkansas both serving on the campaign for the 21st-century Steering Committee which achieved the University of Arkansas's first billion dollar funding. Together they received the Arkansas Razorback Foundation Distinguished Service Award and the Chancellors Medal in 2005. She is preceded in death by her husband of 43 years George Billingsley and her parents DB Woollard Jr and Mildred Borum Cooper and her stepfather John A. Cooper Sr; also her brother John A. Cooper Jr and her sister Ann Woollard Basore. She is survived by one son Charles W Morgan III (Chuck) of Boca Raton Fla. and two daughters Boyce Ann Billingsley Of Hudson N.Y. and Kelly Billingsley Jones (Wade) A Bentonville Ark. and two grandchildren George Wolfram and Rebecca Wolfram of Hudson N.Y. and one sister Rebecca Cooper Whelan of Hot Springs Ark. Her caregivers in her later life who took exceptional care of her Dario Amini Linda Soboj Mary Hanson and Misty Hooper remain in the families gratitude.

Research I have undertaken suggests there is a widespread appetite for a new paradigm – one that will have far-reaching implications for cities businesses and people.

If the Covid-19 crisis subsides and economies can largely reopen the experiences of so many people working from home over the past year will surely shape what happens next. For many of us this could emerge as a return to the office for three days a week. Patterns will obviously vary but a common thread would be something like Monday Tuesday and Thursday in the office and Wednesday and Friday at home. This is the classic 3-2 plan that large firms such as Google Salesforce Facebook and HSBC have already announced. From my discussions with hundreds of managers across different industries many other companies are working towards similar arrangements.

This coming shift will largely be driven by employers making a calculation between two different equally important forces. One is what companies see as the need for in-person creativity and connections which will spur their desire to bring people back into offices. For many we are at our most creative working face to face meeting people talking over lunch and coffee or gathering in groups. This is why some of the world’s most successful companies be it in London New York or Silicon Valley build such beautiful offices. Leading companies want to lure their employees into work because they believe that’s how to maximise their staff’s creativity and endeavour. Perhaps too there is the lingering notion for some that it is easier to keep an eye on staff with them all in the same place.

There is the potential for something ineffable to be lost when colleagues don’t meet in person. Indeed a recent study by Microsoft shows that employees at home are more likely to contact current team members but less likely to get in touch with new ones. So working from home limits our ability to connect with different teams reduces cohesion and may hinder the potential to create new ideas.

At home however we tend to be more efficient in the daily tasks that make up much of working life. This is the competing force that may keep many of us out of the office even after Covid. Working at home under the right conditions – which means in your own room with good broadband and no children around (which wasn’t necessarily possible for everyone in lockdown) – can be highly efficient. In a large randomised control trial I carried out on working from home in 2010 I found home-based employees were 13% more efficient. When we interviewed employees after the study they told us how noisy and distracting the office can be. The most memorable story was the individual who complained about their cubicle neighbour cutting their toenails at work under the desk with a massive clipper. This greater efficiency on current tasks also combines with other factors like the time saved by avoiding the daily commute offering a compelling reason for people to stay at home. The past year of Covid home working has perhaps opened many more people’s eyes to this.

As companies come to decisions on new working arrangements they will be essentially making a basic trade-off: the expectation of greater creativity in new projects at the office but greater productivity on existing tasks at home. And as with most trade-offs the right answer is not all or nothing – five days or zero days at home – but something in the middle. It seems from talking to more than 100 firms this would be three days a week in the office.

Employees seem to prefer this working pattern too. In a recent survey of 5000 employees in Britain that I did with Paul Mizen and Shivani Taneja from Nottingham University working in the office for three days a week was the most popular choice. Indeed employees reported they regarded this as a perk worth about 6% of wages. Not only is this pattern more efficient for companies then but it also helps to keep employees happy and motivated. Or to put it in cash terms if your company wants to force employees back into the office for five days a week it will need to compensate them – or face losing staff when economies recover.

Successfully navigating this trade-off means companies could maximise performance and profits and employees could be happiest by splitting time almost evenly between days in the office and days at home. Not surprisingly this appears to be becoming the most popular option for many businesses.

If this wider shift happens as I expect it to the long-term move towards greater homeworking has huge implications for our cities reversing long-ingrained thinking about working and urban life. If we now need a home office but only need to commute three days a week the recent flight by some to the suburbs and elsewhere during the pandemic is likely to become permanent. The centres of cities might return to their early 2000s state – lower density cheaper somewhat more bohemian and varied.

Skyscrapers in particular are facing the most radical change. High-rise buildings in city centres have the double challenge of public transport and lifts. Post-pandemic many of us will still be nervous about the density of people in any given circumstances. In our survey of UK employees over three-quarters of respondents reported feeling uneasy about taking crowded tube trains or stepping into packed lifts. So tower blocks will have to cut rents reduce density and even convert some floors into flats to reduce crowding – and to find new income. They will also need to get creative about working hours. To avoid the daily morning and evening crush more companies will have to move away from the 9 to 5 schedule. One office manager I spoke to was considering cutting rents and instead charging tenants peak-pricing on lifts – one pound per employee riding up between 8.30am and 9.30am or riding down between 4.30pm and 5pm – to limit the morning and evening crush.

A greater shift towards working from home also has major implications for inequality which can’t be ignored in the rush to change working practices. Only half of all employees can work from home typically university-educated people in management professionals or business services. Throughout the Covid-19 crisis the other half have remained at work – or worse still lost their jobs. In particular workers in manufacturing healthcare and other frontline jobs have mostly had to continue going to work five days a week: these are jobs that cannot be done at home. It’s clear that the same employees who have faced the hardest time in the pandemic also won’t get to enjoy working from home after it. Employers and governments should be mindful of this and be prepared to compensate for these sacrifices.

In the coming months and years the radical shift towards working from home that occurred during the pandemic is setting up society for a new reality. For many of us the Monday to Friday 9 to 5 daily commute will end. Instead we will be working from home two days a week and travelling in to the office three days a week (or a formulation close to that) many of us from the suburbs and beyond. Ultimately if this shift goes well we have the potential to be more productive in our jobs and happier with a more balanced working life. This could also help to improve affordability in our largest cities as higher earning employees move out away from their bricks-and-mortar workplaces. But will those working from home remember the other half who cannot do the same?",,,,,,

The project will allow restaurants to convert open spaces into outdoor dining areas decorated by local artists.

“Given … how much we love our favorite Newton restaurants how important they are to village life and the difficult year they have endured we are looking to build upon and expand our efforts to encourage outdoor dining or as we call it ‘Newton Al Fresco’” Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller said in a statement on Feb. 25.

Newton Al Fresco allows restaurants to apply to use parking spaces in front of their businesses and adjacent buildings in order to increase the capacity of outdoor dining. With permission from the restaurants’ neighbors restaurants can apply to expand dining into the parking lot.

To make the parking spaces large enough to accommodate more people the project is working to expand the parking stall sizes on Union St. from eight to 12 feet.

They are also creating takeout spaces—designated spaces for customers to park for 15 minutes and pick up takeout—near the village centers and expanding seating for restaurants. These takeout spaces will also feature artistic elements to make the spaces more welcoming and appealing Gloria Gavris board chair of Newton Community Pride and BC ’83 said.

“We are also creating takeout spaces near the village centers which feature artistic elements and Union St. restaurants can expand wider which will create a different vibe for that area” Nicole Freedman Newton director of Transportation Planning said. “It will feel like the street is more for outdoor dining and pedestrians and less for vehicles.”

Newton Al Fresco sites for this year will include Newton Centre Green the Langley Lot Rodney Barker Square Elm St. Parking Lot Captain Ryan Park Austin St. Parking Lot and Colletti-Magni Park Fuller said.

Newton’s economic development and planning staff restaurants on Union St. and Ward 6 Councilors Vicki Danberg Alicia Bowman and Brenda Noel have worked together to expand on-street dining on Union St. in Newton Centre Fuller said.

“The tentative plan … preserves much of the on-street parking spaces allows for continuous traffic flow and carves out a few special expanded dining areas for restaurants” Fuller said.

The plan proposes outdoor dining service areas by Thistle & Leek House of Tandoor Farmstead Table and Baramor and takeout tables by Woops! Bakeshop Café Sol Azteca and Blackbird Donuts.

Police will begin “gentle enforcement” of the two hour parking limit on April 1 according to Fuller.

Communal dining spaces in many of the village centers will be improved including painted bistro tables umbrellas and solar lighting according to Fuller’s statement. Gavris said that the Cultural Affairs Office and Newton Community Pride in conjunction with Newton City Council members are working to include artistic elements created by local artists.

“Local artists were also hurting with lack of opportunity because of the COVID shut down” Gavris said. “We hope that these elements create the opportunity for an artistic place that will last beyond the pandemic and create more of an ambiance around takeout public areas resulting in increased foot traffic to local businesses and overall pedestrian engagement.”

Gavris said that Newton Community Pride serves as the “financial arm” of the Newton Al Fresco project. It commissions the artists participating in the project while local businesses such as Sherwin-Williams and National Lumbar donate the art supplies. Last year Swartz Ace Hardware Sherwin-Williams Paint and Bowman donated supplies.

Gavris did not release which artists are involved in the program at this time. She said that she hopes to hold a socially distant painting event over the next two to three weeks.

“The city has been terrific” Gavris said. “Newton Community Pride played a small part on the creativity and artistic end but the leadership in City Hall facilitated this program.”

Last year’s initiative helped businesses that lacked outdoor dining space to add seating utilizing jersey barriers. Paula Gannon director of Newton Cultural Development assembled a team of 23 artists to paint concrete jersey barriers for 10 Newton restaurants.

Using the barriers Thistle & Leek Sycamore House of Tandoor Baramor Farmstead Table Buttonwood LeDu Thai Eatery Cook Restaurant Grape Leaf Mediterranean Grille and George Howell Coffee were able to add outdoor seating to their restaurants last year.

“Almost a dozen agencies were involved last year we had very little time this year we had time to plan proving a top-notch experience for customers retailers and businesses it’s the new and improved 2021 version” Freedman said.

The 2020 program only included expanding the dining through restaurants’ parking spaces Freedman said.

“The restaurants were concerned and many city councilors like myself were also concerned” Bowman said. “And so we started working hard last summer when we saw how this was going to roll out to try to get the administration to expand it.”

The 2021 Newton Al Fresco project involved a year-long coordination process with numerous departments including the mayor’s office Public Works the Office of Cultural Development economic and planning staff police and fire departments Special Services and a legal team according to Bowman.

Bowman drew from other areas in Massachusetts such as Waltham and Hyannis as models for the Al Fresco program and engaged with restaurants around Newton to adjust the program to their needs. This was a learning experience for everyone involved Bowman said.

“I attended a lot of webinars that were being held by organizations across the country to try to educate people on what we could be doing and the restaurants themselves with the Chamber’s help started a restaurant round-table where they were sharing what they learned with each other and try[ing] to use their political pressure to promote the city to provide more help to restaurants” Bowman said.

Bowman said representatives from the restaurants who serve as active voices in the round table discussion include Karen Masterson from Johnny’s Luncheonette Arpit Patel from Baramor and Karl O’Hara from O’Hara’s Food & Spirits.

Bowman expressed her disappointment in the initial rollout of the program and reluctance of the administration to do more for restaurants and the community.

“We gave the administration a hard time we didn’t think they had gone far enough last year to support the restaurants especially when you look at other communities” Bowman said. “We would have liked to see something more and that is what we’re going to see this year.”

Bowman said she is ready to move forward with Newton Al Fresco and hopeful for its continuation in a post-COVID-19 era.

“I hope that it’s the beginning of us really rethinking how we use our streets and I see us working hard to think through how we utilize space” said Bowman. “I’m excited to see the program expanding and I hope we learn and continue to move forward.”

Some impressive (Brady LeBron) some tragic (COVID) and some obsessive (social media). It’s also the era of algorithms — and it seems there’s nothing they can’t solve for from painting a Monet to minting money.

And now algorithms are even being used to read our minds.

Case in point: Last week Facebook previewed its latest and greatest technology advances — in this case a wearable that can read a user’s mind and give them superpowers liking typing on a keyboard even when there is no keyboard there.

The prototype device out of Facebook Reality Labs revealed to the media this week is reportedly capable of reading neurological signals sent from a users’ brain down to their hands. The device will theoretically be able to use signals to determine the user’s intent either in a real or augmented reality (AR) environment.

“You actually have more of your brain dedicated to controlling your wrist than any other part of your body probably twice as many neurons controlling your wrist and the movement of your hands than is actually dedicated to your mouth for feeding and for speech” said Thomas Reardon director of research science at Facebook Reality Labs.

Facebook demonstrated that this feature can be used in its “force” feature — named for the concept from the movie “Star Wars” — that would allow users to manipulate AR objects in the distance. The feature was also demonstrated to enable users to type on any hard surface as though it were a keyboard and the sensors in the wristband would be able to register and read the wearer’s intention for letters and words.

When will Facebook’s telepathic tech be on the market? According to Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer that is a tough call given that Facebook is still in early development on the project. “It’s hard to predict their timeline” he said. “How these things sequence out in the market when they show up — [those] are things I don’t have crisp answers to. What we’re focused on is hardening these technologies.”

Facebook isn’t the only player working to make smart tech that is truly mind-reading though at present it is the only Big Tech player with such an announced product in the field. The U.S. Army is also formally interested in the telepathic possibilities of connected tech. In fact according to reports that began circulating in late 2020 the Army’s version of this project is a whole lot more science fiction-sounding than Facebook’s.

The Army in cooperation with researchers from the University of Southern California UCLA Berkeley and Duke University is providing $6.25 million in funding over the next five years to research whether algorithms and advanced mathematics provide the foundation for separating brain signals that “influence action or behavior from signals that do not.”

And if that doesn’t immediately jump out as relevant to mind-reading experts tend to agree that being able to distinguish action-influencing brain signals from others is the first step to creating brain-interface systems.

Hamid Krim an Army Research Office program manager explained that initiatives based on this research might be able to create devices that will detect things like stress and fatigue signals from soldiers and transmit them to their leaders. Theoretically it could also be used to create a channel for silent communication via a central computer while boots are on the ground.

The military’s testing like Facebook’s is in the very early stages though testing on monkeys has begun. It will likely be more than a decade before any technology applicable to human beings could be conceived Krim noted. “The next step after that is to be able to understand it” Krim commented. “The next step after that is to break it down into words so that you can synthesize [it] in a sense like you learn your vocabulary and your alphabet.”

It seems we’ll have a while to wait before the technology to truly read humans’ minds is actually ready for the market/battlefield. That is perhaps a comfort to people who worry about Facebook having this kind of tech given its track record in consumer privacy.

And one can imagine a world where other players might want to build their own tech-enabled versions of the “Vulcan mind meld” that might be somewhat less intimidating than either Facebook or the armed services. How much easier would ordering on Amazon be for example if it knew as soon as you did that you had run out of toilet paper? How much more interesting would digital streaming be if a wearable could sense that you are bored and send that signal to Netflix to find a new show or that HBO could just know that you really liked that coat Nicole Kidman wore in “The Undoing” and had it show up on your doorstep before the show ended?

The possibilities for telepathic tech it seems could be pretty dazzling — and potentially even a little bit dangerous.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3ZhcnNpdHlsZXR0ZXJzLmNhL2Etc3VuZGF5LXJlYWQtc2Z1LXdvbWVucy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtdGhlLXBvd2VyLW9mLWNvbm5lY3Rpb24tdW5pdGluZy1wYXN0LWFuZC1wcmVzZW50LXRocm91Z2gtaXRzLWltcGFjdC1tZW50b3JzaGlwLXByb2dyYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Sunday Read: SFU women's basketball celebrates the power of connection uniting past and present through its ...,"Simon Fraser women's head basketball coach Bruce Langford has already seen the impact of his program's recently-launched IMPACT Mentorship Program one which has involved past and current players like (left to right) Laura van den Boogaard Georgia Swant and Brittany Fraser.

BURNABY — There are many variations of the parable which informs us that in learning we teach and that in teaching we learn.

Boil those words down to their essence however and what remains is the singular feeling of a journey coming full circle.

Laura Kalenuik née van den Boogaard like so many other former student-athletes has always been on that path yet the subsequent turn turn turn of the seasons which follow a university sports career inevitably focus attention on the kinds of changing priorities which define new chapters in life.

But what if say a decade-and-a-half after graduation smack dab in the middle of a busy life balanced by the demands of both profession and parenthood the phone rings with a request for the former student to become the teacher?

In February of 2020 in an effort to more formally connect its past alumni with its current players the Simon Fraser women’s basketball program initiated its IMPACT Mentorship Program.

Not too soon afterwards a host of program alumni spanning the past three decades had been paired with players from SFU’s current 2020-21 team as a means of ongoing support in all manner of student-athlete life.

“At first I wasn’t quite sure how I was going to be able to provide any value” confessed Kalenuik who answered that call a year ago and was eventually paired as a mentor to Georgia Swant a guard from North Vancouver’s Argyle Secondary who is presently in her third season with the program. “I was like ‘I’m 37. I haven’t played for 15 years. I’m a mom. I’ve got three kids.”

Yet despite the fact that the pair have yet to meet in person due to the conditions of the pandemic both their comfort and their connection has continued to grow.

“I didn’t know anything about her” adds Kalenuik of Swant some 17 years her junior “but the more we’d talk it was like ‘Oh my gosh you are just like me when I was in university’ and ‘I know exactly how to help you.’”

PLANTING THE SEEDS OF IMPACT

IMPACT is an acronym for Individuals Mentoring Players Alumni Connecting Together.

Yet although the program was formerly launched over the past year its Simon Fraser-specific roots were actually planted a quarter of a century ago at a high school in Mission.

In the fall of 1996 Bruce Langford currently in his 20th season as SFU head coach was starting a new posting as a teacher at Heritage Park Secondary School.

“I got hired to Heritage as a social studies teacher” Langford remembered. “But I only taught socials for two days. On the third day a guy came into my office and asked me if I was interested in applying for the career facilitator’s job. I said ‘What’s that?’”

Langford decided to take the job one which involved everything surrounding work-experience placement and career-development strategies for a group of around 150 students per year.

“So I’d place kids at the Vancouver Planetarium the Fraser Valley Vet the Mission District Hospital.. even the coroner’s office” remembered Langford.

Five years later when longtime SFU women’s head coach Allison McNeill decided to step down from her position to return to the coaching ranks of her alma mater at the University of Oregon Langford got his first chance to make coaching his full-time profession.

There will always be a storybook element to a former high school coach winning the CIS national title in his first season like Langford did over that 2001-02 campaign.

Yet throughout a career highlighted by five Bronze Baby national titles during SFU’s brief U SPORTS era followed by a successful transition of the program to the upper reaches of the NCAA Div. 2 ranks it’s apparent that Langford has deemed nothing more important each season than the community of his team.

So while he may have honed his coaching chops in turning Heritage Park into something of a turn-of-the-century dynasty before arriving atop Burnaby Mountain in the fall of 2001 it looks like he also brought a lot from the specifics of his actual teaching gig as well.

His SFU players past and present in fact can go so far as to trace his experiences as a high school careers facilitator to the very roots of the IMPACT program.

“I remember I wanted to to get into broadcast journalism… I wanted to be a news anchor” remembers Kalenuik who these days along with her husband Jeremy a former Simon Fraser football player operate a thriving real estate company — Whitestone Select Properties Group — in the South Surrey area.

“Bruce was always so good with that kind of stuff and he was always trying to help us find mentors” she continued of Langford who was able to set her up with Sara Orlesky back then in her pre-TSN days a former SFU student reporter working locally at Citytv.

“I chose to go in another direction after I explored it” Kalenuik says “but when you are young there are so many options and it’s great to be able to ask different people questions.”

THE POWER OF COMMONALITIES

She’s the South Kamloops grad who as both a player (2005-09) and assistant coach (2009-10) was a part of three national championships with Simon Fraser.

Yet over the last decade as she’s coached high school teams at both Seycove Secondary in North Vancouver and now Ballenas Secondary in Parksville Brittany Parker née Fraser admits that the figurative tug on her basketball heartstrings has always kept her close to her alma mater atop Burnaby Mountain.

“It’s one of the hardest things to put into words but a big piece of what has resonated with me since I finished was the connectedness” explains Parker these days the director for the Centre for Experiential Learning at Nanaimo’s Vancouver Island University where she supports students by helping them find internships and co-ops within their fields of study.

“It sounds cliché” she continued “but it’s like this whole entity that is about so much more than games. It starts in your first year and just continues to enhance and when you turn into alumni it’s that feeling of connectedness that you just carry with you. That is what we want to achieve through IMPACT.”

So when program founders Dani Langford and Julia Wilson stalwarts as respective point guard and post on some of SFU’s most successful teams of the 2000s decided to formalize plans for IMPACT and put out the call for help Parker needed no cajoling.

“The original idea came from Dani and Julia and Dani reached out to me to ask if I had the capacity and the willingness to support this to help turn this idea into action” said Parker a criminology grad with a Master of Business Administration to boot.

“I took the back-end pieces all of the administration and then we looped in (SFU assistant coach) Jessica (Wallace) and that was it” summed Parker.

And all you need to do is take one look at the varied career paths of the alumni who agreed to take part in the program’s pilot year and you’re reminded of how such a diverse group of individuals have been brought together through the commonality of basketball to create lifetime bonds.

Joining Kalenuik as player mentors this season: Ellen Kett (2013-17 registered nurse) Morgan McLaughlin (1999-2005 educator/administrator) Joby McKenzie (1994-98 health care executive) Kate Pearce née Hole (2006-10 lawyer) Brea McLaughlin (2005-10 registered psychology student) Kirsten Mulleny née Wood (1997-2002 teacher) Dani Langford (physiotherapist 2000-05) Courtney Brown (2002-07 sports specialist chiropractor) Anna Carolsfeld (2007-12 organic farmer/outdoor educator) Alex Wright (2006-11 civil servant Scotland) and Erin Hobin (1996-99 public health research scientist).

Parker says that when the word first went out to the program’s past players response was overwhelming.

“Even in our initial outreach we had so many alumni saying ‘We would love to help out even if it’s not a formal mentorship’” related Parker. “They asked if maybe they could do some informal speaking with the whole team.”

On that note alumni like Meg Wilson (2012-17) Candice Odgers (1994-97) Rebecca Langmead (2010-14) Lisa Tindle (2006-10) and Pam Reynolds (1995-99) have all given of their time to the current edition.

And while Simon Fraser’s women’s basketball history of course pre-dates this season’s entire group of mentors Parker says another goal of IMPACT is to strive to bring all of its eras closer together.

“We also want the program to not only connect alumni with current student-athletes but also to connect alumni from different generations with each other” she says with hope.

THE POWER OF CONNECTION

If Laura Kalenuik and Georgia Swant had somehow played in the same era on the same team and in the same Simon Fraser back court perhaps we would see the same chemistry the pair have discovered in their mentor-mentee relationship.

“I definitely feel connected to her through the SFU basketball program and by the fact that she played my sport” admits Swant an environmental sciences major.

Adds Kalenuik the former Brookswood Bobcat who known in her playing days for sporting a distinctive headband: “When you ask me what it was like (to play for SFU) right now I am just smiling thinking about it. Now the mentorship program and the chance to work with Georgia has brought me back into the team. It’s been fun for me to go back and pretend that I am 20 again to be able to ask Georgia ‘What was practice like today?’ because I never talk like that.”

Now that they are maybe that’s when they’ll get down to comparing some of the highlights from their high school and university careers.

Perhaps Kalenuik will discover that in the 2016 B.C. junior girls championship final Swant was named MVP in a title-game win over Walnut Grove after she poured home a game-high 45 points.

Or maybe Swant will gasp just a little when she finds out that Kalenuik in the opening game of the 2005 CIS nationals in Winnipeg hit six three-pointers over a 16-minute span and that her team-high 18 points helped propel Simon Fraser to a win over the Ottawa Gee-Gees on their way to a perfect 27-0 Bronze Baby-winning season.

Yet as Kalenuik proudly reminds the support that the IMPACT program has been able to give back to the team’s current student-athletes has the potential to extend far beyond the game itself.

“Our chemistry it started out slow just like it does in any relationship” she said “but this morning we were texting and talking about things completely unrelated to basketball. I think it’s a relationship that will continue and it will turn into a friendship after that.”

And throughout the last 12 months Parker Dani Langford Wilson Wallace and all of those committed to growing the IMPACT program over the coming years have come to understand the full nature of the team’s resilient culture even though daily progress has had to be measured through the pandemic’s non-standard metrics.

In fact just getting everything off the ground in the midst of COVID has opened their eyes to limitlessness of the virtual setting.

“I think it’s interesting that COVID played a part in how we actually implemented and delivered it” Parker explained. “It made us aware that we can be flexible and that people can meet remotely. We’ve got mentors in places like Toronto and Edinburgh. It’s offered us this opportunity to think about how to expand it even greater.”

Yet however large it might happen to grow you can still boil its mission down to connection.

“She told me that when she was here in school that she was a little bit lost in terms of what she wanted to do afterwards” Swant says of just such a moment of connection and relatability she shared recently with Kalenuik. “It was just nice to hear her say that when she was my age she didn’t know what she wanted to do.”

And Kalenuik for her part smiles to reveal what to her seems to be a treasured silver lining.

“As much as through the IMPACT program I have been able to be a mentor to Georgia from my perspective she has also helped me in so many ways” Kalenuik says moved by the way Swant has persevered to be her best self as young person during a worldwide health crisis.

“I feel that she has taught me just as I hope I have been able to teach her.”

Just as the student can learn from the teacher so too can the teacher learn from the student.

The new delay on the project already years behind schedule and billion of dollars over budget will likely mean higher rates for Georgia Power customers.

In a filing with the Public Service Commission on Friday the company cited the need for additional “remediation work. Georgia Power's parent company assured investors for years that by the November 2021 deadline the first of two new reactors would be in commercial operation.

Georgia Power customers already have a fee on their monthly bills related to the construction even though the reactors at Plant Vogtle south of Augusta aren't yet generating electricity. Additional costs related to the latest delay could also be passed on to customers.

If more delays occur the PSC could impose a short-term reduction in the amount of profit it allows the company to make. But long-term customers could be paying for the construction for decades.

In addition to Georgia Power a number of municipal electrical systems and electric co-ops are contractually obligated to use electricity from the plant once it goes online.

The Vogtle expansion is the only major commercial nuclear power expansion project currently underway in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI1MDEwMjA3OS5odG1s0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAua2Fuc2FzY2l0eS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlMjUwMTAyMDc5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kansas City Southern board agrees to sell to Canadian Pacific for $29 billion,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kansascity.com', port=443): Read timed out.

It is an effort to capitalize on the trade flows expected to run through the three countries after President Donald J. Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law last year. It’s also a bet on the strength of the industrial economy as the United States rebounds from the pandemic.

Canadian Pacific links major ports on the East and West Coasts between the United States and Canada while Kansas City Southern connects the United States Mexico and Panama. The two connect on a single point: a joint facility in Kansas City Mo. where Kansas City Southern is based.

“This deal just has so many longer-term strategic advantages” Kansas City Southern’s chief executive Patrick J. Ottensmeyer said in an interview. “Our board really saw the value in putting these two companies together right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzMyODEwLWNwLXJhaWwtYWdyZWVzLXRvLWJ1eS1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1zb3V0aGVybi1mb3ItMjUtYmlsbGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CP Rail Agrees to Buy Kansas City Southern for $25 Billion,"Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion seeking to create a 20000-mile rail network linking the U.S. Mexico and Canada in the first year of those nations’ new trade alliance.

The transaction creates the only network that cuts through all three North American countries giving CP access to the Kansas City Missouri-based company’s sprawling Midwestern rail network that connects farms in Kansas and Missouri to ports along the Gulf of Mexico. The network would also let CP reach deep into Mexico which made up almost half of Kansas City Southern’s revenue last year.

“I’ve had my eye on the KCS for quite some time” CP Chief Executive Officer Keith Creel said in a telephone interview. “We extend our reach for our customers through the U.S. and into Mexico and at the same time KCS can do the same coming from Mexico up to U.S. destinations and Canada.”

The combination — the biggest purchase of a U.S. asset by a Canadian company since 2016 — would provide a transportation solution for manufacturers seeking to bring factories back to North America after the pandemic exposed risks of relying on overseas supply chains Creel said. The merger has a “compelling and powerful environmental impact” by enticing more truck cargo to rail which is about four times more fuel efficient he said.

Kansas City investors will receive 0.489 of a CP share and $90 in cash for each share they hold valuing the stock at $275 apiece — 23% more than Friday’s record close according to a statement from both companies on Sunday.

Creel will be CEO of the new company to be based in Calgary and is expected to remain at the helm until at least early 2026 according to a separate statement. The new entity to be called Canadian Pacific Kansas City or CPKC will have revenue of about $8.7 billion and almost 20000 employees.

Trade Play

The transaction would be the biggest Canadian purchase of a U.S. asset since Enbridge agreed to buy Spectra Energy for about $28 billion five years ago according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That deal closed in early 2017.

The deal comes as trade across the three nations is expected to pick up under the Biden administration. Just days after his inauguration U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with the leaders of Canada and Mexico his first calls with foreign counterparts where issues from trade to climate change were discussed.

Mexico is a crucial supplier of vehicles auto parts electronics and food and a major customer of grain fuel and consumer goods — ties that are likely to be strengthened by July’s passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact.

Kansas City’s unique network linking Mexico’s largest industrial cities and ports to the U.S. Midwest would be positioned to benefit if the coronavirus pandemic and fraying ties between the U.S. and China prompt companies to move lower-wage manufacturing from Asia to North America.

As part of the transaction CP will issue 44.5 million new shares to be financed with cash-on-hand and about $8.6 billion in debt. CP’s debt would jump to about $20 billion and leverage would increase to about four times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. Free cash flow of about $7 billion over a three-year period from the combined railroad would help CP whittle that down to 2.5 times.

CP expects to boost adjusted diluted EPS in the first full year after completing the deal and later generate double-digit accretion. The combination will result in about $780 million of efficiency gains over three years with about three-fourths of that coming from profit increase.

No Job Cuts

There will be no workforce reductions Creel said in the interview and he predicted the merger will result in job gains as sales grow.

CP will file the merger application with the U.S. Surface and Transportation Board on Monday and begin the process of creating a trust that will hold Kansas City Southern’s shares while approval is pending Creel said. The companies expect a review by the STB to be completed by mid-2022

On a conference call with analysts Sunday Creel said there’s “minimal risk’’ that regulators will block the deal. There are no situations in which the merger will cause shippers to lose access to rail options he said.

“The Canadian Pacific-KC Southern combination has most of the hallmarks for regulatory approval” said Lee Klaskow analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It will remain the smallest Class I railroad and the lack of overlap and the extension of the combined networks will not impede competition in our view and may result in improved fluidity.”

He added that Kansas City Southern is exempt from the regulator’s “high-hurdle merger rules.”

Still there could be other obstacles. CP’s hostile attempt to acquire Norfolk Southern Corp. beginning in 2015 collapsed amid a hail of shipper criticism including from United Parcel Service Inc. FedEx Corp. and even the U.S. Army which uses the rails to transport military equipment. Creel called the deal “simple and pro-competition” because the two networks don’t overlap.

“It provides a positive impact for all stakeholders including the public interest” Creel said. “Existing customers get to extend their length of haul and reach into new markets as well as new customers that this network will naturally attract.”

A Repeat Target

Kansas City Southern the smallest of the U.S.’s Class I freight railroads has been a takeover target before.

In September Dow Jones reported that the company rejected a $20 billion offer from Blackstone Group Inc. and Global Infrastructure Partners. Rumors of Kansas City Southern as a takeover target have swirled for years especially after Canadian National Railway completed the purchase of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1999 that gave it access to ports in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Creel and Kansas City Southern CEO Pat Ottensmeyer said they began talks on the merger late last year. The two companies which have worked together for years with railcar exchanges decided the timing was right especially after the revamped U.S.- Mexico-Canada trade deal that replaced NAFTA Ottensmeyer said.

“This is a combination that just makes tremendous sense given that lack of overlap and the opportunities such as USMCA present for the outlook for rail and the footprint that this company is going to have in terms of an unmatched North American network” Ottensmeyer said in the telephone interview.

It’s not because of any training program or incentives that the company has set up.

One of the most frustrating thing I hear from cabin crew all the time is about the small percentage of their colleagues who are slackers who perform poorly and do as little work as possible (increasing the workload for everyone else). This is frustrating because there’s usually very little consequence. And seeing poor performers do just as well as those who provide exemplary service is demoralizing.

This isn’t strictly a union versus non-union issue. While in general Delta’s non-union flight attendants have seemed happier with their jobs and friendlier to customers than American’s Southwest Airlines unionized flight attendants are generally more than pleasant too. Southwest does however manage to push out disgruntled employees about 1/7th of 1% per year.

U.S. airlines mostly discipline for attendance not poor service and there’s little they can do to change this culture – or so it seems. United Airlines is actually trying something new: sharing passenger feedback from each flight directly with cabin crew.

United surveys passengers on their flight experience – satisfaction with service whether they were thanked whether cabin crew were visible throughout the flight and whether they were friendly. You might think that only people who complain fill out surveys but “In 2020 United flight attendants received over 20000 compliments.”

United is starting a test April 1 to share survey feedback with Chicago and Honolulu-based cabin crew flying certain routes

The airline will roll out surveys in-app and via seat back entertainment screens.

The question – and it’s a really interesting one – is will direct customer feedback (anonymized after a flight) be taken constructively causing employees to try to do better? Will positive feedback reinforce an employee’s desire to perform well? It’s still not a monetary reward. Their position in the company isn’t necessarily enhanced. But we all like positive feedback and to do those things which garners it. And if it’s clear how to avoid negative feedback that could shape behavior as well.

This could easily go wrong and I wonder whether United will actually censor some of the comments. Feedback provided anonymously via a keyboard can be mean-spirited and foul-mouthed. Believe me I get some every day!

Still in a world where U.S. airlines have few tools for encouraging good service and competing forces that demoralize crew into working as little as some of their colleagues get away with this is an interesting experiment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcmV0LmNvbS91dGFoLzIwMjEvMy8yMC8yMjI5NTUxMC9zdGV2ZS1qb2JzLW9mLXRoZS1za2llcy1yZWFkeS1kby1pdC1hZ2Fpbi1icmVlemUtZGF2aWQtbmVlbGVtYW4tc2V0YmFja3MtYWRoZC1sYXVuY2gtZm91ci1haXJsaW5lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah entrepreneur David Neeleman is launching his next airline Breeze – Deseret News,"It’s almost 10 a.m. and David Neeleman just finished his eighth run on the Mountaineer lift. Not bad since the lifts open at 9.

He’s got appointments and meetings starting at 10 so it will have to go at that. But he looked out the window when he woke up saw a half-foot of fresh powder and couldn’t think of a single reason why he shouldn’t track it up.

His ski-in ski-out Deer Valley house is next to the lift which makes it convenient and in true Neeleman fashion he has the drill down: 3 ½ minutes for the lift ride a little over a minute to go downhill — so five minutes per run give or take with no breaks.

Welcome to the perpetual motion world of David Neeleman a man who never met a laurel he wanted to rest on.

Here he is at 61 his position already preserved as the Steve Jobs of the airline industry — a national publication called him “Lord of the Skies” — with a net worth of $400 million according to Forbes with 10 children and 24 grandchildren and two on the way and all sorts of stories to tell them about how their grandfather launched four major airlines and helped rescue another one on three continents no less; not to mention inventing ticketless travel and the home reservation system.

And yet here he is about to launch his fifth airline this one right back home in Utah where it all began.

Ask him why and he’ll tell you it’s for two simple reasons: When he sees a niche he likes to fill it and he loves to make life better for people. That’s the motivation that created Morris Air WestJet JetBlue and Azul all of them airlines that went where others didn’t and did things others wouldn’t.

And that’s the motivation behind Breeze his new airline headquartered along the Wasatch Front in Cottonwood Heights scheduled to open this summer that will connect regional cities and “fly where people don’t fly” in addition to revolutionizing the flight attendant industry and setting new standards in being “nice.”

He probably couldn’t stop if he tried.

Almost 40 years ago he was working toward a degree at the University of Utah when he took the first of the many detours that have defined his career. You might say his secret to success is getting bankrupted laid off or fired.

He was in his second year at the university just another business major looking to get started on his first million when a classmate told him about a relative who was having trouble selling timeshares at a condo project he owned in Honolulu. That set Neeleman’s mind to whirling: If they’re just sitting empty why not rent the condos until they’re sold?

He took out an ad in the newspaper (this was 1981 people did that back then) offering Hawaii condos for $50 to $75 a night. When it turned out there was a healthy market for the rentals Neeleman upped the ante and partnered with airlines and hotels to create low-cost Hawaiian getaway packages. He also dropped out of school. There was money to make and deals to be made.

That’s how the entrepreneurial force that is David Neeleman began. It was the public’s first glimpse into his ability to look at what everyone else was looking at and see opportunities and improvements no else could see.

Legacy of success

He wasn’t the first Neeleman to act like this nor the last. The family tree is full of stories of innovation overachieving and never slowing down.

David’s younger brother Stephen for example built from scratch Draper-based HealthEquity the largest health care savings plan in the nation; his father Gary rose from cub reporter to the top echelons of United Press International — and today at 87 remains Brazilian Honorary Consul for Utah and with his wife Rose is working on their 13th book; and you may have heard of his nephew Zach Wilson his sister Lisa and husband Mike Wilson’s son the expected high first-round NFL draft pick this year despite being a lightly recruited quarterback out of high school — to list just a few of many examples.

But to get to the original high-energy source you have to go back to John “Johnny” Neeleman David’s grandfather.

Born in 1911 to Dutch immigrants who arrived in Utah with their membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the catalyst that brought them here and little else John Neeleman went from nothing to own and operate no less than nine businesses in his lifetime among them a chain of stores he called Miniature Markets.

Today they’d be called convenience stores. But in 1951 nobody knew that term because Johnny Neeleman had just invented the concept.

He had noticed that large supermarket chains were driving the traditional corner markets out of business. His idea was to create a store that would be open at all hours and conveniently provide everything anyone needed including freshly made sandwiches.

The first Miniature Market on 600 South and State Street was such a hit he opened two more one on 3300 South and another on Highland Drive. The all-day all-night business’ reputation spread to the point that the national magazine Argosy sent a reporter and photographer to Salt Lake City to do a feature story on “the biggest little store in America.”

Gary Neeleman remembers his father’s reaction to the national publicity.

“I said ‘Isn’t that great?’” says Gary.

“He said ‘Son I’m madder than hell about it. Now everybody will want to take my idea.”

He was right. Soon men from the Southland Corp. in Texas walked into Neeleman’s store and started asking questions: Where do you get the bread for your sandwiches? How much business do you get in the evening? How do you rotate your stock?

The Southland Corp. owned a small number of stores in the Dallas area called 7-Eleven.

“It wasn’t long after that that 7-Eleven stores were everywhere” says Gary — including just down the street from the Miniature Markets. (Incidentally the 3300 South Miniature Market is still going strong; it is owned by Mike and Lisa Wilson the quarterback’s parents who make hundreds of fresh sandwiches every morning.)

Like all his brothers and sisters David Neeleman worked at his grandpa’s stores. He started when he was 9 and had to stand on a milk crate to see over the counter. From there he had a front-row seat to his grandfather’s tremendous work ethic — “That guy could not sit still” says David — and a fixation on customer service that bordered on obsession.

“His theme was ‘Our customers are right even when they’re wrong’” says Gary.

“When a customer came in the store and asked for something we didn’t have he’d say ‘Here have a donut and cup of coffee’ and stall them while I’d run out the back door to the Safeway and get what they wanted” remembers David. “He really focused on customers and making them happy. He never wanted to lose a customer.”

Up in the air

David Neeleman’s Hawaii condo rental package enterprise was a roaring success — until it wasn’t.

All was going great until Hawaiian Express the airline David partnered with to provide transportation between L.A. and Honolulu went out of business without warning and filed for bankruptcy. David’s company was doing $6 million annually but it was cash poor. Unable to reimburse customers for tickets already bought and paid for he too was forced to take out bankruptcy. He learned the hard way about having unreliable partners and insufficient reserves and now at 23 he was back at square one — working for his grandfather at Miniature Markets minus the milk crate.

But not for long.

June Morris a woman who had built Morris Travel into one of Salt Lake’s most successful travel agencies had watched David’s innovative genius with the Hawaiian rentals. Maybe he could do something similar for her.

Anyone who was in Salt Lake City in the 1980s is familiar with the rest of the story. With David at the controls Morris Travel transformed into Morris Air featuring $399 weeklong Salt Lake-to-Hawaii travel packages and $69 fares to Los Angeles. No one had ever offered something this affordable and convenient.

The masses gobbled it up like manna. By the time he was 27 David paid off the mortgage on his house. By the time he was 33 Southwest Airlines swooped in and bought Morris Air for $130 million. David’s share was $25 million plus an executive position with Southwest Airlines.

On paper it was everything the young entrepreneur had dreamed of. He had more money than he’d ever need and now he’d get to work with Southwest founder Herb Kelleher the man Neeleman most admired in the airline industry.

But it was one thing to be the young guy with the innovative ideas and relentless energy in a small company in Salt Lake City where everyone was like family quite another at a successful well-established airline in Dallas. The old guard at Southwest looked at David like he was a mosquito they wanted to swat. He didn’t last six months. It was Kelleher a great admirer of Neeleman’s talent who took the young man to dinner at Ruth’s Chris in Dallas and said “It’s not working. You’re driving everybody insane.”

At 34 David Neeleman was out of work. Again.

He could have retired and licked his wounds. He had plenty of money. Instead he returned to Utah and started Open Skies a software company that refined the ticketless ticket system David had envisioned and implemented at Morris Air — the innovation that was the prime motivator behind Southwest’s takeover.

And just to make sure he didn’t have time on his hands as he waited out the five-year noncompete clause that was part of the Southwest deal he helped found a low-fare airline in Canada (where the clause wasn’t in effect) that was more or less a Morris Air clone called WestJet.

‘This is me’

It was during this interlude that Neeleman learned something important about himself that went a long way in explaining his frenetic behavior.

David’s parents had taken his youngest brother to a doctor to see why the teenager was having trouble concentrating in school. The diagnosis: Mark had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a condition that hadn’t even been labeled until just a few years earlier in 1987.

Suspecting David might also have ADHD Rose Neeleman sent her son a book “Driven to Distraction” by Edward M. Hallowell that listed 21 characteristics of ADHD.

“I read those 21 things and I put the book down and I had tears in my eyes” recalls David. “I had every one of them. I thought ‘Wow! This is me.’”

It explained a lot: why he had such a hard time concentrating on anything he wasn’t interested in; why he graduated “semi-illiterate” from Brighton High School with mostly C’s and D’s; why he scored so low on his college entrance exam that his counselor in amazement remarked “You could have just marked C for every answer and gotten a higher score.”

David was well beyond high school before ADHD entered everyday lexicon and youngsters began to be treated with medication and other therapies.

“Now everyone likes to say they have it but no one knew about it when I was growing up” says Neeleman. “It was tough for me. I was gregarious and I could get my way through things but I couldn’t read. I could tell you everything I thought about what was in a book except for what was on the page.”

Discovering he had ADHD in his 30s didn’t cause him to take medication or other treatments. David’s dad Gary tells the story of David giving a talk at Harvard Business School.

“They asked him if he was taking medication for his ADHD. He told them ‘No.’ They asked ‘Why not?’ He said ‘Because if I did I’d be just like the rest of you.’”

But having a better understanding of what drove him was incredibly liberating and freeing and not only for David for the whole Neeleman clan. It explained why his grandpa Johnny literally worked until the day before he died; it explained why his father Gary is still writing books in his 80s; it explained why Neelemans are as Gary proclaims “these 100% crazy driven people.”

Creating JetBlue

When the noncompete period was up in 1998 David sold Open Skies to Hewlett Packard left the running of WestJet to his partners and got to work building the airline he’d had five years to envision — his next magnum opus: JetBlue.

No one had seen anything quite like it: a discount airline with leather upholstery TVs in every seat satellite radio convenient airports new routes a computerized ticketless reservation system operated by agents working from their homes and an emphasis on being on time.

“A customer service company that just happens to fly airplanes” is how Neeleman described the new venture.

“David was like a clone of our grandfather” says his brother Stephen. “He never wanted to disappoint the customer.”

In an industry notoriously short on putting passengers first JetBlue and its innovations took off like the proverbial rocket. The airline quickly assumed a place among America’s largest carriers.

Then for Neeleman the ride ended much faster than expected. In 2007 JetBlue’s board fired the founder. A disastrous ice storm that winter caused major disruptions and left passengers stranded aboard a JetBlue flight for hours — in New York no less generating awful publicity.

Ironically the man who brought humanity back to air travel was made the scapegoat. The company had gone public and Neeleman had no recourse. Like Steve Jobs with Apple the very thing he’d created showed him the door.

Neeleman has never downplayed the betrayal he felt. “I was totally devastated” he says. “I killed myself for that company. For years as I would land in airports it would be hard to look over and see my airline.”

But he’d been here before and knew his only recourse was to get back on the proverbial horse and do it again.

That’s when he turned his attention to Brazil the land of his birth.

David was born in Sao Paulo on Oct. 19 1959 and lived in Brazil the first five years of his life. His parents had moved there from Salt Lake City when Gary who learned Portuguese on his Latter-day Saint mission in Brazil took a job at 23 as a correspondent for UPI launching one of the most successful careers in that wire service’s history (eventually he became bureau chief for all of Central and South America).

David too served a mission in Brazil when he was 19. With his status as a Brazilian citizen (thanks to his birth) fluency in Portuguese and love for the people he set his sights on bringing the country a lower cost more convenient form of airline travel.

He knew the two Brazils. During travels with his father he’d seen the affluent Brazil. As a missionary he’d lived with the poor. “That contrast really annoyed me” he has said. “It made me want to do something to make a difference for the lower classes.”

The result was Azul Airlines. And yes there is a subliminal message in the name. Azul translates to blue in English.

Azul opened up the Brazilian skies to a population that had long been underserved creating routes between dozens of cities without previous air service and greatly increasing the number of nonstop flights.

Shortly after opening in 2008 just a year after Neeleman’s unceremonious dismissal from JetBlue Azul began to emerge as one of Brazil’s top carriers. In 2021 it employs 15000 people and is the country’s No. 2 airline in terms of revenue and No. 1 in terms of daily departures and cities served over 100 of them from corner to corner of the massive country comprising more than 800 flights and more than 80000 passengers daily.

In 2015 Neeleman also stepped up to help rescue TAP Portugal’s struggling national airline by buying a percentage of the company and infusing capital that rebuilt the fleet. When he sold his share in 2020 Portugal’s government thanked the Brazilian-American entrepreneur for his assistance in shoring up the troubled carrier.

A new venture

Which brings us to the present.

These days Neeleman is back home in Utah. He continues to oversee Azul (he made sure to write into the company bylaws that he cannot be fired) but not on an everyday basis. He bought the ski-in-ski-out house in Deer Valley five years ago so the family had a place to gather for vacations and a year ago made that his permanent residence.

The Brighton High grad is in high demand from business schools and companies that probe him for his secrets to success. And like it or not he has become something of an authority on moving on past setbacks.

“It isn’t what happens to you it’s how you deal with it” is his mantra. “Nursing a grudge doesn’t do any good it’s just wasted energy.” (With a smile he adds “Although I would be lying to you if I said when Azul’s market cap was approaching JetBlue’s it didn’t give me a thrill.”)

“Be who you are” is another mantra. His ADHD might make reading more difficult but it helps him quickly distill complex situations into workable solutions. “It drives my team crazy” he says. “They’ll go ‘It’s not that simple’ and I’ll go ‘Yes it is.’”

He skis a lot more now and rides his mountain bike in the summer and spends time with his kids and grandkids almost all of whom are in Utah. He has eight guest bedrooms in his house and he’s adding two more enough for each of his 10 children even if they all arrive at once. Sometimes they come close. Over Christmas he had 17 of his 24 grandkids on the hill skiing at the same time.

“He’s like an old shoe there’s no pretense” says his dad.

But don’t get the impression the Steve Jobs of the Skies is slowing down. This summer he’s set to roll out his next grand scheme: Breeze Airlines.

Breeze is based on three concepts: fly routes that others don’t use young college aged kids as flight attendants while Breeze helps put them through school and become the world’s “nicest” airline.

It is Breeze’s intent to connect smaller and mid-size cities with nonstop service.

“We feel there are literally hundreds of routes we can serve where people can get places quicker for less money” says Neeleman.

Using college students as flight attendants stems from Neeleman watching too many flight attendants over the years work for perennially low wages well past retirement — and burnout — age. Too often “it’s a career that keeps you on the road as life slowly passes you by” he observes.

His vision is a Breeze Airlines college scholarship program. Breeze will pay the tuition and expenses of qualified young people as they work as Breeze flight attendants while concurrently pursuing their degrees via online study. It will allow them to travel and see the world while they’re young and once they graduate they can move on to the career of their choice.

He’s started a pilot program with Utah Valley University and is exploring affiliating with Southern Utah University and others.

As for being nice Neeleman believes that is the foundation of all business or should be. “If we say we’re the nicest airline that’s not overpromising. It’s a message to our passengers and a message to our people. That’s what we do. That’s who we are.”

As has been the case since his earliest gambit when he discounted those timeshare condos in Hawaii David Neeleman sees it as a good deal-good deal-good deal — a good deal for his customers a good deal for his employees and perhaps most of all a good deal for himself.

“The more people you touch the more good you do the more lives you change the happier you are” he says.

Very different. Screenshot by ZDNet

Airlines offered so much good news last week that it was hard to know how happy to be.

Delta United and Alaska all made noises about soon breaking even. Gary Kelly Southwest's CEO chirped that this ""feels like the beginning of the end.""

So along came American Airlines to helpfully prepare customers for what the end might really look like.

It offered ABC's Good Morning America a glimpse at all the tech innovations it's bringing to the passenger experience.

Some of them may seem a little chilling even if the intention -- officially-- is to make passengers feel good.

This is the new normal. A normal where you go to the airport and are encouraged to touch nothing at all.

Instead your face is your passport to everything but another country. You check in by staring into a camera. You drop your bag off by staring into another camera.

It's surely the most glorious experience for all those who have obsessively taken selfies since toddlerhood.

""Everything you saw at our airport today didn't exist a year ago"" said Julie Rath American's VP of customer experience.

Oh I don't know about that. Almost two years ago I was at Minneapolis Airport watching Delta's international passengers being boarded via facial recognition. This was supposed to be optional. It didn't seem very optional at all.

American too has been testing the new technology on some of its international flights. Easy to do when they're not exactly full. The intention now though is to install these systems for all domestic flights.

Some might mutter that it's interesting how disasters often lead to greater intrusions. And it's not as if facial recognition has an exemplary reputation thus far.

Yet here was Rath's answer on being asked if the future of air travel is your phone and your face: ""In the future you may not even need your phone. Just literally facial recognition can get you through the airport.""

I fancy one or two people will just literally feel uncomfortable about that.

It's all very well instituting COVID-19-inspired innovations such as touchless payment on board or QR codes that allow you to have a video chat with a customer service robot -- I'm sorry I mean a real live customer service person.

But when your face is your whole your identity is surely disseminated even further and wider than it is now.

Ah says American. Please don't worry about that. All the data is completely disappeared from its systems within 24 hours.

""Oh that's OK then"" say customers who have lived a while.

Here is where your desperation to fly again meets your concerns about privacy. Do you even stop to think about any privacy risks if you can finally -- and perhaps safely -- get on a plane and disappear for a little while?

Well when you've already had your whole body being intimately photographed by the X-Ray machine every time you fly why worry about whether your face might be floating in some distant ether?

This is the future. You don't need to embrace it. It's far too busy embracing you and never letting go.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL3JlcG9ydHMtb2Ytc2hvb3RpbmctYXQtaG91c3Rvbi1tYWxsLXdlcmUtdW5mb3VuZGVkLWNvcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reports of shooting at Houston mall were unfounded: cops,"Houston we don’t have a problem.

But cops found no “evidence of shots being fired” at the Galleria Mall Saturday and no victims have come forward.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.32%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

South Korea’s retail giant Shinsegae is reviewing ways to double its stake in Starbucks Korea from 50% to 100% according to an industry source on Mar. 19.Shinsegae’s affiliate E-mart currently owns 50% of Starbucks Korea while Starbucks Corporation headquartered in the US owns the other 50%.If the deal is successful Starbucks Korea would become a wholly owned subsidiary of E-mart which will receive double the dividends from the company. Starbucks Korea paid out annual dividends of 30 billion won ($26.6 million) each to E-mart and Starbucks Corporation last year.“While we are having thorough reviews on the topic internally nothing has yet been confirmed” said a Shinsegae spokesman.Starbucks Korea will still have to pay royalties at the current rate of 5% to Starbucks headquarters even if E-mart owns a 100% stake in the company.South Korea’s retail and franchise industry has been speculating for years regarding Starbucks Korea’s next steps.Many had projected that Starbucks headquarters would want to purchase E-mart’s shares to operate independently as it did in China and Japan in the last five years.In case of a successful deal between Shinsegae and Starbucks Corporation South Korea will mark the first country in Asia where Starbucks is 100%-owned by a local operator.Starbucks Korea was established as a 50:50 joint venture between E-mart and Starbucks Corporation in 1997 opened its first branch in 1999 and expanded to 1503 branches as of December last year.Starbucks Korea’s revenue now exceeds 10% of Starbucks’ total revenue generated globally but its operating margin falls behind the global average.Starbucks currently holds the highest coffee franchise market share in Korea surpassing 1 trillion won ($885 million) revenue in 2016 and maintaining more than 20% year-over-year growth rates from 2017 to 2019 at 26% 20.5% and 22.8% respectively.Last year Starbucks Korea generated 1.92 trillion won ($1.7 billion) in revenue just 80 billion short of 2 trillion won ($1.77 billion).Bo-Ra Kim at destinybr@hankyung.com Daniel Cho edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbXBsZW1vc3QuY29tL2hvdy1vcmRlci1zdGFyYnVja3MtY2lubmFtb24tdG9hc3QtY3J1bmNoLWRyaW5rL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to order a Starbucks Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink,"Is it just us or is everyone obsessed with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal? Make no mistake we are not complaining one bit. The power of the combination of sugar and cinnamon is clearly too big to contain in a basic box of cereal. In recent months we’ve seen everything from Cinnamon Toast Crunch flavored milk to a magical seasoning that sprinkles the flavor of your favorite cereal on anything you want.

And now you can get a Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink via Starbucks’ “secret menu.” The not-so-secret Starbucks menu keeps growing as people get more creative with their coffee cravings to come up with their own blends. We’ve seen the Cookies and Cream Cold Brew and the 50-calorie Nutella Cold Brew trending lately. But with word of a Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink hitting social media we think we’ve found a better way to get your cereal fix.

Breakfast cereal isolated on a white background

It’s important to remember that the Starbucks secret menu isn’t something you can see when you go to Starbucks. It’s actually a collection of exciting drinks that customers have created by combining actual ingredients already available at the coffee chain. Some mimic favorite snacks including Girl Scout Cookies or even another cereal favorite Cap’n Crunch.

To “order” an item from it you have to give your barista specific instructions based on the drink you want them to create. Fortunately there are a number of online sites and social media accounts that share step-by-step directions on how to order the perfect drink.

Totallythebomb.com is one of our go-to sources for getting the scoop on Starbucks secret menu drinks and it never disappoints with the details. This particular drink is a combination of a white mocha cinnamon dolce syrup whipped cream cinnamon and Sugar in the Raw.

Here’s exactly how to order your Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink:

First order a Venti Iced White Mocha

Then ask for two pumps of White Mocha

Next ask for three pumps of Cinnamon Dolce syrup

Then ask for the whipped cream topping

And finally ask for a sprinkle of Sugar in the Raw and Cinnamon on top.

If iced coffee is not your thing no worries. You can order the Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink hot as well.

YouTuber Hannah Martin gave a glowing review of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink calling it “one of her top 3 drinks.”

If drinking the milk in your finished bowl of cereal is your jam then you might want to check out the new Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink from Starbucks. But if you think ordering off the secret menu is too much trouble you could also try the company’s new Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso — people on Twitter say it too tastes a lot like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRobGFrZXN0eWxlLmNvbS9mb29kL29wZW5pbmdzLWNsb3NpbmdzL3N0YXJidWNrcy1hdC13aGl0ZSVFMiU4MCU5OXMtY2hhcGVsLWJvdWxldmFyZC1pcy1jbG9zaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks At White's Chapel Boulevard Is Closing,"One of Southlake’s long-standing Starbucks locations is closing for good next weekend.

Drive-thrus are becoming increasingly important for fast food and quick-service restaurants and some of the most successful have slimmed down menus significantly over the last year. Starbucks unlike its competition continues to add to the menu with no signs of cutting it back.

On-the-go orders meaning drive-thru and pickup orders made up 80% of Starbucks orders prior to the pandemic Starbucks told Insider and increased more than 10% over pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2021. Drive-thrus have been up industry-wide because they are perceived as a ""safe way to use the brand"" Kalinowski Equity Research founder Mark Kalinowski told Insider.

Companies that rely on drive-thru business have cut items from menus and consolidated size options to make the drive-thru experience faster Kalinowski says for example Chick-fil-A removed decaf hot coffee from menus and narrowed options for coffee sizes.

While slimmer menus are the way drive-thru menus are trending Kalinowski says he doesn't expect that from Starbucks. ""They have a ton of customization and that's not going away. They believe it's a strength"" he told Insider.

Customers generally don't expect Starbucks to be as speedy as Wendy's or McDonald's because they're offering fundamentally different things. In 2020 Starbucks lagged behind coffee competitor Dunkin' in terms of speed according to QSR's annual drive-thru study. While Starbucks is working to make drive-thrus more efficient it isn't trying to be the fastest drive-thru around Kalinowski says. ""Customization is much more meaningful for Starbucks"" he says even if it means slightly longer waits.

Starbucks is actually expanding menus right now most recently with the addition of oat milk and new drinks that incorporate it. With every new product announcement Starbucks encourages customers to customize it with different milks syrups cold foam and thousands of other potential combinations sometimes to the chagrin of baristas.

Starbucks has no plans to pare down menus although available drinks change seasonally a spokesperson told Insider on a phone call.

Other fast-food chains have cut menus since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to keep up with supply chain changes customer desires and to make drive-thru waits shorter. McDonald's discontinued all-day breakfast salads grilled chicken sandwiches and chicken tenders in March to ""simplify operations in our kitchens and for our crew"" Insider reported last spring.

Taco Bell cut more than a dozen items in 2020 including fan favorites like the seven-layer burrito and Mexican pizza. Despite outcry from fans last year the leaner menu proved to be a smart decision as the chain shifted to more drive-thru orders and sales grew 5% in the quarter following the menu change.

Starbucks is still making efforts to improve drive-thru efficiency just not through cutting menus. Baristas can take orders through digital drive-thru screens which the company says are installed at about 3800 stores. Starbucks began rolling them out in 2015 and they use AI called ""Deep Brew"" to recommend food and drinks based on the weather and time of day.

The company is also rolling out handheld devices for baristas to input orders on. Starbucks says they are in 500 stores and were first implemented this past summer. Kalinowski says these newer drive-thru technologies can minimize wait times in drive-thrus.

""In a traditional drive-thru there's only one place an order can be taken"" he told Insider. ""That creates huge bottlenecks"" compared to having mobile stations where customers can place orders.

Starbucks says it is designing new drive-thru ideas including double lanes drive-thru-only stores and drive-thru plus curbside pickup locations. After learning from experience during the pandemic drive-thrus will likely continue to get better Kalinowski says."

Despite being overmatched on paper against Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary in the Division II state championship the Stallions spent the first 16 minutes of the game playing without fear and led by five at halftime. Then the wheels fell off.

The Fighting Irish outscored DeSales 26-9 in the third quarter to go from trailing by five to a commanding 12-point lead. The dominant quarter powered SVSM to its OHSAA-record ninth state championship as it went on to win 72-50.

""We tried to eliminate easy shots which we did a decent job of in the first half"" coach Pat Murphy said. ""We tried to take care of the ball which we did a really good job of in the first half. Tried to eliminate second chances for them which we did a really good job of in the first half. Tried to get to the rim and the free throw line which we did a really good job of in the first half.

""I sound like a broken record. We were prepared. We just got beat by a better team which happens sometimes.""

It took the Fighting Irish (26-2) only two minutes 13 seconds to flip the game on its head in the third quarter. They tied the score for the first time since the beginning of the game on a dunk from junior Sencire Harris early in the frame and Ohio State basketball signee Malaki Branham put on a show for the rest of the quarter.

Branham already had 13 points at halftime but the early minutes of the third showed he was just getting started. It was his hard drive to the rim that gave the Fighting Irish the lead 35-34. It was his dunk that extended the lead to three. It was his made free throws that pushed the game even farther into SVSM's control.

By the end of the third quarter Branham had 29 points. He finished with 37 and led all scorers.

DeSales senior Des Watson went toe-to-toe with Branham for much of the first half and even had one more points than Branham after the first 16 minutes. But while Branham took off in the second half Watson cooled down just enough that the game slipped out of reach for the Stallions (19-8). After scoring 14 points in the first half Watson added just nine in the second.

Early in the fourth quarter Watson attempted to slam home an alley-oop pass — the kind that he had been able to finish twice earlier in the game. This time it didn't go and seconds later Branham finished on a nearly identical play.

The sequence summed up the second half for DeSales. What had worked earlier suddenly didn't and what hadn't worked for SVSM suddenly did. And in the end it was the Fighting Irish who were able to take advantage and come away with the gold trophy.

""That tall silver trophy isn't what we came for tonight but it'll feel better later"" Murphy said. ""It hurts right now.""

The concert featured dinner drinks and a myriad of fundraising promotions and yielded $33500 for INK! which provides tools and resources for teachers to help local students.

Sponsors of the event helped fund part of the expenses so that more money could be donated to INK!. Food was donated by Sysco and prepared by Woodpecker’s Back Yard BBQ.

Chris Shee owner of Tringali Barn at Heritage Farms and his company MasterCraft Builder Group launched the inaugural concert series and selected INK! due to Shee’s interests in raising money for local nonprofits through his company’s charitable giving initiatives.

“We are very grateful to receive the generous donation from Chris and all sponsors to help us continue with much needed programs and services in our area” said Donna Lueders INK!’s executive director. According to Lueders the local nonprofit continues to provide innovative programs and classroom resources to promote the academic success of students.

The NAD monitors national advertising in all media in the states and 0""enforces high standards of truth and accuracy and efficiently resolves disputes to build consumer trust and support fair competition.""

Boost Mobile told by the NAD to stop promoting unlimited 4G LTE streaming













AT&T complained about Boost and as a result the NAD said that Boost's unlimited claims cannot be verified because of the throttling of data speeds that Boost puts customers through after they hit monthly data limits. Boost was purchased by Dish Network as part of a deal made by T-Mobile and the FCC that allowed the carrier to buy Sprint for $26.5 billion. The hope is that Dish will eventually replace Sprint as the ""fourth nationwide facilities-based network competitor. Dish has slightly more than 9 million subscribers in the U.S. and has a multi-year MVNO contract with T-Mobile. An MVNO is a Mobile Virtual Network Operator that leases the network it uses to carry calls and data. While Dish is building out its own 5G stand-alone network it uses T-Mobile's network for its customers.





According to the BBB  Boost will stop the ads related to unlimited streaming but will appeal the NAD's ruling on unlimited data. AT&T said that Boost was wrong to advertise unlimited streaming since it would throttle data speeds from 4G LTE to 2G once a customer's monthly data cap was hit. In other words AT&T says that because surpassing the data cap led to real repercussions (the throttling of data speeds) Boost was not really offering unlimited data. The NAD part of the Better Business Bureau also took issue with the use of the unlimited data phrase by pointing out that there are plenty of things that Boost subscribers could not use their phones for after being throttled to 2G. In making its decision against Boost the NAD stated that ""At 2G speeds many of today's most commonly used applications such as social-media e-mail with attachments web browsing on pages with embedded pictures videos and ads and music may not work at all or will have such significant delays as to be functionally unavailable because the delays will likely cause the applications to time out.""



The NAD also took Comcast to task over advertising run by the cable firm's Xfinity Mobile over its 5G service and availability. Once again AT&T was the tattletale passing along a complaint to the NAD. Xfinity which has an MVNO deal with Verizon offered 5G in only limited areas of certain cities at the time when the complaint was filed and the ad was running. That's because this was taking place when Verizon was concentrating on its high-band mmWave service which does not travel long distances. Eventually the NAD said that Comcast had sufficiently included a disclosure about the limited availability of Xfinity's 5G coverage. But it did want Comcast to modify an ad starting Amy Pohler to make it clear that a 5G device is required in order to use 5G service. The part of the ad that contained a disclosure that said ""5G capable device required. 5G available only in parts of select cities"" was in a small gray font and placed in a background with very little contrast.





While Comcast said that it would comply with NAD's demands it also noted that ""because the advertised 5G services is (sic) now broadly available nationwide Comcast understands that disclosing the limited availability of 5G service is no longer necessary.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjcndpcmVsZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIxMDMyMS9idXNpbmVzcy90aGUtc3VuZGF5LWJyaWVmLXRoZS1lbGVwaGFudC1pbi10aGUtcm9vbS1hbmFseXN0LWRheS1hbmFseXNpcy1wYXJ0LXR3b9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Sunday Brief: The elephant in the room (Analyst Day analysis part two),"Greetings from Davidson/ Lake Norman where the 2-year-drought has ended! The editor has a question for all the TSB-reading technology innovators implementers and investors: Why is it 2021 and we’re still having to do THIS with our TV’s? Picture-in-picture was an ‘80’s phenomenon. After 40 years we’re still hauling in the old set from the kids room and setting it up on a TV tray? The collective wisdom of TSB readers has got to be able to put together something better. It’s only 5 months ‘til football season …

Meanwhile there’s still a lot to cover from the analyst days held the week before last. Our focus this week will be on the “elephant in the room” for each wireless carrier.

A final editorial note: Like many of you we will be taking a break for the Easter holiday (in two weeks). We will publish a “videos to watch” article on the Sunday Brief website in lieu of a mailing.

The week that was

This word to describe this week’s activity is “sideways.” Apple lost $17 billion in market capitalization (on more than $2.1 trillion in total value) despite an encouraging leak on their upcoming tablet releases (more on that from Bloomberg here). Microsoft lost $41 billion in market capitalization this week Amazon lost $8 billion and Google lost $13 billion. Offsetting this was an economic recovery-driven pop at Facebook (+$62 billion). Overall the Fab Five lost $16 billion for the week and has added a mere $12 billion to last year’s $2.57 trillion gain. Sideways never looked so good.

The Telco Top Five started to slip last week driven by T-Mobile (-$3 billion) and Comcast (-$8 billion). Verizon continues to recover as the “an extra $53 billion in debt isn’t as bad as it first looks” theme proliferates. T-Mobile had the biggest announcement this week on Wednesday signing up Pandora/ Sirius XM for exclusive musical content and ad-free weekend offerings for the Magenta faithful who redeem the code through the T-Mobile Tuesdays app. For those of you who have lost count this now brings T-Mobile’s business and consumer content suppliers to seven: Netflix Pandora/ Sirius XM Dialpad Microsoft 365 Apple TV+ (TVision) Amazon Prime (Metro by T-Mobile) and Google One (Metro by T-Mobile). See the nearby slide for a comparison to AT&T and Verizon’s offerings.

The biggest news of the week however involves one company from the Fab Five and the Telco Top Five. On Friday Comcast announced that they (including streaming over Peacock) had retained the NFL Sunday Night slot for the next 11 seasons (through 2033). NBC Sports will also broadcast four of the next thirteen Super Bowls. While no figures have been released Bloomberg estimates it cost NBC around $2 billion annually for the rights to broadcast the #1 Primetime show.

Amazon who announced Wednesday that they would be expanding their Amazon Care program nationally (and increasing coverage beyond Amazon employees to other companies) made news on Thursday when they landed exclusive rights to the Thursday Night football slot (announcement here). The impact to the NFL Network (Amazon’s previous simulcast partner) is yet to be seen. Bloomberg estimates in the link above that Amazon paid around $1 billion per year (with 126 million US Amazon Prime members that amounts to ~$8 per subscriber per year before any advertisement offsets). Comcast Fox ViacomCBS and Amazon set a high bar for AT&T’s DirecTV unit who has yet to announce an extension.

Speaking of AT&T they noticed customers this week that smartphone data consumed by HBO Max will be counted toward data limits starting next Thursday (CNBC article here). The change is driven by California’s Net Neutrality law which went into effect after CTIA/ NCTA/ US Telecom lost their challenge to the ruling. From AT&T’s statement:

“We regret the inconvenience to customers caused by California’s new “net neutrality” law. Given that the Internet does not recognize state borders the new law not only ends our ability to offer California customers such free data services but also similarly impacts our customers in states beyond California.

A state-by-state approach to “net neutrality” is unworkable. A patchwork of state regulations many of them overly restrictive creates roadblocks to creative and pro-consumer solutions. We have long been committed to the principles of an open Internet. We deliver the content and services our customers want because it’s what they demand not because it’s mandated by regulation. We also believe Internet access should be available and sustainably affordable to all Americans and strongly advocate for Congress to adopt federal legislation to make that possible while providing clear consistent and permanent net neutrality rules for everyone to follow.”

It’s unclear how many customers are going to be impacted by this change as their Unlimited Elite plans offer 100 GB of “premium data” while their Unlimited Extra plans include 50 GB. Our estimate is that 1-2% of the HBO Max base is impacted. Regardless having to notify customers of a perk removal is not pleasant. And blaming California infuriated our friends at Ars Technica who published a scathing critique of AT&T’s actions.

Perhaps this lights a fire under Congress for legislation. Then again…

The elephant in the room (Analyst Day analysis part two)

Last week’s Brief was chock full of information: 7.5 hours of presentations provide plenty of content but leaves little room for analysis. As we frequently discuss with respect to quarterly earnings calls it’s important to consider what’s not being discussed in addition to the key takeaways. This week we will look at those “elephants in the room” (each telecommunications carrier has at least one) and suggest ways management can address them.

AT&T’s Elephant: Balance Sheet Obligations

As we discussed last week AT&T did a good job of presenting a lot of information in two hours. While some were surprised that wireless did not get more airtime (and HBO Max did) we think AT&T chose to strike a “balanced portfolio” theme versus pursuing one that was wireless-centric.

If AT&T were to deploy fiber to three million homes this year and achieve the lowest monthly postpaid churn in the wireless industry and launch HBO Max globally to rave reviews and have a few blockbuster theatrical surprises then the balance sheet would be strong. Cash would be plentiful and deleveraging could accelerate. If any one of these initiatives fails to meet management’s lofty objectives however there’s little “wiggle room” to take on debt or other obligations.

The schedule from AT&T’s 10-K paints the picture (we have included footnotes as well):

AT&T’s total obligations including the additional $27 billion in debt needed to pay for C-Band licenses and the receipt of funds from TPG in the DirecTV transaction will likely eclipse $450 billion dollars. About $100 billion of that is due in the next three years. Even when weighed against cash flow from operations (CFFO) expectations of around $140 billion for 2021-2024 (~$47 billion per year) and assuming dividends stay intact ($45 billion over three years) there’s not a lot of room to maneuver. Everything has to go right assuming AT&T keeps their dividend flat and also retains an investment grade rating (currently rated by S&P as BBB two notches from junk status).

We do not mean to imply that AT&T is flirting with insolvency – they have very strong cash flows and should be able to re-term and roll over debt as they execute on their plan. But any ambitions beyond local fiber HBO Max and C-Band are going to be put on hold. And if T-Mobile or Dish or cable disrupts the competitive landscape operating cash flows will suffer.

Bottom line: AT&T has a lot of assets but must execute on all fronts to meet their obligations. The sizes and due dates of those obligations are the elephants in the room.

Verizon’s elephant: T-Mobile’s network superiority

While many of you think “Obligations” should also be the elephant in the room for Big Red we think it’s slightly worse for Ma Bell (Verizon’s total obligations equal $258 billion per their 10-K before C-Band debt and $70 billion is due in the next three years. Verizon should also generate ~$120-130 billion in CFFO over that period and have $30-33 billion in dividend payments. Still tight but more room to maneuver than AT&T). And assuming the TracFone transaction is completed they will have ~$1 billion in additional CFFO generation.

The elephant in the room for Verizon is that their reign as undisputed network champ is ending. As we are seeing in the RootMetrics RootScore Reports for most metros (the first 43 market results are shown in the nearby table) it’s just as likely that AT&T wins and 3x more likely that the metro ends in a tie. And while T-Mobile does not have any outright wins today (only five ties) they have just begun to deploy their 600 MHz/ 2500 MHz carrier aggregated 5G network. We will be especially interested to see how one of their earlier 5G markets (Philadelphia) helps T-Mobile versus Verizon.

There appears to be corroborating evidence to support T-Mobile’s ascent. OpenSignal released their 5G rankings in January and crowned T-Mobile the winner in upload speed download speed and availability (see here). T-Mobile also scored well in OpenSignal’s state-by-state rankings. Ookla weighed in a few weeks ago as well with AT&T winning the overall download speed (Verizon fourth behind legacy Sprint) and T-Mobile winning latency availability and 5G time spent. Many of you have requested spending a portion of one Brief explaining the differences between various testing company methodologies but the bottom line is that Verizon’s 4G championship is not extending into 5G.

Short-term (until C-Band arrives) disadvantages can be overcome with additional retention incentives (including content bundling) and more advertising. But what if T-Mobile’s Clearwire Band (their flavor of C-Band) is better than Verizon’s new network? This is why there was a lot of discussion of these two slides over the past week:

In their analyst day presenttion Verizon made the argument that because of power limitations imposed for 2.5 GHz spectrum (relative to C-Band) T-Mobile would have no advantage whatsoever (left side of the picture). Verizon also made the argument (as did several industry analysts) that Verizon already has a lot of cell site density in many metropolitan areas today and that deploying C-Band would not leave coverage gaps (Mike Dano has a great article in Light Reading on this here if you want to read more).

T-Mobile countered Verizon’s argument quite effectively arguing that they are going to use their low-band (600 MHz) as the uplink and that this would create an additional 30% range extension for their 2.5 GHz. They also indicated that they plan to deploy this nationwide using their arsenal of ~85000 cell sites. They committed to over 200 million POPs of coverage with this new configuration by the end of thie year (just as Verizon is receiving their C-Band licenses).

Bottom line: If Verizon cannot claim undisputed network performance as their competitive differentiator then their ambitions to charge more for their services (see last week’s article about the critical importance of growing ARPU/ ARPA to meet deleveraging targets) are going to be challenged. Without network and engineering superiority Verizon will need a new corporate identity (“We’re #1 in a tie” won’t cut it).

T-Mobile’s elephant: Credibility

Having watched the T-Mobile Analyst day three times there aren’t a lot of gaps. We mentioned a possible chink in the armor last week (lack of a cohesive fiber/ transport strategy) but there’s an easily identified remedy for that – develop and execute one! Identify the clusters of towers where T-Mobile should own and manage connectivity and build local operations teams. That would cement low-cost superiority (when spectrum costs are included).

We aren’t quite sure that Mike Katz’s reply to a question where he basically said “We can still win wireless deals without wireline – they are two separate contracts” is completely accurate but can give him the benefit of the doubt that they will win enough wireless to meet their market share goals without owning and operating the fiber connection to the factory or headquarters.

Mentioned time and again throughout the presentation were the phrases “Once they discover” or “After they try.” This is the common cry of the challenger: It’s better and here’s why you can believe us! We think credibility is T-Mobile’s elephant in the room and that it’s going to take many programs across many years to implant confidence and conviction.

There are many ways T-Mobile can address this problem. After deploying their LTE network T-Mobile launched an Uncarrier initiative called Test Drive (original 2014 announcement here). They changed the program to a 30-day Hotspot in 2019 for consumers and included small businesses last year. Test Drive allowed potential customers to experience T-Mobile’s network changes before they actually committed to a relationship (since a growing number of smartphones are purchased through Apple and Samsung directly Equipment Installment Plans don’t have the retentive power of yesteryear).

T-Mobile indirectly learned about the power of a test drive when they launched Home Internet in 4Q 2020. Many (including yours truly) were skeptical and switched between cable and T-Mobile networks to see if there was any material difference. Unlike smartphones with voicemail losses and the pains that occasionally happen with porting phone numbers data is free from those hassles.

If T-Mobile could figure out how to use the eSIM now present in many smartphones to provide a similar test many of those “I had T-Mobile back in 20XX” prospective customers might try Magenta again.

Bottom line: As we discussed last week T-Mobile has a tremendous amount of merger and network momentum. They have a talented team of experienced leaders who can manage growth and change. But they lack credibility with many who had T-Mobile in the past or who still equate Magenta with “cheap.” There is no short-term fix as brands are not supercharged overight but T-Mobile can accelerate their net additions by making aggressive Uncarrier moves that improve credibility.

Next week we will start our Q1 preview with a look at the overall economic conditions (read our March 7 Brief if you need a refresher). Until then if you have friends who would like to be on the email distribution please have them send an email to [email protected] and we will include them on the list (or they can sign up directly through the new website).

This is how we know,"The effects of mobiles phones and other technology at school is a hotly debated topic in many countries. Some advocate for a complete ban to limit distractions while others suggest using technology as a teaching tool.

Kids in public South Australian primary schools started the school year without being allowed to bring their mobile phones to class unless they are needed for class activity. All students in public Western Australian Victorian and Tasmanian schools have a mobile phone ban in place since for all or some of 2020. New South Wales also banned mobile phones in public primary schools with secondary schools having the option to opt in since the start of 2020.

Education departments have introduced the bans for various reasons including to improve academic outcomes and decrease bullying.

Several recent papers point to positive impact of banning mobile phones at school on student performance and other outcomes. Understanding the evidence is crucial for best policy.

Read more: No Education Minister we don't have enough evidence to support banning mobile phones in schools

In a 2015 paper we used a method — called a difference-in-difference strategy — as well as student data from England to investigate the effect of banning mobile phones on student performance. In this method we compared schools that have had phones removed to similar schools with no phone bans. This allowed us to isolate the effect of mobiles phones on student performance from other factors that could affect performance.

We found banning mobile phones at school leads to an increase in student performance. Our results suggest that after schools banned mobile phones test scores of students aged 16 increased by 6.4% of a standard deviation. This is equivalent to adding five days to the school year or an additional hour a week.

The effects were twice as large for low-achieving students and we found no impact on high achieving students.

Our results suggest low-performing students are more likely to be distracted by the presence of mobile phones while high performing students can focus with or without mobile phones.

The results of our paper suggest banning mobile phones has considerable benefits including a reduction in the gap between high- and low- achieving students. This is substantial improvement for a low-cost education policy.

Other studies show similar results

Recent studies from Spain and Norway using a similar empirical strategy to ours also show compelling evidence on the benefit of banning mobile phones on student performance with similar effect size.

In Spain banning mobile phones has been shown to increase students’ scores in maths and science. Researchers also documented a decrease in incidences of bullying.

In Norway banning phones significantly increased middle school students’ grade point average. It also increased students’ likelihood of attending an academic high school rather than choosing a vocational school. And it decreased incidents of bullying.

Evidence from Belgium suggests banning mobile phones can be beneficial for college student performance. This context might be different but still informative as students are of similar age to those in high school.

Research from Sweden however suggests little effect of banning mobile phones in high school on student performance. It is worth noting however the study did not find any detrimental effect of banning mobile phones.

A similar conclusion can be drawn from the literature on the effect of computers used at school. Evidence from the US suggests using laptops in class is detrimental to learning and the effects are large and more damaging for low-performing students.

Potential psychological mechanisms involved

The psychological literature might shed lights on the potential mechanisms as to why mobile phones and other technology in school might affect student performance. This literature finds multitasking is detrimental to learning and task execution.

Many recent experimental papers present evidence mobile phone use while executing another task decreases learning and task completion. Research also shows computers might be a less efficient way to take notes than pen and paper.

It may be that taking notes by hand allows you to remember the material better than typing those notes on a computer. This may be because students are not just typing out every word said but thinking of how to summarise what they’re hearing.

These findings do not discount the possibility mobile phones and other technology could be a useful structured teaching tool. However ignoring or misunderstanding the evidence could be harmful to students and lead to long term negative social consequences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9PbmVQbHVzLTktYW5kLU9uZVBsdXMtOS1Qcm8tY29tcGxldGUtc3BlY3MtcmV2ZWFsZWQtYnktVC1Nb2JpbGUtYWhlYWQtb2YtTWFyY2gtMjMtbGF1bmNoLjUyODY2Mi4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro complete specs revealed by T-Mobile ahead of March 23 launch,"The differences between the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro primarily lie in the display and camera specifications. The OnePlus 9 Pro offers a 6.78-inch Fluid AMOLED QHD+ display while the OnePlus 9 makes do with a 6.55-inch FHD+ variant. Both the phones are slated to offer a 120 Hz refresh rate.

However the T-Mobile listing gets the display spec wrong with respect to the colors on the OnePlus 9 Pro — it lists it as 16 million but we already know that the 9 Pro will feature a 10-bit panel which means the display actually supports 1 billion colors.

Both the OnePlus 9 and the OnePlus 9 Pro will sport a 4500 mAh battery with support for 65 W fast-charging and are also slated to have an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.



The highlight of the launch is of course OnePlus's new found partnership with Hasselblad. It remains to be seen what this collaboration has resulted in terms of camera hardware and software enhancements.



Alongside the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro we also expect a OnePlus 9R variant powered by the Snapdragon 690 and a OnePlus Watch as well. The OnePlus 9R however will be an India-exclusive variant for now.

The Rivian Adventure Network is designed to allow quick recharges along highways and also includes Level 2 charges at more remote locations near parks and other destinations.

Rivian described the network in a blog post:

Each site will have multiple chargers and will be conveniently located on highways and main roads often by cafes and shops. These DC fast chargers will be for Rivian owners only with details on pricing and associated programs coming soon.

The company also is installing waypoint Level 2 AC chargers each with a 11.5 kW charging speed to add about 25 miles of range every hour for Rivian’s R1T pickup and R1S SUV. These chargers will be located along routes that Rivian thinks its drivers will take. The first such waypoint chargers are being installed in Colorado’s state parks beginning in July and will be accessible to any electric vehicle with a J1772 plug.

Sky News has learnt that Will Shu who launched the company less than a decade ago is likely to sell a small part of his 6.2% holding in Deliveroo - which in total could be worth in the region of £500m.

People close to the company said this weekend that Mr Shu had yet to make a final decision about the size of any share sale although one insider suggested it was likely to involve less than £50m of Deliveroo stock.

That would represent only a small fraction of Mr Shu's stake.

A source close to him said he had sold a small number of his own shares on ""more than one"" occasion in the past although the latest transaction is likely to represent his biggest single payday to date.

His decision could be disclosed in the formal prospectus for Deliveroo's initial public offering (IPO) which will be published on Monday.

The document will reveal a price range for the company's shares which is expected to catapult it into the ranks of Britain's biggest home-grown tech start-ups.

Deliveroo was valued at $7bn in a pre-IPO funding round less than two months ago but is said to have seen strong enough demand during an investor roadshow to be valued now at $9bn-$10bn.

In a statement released earlier in the listing process Mr Shu said he had ""never set out to be a founder or a CEO"".

""Today we operate in 12 markets right across the world. 115000 food merchants over 100000 riders millions of consumers.

""Every single month every single year we focused on getting better - sometimes incrementally and sometimes by leaps and bounds - focusing on great food and being customer-obsessed. But the last 12 months were different.

""I was sad to see many of our partners struggle - restaurants owners I've known for years face closure and ruin - all due to some terrible virus. So we took action to help.""

Half a dozen investment banks led by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are working on the flotation.

It has appointed Claudia Arney a former Premier League and Ocado director as its chair and Next's chief executive Lord Wolfson as an independent director.

The company will float in London with a dual-class share structure for three years that will allow Mr Shu to retain control of the company.

Amazon-backed Deliveroo is one of Britain's best-known technology 'unicorns' - companies worth at least $1bn.

Its decision to float in the UK has been welcomed by the chancellor Rishi Sunak who hailed it as ""a true British success story"".

Nevertheless Deliveroo continues to face questions about the terms on which its riders work for it and the funding model it uses with restaurant partners.

Amazon's investment - following a lengthy competition inquiry - as part of a $575m fundraising has prompted Deliveroo to turn its attention towards further innovation in the fight against rivals Uber Eats and Just Eat Takeaway.com.

Other shareholders including the private equity firm Bridgepoint and the institutional investors Fidelity and T Rowe Price may sell part of their holdings although Amazon is unlikely to offload any of its stake.

Last week it confirmed it would raise £1bn from the sale of new shares in addition to disposals by existing investors.

Deliveroo now has around 45000 restaurants on its platform in the UK although its stellar valuation comes at a torrid time for many of its restaurant partners with hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk across the sector as a result of the pandemic.

A Deliveroo spokesman declined to comment on Mr Shu's plans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzIwL2J1c2luZXNzL2xhcnJ5LWN1bHAtaXMtZ2UtY2VvLXdoby13b3VsZC1yYXRoZXItaGFuZy1vdXQtZmFjdG9yeS1mbG9vci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Step by step Larry Culp is rethinking and remaking General Electric,"He is an enigma to most people in Boston even though he runs one of the world’s best-known companies. The 58-year-old doesn’t burnish his bold-names cred working the social circuit where other executives hobnob.

In the long history of General Electric its chief executives have come up through the ranks and in modern memory embodied managerial archetypes tuned to their times: Jack Welch the celebrity CEO who built a sprawling conglomerate and Jeff Immelt the torchbearer for digital transformation.

Instead Culp is a genuine throwback a guy who got his start on the production line in this case the family welding shop and became an evangelist for the exacting Japanese philosophy centered around an unrelenting improvement in business practices — a philosophy that helped revolutionize the manufacturing world over the past half century.

It is called kaizen and to learn about it Culp became that rare Harvard MBA who chose to cut his teeth in business learning from the Japanese how to more perfectly make air conditioners. Really.

“He would rather be walking through the factory than talking to the chamber of commerce” said Bill Stromberg chief executive of investment giant T. Rowe Price who has known Culp for three decades and considers him a mentor. “That hands-on approach is what makes him great.”

Culp is by many accounts stabilizing a once-mighty company that had big ambitions when it moved to Boston in 2016 to be among the whiz kids with their laptops sitting in coffee shops and soaking up visions for a day when software not the heavy-metal hardware of trains planes and power plants ruled the business universe.

But the move masked a deeper need within GE. It had in the view of many critics become a bloated corporate behemoth that had lost its vaunted discipline and overindulged in deal making. Soon it would be hemorrhaging money and amputating entire divisions.

The troubles suggested that GE whose roots run to inventor Thomas Edison wasn’t so much in need of finding new ways to make money as getting back its manufacturing mojo.

If GE was going to survive and thrive in the Internet Age the way it had in the previous century it needed a back-to-basics taskmaster someone who could remind the company of how it once got so dominant — by making things well and making them efficiently.

The part it would seem was written for Culp.

Yet he fills his role without being a cyborg or grim disciplinarian at a company in the throes of billions of dollars in cost-cutting. Rather Culp is what close friend Kevin Sharer called a “joyful warrior.”

“When I say ‘joyful’ it’s a role model leader who by his actions words and examples leads and inspires people to do things they didn’t think were possible” said Sharer the former CEO of biotech behemoth Amgen. “When I say ‘warrior’ the thing Larry is fighting is the past the last decade of failure and he’s fighting the status quo and the belief that things can’t change.”

Over 6 feet tall with wavy salt-and pepper hair Culp comes across as measured but friendly smiling with ease. He may live and breathe by “kaizen” but he’s not all work and no play; when he stepped down from his previous job running another manufacturing company he said he hoped to spend more time fishing. He can be intense but those around him say he is not the intimidating type. He is known at GE not as an alpha-male boss but as a leader who knows how to listen.

The old GE was about putting the smartest people at the center of the company. Culp’s GE focuses on making customers happy and on rigorous attention to what’s happening on the factory floor.

In 2019 his first full year as GE chief executive Culp was on the road most of the time often visiting factories from Ohio to South Carolina. He is the old-school operations guy who would sometimes show up in jeans to talk shop with machinists and technicians. At some plants it was the first time workers had ever met the global company’s CEO.

He honed that “how things work” fascination as a boy growing up outside of Washington D.C. where he hung out in the welding shop his grandfather founded and later his parents would run. His first paying job was hauling heavy equipment there. His management career has been defined by just two employers both of them industrial conglomerates: Danaher Corp. and GE.

“I’m not somebody that likes to run the business from my desk” Culp said in an interview with the Globe.

In 2018 Culp was enjoying what he calls his “so-called retirement” from Danaher. He was teaching leadership and strategy at his alma mater Harvard Business School and working as a senior adviser for Bain Capital. He bought a home in Beacon Hill. Then he was recruited to the GE board by the man whose job he would ultimately take CEO John Flannery. Culp said he probably would have turned down the offer to join the board had he not been in Boston already.

In business school circles Culp is a bit of a cult figure the subject of case studies on how he transformed Danaher into a major player in medical testing and dental equipment. He spent almost a quarter century there becoming CEO at the age of 37 in 2001. On his watch the Washington company increased revenues and its market capitalization five-fold by perfecting the kaizen lean manufacturing philosophy most prominently associated with Toyota.

“Larry had an extraordinary career at Danaher and was really one of the architects of what was called the ‘Danaher System’ which is consistent with what he’s doing at GE” said John Connaughton co-managing partner at Bain Capital. “He brings a lot of structure and discipline.”

There is a lot of rhetoric in the business world about creating a highly efficient customer-driven organization. On this Culp is the real deal. Listen to him as he described why he spent time in Japan learning to build air conditioners so he could “understand what a maniacal emphasis on waste elimination with an eye towards serving the customer is really all about.”

“For some folks lean is a set of tools. The tools are important but lean is much more than that. It’s really a way of life” Culp explained in a virtual event in October. “Lean is a means to an end — that end being a stronger set of businesses a stronger GE and a better more vibrant culture.”

The irony here is that GE was long the standard-bearer of the tightly-run American corporation notorious for its brawn and dominance in its markets and on Wall Street for always beating its profit estimates. Welch was the world’s leading proponent of another management philosophy Six Sigma that also preached a gospel of constant improvement in work processes. GE was famous for the way it schooled up-and-coming managers and executives and even used its college-like campus in New York state to develop them.

But the company that has laid claim to the lightbulb the washing machine electric stoves power plants jet engines and the television network that first made Donald Trump a media star went astray — badly.

Its massive GE Capital arm source of so much profit in the glory years had never fully recovered from the 2008 recession. When GE decided to sell off most of the Capital businesses in 2015 it held onto some of its liabilities a move that would weigh heavily on the balance sheet after the firm relocated to Boston from Connecticut.

Governor Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh joined GE chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt and Ann Klee vice president of Boston Development and Operations for a groundbreaking for the company's new headquarters in Fort Point in 2017. Pat Greenhouse

Then there were the ill-timed acquisitions of Baker Hughes which services oil and gas producers and the energy business of French conglomerate Alstom just before big downturns in their industries. Immelt had also committed to spending more than $1 billion to turn GE into a software titan. The GE of Welch and Immelt behaved as if it could wring profits from any kind of product or business but that hubris came with a cost.

GE struggled to meet its earnings targets and Immelt was out. Flannery who had run the health care division found himself in charge in mid-2017 and immediately was under pressure to radically rethink GE’s size maybe even break it up completely.

One by one the dominos fell mercilessly including those old liabilities from GE Capital which forced the company in 2018 to take a $6.2 billion charge and reserve billions more to shore up its old long-term-care insurance operations. At rapid-fire pace GE moved to divest some businesses such as lighting and trains and cut costs and employees to preserve cash in the face of a mountain of debt. Its stock price plummeted and then in humiliating fashion GE was drummed out of the Dow Jones industrial average where it was the last original member.

The body blows landed as GE was planning a sleek headquarters campus along Fort Point Channel the company’s launch pad into its next century.

The final straw for Flannery was a $23 billion charge in GE’s struggling power business. After just 14 months he was out and in October 2018 Culp became the first outsider to run the company since it was founded in 1892.

“He understood he could be called he didn’t expect to be called and he didn’t want to be” said Sharer who was on the faculty of Harvard Business School with Culp. “To me it’s a national service. It’s an important company for America.”

In his short tenure Flannery pursued an aggressive paring of the company’s portfolio. Culp continued in that vein reducing GE’s dividend to a nominal amount and jettisoning a new tower in Fort Point in favor of a more modest headquarters there. Culp also launched a boot-camp-style exercise to root out fat and waste to streamline the manufacturing process and make it more responsive to customers’ needs and schedules.

Drawing on his time in Japan Culp peppers meetings with talk of lean principles such as “genba” (where the real work happens) and of course “kaizen” (continuous improvement). GE in its annual report describes the process that unfolded under Culp as a “ruthless prioritization of work to improve safety quality delivery and cost.”

Importantly for Culp this self-examination begins on the factory floor.

Case in point: At the company’s gas turbine plant in Greenville S.C. the team found the production process had become overly complicated. One critical and expensive part traveled a serpentine path around the factory floor traveling more than three miles over 85 days to complete the machining process. Workers found that if they rearranged the shop floor and replaced some old machines they could reduce the travel distance to 165 feet in a straight line.

Along with other lean ideas the Greenville plant in 2020 cut overall production time for a turbine roughly in half to less than 40 weeks. Inventory levels went way down saving hundreds of millions of dollars in tied up capital. Under Culp similar “Lean Action Workouts” have been held at GE locations around the world.

“We’re an industrial company which means the way we design the way we manufacture the way we service our products is where we win or lose” Culp told the Globe.

Under Culp GE seemed to find its footing in 2019. Then the pandemic hit. The abrupt shutdown of global travel decimated a GE cash cow: the jet engine business. Almost immediately Culp had to cut roughly 25 percent of GE’s aviation workforce.

But by the end of 2020 Culp had stabilized GE’s cash flow. Then on March 10 he announced a $30 billion deal to peel off the company’s aircraft leasing business.

The GE of today is down to just four manufacturing segments: power which makes turbines for traditional electric plants; renewables such as wind turbines; health care which includes imaging machines such as MRIs; and aviation where GE has its biggest footprint in Massachusetts the jet engine plant in Lynn.

When GE decided to move to Boston in 2016 it had revenues of $117 billion 333000 employees and about 500 factories worldwide. Today two CEOs later the number of factories has been cut in half the workforce is at about 174000 and annual revenues are at $80 billion.

In August Culp agreed to a two-year contract extension and received a one-time stock grant that won’t vest for another three-plus years. That award could eventually be worth more than $200 million but only if the share price averages at least $16.68 for 30 straight days by August 2024.

Its stock now trades in the $13 range around where it was when Culp became CEO but roughly double its price last summer in the depths of the pandemic.

Culp is in his own words far from done.

“If we were over at Fenway the scoreboard would be no further along than the middle of the third” Culp told the Globe. “There’s so much in front of us.”

But he’s yet to win over a key audience: The GE union for workers at the Lynn plant feels the CEO is neglecting some of the company’s domestic factories. The Lynn plant still has a punch-press system dating to 1943 one of numerous outdated machines throughout the plant said union local president Adam Kaszynski.

“We know Culp knows how to invest in a plant to make it more profitable efficient productive but we aren’t seeing it here” Kaszynski said. “We’re fighting for every scrap of investment.”

In Boston civic and business circles Culp remains a sight unseen and few expect him to emerge after the pandemic.

“We in the business community don’t see him very much at all but we understand why” said Mary Jo Meisner the former Boston Foundation executive who focused on civic leadership and now consults to CEOs. “We want the company to stabilize and stay here.”

GE’s troubles have caused some worries about the depth of the company’s commitment to Boston. However like Immelt Culp sees value in being in a hub for innovation talent.

“The company being in Boston is just a glove-fit for what we’re trying to do” he told the Globe. “Boston’s hard to beat. We’re happy to be here.”

Culp does share a particular abiding passion with Bostonians: He is a lifelong Red Sox fan adopting the team as a kid growing up outside Washington in the 1970s while playing on a Little League team called the Red Sox.

Like many CEOs Culp likes to use sports analogies. He recently summed up his approach to steering organizations through a tough situation this way: “We simply got to get Dave Roberts to second base.”

The reference is to that celebrated moment in the 2004 playoffs against the Yankees when pinch-runner Roberts stole second setting off a chain reaction that resulted in the Sox winning their first World Series in 86 years.

Culp in many ways is sweating the small stuff to achieve what seems like the impossible — a company restored to something like its old health and international stature.

“Boston has a lot of comeback stories in sports but I think those are relevant” Culp said in a talk for the Boston College Chief Executives Club in November. “There’s always something that can be done to improve the trajectory of things. That’s what we do as leaders hopefully just find a way to take that next step and encourage folks to sometimes steal second base and we’ll take it from there.”",,,

While some of the criticism is well earned there are a lot of excellent free-to-play titles available. For those tired of spending $60 for the latest AAA games here are the best PS4 games that you can download and play immediately at no cost.

Call of Duty: Warzone

It may not be the first Call of Duty game to do battle royale but it’s certainly the best — not just in the franchise but in the entire genre. Warzone has already amassed incredible acclaim garnering a whopping 30 million players in little over a week since it was first released. The sprawling world map of Verdansk is an incredible sight to see and well equipped for the 150-player matches.

Infinity Ward has certainly delivered an experience that evolves the atypical battle royale with its introduction of the Gulag wherein players are dropped into a one-on-one deathmatch after elimination in an effort to return to the battlefield. The most recent release of season 3 beckons all-new weapons and skins in addition to four-player squads and the potential for duos on the near horizon.

Even if the battle royale gets to be a little too boring or frustrating there’s a Plunder mode which basically challenges players to amass the most cash in the allotted time. With respawns available and no ever-closing gas cloud Plunder allows newcomers to try out the Call of Duty experience for themselves and to learn its myriad mechanics like mounting weapons on surfaces and the various weapons color coordination. Though it helps to know all of the Warzone bunker locations ahead of time.

Fortnite

Fortnite really doesn’t need an introduction at this point. It’s by far the most played game across the globe. That also means it’s the most popular free game on PS4.

The 100-person battle royale filled with cartoon silliness and elaborate building mechanics has become more than a game over the past couple years. It’s a cultural phenomenon. The third-person shooter is easy to pick up and play and you’ll never have a problem finding a lobby filled with eager competitors. The long-awaited release of season 3 of the game has arrived with new challenges for existing players.

Genesis

With Smite League of Legends and Dota 2 at the forefront of the MOBA game sphere there aren’t too many worthwhile competitors besides the lovely sci-fi action of Genesis. Completely free and devoid of predatory pay-walled content Genesis launches out of the gate with 28 unique characters loads of various battlefields and action-packed arena-based combat.

This stellar MOBA was made entirely via Unreal engine and was intricately designed with the PS4 controller in mind. Say goodbye to the keyboard and mouse not to mention paying for an exceptional experience as Genesis pulls out all the right stops from performance to extended replay value without ever asking for a dime.

PS4 players don’t even have to be long-time MOBA fans as the game is as welcoming as it is loads of fun for newcomers and veterans alike. Download it today on the PSN store and experience the action-packed arena-based sci-fi might available only in Genesis.

Destiny 2

Destiny 2 has come quite a long way since its 2017 debut. Despite its age the sci-fi looter shooter still maintains an avid player base and continues to be updated regularly by the developer. Bungie’s split with Activision in early 2019 helped to pave the sequel’s future and ensured its reach allowing for it to go free-to-play. Now everyone can enjoy Destiny 2 fighting across multiple planets while acquiring new weapons and armor after every intense challenge.

The $35 DLC expansion called Shadowkeep isn’t a necessity to play further once the main story has been completed. Not only are there loads of quests to take on and bosses to overcome but there’s likewise the high-octane PvP mode Crucible. This is the best place to test out the effectiveness of newly acquired gear against friends and strangers alike.

For existing players take a look at our guide to finding Xur for exotic weapons and armor.

Brawlhalla

Published by Ubisoft Brawlhalla is a free-to-play fighting game in a similar vein as the Super Smash Bros. series. The objective: Knock other players off the stage using one of the game’s 40-plus cartoon fighters.

Brawlhalla has simplistic controls making it easy to jump in on the action. Like Super Smash Bros. weapons fall from the sky. Each character has their own play style and Brawlhalla features a multitude of game modes and stages.

Each week a batch of six fighters are playable without spending any money. If you like what you play though you can spend $20 to unlock all current and future characters.

Mobile Suit Battle Operation 2

Gundam fans meet your new favorite free-to-play experience: Battle Operation 2. When you’re not too busy watching all of the best anime on Crunchyroll and Funimation hit the PS4 for some incredible online 6v6 action. It’s the shining feat of this Gundam title and what makes it even more special is that it doesn’t even require a PS Plus subscription.

Luckily this online versus isn’t the only mode to grace Mobile Suit Battle Operation 2 as the Infantry Battle makes for a completely new and varied experience. In this mode players will be challenged outside of their mechs as mere pilots scrambling to place bombs on enemy bases. Who says it all has to be done inside of a Gundam?

Speaking of which with a whopping 130 Gundams at a player’s disposal there’s few if any alternatives for a free-to-play experience as stacked as Battle Operation 2. Grab a few friends and join the fight today.

Apex Legends

Adding to an already extensive list of free FPS games to choose from Apex Legends is EA’s breakout experience which nearly toppled Fortnite in prolonged Twitch viewership. From the minds of Respawn Entertainment the developer behind the Titanfall series and Jedi: Fallen Order the trio-specific battle royale breathed new life into the mode with team revives and an intricate pinging system.

Though it may not have ever toppled Fortnite’s incredibly large player count Apex Legends still gave the battle royale counterpart a run for its money. It’s still going strong to this day with an average PS4 player count of 39 million. With all-new characters being added and new weapons to unlock like the high-powered Charge Rifle there’s no better time to jump in and experience the intense action at World’s End.

Warframe

In Warframe players take control of members of the Tenno race ancient ninja-like warriors that woke from a lengthy cryogenic slumber to find the world at war with multiple factions including a frightening race of human clones. Since its 2013 launch the third person co-op shooter has been all about the grind.

Armor suits known as Warframes serve as highly customizable character classes with more than 30 to choose from. Each suit has four active skills and one passive skill that players can switch back and forth from. Weapons of which players wield three can be upgraded and tweaked via loot dropped by enemies.

There’s a competent PvP mode but Warframe is primarily a PvE experience. Up until now Warframe has tasked players with linking up and fighting through randomized linear levels completing objectives along the way.

Now is the perfect time to jump into Warframe and learn the ropes as later this year its identity will receive its biggest overhaul yet. The next major expansion Plains of Eidolon will introduce player hubs (a la the Tower in Destiny) where you can meet fellow Tenno and join up for specific missions. Fast and fun (if a bit repetitive) Warframe is one of the most popular free-to-play games on PS4 and for good reason.

Dauntless

Dauntless is the amalgamation of Fortnite graphics with the gameplay of Monster Hunter. It’s a stellar free-to-play PS4 experience that even allows for friends across consoles to enjoy it together with its crossplay feature an ever-growing new component in gaming. Dauntless was first released as a beta back in 2018. Fast-forward only a mere two years and the game is now among the best free RPGs on the PS4.

In Dauntless players will go up against ruthless creatures in a fantasy land ripped asunder. These Behemoths as they are called in-game carry within them a variety of craftable components and supplies which can then be used by players known as Slayers to build and equip so as to take on larger more dangerous foes. Although the game is dripping in the Monster Hunter aesthetic much of what inspired the team behind Dauntless was the Dark Souls games making this a prime experience for the Soulsborne crowd.

Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration

Say what you will about the rebooted Lara Croft outings and their underwhelming story beats but there is no denying that they are mesmerizing in graphical fidelity. Case in point is Rise of the Tomb Raider which has now become a graphics benchmark for PCs and is also among Sony’s free PS Plus games for July.

Although players will have to be a PS Plus subscriber to get it there’s no reason not to download and enjoy Rise of the Tomb Raider. As a sequel to the 2013 reboot simply titled Tomb Raider Rise takes Lara on a quest of epic proportions with PTSD from the previous game’s experiences overlapping her newfound mission into Siberia.

For hardcore Raiders and series newcomers alike this second entry into the rebooted Croft storyline is a spellbinding adventure that would put even Uncharted to shame with its unrelenting action and above-par graphics. Do you have what it takes to step into the shoes of Lara Croft?

Let It Die

Let it Die is a grueling action game that attempts to deliver Dark Souls–esque difficulty in a twisted world brought to you by Grasshopper Manufacturer the maker of Killer7 and Shadows of the Damned.

With the guidance of a skateboarding grim reaper called Uncle Death you embark on a daunting journey up the Tower of Barbs (a structure that literally cuts through clouds). Filled with quirky characters like Mushroom Magistrate and Kommodore Suzuki Let it Die is surprisingly rich in narrative for a free-to-play title.

The thing about Let it Die is you’ll probably love it or hate it. The combat itself with simplistic one-button attacks and weapons that break almost as quickly as it took you to scoop them up isn’t likely to impress many. That combined with the game’s devastating difficulty blends into a game that may not work for everyone even the Dark Souls fans who should theoretically make up the game’s core fan base.

But for those who stick with it Let it Die may offer dozens (if not hundreds) of hours of intense fights — and maybe frustration. Certainly if you are a fan of No More Heroes creator Suda51 Let it Die’s aesthetic alone might be enough to keep you playing.

NBA 2K20

Yet another among Sony’s free PS Plus games for July is Take-Two Interactive’s NBA 2K20. Although it may be littered with some predatory content like a fully functional slot machine there are some awesome subversive modes that give it a certain flair (and necessitate its place among the current best free PS4 games).

For starters the Neighborhood mode which is unlocked after players enjoy their first drafted game allows for loads of awesome on- and off-the-court action. From dodgeball and casino games to skateboarding and bighead basketball Neighborhood mode in NBA 2k20 is the best thing nobody has heard about.

There’s also the tried and true MyTeam and MyCareer modes which offer an insane amount of content for all types of basketball fans to enjoy; the 5v5 Scrimmage offering; and Freestyle which basically allows players to enhance their skills to the max. For absolutely nothing aside from the PS Plus subscription requirement there’s no reason not to grab NBA 2K20 for some much-needed sports action.

Smite

In what is undoubtedly the first truly revered MOBA to grace consoles Hi-Rez’s Smite successfully transferred the feel of MOBA to consoles — no small task considering that mouse and keyboard is generally considered a requirement for a MOBA.

Smite uses a classic camera angle similar to what you would find in a 3D action game. The behind-the-character angle differs from games like Dota 2 or League of Legends but it feels more immersive. Figuring out the different controls and skills may take you a while but that’s just like most other MOBAs. You might feel a little lost at first but you’ll be rewarded if you take a little time and stick with the game.

There are numerous possibilities to spice up your gameplay experience with this game because it has a vast array of characters and modes combined with plentiful personalization options that make your gaming experience unique. Teams can contain three four or five players and along with the standard MOBA lane-based format there are options like Arena which tasks players with escorting little minions across the enemy line. Smite feels more like a third-person action RPG than a MOBA so not everyone will love it. But Smite continues to enjoy popularity as one of the most polished free-to-play PS4 games out there.

Cuisine Royale

Self-titled as the “craziest battle royale yet” Cuisine Royale sure knows how to market itself and it’s as over the top as it is fun to play. Be prepared to laugh out loud as you go from seeing the world through your character’s eyes to seeing your character as a separate entity. For example you can be in the midst of a serious battle facing a realistic European landscape only to flip back to third-person and see your character dressed not in fatigues but an absurd mishmash of undergarments and household items.

The comedic elements offset a ton of realistic combat scenarios with both first and third-person shooting options. The added flair of demonic abilities supernatural rituals mystical traps and an assortment of craftable items ensures players never get bored unlike potentially mundane battle royale experiences like Fortnite and PUBG. Cuisine Royale stands out from all the other games in the royal genre as an engaging battle game with comic relief. This Gaijin Entertainment game is a funny and entertaining breath of fresh air for the gaming community and the best part about it is that it’s free.

The trailer is the first major announcement for eSports Boxing Club since mid-February. Those were roster announcements too. In February the developer announced six legendary boxers who will be playable in eSports Boxing Club. Today’s announcement tops that revealing a whopping 25 new eSports Boxing Club fighters.

The announcement show is hosted by former Friday Night Fights host Todd Grisham. For me Grisham who also serves as Vice President of business acquisitions for ESBC is a perfect choice to be the voice of the game. The excitement he brings to the reveal trailer alone is proof. As he announces new fighters from the Fight Capitol of the World Las Vegas he makes the green screen cool.

The developers take every opportunity to talk about ESBC’s 100+ fighter roster. Considering the game’s delays some fans have expressed doubts. Even Sergio Mora expressed his doubts. “When you first told me about this” Mora jokes “I thought ‘listen man this is gonna be your Fyre Festival.” Today Steel City decided to show not tell. The first Announcement Show reveals 25 of the game’s licensed boxers. The exhaustive list includes WBO Welterweight World Champion Terence Crawford Unified Cruiserweight Champion Oleksandr Usyk and Roy Jones Jr. one of the greatest to ever do it. They even showed a little range with the addition of Eric “Butterbean” Esch. You can find the full list of announced fighters below.

In the past year we’ve seen a massive spike in SPACs as an alternative to traditional IPOs but questions remain about whether they’re a good investment for the public.

What do these 5 people have in common?

Shaquille O’Neal (7’1” NBA legend) Scott Kelly (former astronaut) Paul Ryan (ex-congressman) Serena Williams (one of history’s greatest tennis stars) Bill Ackman (hedge fund billionaire)

Answer: They all have a hand in SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) one of the hottest financial trends on Wall Street.

In the past 15 months SPACs have seen a meteoric rise as an alternative way to take a private company public — one that bypasses many of the legal and regulatory “headaches” of the traditional IPO (initial public offering) process.

By the latest tally SPACs now outnumber traditional IPOs by a factor of 5x.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Many outlets have proclaimed SPACs to be the “new IPO” — and with good reason:

In 2020 248 SPACs went public (a 400%+ increase from 2019) collectively raising $83B from investors.

SPACs went public (a from 2019) collectively raising from investors. Just 3 months into 2021 we’ve already surpassed last year’s figures (275+ SPACs $84B+).

Prominent companies like DraftKings Virgin Galactic and OpenDoor have all used SPACs to go public.

But SPACs — which are generally subject to less regulation than IPOs — have also drawn controversy for the risks they pose to public investors: earlier this week the investment bank UBS banned its financial advisors from recommending SPAC stocks to clients.

What exactly is a SPAC? Why are so many companies choosing to go public via SPACs in lieu of a standard IPO? And how beneficial are they to businesses and investors?

How a standard IPO works

Before we get into SPACs it’s necessary to touch on how a standard IPO typically works.

Let’s say our pal Tony starts a donut shop.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

At first Tony’s happy just running one little shop in California. But his donuts get hyped and people start lining up for blocks to try them.

Tony uses his income to open a 2nd shop then a 3rd and a 4th — each more successful than the last. Eventually he takes some money from private investors and expands to hundreds of locations all over the US.

After years of hard work and luck Tony’s little donut shop becomes a full-fledged corporation with hundreds of employees and $1B in annual revenue.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Tony realizes that he has to raise more capital to sustain his growth. So he decides to take his company public via an IPO.

There are a few different types of IPOs. But if Tony goes the traditional route his company will partner with an “underwriter” (typically an investment bank) to navigate the mountain of legal paperwork regulatory documents and pricing models required to go public.

Usually the simplified process looks something like this:

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Going public offers several obvious advantages:

It allows a business to raise large amounts of capital. It offers a payout for private shareholders. It increases financial transparency and raises public trust.

But there are a few problems with the affair:

It’s pricey. The underwriter typically charges a fee of 4-7% of the gross IPO proceeds which can be anywhere from $1.5m to $100m+ depending on the deal size. Legal accounting printing and regulatory fees can cost millions more. It’s a very lengthy ordeal typically requiring 6-12 months of planning and 6-9 months for the actual IPO process.

The bulk of that time — up to 5 months — is tied up in filing an S-1 the standard registration form required by the SEC. The government often puts applicants through 2-5 rounds of revisions before approval.

An IPO also requires a ton of back-end work for a company like Tony’s Donuts — “roadshows” huge marketing investments and financial disclosures of every imaginable variety (balance sheets cash-flow statements income statements).

The goal of all of this due diligence? To provide as much transparency as possible to the public before they invest.

With an IPO investors know what company they’re betting on and ideally have the necessary information to make an informed buy.

But if Tony decides this process is too tedious he has another option…

Enter the SPAC

Let’s say Tony’s Donuts doesn’t want to mess with all that regulatory oversight. In lieu of an IPO the company might consider a SPAC.

In essence the SPAC process allows a company to bypass the rigmarole of an IPO by merging with a shell company (called a SPAC) that’s already gone public.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

A SPAC can usually get SEC clearance and IPO much faster than an established private company (~2 months) since it doesn’t have any historical financial documents to disclose.

Once public the shell company can take up to 24 months to identify a purchase target — like Tony’s Donuts — and enact a merger.

A SPAC allows a private company to go public in as little as 5-6 months compared to the 1- to 2-year timeline of an IPO.

On paper it can also be a tad cheaper and it offers a company both more flexible negotiation terms and more market certainty.

Sounds pretty decent for Tony’s Donuts…

But is it good for public investors?

When you buy into a SPAC IPO you almost always pay a set price of $10/share and get “warrants” or options to buy more shares in the future at a low price.

As a SPAC IPO investor you’re buying shares in a shell company and hedging a bet that it will merge with a desirable private firm in the future thus boosting the share price.

It’s usually a leap of faith — hence the moniker “blank check company.”

Most SPACs offer little insight into the companies they plan to merge with. Investors may be told something extremely general like “our focus will be on the technology industry in Southeast Asia or the United States.”

A SPAC filed in February 2021 uses typically vague language: “We have not selected any business combination target…[and] we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.” (Filing via SEC.gov; graphic: The Hustle)

The “blind” nature of these investments — and the reduced regulatory oversight they’re subject to — has drawn criticism that SPACs pose more dangers for retail investors than typical IPOs.

One case study frequently cited is Nikola Motors Co. which went public via a SPAC in June 2020 and shot up to as high as $66/share before allegations of fraud tanked the stock to $14.

As The Hustle has written SPACs have also attracted controversy for giving long-term revenue projections — something that’s strongly discouraged in the traditional IPO process.

But SPACs pay off? Like most stocks results are mixed.

A Bloomberg analysis of 24 SPAC stocks that went public between January 2019 and February 2021 found that more than half depreciated in value 1 month after a merger was announced.

Research by Bain has shown similar outcomes: a review of 121 SPACs showed that 60% underperformed the S&P 500 post-merger.

Data via Bloomberg Law; graphic: Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

Among Bloomberg’s sample size of SPACs the average return was 22.9%. By comparison in 2020:

The S&P 500 index saw a gain of + 18.4%

Nasdaq saw a gain of + 43.6%

Traditional IPOs saw an average gain of +75%

If we examine longer-term data the results are a bit more sobering.

A study of 93 SPACs that went public between 2015 and 2020 found that common shares posted an average loss of -9.6% (vs. a 37.2% average return for traditional IPOs). Less than one-third of SPACs were in the green.

As Tony would say that’s a big ol’ donut hole.

“CERT-In has observed continued targeted intrusion activities from Chinese state-sponsored actors towards Indian transport sector with the possible intention to collect intelligence and conduct cyber espionage. The notable threat actors such as APT41/Barium Tonto Team APT101 StonePanda APT15/K3yChang APT27/Emissary Panda Winnti groups & RedEcho have been targeting organisations across a range of industries aligned with the national strategic goals of the Chinese national policy priorities” says the note accessed by BusinessLine .

IRCTC Tata Motors National Highways Authority of India RITES Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) and Roads & Building Dept Andhra Pradesh are the entities that were subjected to cyber attacks during the period between May last year and as late as February this year.

“The Chinese actors have reportedly used either spear phishing Drive via Download or exploiting known vulnerabilities present in public facing applications as an initial entry mode to compromise the enterprise network” says the note dated March 10 sent to the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) with copies to the Intelligence Bureau Research & Analysis Wing and the National Security Council Secretariat. “The Ministry has advised departments and organisations under transport sector to strengthen the security posture of their infrastructure. Accordingly NIC NHAI NHIDCL IRC IAHE State PWDs testing agencies and automobile manufacturers have been requested to conduct the security audit of the entire IT system by CERT-In certified agencies on a regular basis and take all actions as per their recommendations” the Ministry said in a reply to BusinessLine .

An e-mail sent to Director-General CERT-In Sanjay Bahl asking for details on the note remained unanswered. Calls and messages sent to Ajay Prakash Sawhney Secretary MeitY also remained unanswered.

“Considering the advanced capabilities and infrastructure and tenacity of the Chinese adversaries CERT-In suggests departments and organisations under transport sector to beef up the security posture of their infrastructure with respect to the continued computer network operations and targeted intrusion” the note advised. “Organisations should stringently monitor and examine their network perimeter logs (firewall proxy etc.) particularly with curated list of Indicator of Compromise of this campaign provided by CERT-In” it added.

Intimate on actions taken

It may be recalled that the recent attacks on the country's various power assets were also linked to Chinese hackers. Tech giant Microsoft had also warned its customers recently against cyber attacks that have origin in China primarily targeting its on-premises ‘Exchange Server’ software.

Citicore Power Inc. (CPI) through subsidiary Rio Norte Hydropower Corporation has chosen Chinese engineering firm Xian Electric Engineering Co. Ltd. to build its 19.7-megawatt (MW) hydropower project in Isabela.

On Thursday Citicore said the two firms — represented by CPI chairman Edgar Saavedra and Xian Electric deputy general manager Liu Zhaohua — signed the Ilaguen 3A hydropower project’s engineering procurement and construction contract last March 11.

Construction is expected to commence in the second half of the year while operations are targeted to begin by October 2024. Once completed the project aims to provide 85 million kilowatts annually at lower costs to the cities of Cauayan and Santiago as well as 13 towns in the province.

The project will allow Citicore to achieve its target of producing 1000MW capacity from renewable energy sources in the next five years.

The run-of-river power generation is one of the most environment-friendly energy methods available because it utilizes natural water flow to generate power.

Currently the renewable energy firm has 163MW of capacity from its solar power plants located in Bataan Tarlac Pampanga Cebu Negros Occidental and South Cotabato. It recently revealed plans to offer the country’s first power real estate investment trust within the year.

Citicore is also set to begin the construction of its 50-megawatt alternating current (MWac) solar plant in Pampanga which aims to commercially operate by year-end. The project is a joint venture between CPI and AC Energy."

Just moved over here from the now inactive Tesla forums. I looked over Tesla's new ""Engage"" site but there doesn't seem to be much ""there"" there. Look forward to participating in this community!



I took delivery of my MY in November 2020. In short love the car. However I'm heartbroken about a couple of dings and mishaps. An accident with the garage door put a small nick in the top edge of my lift gate - slight dimple and paint missing. Then taking a road trip earlier this week apparently something hit the hood. I think I remember when it might have happened - it looked like a small piece of wood was kicked up by another car and bounced off the hood.



I didn't think much of the hood incident since it sounded/felt very minor when it happened. But after washing the car I see I now have a nice dimple and very visible scratch on the hood on the passenger side. HUGE bummer.



However I now see I'm also getting some small paint chips on the rear doors where they flare out to the rear fenders. I've seen people mention PPF and wonder if it's too late to invest in that and how well it would protect against the things I've experienced thus far. I'm also left wondering if the Tesla paint quality is simply not up to par with all other cars I've owned. I drove many other cars for years without incurring any significant paint damage (Mazdas Hondas and Toyotas).



I also saw mentioned that the red and white paint on the MY is a multi-coat paint job whereas the other colors are single coat. Does anyone know if that's accurate/true?



I'm looking to mitigate any future damage once I've used the touch-up paint to improve the appearance of the paint damage thus far.



(I also find myself wondering how much a replacement hood would be. That gouge on the hood really bums me out as it detracts from the beauty of the car!)



Any pointers or advice? I'll be happy to post pics of the damage later on but I don't want to delay this post going up - first post in these forums!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzMvMjEvMjIzNDMwMTgvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXRlc2xhLXNodXQtZG93bi1jYXJzLXNweWluZy1jaGluYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk says Tesla would be “shut down” if its cars were used for spying in China,"Elon Musk said Saturday if Tesla vehicles were used to spy in China the company would be shut down Reuters reported. Musk made the remark while speaking via video link to the China Development Forum addressing reports that China has barred its military and government personnel from using Tesla vehicles over security concerns.

“There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information” Musk told the forum. “If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere we will get shut down.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that people who work for China’s military government agencies and “state-owned enterprises in sensitive industries” were prohibited from driving Teslas. China is concerned that Tesla’s exterior cameras which constantly record footage could be used to gather images to be sent back to the US according to the Journal.

China is a huge market for Tesla and for electric vehicles; according to Reuters the carmaker sold 147445 vehicles in the country last year which accounted for 30 percent of its global total.

As Bloomberg notes Tesla and its leader have taken a different tone with Chinese authorities than with their US counterparts. For example last month Tesla apologized that one of its staff had blamed China’s electrical grid for damaging a customer’s vehicle: “We are deeply sorry for the misunderstanding and would like to apologize to the Nanchang Power Grid for the inconvenience caused” Tesla said in a video.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC11cy1jYW5hZGEtNTY0Njk0NzXSATVodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtdXMtY2FuYWRhLTU2NDY5NDc1LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russian pleads guilty to Tesla ransomware plot,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE5ODY3MzYvdGVzbGEtbmVlZHMtY2hpbmEtYnV0LWNoaW5hLWFsc28tbmVlZHMtdGVzbGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla needs China but China also needs Tesla,"﻿In China’s business circles executives talk admiringly of a particular type of firm they refer to as a “catfish.” These companies voracious competitors in crowded markets force rivals to improve their performance or perish. In China’s hyper-competitive electric vehicle (EV) market the metaphor of an aggressive fish gobbling up its lesser rivals until only the strongest remain is an apt one.

China has around 450 EV manufacturers according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies a Washington-based think tank. Only a handful of those companies actually sell cars as few players in the capital-intensive industry have raised the money needed to build a vehicle. In the US only three major car companies remain the product of waves of painful consolidation during the 20th century that eliminated hundreds of automakers.

That’s why China’s government officials have rolled out the red carpet for Tesla: they see the American automaker as just the catfish they need to thin out the EV market. Beijing has showered Tesla with perks including lighting fast approval for its Shanghai factory. In 2019 Chinese premier Li Keqiang offered Tesla CEO Elon Musk China’s equivalent of a permanent resident permit; Tesla also became the first foreign car marker to set up a wholly-owned factory without a Chinese partner.

“The bureaucratic red tape wasn’t there”said Bill Russo a former Chrysler executive and now the CEO of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility. “It was the opposite there was a bureaucratic tail wind.”

There was a bureaucratic tail wind.

One Chinese official even made his aims public. Miao Wei the ex-head of the country’s industry and information technology ministry welcomed the upstart this January calling Tesla “the catfish that can invigorate a pool of water” eliciting grumbles from China’s domestic EV manufacturers.

Beijing needs Tesla to prod Chinese competitors to innovate instead of coasting on government subsidies and to convince foreign investors that they remain welcome amid souring US-China relations. China is now turning the screws on its domestic industry: It’s phasing out its EV subsidies and squeezing domestic automakers’ profits in the hope that any short term pain will be compensated by more globally competitive sector. Beijing-based think tank Anbound argues that Tesla’s presence will strengthen high-quality domestic EV supply chains in China “and eventually help the Chinese electric car industry to thrive.”

For its part Tesla needs China just as much if not more. Tesla plans to produce and sell a record number of cars in China this year its second-largest market after the US. Sales in China contributed $6.7 billion to Tesla’s revenue last year accounting for around one-fifth of total sales. Tesla’s Shanghai factory churned out about 150000 cars in China last year and expects to produce around half a million cars in 2021 according to Reuters many destined for export to markets in Europe.

Publicly Musk has offered nothing but praise for the country. “China rocks in my opinion” he said during an interview last year. “The energy in China is great.” The executive has praised Beijing for being “very responsible” for its citizens a line cited by Chinese state-owned tabloid Global Times to polish the government’s battered global image abroad. And Zhu Xiaotong head of Tesla’s operations in China said Tesla’s expansion in the country will advance China’s goal of “dual circulation” an initiative by Chinese president Xi Jinping’s to strengthen the country’s domestic markets according to Chinese media.

How Tesla changed the view of electric cars in China

When Tesla sold its first Model S in China in 2014 the average car buyer saw EVs as either an imported luxury—“toys only for the rich” as one Chinese financial outlet put it—or low-end domestic models bought for service fleets. Tesla changed that by marketing EVs not only as a replacement for traditional gasoline cars but a desirable one as well. Today China is the world’s largest national EV market and Tesla’s Model 3 was the country’s best-selling EV in 2020. China accounted for 41% of global EV sales last year a record 1.3 million new EVs according to tech analytic firm Canalys. All new cars in the country should be electric fuel-cell or hybrid by 2035 up from 5% today.

“Tesla lit the candle and showed retail consumers it was OK to buy an EV” said Russo of Automobility. He compared Tesla’s success to Apple’s transformation of the smartphone from a commodity into a coveted luxury for middle-class Chinese opening up the market for local handset makers such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Tesla is now doing the same thing for EVs.

China’s own high-end EV brands such as NIO Xpeng and Li Auto all founded shortly after Tesla’s arrival in 2014 have credited Tesla as an inspiration and competitor. He Xiaopeng the founder of Xpeng told Quartz in 2018 that one of the reasons he started the company was the experience of driving a Tesla for the first time (and its decision to make more than 200 patents available). “Tesla has created a huge impact on me” said He

Consumers unable to afford Tesla’s relatively expensive starting price—around 249900 yuan ($38392) for a Model 3—in China are turning to domestic EV brands from premium EV makers such as Xpeng to budget brands as Hong Guang Mini EV and Chery starting under $10000. The top three EV makers sales surged by 350% in January compared to the same period last year. Some of the carmakers’ production is expected to ramp up to as much as 150000 vehicles this year. Tesla’s made-in-China models are also helping support Chinese EV parts suppliers such as battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology. In the future Tesla is expected to use more parts sourced from local companies that are set to benefit from the company’s expansion.

What’s next for Tesla and China

This is all part of China’s big bet on EVs. “The Chinese government has been very open and very aggressive about supporting the development of electric vehicles” said Steve Dyer the managing director at AlixPartners and a former executive at Ford Motors. Since 2009 China has heavily subsided its “new energy vehicles” low-emission technologies including plug-in hybrids battery-only electric vehicles (BEV) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Last year it offered subsidies as high as 18000 yuan ($2766) per vehicle on average.

But a period of consolidation is coming. Car sales in China fell by 4% in 2019 after decades of growth. China is eager to phase out subsidies (policymakers only extended incentives through 2022 after an attempt to reduce them in 2020 caused a plunge in sales). All this will strengthen the position of potential acquirers as weaker players edge toward bankruptcy.

This market is “just taking shape” according to Brian Gu president of Xpeng as incomes rise for China’s populace of 1.3 billion people. But a few dominant players have already emerged: premium EV brands NIO and Xpeng as well as budget automakers including Hong Guang Mini EV a joint venture between Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC and General Motors. The Mini EV sells for around $4500 and even outsold the Model 3 in January.

But once China’s domestic EV brands can challenge Tesla directly the company’s relationship with Beijing could become a bit more tricky. There’s already hints of frosty treatment from the government. In February Tesla was summoned by Chinese regulators over complaints about quality issues including acceleration irregularities and battery fires following Tesla’s recall of over 35000 imported Model X and S that month. One state-owned media outlet called the recall a sign of the company’s “ignorance in understanding Chinese consumers” while another slammed the company for being “unreasonable and arrogant” a 180-degree shift from its glowing praise less than a year earlier. Tesla said it has accepted the guidance from the authorities “sincerely.”

Yet there are no signs Beijing is withdrawing its preferential treatment of Tesla yet. Authorities seem ready to give Tesla a long leash as it helps accelerate the rise of the country’s EV industry. After all Tesla’s role as a catfish isn’t finished yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2FzaWEubmlra2VpLmNvbS9Qb2xpdGljcy9JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJlbGF0aW9ucy9VUy1DaGluYS10ZW5zaW9ucy9DaGluYS1iYW5zLXVzZS1vZi1UZXNsYS1ieS1taWxpdGFyeS1jaXRpbmctc2VjdXJpdHktY29uY2VybnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China bans use of Tesla by military citing security concerns,"BEIJING -- The Chinese military has in effect banned the use of Tesla vehicles by its staff and employees citing concerns that data collection by cameras installed on the cars can lead to leaks of sensitive information sources said Friday.

The move comes at a time when tensions between Beijing and Washington are running high. China's top diplomats and their U.S. counterparts just had a heated exchange in their first meeting in Anchorage Alaska raising speculation that Beijing is pressuring Washington by going after the top U.S. electric vehicle maker.

Tesla cars are now prohibited from entering People's Liberation Army facilities and housing complexes the sources said. The government is concerned that the omnidirectional cameras and ultrasound sensors on installed in the cars can lead to security leaks according to the sources.

Chinese authorities including the State Administration for Market Regulation said it investigated two Tesla subsidiaries in February. In addition to safety issues such as rapid acceleration and battery fires the authorities asked the Tesla side about the suspicion that the automaker is taking user data out of the country.

Chinese regulations mandate so-called new-energy vehicles including electric and plug-in hybrid cars to offer real-time driving data such as vehicle location and battery usage to authorities. Suspicion has been raised that Tesla has not followed this requirement.

According to The Wall Street Journal Beijing is also banning employees of government agencies from using Tesla cars.

""If Tesla is not following Chinese rules and regulations the restriction is appropriate"" said a Chinese local government official.

Tesla sold 145000 vehicles in China last year according to British research firm LMC Automotive. This roughly threefold jump from 2019 vaulted the company to third place in new-energy vehicles behind Chinese automakers SAIC Motor and BYD.

Demand grew among affluent consumers unable to spend money on foreign travel as well as middle-class shoppers seeing locally produced Teslas as a relative bargain.

China generated about 30% of Tesla's global sales volume last year and was a major driver behind the company's first-ever annual net profit.

The Chinese government keen to win over a prominent American business has rolled out the red carpet for Tesla allowing it to become the first foreign automaker to set up a wholly owned production and sales subsidiary in the country.

But friction between Washington and Beijing could create a bumpier road ahead and Thursday's openly confrontational meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's top diplomat Politburo member Yang Jiechi does not bode well on that front."

Could Sig Sauer Be the Answer?,"With the U.S. military finally replacing the M4 Sig Sauer brings the MCX Spear to the table sporting a familiar design. Little additional training will be necessary for soldiers to adapt to the new platform.

The United States military is finally replacing the beloved M4 along with the M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW). This change is said to be coming in 2021. This will be the first major weapons platform change since 1994 when the M4 became the standard issue rifle for the United States military. Now it’s time for a change. Not only is the military swapping out platforms but it’s also changing calibers.

The military was seeking out something that had manageable recoil and high velocity like 5.56 but also wanted something with superior stopping power like 7.62. Despite having lethality on its side the U.S. wanted to avoid the heaviness and higher recoil of the 7.62 cartridge. This ended with the selection of 6.8 mm.

6.8 mm was specifically designed to address the long-distance ballistics issues of 5.56 NATO and serve as a way to close the gap between 5.56 and 7.62. It can’t match the stopping power of the 7.62 but it’s lighter faster and has less recoil. 6.8 is also more easily controlled in burst fire.

There are 3 contenders bidding to be the new platform for the new 6.8mm: Sig Sauer General Dynamics and Textron Systems.

Sig Sauer brings the MCX Spear to the table sporting a familiar design to the M4. Meaning little additional training will be necessary for soldiers to adapt to the new platform. Its weight is probably the same as the M4 as well but no specifics have been given except that it’s under 10 pounds. What’s interesting is that all Spear rifles come with a built-in suppressor to counter the muzzle blast (recoil) from the new cartridge. Eventually the MCX Spear will be fitted with a fire control group called the Vortex system. It’s a suite of optics rangefinders and even a ballistic computer. This technology could lead to the average soldier having superior shooting ability even without sharpshooter training. The computer determines the trajectory of the bullet before it’s fired making it almost trivial to land shots.

They also have the 6.8 LMG on the table but even fewer details have been given out about the MCX Spear’s sibling firearm. Sig Sauer claims that its new LMG platform weighs 40 percent less than its predecessors. Recoil is also said to be “dramatically” reduced in the new platform. The new LMG will also feature quick-detach magazines more M-LOK rail space the aforementioned suppressor and “vastly improves upon the operation and function of the legacy M249.”

The military will be selecting one of the three companies by October of 2021. After that the selected company will have a year to make rifles for the 2022 rollout. These rifles won’t be given out to all U.S. soldiers though. Special forces and recon are among the first to receive the rifles with the rest to receive them in the following years.

Review Editor

It’s almost time to get “the Maxx for the minimum” in Alliance

Retailer TJ Maxx has announced an opening date for its store in Alliance.

In a note on under the ""Store Locator"" on the retailer’s website tjmaxx.com the Alliance location at 2642 W. State St. shows “New store opening on March 21 2021 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.”

The store has been in the works for well over a year.

The City of Alliance approved an occupancy permit for the store in late 2019.

At that time city officials said the store going into the West State Square plaza would be 21052 square feet. The store will replace two retailers that once were located in the plaza between Walmart and Carnation City Mall.

Rue 21 was going through a store closing sale when TJ Maxx first was announced in Alliance. A neighboring business EmbroidMe relocated to 2213 W. State St. across from Pizza Hut.

EmbroidMe relocated early in 2020 and owner Paul Brestelli told The Alliance Review in May that the first months in their new location were difficult and that the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic and statewide business shutdown didn’t help.

The pandemic also hurt the expansion of West State Square causing multiple lengthy delays in building the 10000-square-foot addition.

Initial plans in late 2019 indicated the store would open by mid-October 2020. The store will be the second in Stark County. A newly opened store at 4800 Everhard Road NW in Plain Township sits next to a Home Goods store. Those two stores are part of the same company that also owns Marshalls TJX Companies.

There are two Marshalls stores in Stark County — one in The Strip in Jackson Township and one in the Massillon Marketplace plaza. The Plain Township Home Goods is the only such store in Stark County.

The opening of TJ Maxx will bring another clothing retailer to the city. The troubled Carnation City Mall lost JC Penney in 2020.

Redevelopment of the mall was announced in late 2020. As part of a deal with incoming owner Fairmount Properties the city will place the mall property into a tax incremental financing program that will exempt the owner from some property taxes.

According to the plan the City of Alliance would become the temporary owner of the mall. The mall then will be sold to Fairmount Properties.

City of Alliance Director of Planning and Development Joe Mazzola previously told the Review that the city aims to finalize the plans for the mall in the early part of this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjEvc3RvcmUtb3BlbmluZ3MtMjAyMS0xMC1yZXRhaWxlcnMtdGhhdC1hcmUtb3BlbmluZy1uZXctc2hvcHMuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAzLzIxL3N0b3JlLW9wZW5pbmdzLTIwMjEtMTAtcmV0YWlsZXJzLXRoYXQtYXJlLW9wZW5pbmctbmV3LXNob3BzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 10 retailers are in expansion mode: Here's who is opening new stores,"A Dick's Sporting Goods store Craig Warga | Bloomberg | Getty Images

In a 180-degree turn from 2020 retailers' expansion plans are outpacing plans to close up shop so far this year. U.S. retailers have announced 3199 store openings and 2548 closures year-to-date according to a tracking by Coresight Research. For comparison the firm recorded a whopping 8953 closures along with 3298 openings last year as the Covid pandemic upended the retail industry and pushed dozens of businesses into bankruptcy. Now though the country is seemingly turning a corner. The rollout of the Covid vaccine keeps ramping up another round of stimulus checks is landing in many Americans' bank accounts and companies are by and large predicting a strong rebound of the consumer. The National Retail Federation is forecasting retail sales in the U.S. could grow anywhere between 6.5% and 8.2% this year with the economy accelerating at its fastest clip in two decades. The real estate market meantime presents an opportunity in 2021 for companies looking to grow. They will likely pay less in rent and have more flexible lease terms. A glut of vacancies has left landlords more desperate to fill space and sign deals they wouldn't have ever considered pre-pandemic. ""Most retailers that survived Covid's early days are now looking to refill their new store opening programs"" said Bill Read executive vice president for Retail Specialists a brokerage firm based in the Southeast. ""Demand for new stores is very robust right now. Playing catch up has everyone in a hurry up."" Here are 10 of the retailers that have store openings planned for this year.

Ulta Beauty

Market cap: $18.13 billion

12-month stock performance: Up 119% Ulta Beauty is planning to open about 40 net new stores in 2021. The retailer has earmarked roughly $70 million for store openings and remodels this year. Its plans call for 11 locations to be remodeled and 10 to be relocated. When the Covid pandemic hit store openings that were slated for 2020 were postponed Ulta's management team told analysts during a conference call in early March. And as a result many of the openings now planned for 2021 are expected to happen during the first quarter it said. Beginning in the second half of this year Ulta is also rolling out a smaller version of its store in more than 100 Target locations. ""We continue to be optimistic and positive about the outlook of physical retail and we'll continue to find terrific locations across the country"" Ulta President David Kimbell said. ""We see plenty of growth ahead of us."" Kimbell is set to replace current Ulta CEO Mary Dillon when she steps down in June.

Sephora

LVMH-owned Sephora says it plans to open more than 60 freestanding stores this year the majority of which won't be in malls. Separately the beauty business is on track to open some 200 pint-sized shops within Kohl's locations this fall which will ramp up to more than 850 sites by 2023. Its store strategy is focused on reducing its exposure to suburban malls and getting closer to customers in other ways. As it moves into Kohl's it's ending a years-long relationship with the department store chain J.C. Penney. Make-up sales have been walloped during the pandemic with more consumers embracing a low-maintenance and casual lifestyle but Sephora is betting that demand for cosmetics will come back strong.

Burlington Stores

About a third of this year's openings will be a smaller-format Burlington is piloting. These will be about 25000 square feet versus the typical 50000 to 80000 square feet. The company has said its goal for these locations is to keep inventory levels down and cut costs. ""When you have less in-store inventory you need less physical space"" Chief Executive Michael O'Sullivan said. ""This has significant economic benefits ... increasing the pool of potential real estate sites and providing the opportunity to open profitable stores in more locations around the United States.""

Amazon

Market cap: $1.531 trillion

12-month stock performance: Up 63% Amazon is quietly opening more Amazon Fresh grocery stores according to a recent Bloomberg report. Amazon Fresh debuted in Los Angeles in September. The Bloomberg report said the eleventh such store opened earlier this month and Amazon is working on at least two dozen more. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the report. Amazon which also owns the high-end Whole Foods grocery chain sees an opportunity to take over vacant real estate in order to plant itself much closer to customers. Bloomberg reported some of the Fresh shops are filling empty Toys R Us locations for example. Hundreds went dark after the toy chain filed for bankruptcy in September 2017. The Fresh stores range from 25000 square feet to 45000 square feet Bloomberg said. It's not just Amazon looking to grow either. Grocery remains a competitive category from the low-end to the high-end: Aldi Lidl Sprouts Farmers Market and Trader Joe's have all announced store openings this year as well. Dollar General  which also sells groceries plans to open 1000 stores including some with its Popshelf label.

""Further we see additional opportunities to relocate existing stores to more desirable locations and to seek out more favorable terms when leases expire.""

By Alwyn Scott and David French

NEW YORK March 19 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd's $23.4 billion bid for Hartford Financial Services Group Inc would catapult it well up the rankings of U.S. property and casualty insurers if it is willing to sweeten its offer enough to clinch the deal equity analysts said.

Chubb on Thursday offered to buy Hartford for $65 per share in cash and stock a premium of about 13% to its stock price the previous day.

In combining forces Chubb would significantly boost its footprint among small commercial businesses where Hartford is a leader. Building scale in that sector is critical because small businesses tend to pay small premiums said analyst Paul Newsome at Piper Sandler in Chicago.

Hartford Financial or ""The Hartford"" as it is known dates back to 1810 when it was founded as the Hartford Fire Insurance Co.

Some analysts said the offer undervalued Hartford and suggested the price could rise to more than $29 billion. Other acquisitions in the sector have fetched prices that were 151% to 176% of book value compared with Chubb's bid at 144% of Hartford's book value.

""We view the $65 per share as too low"" Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan said in a note arguing Hartford could command more than $80 a share.

The combined company could book about $51 billion in net premiums earned in 2022 a key revenue metric for insurers Greenspan estimated.

That would make Chubb bigger than Progressive Corp which analysts expect will report about $48 billion in net premiums earned in 2022 according to Refinitiv.

The P&C insurance market has been hit by claims associated with the COVID-19 pandemic including payouts to some business for losses caused by lockdown measures.

This comes on top of terrible wildfires in western states the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record and civil unrest which have all raised claims by policyholders and pushed losses onto insurers.

While a potential deal would be the largest in the P&C space since Chubb was created by ACE Ltd's $28.5 billion purchase of Chubb in January 2016 this part of insurance has seen a steady flow of smaller acquisitions.

Transactions such as MetLife Inc selling its car and home insurance business to Farmers Group part of Zurich Insurance Group AG reflect how those with smaller operations are exiting the sector in the face of fierce competition.

The deal is unlikely to encounter regulatory challenges given how fragmented the P&C industry is Newsome said. Chubb has a narrow advantage as the largest writer of commercial lines policies ahead of Travelers Companies according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Adding eighth-ranked Hartford would give the combined entity an 8.4% market share overall.

In personal lines insurance a joint Chubb-Hartford would be the 11th-largest writer S&P Global figures show. Ranking by net premiums written would put Chubb-Hartford just below fifth-ranked Liberty Mutual Insurance Co based on 2020 results according to AM Best.

If Chubb does not pay up for Hartford others might be more willing. William Hawkins at Keefe Bruyette & Woods wrote in a note that Allianz SE and Zurich could offer $87 and $84 a share respectively while still accruing benefits to earnings.

Allianz and Zurich declined to comment.

Harvest Hosts an RV membership company that gives RVers access to ""unique"" overnight stays has found success during COVID-19 and a new almost $40 million investment will allow the business to continue its fast growth ahead of the predicted summer travel boom.

Road travel vehicle manufacturers specializing in RVs camper vans and trailers saw a huge spike in sales during 2020 as COVID-19 stopped would-be travelers from flying and cruising. However these makers weren't the only travel-adjacent companies that benefited from the coronavirus pandemic: from May 2020 to December Harvest Hosts' membership base doubled in size the company says.

Prior to this the company had already been growing fast due to the millennial #VanLife boom and retirees interested road travel. But when COVID-19 hit the US ""everything went into hyper-speed"" Joel Holland CEO of Harvest Hosts told Insider in an interview.

Harvest Hosts' expanding business eventually caught the attention of Stripes leading to its $37 million investment in the RV membership company. Stripes previously invested in companies like GrubHub Reformation and Refinery29.

""We look to back ambitious entrepreneurs who are delivering amazing products and it became clear as we spent more time in the space that Holland is building a really special product for RVers"" Chris Carey a partner at Stripes said in a press release. ""His vision for the company is something we are excited to be part of.""

How it works

Harvest Hosts. Harvest Hosts

Harvest Hosts' appeal is in its straightforward membership model. Members can tap into the company's network of over 2000 locations — known as ""hosts"" — across the US for overnight RV stays. The company's hosts encompass a wide range of destinations including breweries farms golf courses and wineries the latter the most popular option.

There are several stipulations to the membership program. For one members must have a ""fully self-contained RV"" with a toilet and wastewater tanks. RV travelers are also required to notify the hosts ahead of their arrivals and are discouraged from staying longer than the allotted 24-hour overnight stay.

Annual memberships start at $79 for the classic package. This price then jumps to $199 for the classic package plus access to golf and country clubs. Overnight stays don't come at any additional cost but Harvest Hosts encourages its members to spend money at their destinations in order to support the local hosts.

""We keep our membership costs low because we want to encourage people to take the money they're saving and spend it with the local businesses"" Holland said. Currently about 60% of its members are retired and over half have a six-figure-plus disposable income making them a ""powerful buying force"" Holland explained.

Last year Harvest Hosts' members spent over $25 million at the visited locations. Holland projects this will grow to $30 million this year which translates to an additional $15000 for winery-based hosts specifically.

Harvest Hosts has grown quickly. This is how its new investment will help

The company's rapid growth has been a constant for several years now. From 2018 to the COVID-19 pandemic Harvest Hosts' membership base grew ten times and this growth only continued to accelerate through 2020.

According to Holland new members began flocking to the company through the summer — as expected — into the winter. Travel normally hits a lull during winter but the inverse happened for Harvest Hosts: interest in January and February 2021 were so high the number of members spiked 400% compared to last year.

Now the company is anticipating a massive summer travel boom and consequently the potential for further growth with the help of its new financial cushion and Stripes' resources.

""Everything in this industry seems to be moving fast"" Holland said. ""We want to make sure we can keep up and the funding will help us do that.""

According to Holland this $37 million investment will help Harvest continue the growth of both its host and member communities all with the goal of becoming ""the trusted resource for RVers when they're looking for a place to stay.""

To do this Harvest Hosts is now using the money to boost its location catalog from a little over 2000 hosts to 3000 hosts by the end of the year. Looking even further ahead the company is ""racing to 10000"" Holland said.

Along with this host growth the Harvest Hosts is also building out features like improved ""route planning tools"" and a new reservation system meant to ease the hosting process.

""The faster we can get more hosts onboard the better for our members and these small businesses"" Holland said. ""The more we scale the better everyone does so I'm excited to [do so] as quickly as possible and that takes money.

SEATTLE — Gov. Jay Inslee issued a new advisory Friday for Washington travelers saying they should comply with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Inslee modified his Nov. 13 travel advisory which urged people returning to Washington to self-quarantine for 14 days and encouraged Washingtonians to avoid non-essential travel.

However the November advisory was a recommendation and not a mandate and there was little way to enforce it.

Washington’s new travel advisory will follow CDC guidelines which Inslee said was more all-encompassing.

“Current CDC guidance is more robust thorough and specific than my November 2020 travel advisory and importantly the CDC updates its guidance to reflect the latest science optimal safety practices and protocols and the current COVID-19 situation here and abroad” Inslee said in a statement.

As of March 20 this is the CDC travel guidance which Washington will follow:

Get fully vaccinated for COVID-19 if you are eligible.

Get tested for COVID-19 one to three days before your trip.

Wear a mask over your nose and mouth while in public.

Avoid crowds and stay 6 feet apart from anyone who didn’t travel with you.

Get tested for COVID-19 three to five days after your trip and self-quarantine for seven days after your trip. Alternatively if you don’t get tested quarantine for 10 days.

In early March Inslee updated Washington’s requirements for international travelers to comply with CDC guidance. Under CDC rules international travelers returning to the U.S. must test negative for COVID-19 before getting on a plane to the states."

It includes GPS trackers on the buses a tablet and an RFID scanner which lets students tap on and off of buses using cards.

""When they get on the bus they scan it and it registers to the bus driver that yes this is their correct bus and this is who the student is"" said Chlorissa Goddard the Transportation Director for the Tooele County School District.

This also helps bus drivers make sure students are getting on and off of buses at the right time.

Goddard said ""It does pop up with an alert saying that the student shouldn’t be on this bus or shouldn’t be getting off at this bus stop.""

This can be adjusted by the driver manually if parents verify changes with the school district.

If a student forgets their RFID card the driver can add them to the rider log using the tablet.

Each bus driver is assigned a tablet which is password protected to keep all the student information safe and secure.

The tablets track lots of information like which kids got on or off of each bus directions bus stops clocking drivers in and out and details that help with vehicle inspections.

""Before I had tons of physical papers that I had to handle but this has eliminated so much of the paperwork because the information is already stored on the tablets"" said Lory Thatcher the Transportation Trainer for Tooele County School District.

Thatcher also steps in as a bus driver when someone else calls out or in other emergencies.

She said this new technology will help her and other substitute drivers a lot especially when they aren't as familiar with the kids who are on their designated route for that day.

""Can you imagine having to cover all these different buses and all these different routes and being able to know where you’re going what ride you’re going on where you’re stopping at? The tablets take care of all of those problems for us"" said Thatcher.

""At the end of each route our bus drivers take the tablets off of the docking station and they walk to the back of the bus and they scan the unique code"" said Goddard.

This process reminds the bus drivers to check if there are any kids left on their buses.

If the driver did not scan the code at the back of the bus they would have to put in a reason why and that would flag it with the school district.

Only the school district is able to track the location of the buses in real-time.

The district says it's hoping to roll out an app to let parents track the location of buses and have the app ready to use by the next school year.

Goddard said ""We got our scanners for the kindergartners just this past year we got the tablets the year before that and the year before that was the GPS units.""

For now the RFID cards are only being used by kindergartners but the district says it plans to have more students using them over time.

The RFID cards come at no cost to students/parents and the same ones will be used by students throughout the duration of their time in the Tooele County School District.

""It doesn't have any kind of identifying information on the actual card itself. We put very basic information that nobody would be able to identify a student by"" said Goddard.

The tablets and the RFID scanner being used by the Tooele County School District are made by Tyler Technologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cars drove through an orderly line and drivers one by one stuck their arms out to get the shot that could save their lives.

Area poultry processing plants are immunizing employees against COVID holding company-wide events where people can get vaccinations.

Eli Ruiz the human resources shift manager for Simmons Foods Cook Plant in Van Buren said going to a vaccination event rather than having to find a place to get a vaccine on his own made it a lot easier.

“I decided to get the vaccine because I feel it’s very important to limit the number of people getting infected"" Ruiz said.

At O.K. Foods Simmons and Tyson Foods employees can get vaccinated through on-site clinics.

""O.K. Foods has remained committed to the health and safety of our valued team members throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been actively educating team members about the vaccine and encouraging them to get vaccinated at their earliest convenience"" said Jordan Johnson a spokesman for O.K. Foods in an email.

All the plants want to make the vaccines available to anyone who wants them.

At Tyson the plan is to hold 19 vaccination events between March 15 and April 2 giving the company's approximately 24000 Arkansas employees a chance to get the vaccine according to a press release.

The Fayetteville and Springdale Tyson plants had vaccination clinics on March 9 and 10 respectively. More than 1200 employees were vaccinated at the events according to the release.

Derek Burleson a spokesman for Tyson said that the company could possibly have more clinics depending on if there is a great enough need for them. Otherwise officials will direct their employees to nearby vaccination facilities.

“It really depends on the volume"" Burleson said.

Tyson is offering its employees up to four hours of regular pay if they are vaccinated outside of their shift times or through an external source.

Simmons had two vaccination events for its four plants in the River Valley area extending vaccines to their more than 1500 team members in the River Valley said Julie Maus the director of communications for the company. More than 700 employees received their first round of the Pfizer vaccine.

The company had three vaccination clinics over three days in northwest Arkansas. Simmons will have another round of clinics within the next few weeks to give their employees their booster shots.

Workers could get their vaccines any time during their work shift and were paid if they received their vaccine before or after their shift Maus said.

Ruiz who got his shot at the Simmons Cook Plant in Van Buren said the shot did not hurt and that he was “thankful because they’re keeping their employees safe"" he said about his employer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3Npb3V4Y2l0eWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3NwZWNpYWwtc2VjdGlvbi9sb2NhbC9pbmR1c3RyeS9wcm9ncmVzcy1sb3Blei1mb29kcy1iZWdpbnMtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yZW5vdmF0aW9ucy1hdC1jaGVyb2tlZS1wbGFudC9hcnRpY2xlXzMwMWY4OTliLTJkODgtNTgwYS04MDFlLTBkMjQyZDlhZDNmNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROGRESS: Lopez Foods begins production renovations at Cherokee plant,"CHEROKEE Iowa -- Lopez Foods has made major headway on a multi-phase multi-year renovation project at its plant in Cherokee where the Oklahoma-based meat company began production in 2020.

Lopez purchased the roughly 285000-square-foot former Iowa Food Group plant in the summer of 2019 for $9.3 million including $5.8 million for the real estate and $3.5 million for equipment on site. The Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) approved $500000 in direct financial assistance plus tax incentives for the plant back in December of that year.

Lopez began renovations of the plant in August 2019 and planned to begin production in the spring of 2020 -- until the coronavirus pandemic struck. Cherokee County remained relatively untouched by the pandemic during the early days not tallying its first infection until the last week of April. Meatpackers elsewhere were suffering severe outbreaks at the time.

Because of the COVID-19 delays production didn't begin in earnest until June. ""Our business plans changed due to the pandemic; and so like probably a lot of other (companies) we had to restart our growth plan"" said John P. Lopez president of Lopez Foods.

Phase I was essentially completed last fall. Further phases will begin later depending on the timing of contract negotiations for which products to produce. As of February negotiations with customers were ongoing and Lopez was hopeful the ink would be dried on some contracts in the near future.

""The good news is we are currently negotiating some really big contracts with some potentially new customers"" Lopez said.

In the fall Lopez estimated that roughly 25 percent of the plant or perhaps slightly more was being utilized. A little more than 50 were employed full-time at the plant at the time with hopes of bringing on ""several hundred more employees"" depending on the contracts Lopez said.

""With what we're trying to negotiate we could fill up the facility almost immediately if these negotiations go very well"" he said.

The process of getting everything up and running could take three to five years total. Again much of it will depend on the contracts.

""Depending on what Phase II and III are and the timelines associated with each there will be additional renovations that need to occur before we would bring our processes in"" Lopez said. ""There's a lot of walls and rooms and other things that don't necessarily fit our process flow. So we would completely demolish what we could and remodel the internal areas to be a linear and efficient process flow.""

The plant located on the southern end of Cherokee at at 1300 S. Lake St. is only Lopez's second. Its flagship plant is in Oklahoma City.

Lopez was originally called Anderson Meats a spinoff of Wilson Foods which built the oldest parts of the Cherokee plant back in the mid-1960s. Anderson produced beef patties for McDonald's as early as 1968; the company takes its current name from John C. Lopez (the father of John P. Lopez) who purchased a controlling stake in the company in 1992.

The aging Cherokee plant has changed hands repeatedly. It became an IBP Inc. plant in 1997 and then a Tyson plant after Tyson's acquisition of IBP in 2001. In 2014 Tyson closed the plant citing the facility's age and the ""prohibitive cost of renovation"" plus changing consumer demands. The closure resulted in the loss of roughly 450 jobs.

Iowa Food Group a startup led by a group of Texans and one Iowan purchased the plant for $2.35 million in September 2018. The company planned to initially hire 100 workers to process beef chicken pork and lamb slaughtered elsewhere for retail or food service but they soon ran into trouble.

Only a few months after production at the plant was restarted the firm announced it had temporarily suspended production to raise more capital. The temporary suspension became permanent; Iowa Food Group never resumed operations and its workers lost their jobs.

While previous owners chose to abandon the plant Lopez said there was a lot of opportunity there -- renovations are expensive but so is building from scratch.

""The ability to grow in the manner that we wanted to grow and having that much square footage available was a perfect fit for our vision"" Lopez said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVobi5vcmcvcHJlc2lkZW50LWJpZGVuLWVudmlyb25tZW50LWFuZC1jbGltYXRlLTI2NTExNDI1MTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Environment & energy in President Biden's first 100 days in office,"Journalists are reliably fond of two things: 1) Arbitrary ways to grade politicians like the ""100 days in office"" meme; and 2) scooping the competition.

Well here's my scoop on President Biden's first 100 days when it comes to the environment.

Executive orders On the campaign trail Biden promised a Gatling gun's worth of Executive Orders. His Inauguration Day executive order on climate change is a veritable Russian nesting doll of presidential decrees calling for everything from respect for science to cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline. In a separate letter he re-enlisted the U.S. in the Paris Climate Accord. A week later another multi-faceted executive order established a goal of 30 percent protection of U.S. land and waters and blocked new oil and gas leases on federal land.

House Got omens anyone? If climate change should be a powerful election issue anywhere it would be Miami and the Florida Keys. Florida's 26th and 27th districts cover that turf. Scientists predict that rising seas will turn virtually all of both districts into surf by century's end. In 2018 the Republican co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Climate Caucus Carlos Curbelo lost his seat in the 26th to Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. In the 27th another Climate Caucus Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen retired clearing the way for Democrat Donna Shalala. Both Democrats lasted only one term. While their GOP replacements have also embraced climate action there's little overall movement in the GOP nationally. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has gently nudged the party toward taking climate change seriously he's also helped lead the loud Republican attack against Progressive Dems' Both Democrats lasted only one term. While their GOP replacements have also embraced climate action there's little overall movement in the GOP nationally. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has gently nudged the party toward taking climate change seriously he's also helped lead the loud Republican attack against Progressive Dems' Green New Deal.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) otherwise a strong supporter of federal action on climate change has blocked an effort by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to adjust federal flood insurance rates. FEMA wants rates that would better reflect the greatly increased risks to beachfront homes including some of the priciest properties in the country on Long Island's coastline.

States State governorships cabinets and legislatures have taken an abrupt turn into complete control of statehouses. According to the website Ballotpedia 38 states are dominated by ""trifectas"" where both legislative houses and the governor's office are controlled by the same party"" -- 23 by Republicans and 15 by Democrats. Of the 23 Republican states 21 have joined in efforts to sue the White House over its cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline.

Wise Use redux In the 1990's the ""Wise Use Movement"" became a particularly fierce player in western U.S. politics motivated by what they saw as federal overreach on control of western grazing water and mining rights. During the Obama Administration similar protests led by the family of Cliven Bundy drew a more strident sometimes violent pose. Following the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol fears over a backlash to Biden's potential actions are growing. Climate environment and energy issues rarely dominate the headlines. In the age of COVID there's little chance that they will.

Tim Brown CEO of Brown Wegher said merger talks began in May and were finalized on Dec. 31.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

""It was a mutual consultant that was working for both companies and just recognized a real fit for us"" Brown said. ""We've been thinking through succession planning for a few years with the goal of -- Rick (Wegher) and I are both in our late 50s and we wanted to make sure that Brown Wegher Construction (and MBW Construction) we wanted to make sure that those two entities had a bright future after we hit an age that we can't support it.""

Brown said that Weger maintains a ""significant ownership piece"" in Brown Wegher Residential while Brown maintains an ownership stake in MBW along with Tyler Manker (whose last name is the ""M"" in MBW).

Staffers at MBW and Brown Wegher are expected to remain in their current roles.

""It wasn't a merger to create cost savings so our entire staff is staying on board and doing the same things they want to do"" Brown said. ""It was an opportunity for more significant growth and succession planning.""

The Journey Group in Sioux Falls was incorporated in 1910 and was the builder of several older Sioux Falls landmarks including the Orpheum Theater and the Boyce-Greeley Building as well as O'Gorman and Lincoln high schools and numerous other projects according to the firm's website.

In a statement the Journey Group wrote that Brown Wegher's companion business entities ""have a long-standing history a strong customer base and similar culture and values as Journey.""

Wegher Construction was founded more than 30 years ago by Rick Wegher and some partners while Brown Construction was founded by Tim Brown and was perhaps best known for work in Lakeport Commons the shopping center at the intersection of Sergeant Road and South Lakeport Street that opened in 2005.

Brown Construction ran into some difficulty during the 2007-2008 financial crisis which hit the construction industry hard.

In 2011 Brown and Wegher combined to form Brown Wegher Construction. Wegher serves as president of the firm which now goes by Brown Wegher Residential.

Last spring Brown Wegher launched MBW Construction & Engineering which focuses primarily on work at food processing facilities manufacturing facilities refrigerated warehouses commercial development and the like.

Brown Wegher was the contractor in several prominent projects in metro Sioux City including the extensive remodel of the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce building in 2019 and the BoDean's wafer-baking plant in Le Mars as well as several projects in Dakota Dunes an upscale community in extreme southeast South Dakota.

The S&P 500 pulled back from all-time highs this past week on investor concerns about rising interest rates and inflation.

On Wednesday the Federal Reserve announced it is maintaining its target interest rate range of between zero and 0.25% and reassured investors that inflation “continues to run below 2%.” However the Fed also increased its full-year 2021 PCE inflation projection from 1.8% to 2.4% prompting 10-year Treasury yields to rise above 1.7% for the first time since January 2020.

Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. bank Wednesday to offer a select group of its wealthiest most risk-tolerant clients access to Bitcoin funds. Bitcoin prices hit $60000 for the first time last weekend but pulled back to around $58500 to close out the week.

On Tuesday Uber announced it will be reclassifying all of its U.K. drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. The change came after Uber lost a legal battle in the U.K. over driver classifications and the company is currently fighting a similar battle in the state of California.

Gable Steveson finally achieved it Saturday fulfilling his long-held goal of winning an NCAA championship by defeating Michigan's Mason Parris 8-4 to claim the heavyweight crown in St. Louis.

The junior from Apple Valley finished the season 17-0 becoming the first Gophers wrestler to win an NCAA title since fellow heavyweight Tony Nelson in 2012 and 2013. His victory helped the Gophers tie for seventh place in the team standings with 64 points. Two other Gophers earned top-six finishes Saturday at Enterprise Center with sophomore Patrick McKee placing third at 125 pounds and sophomore Brayton Lee taking sixth place at 157.

The victory pushed Steveson's winning streak to 34 matches and raised his Gophers career record to 67-2. Iowa won the team title with 129 points with Penn State second and Oklahoma State third.

Steveson took a 2-0 lead with a takedown and never trailed. Ever the showman he performed a celebratory cartwheel and backflip after the match then marveled at winning a title he had wanted for as long as he could remember.

""I'm a national champion"" said Steveson the No. 1 seed. ""It's been three years since I came to college. I expected to win [an NCAA title] my first year and got beat. Second year lost to COVID.

""It's been a very long time coming for me. I'm so happy to be here you don't even understand.""

Steveson will pursue another big ambition in two weeks when he wrestles at the Olympic trials in Fort Worth Texas. He is the No. 2 freestyle heavyweight in the U.S. behind two-time world championships bronze medalist Nick Gwiazdowski.

Gable Steveson does a backflip to celebrate after defeating Michigan's Mason Parris

As a freshman Steveson took third in the NCAA tournament after a 4-3 semifinal loss to Anthony Cassar of Penn State. His next chance to win a national title vanished when last year's NCAA championships — which were to be at U.S. Bank Stadium — were canceled because of the pandemic.

That added to his hunger this season. Gophers coach Brandon Eggum said Steveson has ""really matured a lot"" during his time with the Gophers steadily improving his strength and conditioning to become more dominant each year.

""He's done a really good job"" Eggum said. ""The guys he's competing against I think their goal is just to try to keep it as close as they can and not give up bonus points.""

Steveson and Parris the No. 2 seed were familiar foes. They wrestled for the heavyweight title at the past two Big Ten championships; Steveson won both including a 12-4 decision two weeks ago.

Saturday Steveson knew Parris would switch up his tactics. After Steveson's early takedown Parris countered with an escape to trail 2-1 after the first period. Steveson added another point on a quick escape in the second period before Parris slowed the pace.

A Parris escape closed the gap to 3-2 early in the third period but Steveson came back with a takedown and outscored Parris 5-2 through the final stretch.

""I made my adjustments mid-match and took him down when I needed to"" Steveson said. ""I was prepared for anything and he was prepared too. Mason is an excellent opponent. I'm happy to have someone like that to compete against.""

McKee the No. 15 seed at 125 finished off the tournament with his sixth victory in a row. He defeated No. 4 seed Drew Hildebrandt of Central Michigan 5-3 in the third-place match after pinning three of his first four opponents in the consolation bracket. He finished the season 15-7.

Lee seeded sixth at 157 finished 14-6 and earned all-America status for the second time.

Sounds like an anomaly doesn’t it? A “poor man’s banker” but that’s what thousands of disenfranchised immigrants called the gracious Amadeo Pietro Giannini.

His contemporaries referred to him as “America’s Banker.”

The son of Italian immigrants Virginia and Luigi Amadeo was born on a farm in San Jose California on May 6 1870.

At 7 he was traumatized by the murder of his father and at 14 he went to work in his stepfather’s produce business. The hardworking Giannini — who earned a partnership in the business — found success sold the company to his employees and “retired” at the young age of 31.

Giannini’s reputation as an astute and talented businessman quickly spread and he was enticed to join the Board of Directors of the Columbus Savings Loan Society a small bank in San Francisco’s Little Italy.

Mr. Giannini thrilled with the offer saw an opportunity to provide banking services to immigrants and the underprivileged. But he was too often at odds with the policies of the Board which had little interest in servicing the hardworking immigrant class so he resigned.

In 1904 he opened his own Bank of Italy directly across the street from his former employer the Columbus S&L.

Giannini intended to provide banking for “the little fellow”: the farmers merchants and laborers — many of whom were immigrants.

He visited homes of the less fortunate and convinced them it was safe to move their small savings from their mattresses to his bank.

Giannini’s banking operations took off but unfortunately in 1906 disaster struck San Francisco. The infamous earthquake disaster destroyed many of the banks including the Bank of Italy.

But Giannini was determined to continue banking especially at a time when his customers would need it most.

Borrowing a produce wagon Giannini raced to North Beach — battling the fires and rubble — and brought the bank’s valuables and records back to his home.

He set up shop in front of his house using a plank stretched across a couple of beer barrels and amid all the rubble he continued to offer loans to customers.

When some of his more destitute customers apologized for having no security as collateral he replied: “Your face is sufficient security for me!”

Giannini was a gracious practitioner but he was also a genius who revolutionized banking in the United States.

In 1909 he pioneered the concept of “branch banking” after he noticed customers traveling long distances to do business. His first of hundreds of branches was opened in San Jose. When most banks closed at 3 p.m. Giannini kept his banks open until 9 or 10 at night for workers.

In 1928 Giannini negotiated a takeover of the Bank of America and merged it with the Bank of Italy. He became Chairman of the Board and by 1945 the Bank of America was the largest bank in the United States.

He supported large and small businesses with significant financial assistance. He helped finance the construction of the Golden Gate bridge and he provided financial backing to the California wine and movie industries.

Giannini was a philanthropist of the most significant magnitude; a man of great compassion and generosity.

He gave much of his money to charitable foundations. When he died his estate was valued at a rather modest $500000. His philosophy was “personal wealth was not a priority.”

Amadeo Pietro Giannini died on June 3 1949 at the age of 79. He was a giant in the banking industry; a man of great vision and business acumen.

Proud of his Italian heritage Giannini gave extensively to Italian-American causes and to all Americans.

She has been charged with first-degree attempted robbery and assault in addition to being charged for violating the COVID-19 protocol the San Francisco District Attorney's Office told the media.

If convicted on these charges 24-year-old Arna Kimiai could face up to 16 years imprisonment and $3000 in fines. She was booked into San Francisco County Jail after surrendering to San Francisco Police on 14 March.

32-year-old Subhakar Khadka who migrated to the US from Nepal eight years ago was assaulted by three women who hailed his vehicle on March 7. Khadka released footage to a local news station on the same day and the video went viral on Instagram and Twitter.

The women were picked up by Subhakar at the intersection of San Bruno and Felton street in San Francisco. The driver stopped the ride when the women refused to wear their masks.

Drivers and passengers in the US must wear face masks as part of health rules to contain the Covid pandemic.

In the video footage Kimiai's friend Malaysia King 24 was seen shouting “I’ve got corona” while Kimiai tried to snatch Khadka's mobile phone from the dashboard of the car and pulled down his mask. The women can also be heard telling the driver: ""F*** the masks. After Khadka decided not to go ahead they exited the car and one of them sprayed pepper spray toward Subhakar. Malaysia King was arrested after the incident.

Khadka told CBS-owned channel KPIX 5 “I never said anything bad to them. I never cursed I was not raised that way. I don’t hit people I am not raised that way.”

In a statement the cab aggregator said ""Behaviour seen in the video is appalling.” Uber also suspended Kimiai from using their cabs and provided Khadka with $120 in cleaning funds."

The brand which has been solely direct-to-consumer launched with Ulta Beauty this week in select stores and online. According to founder Tina Hedges scaling her business while maintaining her zero-waste philosophy took some heavy workarounds.

“One of our challenges was how do we launch a zero-waste beauty brand in-store where your secondary packaging is so crucial to telling your story and messaging” Hedges said. “It’s not about minimizing your footprint but we didn’t want to resort to pulp shrink-wrapped in cellophane and plastic vacuum trays or any of that.”

“My attitude is always where there’s a will there’s a way. I really had so much pushback people saying ‘Why don’t we just do recycled paper packaging?’ We have a commitment to be tree-free and not just for us but for the planet” Hedges continued.

The entrepreneur found her solution at a vegan meat-substitute producer which grows mushrooms for meat alternatives. “They have an offshoot of their business which is growing the mushrooms into packaging” she said. “Then we found someone who is upcycling hemp fiber to make the paper for us to wrap the mushroom trays in. It is 100 percent worm food.”

Ulta is taking the brand’s entire line online and an assortment of stockkeeping units in 360 doors. Loli Beauty also meets all of Ulta’s Conscious Beauty criteria.

As part of the launch the brand is also launching a new product its first zero-waste waterless alcohol-free acne treatment. “We have clinicals that show it kills acne vulgaris bacteria for eight hours. So we’re going after real clinical skin conditions but from a zero-waste clean perspective” Hedges said.

The product called Arnica Elderberry Jelly All Day Mask-ne and Spot Rescue retails for $28. Industry sources estimate sales to reach between $1 million and $2 million for its first 12 months on the market.

The brand’s waste-free expansion into Ulta comes after a year of explosive growth with Hedges saying the business skyrocketed 1000 percent in 2019. She added that the brand started thinking about wholesale accounts in a meaningful way at the end of 2019 when she felt consumers were finally catching on to her brand purpose.

“Quite honestly we were a year too early in 2018” Hedges said. “The marketplace did not care about clean conscious sustainable or zero-waste beauty. We would talk about how we upcycle from organic food suppliers and whether it was editors or it was retailers no one understood it” she said.

Hedges who said that her mission is to “clean up the dirty business of beauty” launched Loli as a self-funded start-up in 2016 after time working for the Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. L’Oréal and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

In a 180-degree turn from 2020 retailers' expansion plans are outpacing plans to close up shop so far this year. U.S. retailers have announced 3199 store openings and 2548 closures year-to-date according to a tracking by Coresight Research. For comparison the firm recorded a whopping 8953 closures along with 3298 openings last year as the Covid pandemic upended the retail industry and pushed dozens of businesses into bankruptcy. Now though the country is seemingly turning a corner. The rollout of the Covid vaccine keeps ramping up another round of stimulus checks is landing in many Americans' bank accounts and companies are by and large predicting a strong rebound of the consumer. The National Retail Federation is forecasting retail sales in the U.S. could grow anywhere between 6.5% and 8.2% this year with the economy accelerating at its fastest clip in two decades. The real estate market meantime presents an opportunity in 2021 for companies looking to grow. They will likely pay less in rent and have more flexible lease terms. A glut of vacancies has left landlords more desperate to fill space and sign deals they wouldn't have ever considered pre-pandemic. ""Most retailers that survived Covid's early days are now looking to refill their new store opening programs"" said Bill Read executive vice president for Retail Specialists a brokerage firm based in the Southeast. ""Demand for new stores is very robust right now. Playing catch up has everyone in a hurry up."" Here are 10 of the retailers that have store openings planned for this year.

12-month stock performance: Up 119% Ulta Beauty is planning to open about 40 net new stores in 2021. The retailer has earmarked roughly $70 million for store openings and remodels this year. Its plans call for 11 locations to be remodeled and 10 to be relocated. When the Covid pandemic hit store openings that were slated for 2020 were postponed Ulta's management team told analysts during a conference call in early March. And as a result many of the openings now planned for 2021 are expected to happen during the first quarter it said. Beginning in the second half of this year Ulta is also rolling out a smaller version of its store in more than 100 Target locations. ""We continue to be optimistic and positive about the outlook of physical retail and we'll continue to find terrific locations across the country"" Ulta President David Kimbell said. ""We see plenty of growth ahead of us."" Kimbell is set to replace current Ulta CEO Mary Dillon when she steps down in June.

LVMH-owned Sephora says it plans to open more than 60 freestanding stores this year the majority of which won't be in malls. Separately the beauty business is on track to open some 200 pint-sized shops within Kohl's locations this fall which will ramp up to more than 850 sites by 2023. Its store strategy is focused on reducing its exposure to suburban malls and getting closer to customers in other ways. As it moves into Kohl's it's ending a years-long relationship with the department store chain J.C. Penney. Make-up sales have been walloped during the pandemic with more consumers embracing a low-maintenance and casual lifestyle but Sephora is betting that demand for cosmetics will come back strong.

Market cap: $1.531 trillion

12-month stock performance: Up 63% Amazon is quietly opening more Amazon Fresh grocery stores according to a recent Bloomberg report. Amazon Fresh debuted in Los Angeles in September. The Bloomberg report said the eleventh such store opened earlier this month and Amazon is working on at least two dozen more. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the report. Amazon which also owns the high-end Whole Foods grocery chain sees an opportunity to take over vacant real estate in order to plant itself much closer to customers. Bloomberg reported some of the Fresh shops are filling empty Toys R Us locations for example. Hundreds went dark after the toy chain filed for bankruptcy in September 2017. The Fresh stores range from 25000 square feet to 45000 square feet Bloomberg said. It's not just Amazon looking to grow either. Grocery remains a competitive category from the low-end to the high-end: Aldi Lidl Sprouts Farmers Market and Trader Joe's have all announced store openings this year as well. Dollar General  which also sells groceries plans to open 1000 stores including some with its Popshelf label.

Privately held Fabletics is planning to open two dozen new stores in the United States this year which will bring its tally to 74 by year-end. The athletic apparel brand for women (and recently men) is also planning to open stores internationally for the first time in London and Berlin. Some stores will have tech feature like a leggings fit tool and on-site demos of the Hydrow rowing machine. Fabletics has partnered with the at-home fitness equipment maker to market its products in stores and online and to be the exclusive apparel provider for Hydrow's trainers. ""One of the things that we're looking for when we open up a location is ... what's the current density of members that we have within a drive of that store"" Fabletics CEO and co-founder Adam Goldenberg said in an interview. ""We like using the retail store as a place to interact with our members and put on cool events.""

""We're very excited about the malls"" Chief Executive Jay Schottenstein said during an earnings conference call in early March. ""This is probably the best opportunity for us to pick up new locations that we're being offered ... at affordable rents for us."" Aerie's growth rate has been outpacing that of American Eagle. During the fourth quarter Aerie sales spiked 25% to $337 million from a year ago while American Eagle revenue fell 9% to $943 million.

Dick's Sporting Goods has a little more than 850 locations today according to its website. Along with its off-mall sporting goods stores the retailer operates Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream.

""We're not discouraged from opening new stores in any way but we do want to continue to be selective.""

Market cap: $80 billion

12-month stock performance: Up 60% TJX is planning to open 122 net new stores this year which would bring its total by the end of the fiscal year to almost 4700 locations. TJX's portfolio of brands includes the discount chains TJ Maxx Marshalls HomeGoods and HomeSense. Like a number of its peers the company sees an opportunity to land good real estate at a decent price thanks to industry disruption. ""With the increase in store closures by some retailers we are in an excellent position to open new stores in some of our target markets"" Chief Executive Ernie Herrman told analysts in late February. ""Further we see additional opportunities to relocate existing stores to more desirable locations and to seek out more favorable terms when leases expire."" While off-price chains like TJ Maxx and Marshalls have suffered during the pandemic due to their lack of a web presence analysts predict these businesses could see a strong rebound as Americans look to refresh their wardrobes and head back to stores to shop especially around key moments like back-to-school.

Eager to get back to “normal” life Americans went on a decade-long spending splurge buying cars and radios and stocks most for the first time ever.

Although we all know how it ended the Roaring Twenties was largely a product of pent-up demand.

This summer I believe we could see the start of a similar demand-driven economic boom as millions of Americans newly vaccinated and $1400 richer make up for lost time by booking flights and vacations going on cruises taking the family to Disney World and more.

As I shared with you earlier this month close to $18 trillion sit in Americans’ savings accounts right now—a record amount. Much of this cash is just waiting to be unleased into the U.S. economy.

Things are already heading in the right direction. According to CLSA’s proprietary reopening index the U.S. saw the biggest weekly gain since the start of the pandemic up 8% as the number of new daily infections dropped further. Here in Texas all COVID-19 restrictions were lifted 100% last on Wednesday just in time for Spring Break.

Airlines Betting on a Strong Rebound in Summer Bookings

Last week marked the one-year anniversary of the start of the pandemic and if Google Trends data is any indication Americans are ready to travel again. The number of Google queries for online travel agencies Expedia Priceline and Travelocity hit pandemic highs last week as airlines announced new deals and routes.



click to enlarge

Low-cost carriers Allegiant and Southwest recently expanded their networks to include 36 new non-stop routes in the former’s case 17 in the latter’s. According to Bloomberg this is the second-largest network expansion in Allegiant’s history and the largest for Southwest since 2013.

Across the Atlantic Lufthansa is also adding to its slate of summer destinations in anticipation of a strong rebound in bookings. Europe’s largest carrier will add around 20 new routes from Frankfurt and 13 from Munich to vacation spots such as the Caribbean Canary Islands and Greece.

Meanwhile credit card data from the end of February shows an uptick in airline booking among older Americans—those most likely to have been fully vaccinated. At a Raymond James conference the CEOs of Delta and Spirit told investors that bookings took a positive turn in mid-February.

Passenger volume in the U.S. is still down about 60% compared to pre-pandemic levels but I expect this to improve the closer we get to vacation season and as more people get their shots. Cowen aviation analyst Helane Becker who helped us launch our airlines ETFs in 2015 told Yahoo Finance that she believed the number of daily passengers would cross above 1 million by March 20. As of March 14 the number exceeded 1 million people for the fourth day straight.

American Airlines is so optimistic of a recovery in summer leisure travel that it just increased the size of its debt financing from $7.5 billion to $10 billion. The debt according to MarketWatch is underpinned by the carrier’s $20 billion AAdvantage loyalty program.

Another sign that airlines are sensing a shift in Americans’ appetite for air travel? Budget carrier Frontier filed to IPO last Monday saying that it was “well positioned to take advantage of the anticipated demand recovery as vaccine distribution continues.” Rival carrier Sun Country also provided new details for its own upcoming IPO on Monday telling investors it seeks to raise some $200 million to help pay off pandemic crisis loans from the federal government.

$15 Billion Stimulus for Airlines and Airline Contractors $8 Billion for Airports

The U.S. aviation industry is set to receive another round of fresh stimulus now that President Joe Biden has signed the $1.9 trillion rescue package.

American and United immediately dropped plans to lay off or furlough a combined 27000 workers.

Included in the bill is approximately $15 billion for airlines and airline contractors $8 billion for airports and concessionaires.



click to enlarge

As expected U.S. airline and airport trade groups were quick to praise the rescue package. Airlines for America (A4A) wrote that it’s “vital to have our employees on the job and ready to assist as our nation prepares to move forward from this crisis” while the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) said that the amount earmarked for airports “underscores the enormous financial impact that the pandemic is having on airports and the entire aviation ecosystem.”

How the Semiconductor Chip Shortage Will Contribute to Inflation

One of the anticipated consequences of economic reopening is higher inflation. Add trillions of dollars in new debt and money-printing and inflation could end up being hotter than any of us expected.

Last week the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the consumer price index (CPI) rose slightly to 1.7% year-over-year in February up from 1.4% in January.

Of the items tracked by the BLS used car and truck prices advanced the most at 9.3%. This was the sixth straight month that used vehicle prices jumped more than 9% compared to last year.

The reason for this is simple economics: Too few vehicles available for sale during the pandemic and too many buyers.



In a research report CLSA wrote that the chip shortage “should ultimately hasten electrification of the global automotive industry.” With chip supply in question automakers are shifting priority to the products highest in demand right now i.e. electric vehicles (EVs). A number of companies including Ford General Motors and Toyota have extended plant shutdowns due to limited chip availability.The price hike is likely to continue with the global shortage in semiconductor chips which are used extensively in automotive manufacturing. The “smarter” our cars and trucks get the more chips are needed.

As a result prices for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will certainly face upward pressure as fewer of them roll off factory floors.

The moral to the story? If you’re in the market for a new car or truck you might want to make a purchase sooner rather than later.

Ethereum Mining Revenue Broke Above $1 Billion for the First Time

The chip shortage has hit other industries of course including crypto mining. Demand from miners is so high right now that chipmaker Nvidia announced it will be releasing a new series of semiconductors designed specifically for mining Ethereum.

In other Ethereum-related news Coin Metrics data shows that monthly revenue generated by Ethereum miners hit a record $1.37 billion in February an incredible 1300% increase from the same month in 2020 and a 65% increase from the previous month.

Miner revenue includes inflation rewards (block subsidy) and transaction fees. Miners are paid rewards in the blockchain’s native currency for producing valid blocks and processing transactions.

This is very good news for HIVE Blockchain Technologies the only publicly traded crypto miner that mines both Bitcoin and Ethereum using 100% green energy.

Goni or Rolly as it’s known locally plowed through Luzon and affected 2.7 million people displacing 31000 and damaging or destroying 281000 homes.

Sanitation and hygiene become immediate concerns in the aftermath of a storm like this with essential water infrastructure usually damaged.

UPS customer West Point Engineering Supplies Inc. provides specialized products and solutions to essential infrastructures in the Philippines such as water energy and meteorology.

Among its list of projects is a 10-year program with the weather information services company Earth Networks and the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. They’ll collaborate to use weather monitoring sensors that provide earlier warnings for tropical storms.

For West Point Engineering speed and efficiency are essential to installing and maintaining specialized equipment like weather radar which can save lives and homes.

That’s why UPS’s recent expansion of its Worldwide Express Freight service to more postal codes in the Philippines comes as welcome news to West Point Engineering a longtime customer of UPS.

Businesses like West Point Engineering will benefit from time-guaranteed palletized shipments above 70 kilograms to more areas in the Philippines like Bulacan Mabalacat Angeles City Laguna and Batangas. The expansion allows businesses to replenish bulk inventories more easily and quickly and helps customers meet urgent sometimes life-saving delivery requirements.

“We have been a partner of UPS for over seven years” said Dennis Ziganay president and CEO of West Point Engineering. “Through this pandemic we’ve been able to meet the demands of these challenging times … thanks to UPS.”

“Exporters SMEs and longtime partners like West Point Engineering are important contributors to the local economy” said Chris Buono managing director of UPS Philippines and Indonesia. As they grow and expand we listen to their changing supply chain requirements and cater to their needs.”

“Whether it’s one of the several natural calamities that occurred in the Philippines or an ongoing pandemic UPS is putting the customer and community first by delivering what matters as they bounce back from a difficult year” Chris said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAzLTIxL2NwLXJhaWwtYWdyZWVzLXRvLWJ1eS1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1zb3V0aGVybi1mb3ItMjUtYmlsbGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CP Rail Agrees to Buy Kansas City Southern for $25 Billion,"Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion seeking to create a 20000-mile rail network linking the U.S. Mexico and Canada in the first year of those nations’ new trade alliance.

See Full Image Gallery >>



Peugeot said adieu to the United States in 1991 a few years after Renault threw in the towel here (Citroën departed after 1973 and Simca after 1971) but one French car managed to make a stand against German and Japanese sport sedans on American roads for a while in the 1980s: the Peugeot 505 Turbo. During the 505 Turbo's reign here it offered more power at a lower price than nearly all its BMW 3 Series competitors (with the notable exception of the M3) with French styling and comfort to boot. I don't find many of these cars during my junkyard explorations of recent years but this Canadian-market '85 showed up in a Denver-area yard last week.

While the 505 Turbo was plenty quick for its time I thought the 240 mph speedometer seemed a trifle optimistic. Then I realized that I was looking at kmh here which also made the odometer reading seem less impressive.

A gray-market import brought over by some Peugeot aficionado and converted to US-spec headlights at great expense? A glance at the door jamb proved otherwise; this car was originally sold in Canada then moved south at some later date. I see the occasional car that started out in Mexico or Canada in Colorado junkyards including a Chevrolet Chevy and a snowbird Civic. Gray-market French cars do show up here of course.

The 1985 BMW 325e sedan offered 121 horsepower for $21105 while your friendly Peugeot dealer offered the 505 Turbo sedan for just $18150 with this 2.2-liter engine making 150 horses (those prices come to about $52615 and $45250 respectively in 2021 dollars). Mitsubishi would sell you a new Tredia Turbo sedan with 116 horsepower for a mere $9279 that year but it had front-wheel-drive and ugly-duckling styling next to the 325e and 505.

The ashtray takes up more real-estate than just about any dash feature but you need big ash capacity when both front-seaters are chaining unfiltered Gitanes during long road trips.

An automatic transmission was available but most North American 505s got the correct five-speed manual.

All Peugeots sold in North America were far more comfortable than their competition even if reliability wasn't so great and replacement parts were hard to obtain. I had a Peugeot 504 daily-driver for a time in the early 1990s and it was a very pleasant car… when it ran.

This being Colorado owners of old Subarus are always on the lookout for Peugeot 504s and 505s in junkyards. Why? Because only rear-wheel-drive Peugeots and pre-1990s Subarus use the super-oddball 4x140mm wheel bolt pattern and the Subaru freaks have a rough time finding good aluminum wheels for their BRATs and XTs.

Story continues

This lifted mid-1980s Subaru 4WD wagon distinguished itself last summer during the Rocky Mountain Breakdown 24 Hours of Lemons Rally and its owner hastened over to the LKQ in Aurora to grab those precious wheels moments after I broadcast their existence to the local Lemons community. Fortunately they are the 15"" diameter type and not the no-tires-available TRX size that went on some 505s.

You'll find one in every car. You'll see.

Norov has just had a consultation with a mobile health team from the sub-provincial health centre which visits herder communities in their own homes.



The mobile health team screens herders and their families for communicable and non-communicable diseases signs of cholesterol and sugar in their blood and they offer ultrasounds for women. One month ago through this service Norov was diagnosed with gallbladder and kidney problems and was referred to the nearest local (sub-province or soum) health centre where a specialist gave him the medicines he needed.

I know that health is wealth and that I need to make healthy living choices now irrespective of financial challenges” said Norov.



With a vast land area Mongolia faces many challenges in delivering health services to its citizens especially those living in disadvantaged and remote rural areas including vulnerable and nomadic populations migrants and unregistered people.



From 2016-2020 the government operated an initiative called: ‘Expanding use of mobile health technology in primary health care (PHC) towards universal health coverage in Mongolia’ or M-Health. It was supported by WHO through the UHC Partnership and the Korea Foundation for International Health Care and Community Chest of Korea.



Mongolia is among the 115 countries and areas to which the UHC Partnership helps deliver WHO support and technical expertise in advancing universal health coverage (UHC). The Partnership is funded by the European Union (EU) the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Irish Aid the Government of Japan the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs the United Kingdom – Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office and Belgium.



Reaching remote groups through mobile health



The Mongolian State Policy on Health (2017-2026) identifies the “need to expand the use of mobile service and technologies at the primary health care level to better reach out to target groups such as people in remote areas and the poor and vulnerable populations”.



The M-Health initiative is now being implemented in 21 provinces across Mongolia and 9 districts in Ulaanbaatar City.



As part of the initiative PHC providers conduct integrated health services through three types of service delivery: home visits mobile health services combined with home visits and health centre services. All these include health examinations screening and health promotion activities related to maternal and child health communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases. Mobile health services in combination with home visits are mostly used to reach disadvantaged communities including herders migrants and low-income groups.



The Government of Mongolia along with local governments recognized the value and cost-effectiveness of reaching remote and disadvantaged populations. As a result since 2016 this initiative has been expanded to another 121 local areas supported mostly by local governments and a few of them supported by development partners and private companies. In 2021 in order to maintain essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond WHO has been continuously providing support in other 63 remote areas.



Primary health care and universal health coverage



Many health issues as well as COVID-19 have the gravest impact on people who are socially economically or geographically disadvantaged. Addressing equity and reaching those most in need of health services requires a strong focus on PHC for UHC as a response to current and future health challenges. The UHC Partnership will continue to support the government with the expansion of telemedicine mobile services and mobile and portable technologies at the PHC level including rapid COVID-19 tests as a cost-effective measure. The Partnership will also support the strengthening of multisectoral collaboration to address health for all policies.

Montserrat is a territory of the United Kingdom residing in the eastern Caribbean. According to the United Nations about 5375 people live in Montserrat. Poverty plagues the territory. Thus the need for adequate healthcare in Montserrat is more evident than ever.

Poverty in Montserrat

According to the Country Poverty Assessment about 36% of Montserrat’s population falls below the poverty line. Additionally a third of those living in poverty are under 15 years of age. Henceforth children in Montserrat fall victim to the harshest reality of poverty. Moreover about 10% of Montserrat citizens living in poverty are above 30 years of age. Montserrat’s National Sustainable Development Plan of 2008-2020 is the key to advancing the development within the territory. This development has enriched the economy and improved living conditions for citizens.

The Necessity of Universal Healthcare

In October 2020 the need to implement universal healthcare was evident. John Allen spoke at a Financial Informational Month Symposium. He implored that universal healthcare is key to maintaining every citizen’s health. Poverty consumes the majority of the population. Thus the high price tag on healthcare services limits people’s ability to seek help.

Illnesses accounted for the top three leading causes of death for children ages 5 and younger in 2010. There were 601 cases of acute respiratory infections 132 cases of influenza and 94 cases of gastroenteritis. Furthermore a large portion of children is at risk of being underweight overweight and obese. About 28.4% of adolescents suffered from anemia as well. In addition about 12.5% of all childbirths were from adolescent pregnancies from 2006 to 2010. Adults are hospitalized primarily due to obstetrics delivery urinary tract infections influenza diabetes gastroenteritis and hypertension. The elderly population particularly suffers from hypertension and diabetes. Although communicable diseases have received effective treatment diseases such as HIV/AIDS are still prevalent. On the other hand chronic diseases such as malignant neoplasms diabetes and hypertension continue to be a major concern for Montserratians.

Sustainable Development Plan 2008-2020

About 9.4% of Montserrat’s general revenue goes into the Ministry of Health and Social Services. The Sustainable Development Plan also contributes to accelerating Montserrat’s economic development. This plan aims to implement short-term goals every five years. The framework of these policies includes at least one of the following: economic management human development environmental management and disaster mitigation governance and population.

Today Montserrat is focusing on the Medium Term Economic Policy for 2017-2021. The Medium Term Economic Policy’s mission statement is to foster sustainable growth with benefits for all. The goal of this policy is to reduce Montserrat’s dependence on the United Kingdom by building upon its local economy. Utilizing these economic growth strategies helps the economy recover from disasters such as volcanic eruptions.

While Montserrat’s current primary healthcare system is effective individuals who seek secondary care struggle to locate such services. Unfortunately only one hospital in Montserrat offers secondary and tertiary healthcare services. The Ministry of Health and Social Services set a goal to lower the cost of secondary and tertiary healthcare services by 2020. Additionally full-time university students senior citizens children under 16 years of age multifarious public servants and prisoners receive protection the 2002 Public Health Act. Thus they are exempt from paying healthcare bills. Also the Civil Service Association Health Insurance plan covers families of public servants.

Developing New Hospitals

In February 2020 the government signed a contract joining Article 25 an international architectural organization that is based in the United Kingdom. Montserrat has set architectural advancements in motion to improve hospitals. Furthermore the government stated that Montserrat has become globally competitive in the market of medical technology and supplies. The Ministry of Health and Social Services oversees new designs for hospitals based on health facility architecture portfolios located within Article 25.

The New National Hospital Project of Montserrat began construction in late 2020. New healthcare initiatives are bringing the hope of better health and economic growth to those living in poverty. As a result of government action and organizations’ outreach healthcare in Montserrat is improving steadily.

It is not an uncommon sight to see naked or half-clothed persons roaming the streets of villages towns and cities in Nigeria. Commonly called ‘Ototolo’ (madmen) by the Ugep people of Cross River State they live on and eat off the streets and generally display bizarre behaviour. No one knows how they got to be this way but public opinion is usually that their condition is incurable and so they are sentenced to life on the streets until the day they die or disappear.

This is the face of mental illness that most Nigerians see and this forms many people’s perception of what mental illness is.

We often fail to see the ones who appear to be living normal lives but in fact are struggling with mental illnesses so devastating yet invisible that if left untreated could be fatal.

What is Mental Health?

Mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in emotion thinking or behaviour or a combination of all. They are behavioural or mental patterns that cause significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Such behaviour may be persistent relapsing or occur as a single episode.

I remember George (not real name) a distant relative and a regular playmate each time we visited the village for the holidays. At 11 years he started acting strangely and family and friends convinced his mother that it was simply a “spiritual attack” that could be taken care of in a church. The closest psychiatric hospital was 124 km away and even if she wanted to I don’t think she had the means to make that journey. So she took George from church to prayer house in a desperate bid to fix him. I don’t know the entirety of all that she did because I was a child. But I do know that his condition did not improve and eventually she gave up. Years passed and while the rest of us grew up and moved on she kept George locked in her 2-bedroom apartment and would only let him out late at night.

Mental health is defined as a state of well-being in which every individual realises his or her potential can cope with the normal stresses of life can work productively and fruitfully and can contribute to his or her community. The priority placed on mental health is underscored in the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) definition of health in its constitution: “Health is a state of complete physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”



Nigeria’s outdated mental health laws

Mental health has historically been neglected in Nigeria’s health and development policy agenda. The Regional Lunacy Law of 1958 the only law remotely connected to mental health in Nigeria perceives all mental health issues as madness; there is no mention of prevention promotion and treatment. The name of the law is in itself derogatory to people with mental illness. In addition its components promote stigma by retaining discriminatory terms and criminalises attempted suicide among other things.

Nigeria’s only existing Mental Health Policy document was formulated in 1991. In 2003 a bill for the establishment of a Mental Health Act was introduced. It was withdrawn in 2009 and re-introduced in 2013 but was not passed. In 2019 Senator Ibrahim Oloriegbe Chairman Senate Committee on Health sponsored a ‘Mental Health and Substance Abuse’ Bill. The bill passed through the third reading in December 2020. Currently it is unclear whether the bill is at the harmonisation or assent stage. However if the bill becomes law it will make provision for adequate budgetary allocations for mental health facilities and service providers which will be a step forward for mental health provision in Nigeria.

Insuring mental health services

Universal Health Coverage (UHC) means that all people have access to the health services they need without the risk of financial hardship when paying for them but according to Dr. Ubong Etudoh a Consultant Psychiatrist in Abuja most people with mental illness in Nigeria don’t get access to care and one of the reasons is cost. “People that have chronic mental health issues are in and out of the hospital quite often. The social and economic loss is quite high and a lot of them might not be able to afford it” he said.

Edward (not real name) a finance executive who recently had to seek mental health services for his ailing relative readily agrees. Most hospitals don’t advertise mental health services so at first he didn’t know where to go. He approached a private facility but when they gave him a bill of 2 million naira for a 3-month stay he had to look around for cheaper alternatives. He finally found a government-owned hospital in Karu Abuja which came highly recommended. Although he can pay the required costs because he has some disposable income and help from family he noted that “Somebody who is not very strong financially and who is managing the case alone would need the support of health insurance to make sure that the cost does not discourage the person from accessing the required care”.

Edward has a good health insurance plan and early in his search he reached out to the health maintenance organisation (HMO) under which his organisation is registered expecting that their services included mental health. However he was told that they did not have any hospital that offers mental health services on their list.

This piqued my interest and so I decided to do a little digging. I randomly selected and called up five HMOs in five different cities in Nigeria to enquire about coverage for mental health services. None provided coverage. Likewise according to Dr. Etudoh there are several mental health services that are not covered by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). A look at the NHIS benefit package in the NHIS Membership Handbook reveals that drug abuse/addiction is listed under conditions that are excluded from the benefits package of the NHIS; while it is not clear exactly how well other mental health conditions are covered.

No UHC without Mental Health

We could play the ostrich and bury our heads in the sand but the truth is with the insecurity and conflicts happening in different parts of the country as well as increasing substance abuse the number of people living with mental health challenges is growing daily. We may not have the exact numbers in Nigeria but global statistics have revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic and social effects are taking a particularly hard toll on many people’s mental health and aggravating the conditions of people already suffering from mental illness and substance use disorders.

In 2019 the WHO launched the Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019–2023): Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health. This Initiative will advance mental health policies advocacy and human rights and scale up quality interventions and services for individuals with mental health conditions including substance use and neurological disorders. The core goal is that by 2023 100 million more people in the world will be able to access affordable quality mental health services at community level.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director-General of the WHO said “The world is accepting the concept of universal health coverage. Mental health must be an integral part of UHC. Nobody should be denied access to mental health care because she or he is poor or lives in a remote place.” Therefore every country must make sure that care for mental neurological and substance use disorders is included in health care benefit packages and insurance schemes.

Dr. Etudoh confirmed that there are only about 200 practicing psychiatrists in Nigeria. For a nation of 200 million people this means that there is roughly one psychiatrist for every 1 million citizens. We cannot successfully improve access to healthcare without first building human resource capacity to deliver mental health and social care. We need more psychiatrist nurses psychologists social workers and occupational therapists.

Despite the large population resources for mental health remain scarce and overconcentrated in urban areas and these facilities are overstretched. Investing in primary healthcare centres to ensure that they can provide prompt diagnosis treatment and referral of people with mental disorders can help reduce the burden on facilities in urban areas.

Nigeria is also way overdue for a new mental health bill. The new bill must contain vital components that clearly address important issues such as fundamental rights of people who are mentally ill regulations for mental health insurance coverage to improve financial protection proper funding of mental health facilities and compliance with WHO recommendations for mental health and substance abuse.

The last time I saw George was nine years ago he is now about 35 years old and is still confined to his mother’s rooms. It is for him and for every one of us that we must continue to promote the inclusion of mental health care in universal health coverage to ensure that we all have access to quality mental health care that is safe effective timely efficient equitable and people-centred.



At the time of publication it came to our notice that Dr. Ubong Etudoh passed away suddenly. The interview with him was done two weeks ago. We at Nigeria Health Watch commiserate with his family and friends during this difficult time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vcGliLmdvdi5pbi9QcmVzc1JlbGVhc2VJZnJhbWVQYWdlLmFzcHg_UFJJRD0xNzA2Mzgx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India has crossed a Key Milestone in Universal Primary Healthcare,"Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

India has crossed a Key Milestone in Universal Primary Healthcare



Target of Operationalizing 70000 Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) achieved Ahead of Time



About 41.35 crore people have accessed primary healthcare services at the AB-HWCs



More than 9.45 lakh Tele-consultations done at the HWCs





India marked another key milestone in universalising Primary Health Care today. The planned target of operationalizing 70000 Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) by 31st March 2021 has been realised ahead of time.

The feat of scaling up at this pace despite the COVID pandemic was enabled by a high degree of coordination between the Centre and States/UTs foresight in planning flexibility in adaptation standardization of processes and regular interactions at all levels which enabled supportive monitoring and prompt redressal of issues. This is testimony to the process of effective decentralization and cooperative federalism.

Health and wellness centre UPHC Seikhazou Kohima

The launch of Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWC) in April 2018 marked a watershed moment in India’s public health history. By December 2022 150000 Sub-Health Centres and Primary Health Centres in urban and rural areas were targeted to be transformed to AB-HWCs and deliver comprehensive primary health care that includes preventive and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care and which is universal free and close to community in rural and urban areas with focus also on wellness. This mission mode approach also aimed at realising India’s vision of Universal Health Coverage.

Addition of a new cadre of workforce a trained non-physician health worker with BSc Nursing/BAMS qualification designated as Community Health Officer (CHO) leads the Sub-Health Centre AB-HWC’s primary care team of health workers and AHSAs.

Besides expanding and strengthening the existing Reproductive and Child Health (RMNCHA+N) services and Communicable Diseases services the functional AB-HWCs provide services related to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) (screening and management for NCDs such as Hypertension Diabetes and 3 common cancers of Oral Breast and Cervix) and incrementallyadding other primary healthcare services for mental health ENT Ophthalmology oral health geriatric and palliative health care and trauma care etc.

Essential diagnostics list expanded to complement all CPHC services to be provided as point of care or hub and spoke services. HSC-HWCs: existing 7 to 14 tests PHC-HWCs: existing 19 to 63 tests

List of Essential Medicines has been expanded at all SHC and PHC AB-HWCs and the same is being supported under National Free Drugs Service Initiative of National Health Mission to ensure uninterrupted supply of drugs to patients including for treatment for Hypertension and Diabetes SHC-HWCs: from existing 57 to 105 medicines PHC-HWCs: from existing 232 to 172 medicines



MCH services in HWCs in Ranchi Jharkhand

HWCs demonstrate a high potential for positive outcomes in terms of gender equity for care seeking and promoting wellness as a critical component of primary health care. To date about 41.35 crore people have accessed care in these AB-HWCs. About 54% of them are women.

NCD screening HWC Gadadih Chhattisgarh

The HWCs also focus on wellness and healthy lifestyles through various activities. So far these Centres have conducted 64.4 lakhs wellness sessions. Depending on the local context States are undertaking various wellness activities including Yoga local sports Zumba (in NE States) etc. These centres also follow a calendar of 39 health promotion days spread over a year.

Geriatric care services in HWC in Mizoram

Preventive Health Care is the essential component of the services delivered through HWCs. Population enumeration of 30yrs+ population through Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC) is done through community health workers (ASHA and ANMs) and based on risk stratification the screening of the individuals for NCDs have been carried out. The identified individuals with the chronic conditions are put on treatment with necessary follow-up. So far 9.1 crore screenings for Hypertension 7.4 crores screenings for Diabetes 4.7 crore screenings for oral cancer 2.4 crores screenings for Breast Cancer in women and 1.7 crore screenings for cervical cancer in women have been done.

Breast Cancer Counselling In HWC in Ranchi Jharkhand

Tele-consultation services are another key component of the HWCs. More than 9.45 lakh Teleconsultations have been done at the HWCs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic AB-HWCs played a significant role in undertaking public health action related to COVID prevention and enabling non-COVID essential health services. About 75% of total NCD Screenings have been conducted during this COVID period (between 1st February 2020 to till date) itself showing the confidence reposed by people in these AB-HWCs during the present public health challenge.

More than 60% of team leaders (CHOs and Medical Officers) and more than 90% of field workers of HWC teams are women. This is a testimony to a gender sensitive approach to healthcare.Community ownership and community management of these Centres are envisaged through the institutional mechanism of Jan Arogya Samitis (JASs) and JAS are being formed at all functional AB-HWCs to enable accountability of the health care teams.

AB-HWCs are proving to be a pivotal force for India’s Health Systems. The quantum of services delivered and the pace of implementation inspire confidence that the programme is on track to realize the vision to deliver affordable Comprehensive Primary Health Care services closer to people.

Expanded Service Packages provided under AB-HWC are as follows:

Care in Pregnancy and Child Birth. Neonatal and Infant health care services. Childhood and Adolescent health care services. Family planning contraceptive services and other reproductive health care services Management of communicable diseases: National Health programmes General out-patient care for acute simple illnesses and minor ailments Screening prevention control and management of non-communicable diseases and chronic communicable diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy Basic oral health care Screening and basic management of mental Health ailments Care for common ophthalmic and ENT problem Elderly and palliative health care services Emergency medical services including burns and trauma.

De acuerdo al periodista y economista Alberto Aguilar la empresa de bebidas energéticas estaría interesada en ampliar su mundo deportivo a otro equipo de América y Necaxa sería su próximo objetivo. Así lo dio a conocer durante el programa “Primera Emisión”.

Asimismo el periodista señaló que el actual presidente del equipo Ernesto Tinajero ya estableció algunas pláticas con dicha empresa para la venta del equipo en meses próximos. Sin embargo nada está confirmado aún pues según información de René Tovar editor general de ESPN fuentes cercanas a los Rayos del Necaxa negaron las versiones de que existieran negociaciones con Red Bull para una posible compra.

En 2014 un grupo de inversionistas encabezados por Ernesto Tinajero y Guillermo Cantú concretaron el acuerdo con Televisa para adquirir al equipo de los Rayos pues meses atrás se acordó la transacción que debía ser aprobada por el Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones.

Desde aquella nueva etapa los hidrocálidos que se encontraban en el extinto Ascenso MX ascendieron al máximo circuito en la Temporada 2015-16 y ganaron la Copa MX del Clausura 2018 así como la Supercopa MX de la campaña 2017-18.

La reconocida marca de bebidas energéticas tiene vínculos importantes en el patrocinio de deportes extremos como lo es el caso de la Fórmula 1. Sin embargo su vinculación con el mundo de futbol debe reconocerse. Uno de los más destacados es con el equipo RB Leipzig que ha llegado a clasificar en la Champions League. Además la empresa es dueña de cuatro equipos en diversos puntos del planeta que se ubican en Nueva York Salzburgo Leipzig y Brasil.

La marca del toro rojo tiene presencia en el mundo del futbol dentro de la Bundesliga MLS así como en Austria y Brasil por lo que dio pie a los rumores de un posible tercer equipo en el continente americano.

Red Bull entró por primera vez en el fútbol profesional cuando adquirió todas las acciones de un equipo en Austria el SV Austria Salzburgo. El cambio a FC Red Bull Salzburg benefició en gran manera al equipo ya que con la inversión y los cambios que se avecinaron para el equipo de 2005 a 2014 nunca acabó los torneos por debajo del segundo puesto. Y a la fecha desde 2005 ha quedado seis veces campeón. En la temporada actual se encuentra en segundo lugar por lo tanto calificado a la Copa de Europa.

Tiempo después en 2006 fueron por la MLS por los New York Red Bulls. No fue un camino sencillo para el equipo sin embargo poco después consiguieron dos títulos de liga de la conferencia Este de la MLS.

Asimismo fue en la temporada de 2015 que Red Bull Brasil subió a la máxima categoría de la Liga Paulista llegando hasta la ronda de cuartos de final donde fue derrotado por marcador de 3 - 0 con el histórico Sao Paulo.

Por otro lado en 2008 la empresa austriaca creó en la ciudad de Sogakope el Red Bull Ghana. El objetivo de la entidad era desarrollar una academia de fútbol en el país para potenciar el deporte en la región. En 2014 gran parte de la propiedad fue traspasada a la West African Football Academy SC la academia del Feyenoord de Róterdam en Ghana.

En estos d�as el ciento de jocotes se puede comprar a $1.50 y $2 seg�n relata do�a Marisol Hern�ndez quien comercializa esta fruta de temporada que se cosecha en San Lorenzo en Ahuachap�n y Santa Ana.

Para la pr�xima semana espera un incremento de ventas por las personas que compran la fruta para los tradicionales dulces.

“En estos d�as se venden unos 2000 jocotes a diario y ya en Semana Santa que baja el precio la gente compra m�s” dice la comerciante.

El mango saz�n que tambi�n buscan los salvadore�os para preparar en miel se vende entre $1.5 y $2 las 25 unidades y se est� vendiendo a buen ritmo con uno o dos sacos al d�a.

Para Hern�ndez este a�o al igual que el anterior a pesar de la pandemia el movimiento de la fruta de temporada ha sido favorable.

“No me puedo quejar porque en la cuarentena se vend�a quiz�s porque no hab�a mucha competencia afuera del mercado” dijo la vendedora que viaja todos los d�as para estar desde la madrugada en el Mercado Central.

Para do�a Vilma Delgado quien comercializa jocote en las afueras del mercado la venta de la fruta tambi�n ha sido relativamente favorable.

“Agarramos unas 10 o 12 javas a diario y se venden casi todas. Ya esta semana que viene se comienzan a vender unas 20 25 javas para los jocotes en miel” relata la vendedora.

ADEMÁS: El jocote Bar�n Rojo genera decenas de empleos en Ahuachap�n

En San Lorenzo hay un aproximado de 400 productores que trabajan unas 1000 manzanas de jocote.

El a�o pasado en medio de la pandemia productores de jocote de la zona de San Lorenzo tuvieron que botar su producci�n porque no hab�a demanda.

El mango est� entre $8 y $5 el ciento y los 25 mangos a $1.50 detalla la mujer que comienza su jornada a las 4:30 a.m. y se retira a la 1:30 p.m.

Para Janeth Cort�z quien viaja desde Sonsonate para vender fruta en las afueras del mercado la comercializaci�n no han sido del todo din�mica pues en estos d�as comercializa unos mil jocotes. “La otra semana que ya las personas comiencen a hacer la fruta en miel podr�a aumentar la venta” augur� Cort�z.

Esta comerciante dice que el mango se est� vendiendo menos con precios de $2 las cinco manos y el ciento entres $6 y $8.

Para Janeth el bajo consumo de estas frutas obedece a que los ni�os no est�n yendo a las escuelas y ese es uno de los principales mercados para estas frutas de temporada.

“Como los ni�os no est�n estudiando se est� vendiendo poco. Cuando ellos van a las escuelas esta fruta se va r�pido” dice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvYmJ5Y29uc29sYXMuY29tL25vdGljaWFzL3ZlbnRhcy1jeWJlcnB1bmstMjA3Ny1jb250aW51YW4tYmFqYS1uby1waW50YW4tYmllbi1tYXJ6by04MzM0NDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las ventas de Cyberpunk 2077 continúan a la baja y no pintan bien en marzo,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.hobbyconsolas.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Stonehill Taylor worked alongside Snøhetta for the Graduate Hotel serving as the architect of record. The Graduate Hotel and the Verizon Tech Center properties are the final pieces of the Skidmore Owings & Merrill-designed Cornell Tech master plan which was developed by Hudson Companies Related Companies and Brookfield and rises south of the Queensboro Bridge’s central span. Architectural Precast Innovations (API) was the concrete partner on the two buildings.

Photographs looking at the two architecturally contrasting façades show the difference in building materials shapes and mixtures of sharp and curved corners.

The rooftop terrace on the top of the Graduate Hotel is situated below the subtly sloped roof parapet and will give panoramic views of the East River Queens Brooklyn and Manhattan.

A strip of floor-to-ceiling windows is located on the northwestern corner of the structure and will provide occupants unobstructed views of the Queensboro Bridge stretching into Midtown.

A plaza surrounds both Snohetta edifices. The main exterior of Verizon Executive Education Center features a mixture of glass and wooden louvers that start out completely closed on the eastern end and gradually open toward the western elevation allowing for sunlight to pass through. Inside are rooms for academic conferences executive programs seminars and workshops.

While Yahoo already has affiliate links in much of its content which guides customers to the likes of Amazon and Walmart to complete a sale its new venture Yahoo Shops set to launch later this year will be its own marketplace managing the entire purchase journey from beginning to end.

More from WWD

“It will be the first digital media marketplace anywhere with its own capabilities. We don’t see anybody doing that” said Andrea Wasserman head of global commerce at Verizon Media which has owned Yahoo since 2017.

“There’s so much indication already that consumers want to be shopping with us. They tell us that they trust us they vote with their dollars by clicking or tapping on our affiliate links and buying with the merchants that we send them to” she continued. “So when we thought about what is the logical next step for us it really is taking our position as a digital media company and bridging that with native commerce capabilities.”

At its launch Yahoo Shops will have about 50 brands including Woo Skin Essentials by Projectwoo Golden Secrets and Act + Acre but Wasserman is confident that it can quickly grow to hundreds and then thousands. She has also pledged that at least 15 percent of merchants will be Black-owned businesses with plans to increase inclusion of other underrepresented groups in retail.

As for how the site will work she explained that users will be able to directly purchase products featured in reviews editorial roundups and shoppable video while there will also be 3D try-ons. And later this year Yahoo Shops will connect with a universal shopping cart across all of its platforms from Engadget to Yahoo Sports.

“Eventually Yahoo Shops will connect the Yahoo ecosystem with a universal shopping cart. Say you’re reading about the best back to school gear on Yahoo Life you can add a product from that curated list to your shopping cart click onto another story and so on. Users will be directed back to Yahoo Shops for check-out” added Wasserman.

The launch of Yahoo Shops comes as parent company Verizon Media has premiered an expansion of its In The Know shopping network with ITK Parenting and ITK Cooking. According to its own data since 2020 Verizon has driven sales value for merchandise sold through content commerce Yahoo Mail inbox shopping and more by 213 percent.

The editor has a question for all the TSB-reading technology innovators implementers and investors: Why is it 2021 and we’re still having to do THIS with our TV’s? Picture-in-picture was an ‘80’s phenomenon. After 40 years we’re still hauling in the old set from the kids room and setting it up on a TV tray? The collective wisdom of TSB readers has got to be able to put together something better. It’s only 5 months ‘til football season …

Meanwhile there’s still a lot to cover from the analyst days held the week before last. Our focus this week will be on the “elephant in the room” for each wireless carrier.

A final editorial note: Like many of you we will be taking a break for the Easter holiday (in two weeks). We will publish a “videos to watch” article on the Sunday Brief website in lieu of a mailing.

The week that was

This word to describe this week’s activity is “sideways.” Apple lost $17 billion in market capitalization (on more than $2.1 trillion in total value) despite an encouraging leak on their upcoming tablet releases (more on that from Bloomberg here). Microsoft lost $41 billion in market capitalization this week Amazon lost $8 billion and Google lost $13 billion. Offsetting this was an economic recovery-driven pop at Facebook (+$62 billion). Overall the Fab Five lost $16 billion for the week and has added a mere $12 billion to last year’s $2.57 trillion gain. Sideways never looked so good.

The Telco Top Five started to slip last week driven by T-Mobile (-$3 billion) and Comcast (-$8 billion). Verizon continues to recover as the “an extra $53 billion in debt isn’t as bad as it first looks” theme proliferates. T-Mobile had the biggest announcement this week on Wednesday signing up Pandora/ Sirius XM for exclusive musical content and ad-free weekend offerings for the Magenta faithful who redeem the code through the T-Mobile Tuesdays app. For those of you who have lost count this now brings T-Mobile’s business and consumer content suppliers to seven: Netflix Pandora/ Sirius XM Dialpad Microsoft 365 Apple TV+ (TVision) Amazon Prime (Metro by T-Mobile) and Google One (Metro by T-Mobile). See the nearby slide for a comparison to AT&T and Verizon’s offerings.

The biggest news of the week however involves one company from the Fab Five and the Telco Top Five. On Friday Comcast announced that they (including streaming over Peacock) had retained the NFL Sunday Night slot for the next 11 seasons (through 2033). NBC Sports will also broadcast four of the next thirteen Super Bowls. While no figures have been released Bloomberg estimates it cost NBC around $2 billion annually for the rights to broadcast the #1 Primetime show.

Amazon who announced Wednesday that they would be expanding their Amazon Care program nationally (and increasing coverage beyond Amazon employees to other companies) made news on Thursday when they landed exclusive rights to the Thursday Night football slot (announcement here). The impact to the NFL Network (Amazon’s previous simulcast partner) is yet to be seen. Bloomberg estimates in the link above that Amazon paid around $1 billion per year (with 126 million US Amazon Prime members that amounts to ~$8 per subscriber per year before any advertisement offsets). Comcast Fox ViacomCBS and Amazon set a high bar for AT&T’s DirecTV unit who has yet to announce an extension.

Speaking of AT&T they noticed customers this week that smartphone data consumed by HBO Max will be counted toward data limits starting next Thursday (CNBC article here). The change is driven by California’s Net Neutrality law which went into effect after CTIA/ NCTA/ US Telecom lost their challenge to the ruling. From AT&T’s statement:

“We regret the inconvenience to customers caused by California’s new “net neutrality” law. Given that the Internet does not recognize state borders the new law not only ends our ability to offer California customers such free data services but also similarly impacts our customers in states beyond California.

A state-by-state approach to “net neutrality” is unworkable. A patchwork of state regulations many of them overly restrictive creates roadblocks to creative and pro-consumer solutions. We have long been committed to the principles of an open Internet. We deliver the content and services our customers want because it’s what they demand not because it’s mandated by regulation. We also believe Internet access should be available and sustainably affordable to all Americans and strongly advocate for Congress to adopt federal legislation to make that possible while providing clear consistent and permanent net neutrality rules for everyone to follow.”

It’s unclear how many customers are going to be impacted by this change as their Unlimited Elite plans offer 100 GB of “premium data” while their Unlimited Extra plans include 50 GB. Our estimate is that 1-2% of the HBO Max base is impacted. Regardless having to notify customers of a perk removal is not pleasant. And blaming California infuriated our friends at Ars Technica who published a scathing critique of AT&T’s actions.

Perhaps this lights a fire under Congress for legislation. Then again…

The elephant in the room (Analyst Day analysis part two)

Last week’s Brief was chock full of information: 7.5 hours of presentations provide plenty of content but leaves little room for analysis. As we frequently discuss with respect to quarterly earnings calls it’s important to consider what’s not being discussed in addition to the key takeaways. This week we will look at those “elephants in the room” (each telecommunications carrier has at least one) and suggest ways management can address them.

AT&T’s Elephant: Balance Sheet Obligations

As we discussed last week AT&T did a good job of presenting a lot of information in two hours. While some were surprised that wireless did not get more airtime (and HBO Max did) we think AT&T chose to strike a “balanced portfolio” theme versus pursuing one that was wireless-centric.

If AT&T were to deploy fiber to three million homes this year and achieve the lowest monthly postpaid churn in the wireless industry and launch HBO Max globally to rave reviews and have a few blockbuster theatrical surprises then the balance sheet would be strong. Cash would be plentiful and deleveraging could accelerate. If any one of these initiatives fails to meet management’s lofty objectives however there’s little “wiggle room” to take on debt or other obligations.

The schedule from AT&T’s 10-K paints the picture (we have included footnotes as well):

AT&T’s total obligations including the additional $27 billion in debt needed to pay for C-Band licenses and the receipt of funds from TPG in the DirecTV transaction will likely eclipse $450 billion dollars. About $100 billion of that is due in the next three years. Even when weighed against cash flow from operations (CFFO) expectations of around $140 billion for 2021-2024 (~$47 billion per year) and assuming dividends stay intact ($45 billion over three years) there’s not a lot of room to maneuver. Everything has to go right assuming AT&T keeps their dividend flat and also retains an investment grade rating (currently rated by S&P as BBB two notches from junk status).

We do not mean to imply that AT&T is flirting with insolvency – they have very strong cash flows and should be able to re-term and roll over debt as they execute on their plan. But any ambitions beyond local fiber HBO Max and C-Band are going to be put on hold. And if T-Mobile or Dish or cable disrupts the competitive landscape operating cash flows will suffer.

Bottom line: AT&T has a lot of assets but must execute on all fronts to meet their obligations. The sizes and due dates of those obligations are the elephants in the room.

Verizon’s elephant: T-Mobile’s network superiority

While many of you think “Obligations” should also be the elephant in the room for Big Red we think it’s slightly worse for Ma Bell (Verizon’s total obligations equal $258 billion per their 10-K before C-Band debt and $70 billion is due in the next three years. Verizon should also generate ~$120-130 billion in CFFO over that period and have $30-33 billion in dividend payments. Still tight but more room to maneuver than AT&T). And assuming the TracFone transaction is completed they will have ~$1 billion in additional CFFO generation.

The elephant in the room for Verizon is that their reign as undisputed network champ is ending. As we are seeing in the RootMetrics RootScore Reports for most metros (the first 43 market results are shown in the nearby table) it’s just as likely that AT&T wins and 3x more likely that the metro ends in a tie. And while T-Mobile does not have any outright wins today (only five ties) they have just begun to deploy their 600 MHz/ 2500 MHz carrier aggregated 5G network. We will be especially interested to see how one of their earlier 5G markets (Philadelphia) helps T-Mobile versus Verizon.

There appears to be corroborating evidence to support T-Mobile’s ascent. OpenSignal released their 5G rankings in January and crowned T-Mobile the winner in upload speed download speed and availability (see here). T-Mobile also scored well in OpenSignal’s state-by-state rankings. Ookla weighed in a few weeks ago as well with AT&T winning the overall download speed (Verizon fourth behind legacy Sprint) and T-Mobile winning latency availability and 5G time spent. Many of you have requested spending a portion of one Brief explaining the differences between various testing company methodologies but the bottom line is that Verizon’s 4G championship is not extending into 5G.

Short-term (until C-Band arrives) disadvantages can be overcome with additional retention incentives (including content bundling) and more advertising. But what if T-Mobile’s Clearwire Band (their flavor of C-Band) is better than Verizon’s new network? This is why there was a lot of discussion of these two slides over the past week:

In their analyst day presenttion Verizon made the argument that because of power limitations imposed for 2.5 GHz spectrum (relative to C-Band) T-Mobile would have no advantage whatsoever (left side of the picture). Verizon also made the argument (as did several industry analysts) that Verizon already has a lot of cell site density in many metropolitan areas today and that deploying C-Band would not leave coverage gaps (Mike Dano has a great article in Light Reading on this here if you want to read more).

T-Mobile countered Verizon’s argument quite effectively arguing that they are going to use their low-band (600 MHz) as the uplink and that this would create an additional 30% range extension for their 2.5 GHz. They also indicated that they plan to deploy this nationwide using their arsenal of ~85000 cell sites. They committed to over 200 million POPs of coverage with this new configuration by the end of thie year (just as Verizon is receiving their C-Band licenses).

Bottom line: If Verizon cannot claim undisputed network performance as their competitive differentiator then their ambitions to charge more for their services (see last week’s article about the critical importance of growing ARPU/ ARPA to meet deleveraging targets) are going to be challenged. Without network and engineering superiority Verizon will need a new corporate identity (“We’re #1 in a tie” won’t cut it).

T-Mobile’s elephant: Credibility

Having watched the T-Mobile Analyst day three times there aren’t a lot of gaps. We mentioned a possible chink in the armor last week (lack of a cohesive fiber/ transport strategy) but there’s an easily identified remedy for that – develop and execute one! Identify the clusters of towers where T-Mobile should own and manage connectivity and build local operations teams. That would cement low-cost superiority (when spectrum costs are included).

We aren’t quite sure that Mike Katz’s reply to a question where he basically said “We can still win wireless deals without wireline – they are two separate contracts” is completely accurate but can give him the benefit of the doubt that they will win enough wireless to meet their market share goals without owning and operating the fiber connection to the factory or headquarters.

Mentioned time and again throughout the presentation were the phrases “Once they discover” or “After they try.” This is the common cry of the challenger: It’s better and here’s why you can believe us! We think credibility is T-Mobile’s elephant in the room and that it’s going to take many programs across many years to implant confidence and conviction.

There are many ways T-Mobile can address this problem. After deploying their LTE network T-Mobile launched an Uncarrier initiative called Test Drive (original 2014 announcement here). They changed the program to a 30-day Hotspot in 2019 for consumers and included small businesses last year. Test Drive allowed potential customers to experience T-Mobile’s network changes before they actually committed to a relationship (since a growing number of smartphones are purchased through Apple and Samsung directly Equipment Installment Plans don’t have the retentive power of yesteryear).

T-Mobile indirectly learned about the power of a test drive when they launched Home Internet in 4Q 2020. Many (including yours truly) were skeptical and switched between cable and T-Mobile networks to see if there was any material difference. Unlike smartphones with voicemail losses and the pains that occasionally happen with porting phone numbers data is free from those hassles.

If T-Mobile could figure out how to use the eSIM now present in many smartphones to provide a similar test many of those “I had T-Mobile back in 20XX” prospective customers might try Magenta again.

Bottom line: As we discussed last week T-Mobile has a tremendous amount of merger and network momentum. They have a talented team of experienced leaders who can manage growth and change. But they lack credibility with many who had T-Mobile in the past or who still equate Magenta with “cheap.” There is no short-term fix as brands are not supercharged overight but T-Mobile can accelerate their net additions by making aggressive Uncarrier moves that improve credibility.

Next week we will start our Q1 preview with a look at the overall economic conditions (read our March 7 Brief if you need a refresher). Until then if you have friends who would like to be on the email distribution please have them send an email to [email protected] and we will include them on the list (or they can sign up directly through the new website).

Bobby DiMartino 25 of Cape Coral now faces felony charges of fraudulent use of ID and grand theft.

On Feb. 9 the victim reported that someone applied for credit with phone companies in her name the report states. She said she had gone to buy a cell phone at a North Naples Walmart in January. DiMartino her salesman took her license and other information and told the victim the cell phone she wanted was not available she said.

The victim went to another Walmart the next day searching for a phone to find DiMartino behind the counter according to the report. He said again that a phone she wanted was not in stock. The woman said she did not buy a new phone.

A credit denial letter from Sprint and a welcome letter from Verizon acknowledging a new account and the purchase of an iPhone 12 came to the victim in February the report states. She also received the first bill of $818.

The victim told police she did not buy a phone or have credit with either phone company according to a report. The Verizon bill provided the cell phone’s serial number and phone number associated with the fraud account.

When detectives began investigation they found DiMartino was already arrested for similar crimes four days earlier on Feb. 5. The cell phone number reported on the letter was listed in the DiMartino’s booking records.

Walmart provided video of the days DiMartino worked that the victim reported.

The phones were put in the same bag as he walked from the store. Video also showed that he was at the register filling out screens and swiping a card with no customers present.

The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) has adopted a positive opinion for the orphan designation for BIVV003 (autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transfected with zinc finger nuclease mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB-mRENH2) following its meeting of January 19-21—minutes of which were posted this month on the EMA’s website.

COMP based its recommendation on data showing that the first three patients with sickle cell disease ended up “without recurrence of previous SCD symptoms” following treatment with BIVV003 in the Phase I/II PRECIZN-1 trial (NCT03653247).

“Increases in expression of HbF [fetal hemoglobin] have also been reported in accordance with the assumed mechanism of action” the committee added.

The three patients had 52 weeks 13 weeks and 29 days of follow-up respectively following treatment with BIVV003.

“OH. MY. GREGOR. (and Rosalind)” exclaimed Fyodor Urnov PhD director for technology and translation at the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California (UC) Berkeley who was not connected with the study in a tweet on Friday that referred to genetics pioneers Gregor Mendel and Rosalind Franklin.

Investors signaled their enthusiasm for Sangamo’s news by sending its shares up 11.55% on Friday to $13.23 from $11.86 a closing price unchanged from Wednesday.

“Seems promising”

“Though relatively early follow-up the benefit observed seems promising” Maury Raycroft PhD equity analyst at Jefferies and two colleagues observed Friday in a research note.

Sangamo and Sanofi are not the only developers to report positive clinical data for new treatments against SCD in recent months. In January CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals reported positive results for their CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited therapy candidate CTX001 in a patient with SCD and a patient with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) according to data from a pair of Phase I/II trials that was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Another developer of an SCD treatment Bluebird Bio temporarily and voluntarily suspending two clinical trials assessing its LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD; bb1111) following reports that two participants in the earlier-phase study developed blood cancers—one of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the other of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

Earlier this month however Bluebird said its BB305 lentiviral vector (LVV) was “very unlikely” to have played a role in the patient with AML. The company continues to investigate the MDS case.

BIVV003 is an autologous cell therapy that incorporates gene editing of a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells using Sangamo’s zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. The genomic modification occurs within an endogenous BCL11A enhancer sequence.

According to the COMP committee the first patient was of HbSS (homozygous genotype) and on hydroxyurea 500 mg daily for several years and had frequent hospitalizations due to 10 severe vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) including hospitalizations within the past two years before being enrolled in the study.

The second treated patient also had a HbSS genotype and a complex medical history of numerous VOCs and had received chronic red blood cell exchanges since she was seven years old. The third treated patient also had a previous history of chronic red blood cell transfusions and a VOC in the two years prior to enrollment COMP reported.

“Significant benefit”

“Although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product containing autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transfected with zinc finger nuclease mRNAs SB-mRENH1 and SB-mRENH2 will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition” the COMP concluded according to the minutes of its meeting.

“The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical observations supporting a reduction in vaso-occlusive crises as well as long term effects that may obviate the need of frequent treatment” COMP added. “The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.”

The three treated patients were among six recruited for the PRECIZN-1 trial an open label multicenter study for which Sangamo and Sanofi expect to recruit a total of eight adults with severe sickle cell disease. The study is designed to assess the safety tolerability and efficacy of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using BIVV003. The study’s estimated primary completion date is November 2023.

In a separate statement Wednesday Sangamo and Sanofi said they expect to submit updated data from the PRECIZN-1 study for presentation at a medical meeting later this year. At that time the companies said they will also provide an update on another Sanofi-partnered clinical trial assessing another ex vivo gene-edited cell therapy candidate being developed by the two companies for a blood disorder ST-400 in beta thalassemia.

Sangamo and Sanofi are partnering in an exclusive worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize zinc finger nuclease-mediated gene-edited cell therapies for the treatment of beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

The partnership was launched in 2014 by Sangamo and Biogen. When Biogen spun out its global hemophilia business in 2017 the spinout company Bioverativ took over Biogen’s portion of the collaboration before being acquired by Sanofi a year later for $11.6 billion. Sanofi continues Bioverativ’s obligation to conduct the BIVV003 Phase I/II clinical trial and subsequent worldwide clinical development manufacturing and commercialization of products.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From this moment on all Cubans who want to travel to the Central American country must apply for the Tourism Visa at the Panamanian consulate located in the country of residence or origin in accordance with Executive Decree No. 88 published in the Gaceta Oficial.

The Panamanian government established in October 2018 the so-called tourist card for self-employed Cuban citizens or artisans who did not have a stamped visa which had a cost of 20 dollars and allowed them to enter and stay in the Central American country for up to 30 days for shopping tourism.

In March 2019 the Panamanian authorities ruled that Cubans who had said card should have their visa stamped and in July of the same year the suspension of the issuance of the document was announced.

The businesspeople of the Colon Free Zone the largest in the continent resented the measure and asked their government to find alternatives for Cuban buyers who represented 40% of the 57121 tourists who arrived at the emporium between January and July 2018.

The suspension was temporary and was due to “irregularities” detected by the Panamanian government in the allocation and use of this mechanism as confirmed by the president of the Colón Free Zone Users Association Daniel Rojas.

At a cost of 20 dollars the tourist card could be requested in principle by Cuban citizens with a self-employment card certificate of creators (artisans) or who had previously traveled to Panama or a third country and who did not have a stamped visa for a stay of up to 30 days in the Central American country.

Ferndale Considering Regulations for Airbnb/Short Term Rentals

(Crystal A. Proxmire March 21 2021)

Ferndale MI – The City of Ferndale is considering an ordinance that would require owners of short term rentals such as those offered on Airbnb to register their properties and maintain certain standards in order to maintain their license.

“If these property owners want to change their property from a residential home to a business then they need to be treated like a business” said Councilperson Greg Pawlica at the Jan. 25 2021 city council meeting where the proposed ordinance to license and regulate LTRs was first introduced.

The ordinance would require an annual fee for property owners set clear rules for the number of people permitted to stay overnight based on available space and provide a mechanism for revoking licenses of property owners who fall short of standards in terms of upkeep limiting guests and avoiding issues such as parking problems parties and crime.

Tracking and inspection would be funded by the fees. The proposed fee is 185.00 per year for Residential Short Term Rental Unit $185.00 a year for a Non-Residential Short Term Rental Unit and $75.00 a year refund of a portion of the annual licensing fee for a Short Term Rental Unit leased for no more than 14 days a calendar year.

“When I was on council I started getting complaints from residents who live next to or near a short term rental and there were not a lot of records of a trend of Airbnb rentals in the city” said Mayor Melanie Piana. “We really didn’t have a lay of the land in 2019 of where this was going.”

The City created a taskforce to study the STR issue and has already connected with 20 STR owners who voluntarily participated in registering their properties.

The City also has been tracking ads for STRs through sites including Airbnb. They found that depending on the season there were between 30-90 STRs advertised.

Emily Loomis the City’s Assistant Building Official stated “The goal of the ordinance is right now short term rentals are not regulated so any building or structure could technically operate as a short term rental but without regulation. This allows the city to regulate short term rentals to try and mitigate any adverse impacts that it can have on the welfare the safety the health and just the overall quality of life for the surrounding properties.”

Some issues include buildings that have not been cleaned and maintained as well as those that have attracted large parties and even crime. A Jan. 4 2021 drive-by shooting is one example. Neighbors to the north in Royal Oak have had similar problems.

“Some of the goals with the ordinance are overnight occupancy limits” Loomis explained. “This one is based off square footage and the tables within the Michigan residential code. There is the ability to revoke the license of a short term rental if it has had three documented verified ordinance violations with the revocation per review of City Manager.” Complaints would need to be substantiated and the City Manager would have discretion for revocations. There would also be an appeal process.

At the Jan. 25 meeting resident Mike Flores who owns multiple STR properties in cities outside Ferndale explained the economics saying that property owners make more money in the three months of renting at $100-$500 per night in the busy travel season than in an entire year renting to a person or family to live there year-round.

Not including unregistered STRS about 20% of housing in Ferndale is registered as long term rental properties which are inspected and regulated for use by long term tenants.

As traditional renters are displaced and a revolving door of transient guests comes in complaints to the city increase. Piana acknowledged the challenge for neighbors. “They didn’t sign up to live next to a hotel when they bought their house” she said. “So there’s a balance here that we’re trying to achieve.”

In addition to the immediate concerns of neighbors the City is concerned with the loss of affordable rental properties for residents. “Places like Traverse City and Saugatuck have a real problem with more homes going over to short term rentals than being available for people to live in losing some affordable housing. So it’s a real issue for cities” Piana said.

On top of finding a way to preserve affordable housing without imposing on property owners’ rights municipalities are facing the potential for deregulation by the state.

“There’s another track here going on at the same time the legislative track” Mayor Piana said. “The legislators have been trying to prevent cities from passing short term rental ordinances and preempting them taking away cities’ power to even put in a local ordinance so the local government can even try to control these short term rentals in the way that is best for their community. “ She said cities would have to be mindful that such legislation could pass and the ordinance would no longer apply. She encouraged those who have an opinion to reach out to their State officials to weigh in on the issue.

The ordinance will be introduced at the Monday March 22 Ferndale City Council meeting. For more info visit https://www.ferndalemi.gov.

Tatsno Lakes: Freda Berkley and Miss Hester The name Tatsno is of Kawitshin origin and means “my younger sister.

There are 11 names on or near Vancouver Island that appear on a new map of places named for women in Canada.

Tatsno Lakes: Freda Berkley and Miss Hester

The name Tatsno is of Kawitshin origin and means “my younger sister.” It refers to two local alpine club ­members involved in exploring the area.

According to provincial records the name Tatsno Lakes was adopted in 1939 and confirmed in 1948.

Freda Lake was first suggested at a public meeting in 1935 at Courtenay to determine potential names for previously unnamed features on a new map of ­Forbidden Plateau. The name refers to Freda Berkley a member of the party who first explored a route to the Comox Glacier and a staff member at the biological station at Nanaimo. She was considered the first white woman to go into the glacier region.

At the same time the name “Hester Lakes” was suggested by Mr. Harold Cliffe. A committee determined it “advisable [to give] distinctive [First Nations] names to this feature and suggest Tatsno meaning my younger sister associating the names and memories of Miss Freda Berkley and the Miss Hester mentioned in Cliffe’s recommendations.”

Trevor Channel: Frances Hornby Barkley

Frances Hornby Barkley (née Trevor) was married to Capt. Charles William Barkley of the Imperial Eagle and travelled extensively with her husband. Her diaries were compiled into The Remarkable World of Frances Barkley 1769-1845 an account of her adventures at sea.

She was with her husband when he “discovered” Barkley Sound in 1787. According to H.D. Parizeau of the Hydrographic Service Frances the daughter of a Protestant minister was 17 at the time.

The name Trevor Channel was adopted in 1945 replacing Eastern Channel on British Admiralty maps.

Her unpublished reminiscences written in the latter days of her life and now in the provincial archives in Victoria are the main source of information about this and later voyages.

Ross Bay is named for Isabella Ross who as owner of Fowl Bay Farm in the mid-19th ­century was the first registered landowner in B.C. DARREN STONE TIMES COLONIST

Ross Bay: Isabella Ross

The wide bay is named for Isabella Ross (née ­Mainville) a pioneering Métis woman of Victoria. She was married to Hudson’s Bay Company trader Charles Ross a founder of Fort Victoria. Following the death of her husband in 1844 Isabella moved her family to Washington territory for several years. She returned to Victoria in the early 1850s and by signing the deed to the 99-acre property above the bay became the first registered female landowner in British Columbia.

She named her property Fowl Bay Farm because of the abundant waterfowl. It was not successful and Isabella sold portions of her property to individual ­buyers. The city purchased the remote slope overlooking Ross Bay for use as a cemetery which was opened in 1872. Isabella died in 1885 at age 77 and was buried in an unmarked grave at Ross Bay Cemetery. In 1994 an interpretive plaque was installed at her grave site.

Naylor Bay: Emma Naylor

The bay on Mayne Island is named after Emma Naylor (née Collinson). Her father was the first storekeeper and postmaster on Mayne Island in the late 1800s.

The B.C. Geographical Names office said origin notes for Naylor Bay have not yet been transferred from paper records and maps to its website but updates can be expected.

Crowther Canyon: Ann Unsworth Crowther

This deep-sea canyon was named after Ann Unsworth Bailey (née Crowther) who travelled to Victoria from England with her parents in 1862. In 1876 she moved with her husband to Kyuquot on northwestern ­Vancouver Island where he was the operator of a trading station. They remained for six years during which time she was the only European woman in the area.

Butchart Gardens is named for Jennie Butchart who began to shape the gardens in 1904. ADRIAN LAM TIMES COLONIST

Butchart Gardens: Jeannette Foster Kennedy Butchart

Jennie Butchart began to shape Butchart Gardens in 1904. She established in the style of the grand estates of the period several distinct gardens to evoke a range of esthetic experiences. An abandoned limestone quarry was transformed into the dramatic Sunken Garden a reflection of the early 20th-century ­beautification movement and an exceptional achievement in Canadian gardening history.

Butchart Gardens was designated a National ­Historic Site of Canada in 2004. The designated area of the gardens occupies 5.26 hectares and includes the residence that was remodelled and enlarged for the Butcharts by architect Samuel Maclure.

McBey Islets: Nellie Georgina McBey

The group of five small islets south of Meares Island are named for Nellie Georgina McBey (née Stewart). She was involved in naming several species of plant life on Vancouver Island according to the province’s heritage branch.

The rocky formations were originally named ­Dinner Islets as labelled on British Admiralty Charts but the name was changed to McBey Islets in 1934 and ­confirmed in 1947 after a recommendation by the Hydrographic Service.

Nellie was born in 1883 at Urrafirth near Lerwick on the Shetland Islands. Her father was a school headmaster and botanist. She discovered and documented several species of plant life on Vancouver Island including Ericameria ericoides also known as California heathgoldenrod or mock heather.

Helen Lake: Helen Ford

The lake is named after Helen Manning Hunt Ford a longtime resident of the area who moved to the Alberni Valley in the late 1930s. During the Second World War she served with the Canadian Women’s Army Corps where she attained the rank of major. She became a Member of the British Empire in 1946. She devoted countless hours to community groups including the Alberni District Museum and Historical Society and was presented with the Alberni’s Citizen of the Year award in 1983. Helen and her husband donated 52 hectares of land to the province to become Fossli ­Provincial Park. The official name was adopted on Dec. 1 1998.

Emily Lake: Emily Lawson

The lake is named after Emily Lawson (neé Raper) the first schoolteacher in Van Anda a small mining community on Texada Island. She was the daughter of Alfred Raper a miner on Texada in the late 1890s and married John P. Lawson editor of the local paper The Coast Miner. The community was named after the Van Anda Copper and Gold Company which owned 840 acres on the northeast side of the island including the Copper Queen claim. President Edward Blewett a prominent American capitalist and miner named both his son and this mining company after his wife Carrie Van Anda.

Emily Lake was officially named in 1949.

Victoria as seen from Mount Tolmie. The city is named after Queen Victoria. DARREN STONE TIMES COLONIST

Victoria: Queen Victoria

Queen Victoria was the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom Canada and Australia and Empress of India for almost 64 years from 1837 until her death in 1901. Known as the Mother of Confederation she granted Royal Assent to the British North America Act and chose Bytown (now known as Ottawa) to be the capital of Canada. Many of Canada’s towns cities geographical features parks buildings and streets bear her name.

The City of Victoria incorporated on Aug. 2 1862. Victoria was the capital of Vancouver Island and later of the united colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia and since the union with Canada in 1871 has been the capital of British Columbia.

It was named by the officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company. In 1841 James Douglas chief factor of the HBC chose the area as an ideal location for a new post. Douglas spent the summer of 1842 mapping the area between Oak Bay and Esquimalt and on March 15 1843 selected the site for the new fort. Building started June 4 1843 using cedar palisades cut from Mount Douglas.

Chief Trader Charles Ross who was in charge of construction was under the impression that the new fort was to be named in memory of the queen’s consort and named the new post Fort Albert. Supply ships put in there during the summer of 1843 and their logs variously refer to Fort Albert Fort Victoria and Fort Camosun.

Clarification from London finally arrived and in December 1843 with ceremony and the firing of salutes the post was named Fort Victoria. The first British settlers arrived in the late 1840s.

Fort Victoria was demolished on Nov. 24 1864.

Celia Reefs: Unknown

The origin of this natural feature’s name is unknown and research continues. It was included on the map for its name and unique feature on the ocean floor.

Not on the map but worth noting

Port Alice

The village on northern Vancouver Island is located on Neroutsos Inlet northwest of Port McNeill. It was originally built by Whalen Pulp and Paper Mills of Vancouver and named after Alice Whalen the founders’ mother.

The brothers Whalen began their construction of the mill at its present site in 1917 and the first pulp was produced in 1918. The mill at Swanson Bay farther north was also a Whalen operation.

Ladysmith

In 1904 coal baron James Dunsmuir founded a company town at Oyster Harbour for miners at his recently opened Extension colliery to the north. Dunsmuir named the new town on the 49th parallel Ladysmith in honour of the end of the siege of Ladysmith South Africa during the Boer War.

Lady Smith was Spaniard Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith a descendant of Juan Ponce de Leon. She was the wife of Major Harry Smith a British army officer and governor of the Cape Colony in South Africa where Ladysmith was named in her honour.",,,

More than 10 years ago Walgreens launched its first Expressions Challenge program to encourage teens to use creative arts as an outlet to manage some of life’s stressful circumstances and to guide students to make better life choices. Offered only in Chicago and St. Louis Walgreens worked with high school districts teachers and guidance counselors to promote the contest to students grades 9-12. This year for the first time ever Expressions is being offered nationally. Submissions are being accepted now through March 31 with 12 winners from three categories to be awarded $2000 each. Winners will be selected and announced in May 2021.

Formed in 2009 the Expressions Challenge is a creative arts competition in three categories including visual arts video production and spoken word. Teens are guided to use time spent working on their creations as outlets for expressing difficulties they are facing. Students’ finished works often address a range of issues from bullying and self-image to the rapid spread of HIV. Teens today still face these circumstances and more and for many their anxieties are compounded by the effects of COVID-19.

“Expressions was created for moments like these. Our country is dealing with the weight of a pandemic that has been so challenging that one can only imagine how young people must feel. Every year Expressions proves to be more rewarding than the previous year and Walgreens is pleased to extend this support to teens at a time when our nation could use more compassion and healing” said John Standley president Walgreens.

This year the program includes a Specialty Award category for submissions that explore the impact of COVID-19. The lucky winner of this category will receive $1000 for the best entry that addresses the effects of the pandemic and the importance of getting vaccinated. Coordinators for the Expressions Challenge program will interact with schools and students virtually through planned digital and social engagements.

For more information and details about how to enter the Expressions Challenge please visit the website at www.expressionschallenge.com. The Expressions Challenge is not open to Walgreens employees or teens of Walgreens employees.

Walgreens believes in supporting and giving back to the communities it serves.

On Wednesday Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — alongside other Democratic House and Senate members — said they re-introduced the ""Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act.""

The legislation applies to businesses with more than $100 million in annual revenue and targets larger corporations where CEOs earn at least 50 times more than their median worker. The tax is determined by the size of the pay gap between them gradually increasing as the disparity worsens.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

If the CEO makes between 50 and 100 times more than the median worker corporate taxes increase by 0.5%. For those CEOS paid between 100 times and up to 200 times more than the median worker taxes would increase by 1% with a 1% increase for every order of 100. The highest increase would be 5% for companies where CEOs earn over 500 times their typical worker.

A 2020 report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI) looked at how CEO compensation has grown in contrast to workers' wages. Focusing on ""realized"" compensation for CEOs — which ""counts stock awards when vested and stock options when cashed in rather than when granted"" — EPI found that in 2019 the ratio between CEO pay and the typical worker's pay was 320-to-1.

And from 1978 to 2019 CEO pay grew by 1167%; meanwhile it grew by 13.7% for the typical worker.

Some big-name companies would owe millions extra under the legislation

Several widely-known companies would find their taxes hiked. In a press release for the bill several notable ones are highlighted.

If the legislation had been in effect last year some companies would have paid hundreds of millions more in taxes according to the press release: Walmart would have owed $854.9 million more; for Home Depot and JPMorganChase the additional taxes come to $550.8 million and $172.8 million. Nike would have paid an extra $147.7 million.

Meanwhile McDonald's would have forked over an extra $69.5 million and American Airlines an extra $22.6 million.

Notably Nike CEO John Donahoe was promoted to the new position in January 2020 and the company awarded him a much larger compensation package than his predecessor's 2019 pay (shown in the chart below) as part of the move. McDonald's also got a new CEO in 2019 and they calculated their pay ratio using a combination of the pay packages for incoming CEO Chris Kempczinski and departing CEO Steve Easterbrook.

Some conservative economists argue the tax would hit certain sectors harder such as fast-food and retail because of the low-wages commonly paid in those industries.

The legislation comes as Biden looks into potential tax increases

President Joe Biden has reportedly been eyeing some tax increases as he considers measures to fund a new infrastructure package. Democrats are moving to spend trillions on transportation roads bridges and waterways.

One thing he's doubled down on is a tax increase for higher-earning Americans. As Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig reported Biden has said that Americans earning over $400000 will see a tax increase of up to 39%.

Another increase he's been mulling over is the corporate tax rate. Part of his economic campaign plan included raising that rate from 21% to 28%. If Sanders and other progressives get their way the rate could increase for companies with larger CEO-to-worker pay ratios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hcGxlc25ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvY3JpbWUvMjAyMS8wMy8yMS9jYXBlLWNvcmFsLW1hbi1zdGVhbHMtaWRlbnRpdHktYnV5cy1pcGhvbmUvNDc4OTgzMDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart salesman accused of stealing identity information buys iPhone Collier County deputies say,"A Walmart salesman stole a customer's identity information who bought a new iPhone and opened a line of credit more than $800 in her name Collier County deputies report.

Bobby DiMartino 25 of Cape Coral now faces felony charges of fraudulent use of ID and grand theft.

On Feb. 9 the victim reported that someone applied for credit with phone companies in her name the report states. She said she had gone to buy a cell phone at a North Naples Walmart in January. DiMartino her salesman took her license and other information and told the victim the cell phone she wanted was not available she said.

The victim went to another Walmart the next day searching for a phone to find DiMartino behind the counter according to the report. He said again that a phone she wanted was not in stock. The woman said she did not buy a new phone.

A credit denial letter from Sprint and a welcome letter from Verizon acknowledging a new account and the purchase of an iPhone 12 came to the victim in February the report states. She also received the first bill of $818.

The victim told police she did not buy a phone or have credit with either phone company according to a report. The Verizon bill provided the cell phone’s serial number and phone number associated with the fraud account.

When detectives began investigation they found DiMartino was already arrested for similar crimes four days earlier on Feb. 5. The cell phone number reported on the letter was listed in the DiMartino’s booking records.

Walmart provided video of the days DiMartino worked that the victim reported. Surveillance showed that as soon as the customer walked away from the counter DiMartino bought a cheap $24 cell phone in a different name then took the iPhone from a secure cabinet and activated it through Verizon but never paid according to the report.

The phones were put in the same bag as he walked from the store. Video also showed that he was at the register filling out screens and swiping a card with no customers present.

Walmart Loss Prevention also found note pads with many people’s license cell phone and Social Security numbers in DiMartino’s sales area the report states.

DiMartino admitted to helping the victim and said she did not buy any phones he said during an interview March 19 according to the report. He denies opening credit or taking the iPhone claiming it was a computer glitch.

The report states that “as he was pressured for further information he asked several times what he could do to not be arrested.”

DiMartino is charged with felony fraudulent use of ID fraudulent obtaining credit over $300 and grand theft of $750-$5000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1hem9uLWJlY29tZXMtdGhlLXRvcC1jbG90aGluZy1yZXRhaWxlci1pbi10aGUtdS1zLW91dHNlbGxpbmctd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQtZ2FwLWFuZC1vdGhlcnMtMTE2MTYwMDIxOTfSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9hbWF6b24tYmVjb21lcy10aGUtdG9wLWNsb3RoaW5nLXJldGFpbGVyLWluLXRoZS11LXMtb3V0c2VsbGluZy13YWxtYXJ0LXRhcmdldC1nYXAtYW5kLW90aGVycy0xMTYxNjAwMjE5Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon becomes the top clothing retailer in the U.S. outselling Walmart Target Gap and others,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-becomes-the-top-clothing-retailer-in-the-u-s-outselling-walmart-target-gap-and-others-11616002197 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1hem9uLWJlY29tZXMtdGhlLXRvcC1jbG90aGluZy1yZXRhaWxlci1pbi10aGUtdS1zLW91dHNlbGxpbmctd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQtZ2FwLWFuZC1vdGhlcnMtMTE2MTYwMDIxOTfSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9hbWF6b24tYmVjb21lcy10aGUtdG9wLWNsb3RoaW5nLXJldGFpbGVyLWluLXRoZS11LXMtb3V0c2VsbGluZy13YWxtYXJ0LXRhcmdldC1nYXAtYW5kLW90aGVycy0xMTYxNjAwMjE5Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

From the early years of the “Vacation Kingdom of the World” to its current incarnation as a four-theme park potentially self-contained vacation destination each decade of Disney World’s existence has brought a slew of changes.

To really drive home how Walt Disney World has evolved over the years perhaps a little experiment is in order. We’re going to look through the eyes of a guest visiting Disney World every ten years from its opening day to the present.

Welcome to Walt Disney World — by the decade!

1971

For those lucky enough to visit Walt Disney World during its opening year they experienced a vacation destination the likes of which had never been seen before.

Unsurprisingly the largest draw at the time (and arguably still is) Magic Kingdom. The then-new park took the ultra-successful blueprint laid by Disneyland and replicated it on a gigantic scale. Everything from the castle weenie to the walkways were bigger while the attractions were a mixture of improved clones and brand new rides and shows that couldn’t be seen in the park’s west coast counterpart.

Beyond Magic Kingdom itself early Disney World trips were built around the Seven Seas Lagoon. Guests could choose to stay at the Polynesian Village Resort the Contemporary Resort (both of which offered dining and entertainment options as well as watercraft rentals and access to the Monorail) or First Wilderness Resort and Campground.

In addition to the fun of what was part of the appeal of Walt Disney World during its opening year was the promise of what could be. Even then Disney actively touted the amount of available space they had to expand both Magic Kingdom and the Walt Disney World resort as a whole.

1981

Opening day guests returning to Walt Disney World a decade later in 1981 would find a resort that had substantially grown in the previous ten years while still maintaining the same basic structure.

During its first decade Magic Kingdom added several E-Ticket attractions that are still major draws for the park today The first of these was Pirates of the Caribbean in 1973 which was quickly added thanks to guest demand.

Magic Kingdom saw the additions of Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain in 1975 and 1980 respectively. These massive roller coaster style attractions were the first true thrill rides at Walt Disney World and forever changed the type of attractions Imagineering developed for the parks and how guests toured the park.

Outside the park the overall Walt Disney World complex had grown as well. The World’s Resort hotel offerings expanded twice: The Disney Village Resort (later known as the Disney Institute and the grounds of which are now part of Saratoga Springs) opened in 1972 and The Golf Resort (now known as Shades of Green) opened in 1973.

Hotel rooms weren’t the only things to open at Walt Disney World in the 1970s though. Someone visiting in 1981 for the first time in a decade would also find the Disney Village Marketplace (opened 1975 the earliest version of the area now known as Disney Springs) and Disney’s River Country (the first themed waterpark in the world which opened in 1976).

While there were definitely some big additions between 1971 and 1981 the new addition visitors in that latter year were likely most excited about wasn’t even open yet: EPCOT Center.

1991

If the changes between 1971 and 1981 could be described as relatively incremental ones that upgraded the opening day Walt Disney World experience the ones that occurred between 1981 and 1991 fundamentally changed what Walt Disney World was overall. Gone was the Magic Kingdom-focused Vacation Kingdom built around the Seven Seas Lagoon and in its place was a massive vacation destination featuring three theme parks thousands of hotel rooms and a nightlife district.

The biggest differences (nearly) bookended the decade though the projects could not have been more different. In 1982 EPCOT Center opened. The massive theme park was Walt Disney’s final – albeit heavily altered – dream come to life. Designed as the swan-song of many of the original generation of Imagineers the park didn’t feature any Disney characters. Instead the park featured Future World and World Showcase: two realistic World’s Fair-esque areas that aimed to teach about humanity its future and its cultures.

While EPCOT Center was a massive success the Walt Disney Company as a whole wasn’t doing well in the mid-1980s. After a series of attempted corporate takeovers Michael Eisner and Frank Wells were installed as the company’s CEO and CFO respectively in 1984. The two would have a near immediate impact on Imagineering and Walt Disney World specifically through the rest of the decade.

One of the new executive team’s first mandates was to greenlight the construction of a third theme park as a way to curb competition from Universal’s then-upcoming Florida Studios park which Eisner allegedly had foreknowledge of thanks to a pitch he heard during his time as CEO of Paramount Pictures.

Disney’s MGM Studios opened on May 1 1989. The new park featured rides based around Hollywood films (including The Great Movie Ride and Star Tours) as well as an in-depth production tram tour that took guests around the then-active sets and animation studios housed at the park. Despite arguments from some that it was nothing more than a 1/2 day park the Studios were a massive success from the start and the company quickly began expanding the park to meet demand.

The summer of 1989 also saw the opening of two more expansions to Walt Disney World. First up was the the Disney-fied nightclub district Pleasure Island (located next to the Disney Village Marketplace) which provided a nighttime release for parents and other adult guests while not so coincidently keeping them on-property instead of at the popular Church Street Station complex in Orlando.

Next came Typhoon Lagoon Disney’s second themed water park. However unlike the purposely rustic River Country Typhoon Lagoon featured more thrilling slides.

With all the new additions keeping people on property Eisner and Wells quickly began expanding the the resorts amount of hotel rooms. Between 1981 and 1991 the company opened the new flagship Grand Floridan Resort and Spa as well as the Caribbean Beach Resort the Yacht and Beach Club Resorts the Port Orleans Resort and the Old Key West Resort.

In the early 1990s flush off the success of all their additions to Walt Disney World as well as the studio’s renaissance in animation Eisner announced the ambitious “Disney Decade” plan which laid out a litany of new additions the company was planning to build throughout the rest of the decade. Unfortunately things didn’t go quite as planned.

And let’s not forget this little beauty from the World’s 25th anniversary:

2001

Guests who’d last visited in 1991 would likely be somewhat confused at the state of the Walt Disney World complex in 2001. On the one hand the resort featured a brand new heavily-detailed theme park as well as new attractions at each of the other parks a new water park and even more hotels. On the other hand many of the promised expansions heralded as part of the “Disney Decade” were either heavily compressed or not built at all.

The biggest addition by far to Walt Disney World between 1991 and 2001 was the resort’s fourth full-size theme park: Animal Kingdom. The gigantic park combined live animals and state of the art attractions with heavily-themed lands that immersed guests in realistic depictions of Africa and Asia as well as the more fanciful DinoLand USA.

Not to be outdone by its new sibling each of Walt Disney World’s other three parks saw classic attractions open during the decade. Magic Kingdom welcomed its version of Splash Mountain in 1992 MGM Studios expanded with the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror in 1994 and the Rock N’ Roller Coaster in 1999 the same year EPCOT’s first E-Ticket Test Track opened. Unfortunately for the latter park 1991-2001 saw the closure of many of its classic attractions including World of Motion the original Universe of Energy and Horizons.

The 90s saw the opening of the property’s third water park Blizzard Beach which followed the Typhoon Lagoon blueprint of themed yet thrilling waterslides. Late in the decade Pleasure Island the Village Marketplace and a newly built “West Side” area were consolidated into the Downtown Disney District. The Wide World of Sports Complex also opened during this period.

Eisner whose power was consolidated after the tragic death of Frank Wells in 1994 continued pushing for new hotel rooms. The decade saw the opening of several more resort hotels including the Wilderness Lodge the All-Star Sports Music and Movies resorts the Boardwalk Inn and Villas the Animal Kingdom Lodge and Coronado Springs.

While these changes are nothing to sneeze at many of the plans were substantially cut down thanks to the economic failure of EuroDisney in 1992. These issues would continue to plague Disney World (and the Walt Disney Company as a whole) in the decade to come.

2011

Arguably guests visiting Walt Disney World in 2011 for the first time since 2001 would find the resort in the midst of its most stagnant period.

The resort did see the opening of several major attractions including Mission: SPACE and Soarin’ Over California at EPCOT Expedition Everest at Animal Kingdom and Toy Story Mania at Hollywood Studios (which acquired a new name in 2008). However the resort’s crown jewel Magic Kingdom saw no major additions during the decade.

Even hotel construction slowed down with only Pop Century Saratoga Springs and several villas for Disney Vacation Club members opening during this period.

The reasons for this lack of construction vary. In addition to the economic fallout from EuroDisney there was also fallout from the ousting of Michael Eisner in 2005. In addition several planned projects faltered when the films they were tied to bombed at the box office. However things would change in the following decade arguably thanks to some magical competition.

2021

Those visiting Walt Disney World this year for the first time since 2011 will likely be shocked at the scale of some of the additions made to Walt Disney World over the past ten years.

The opening of Universal Orlando’s Wizarding World of Harry Potter in 2010 changed the game for theme parks. The highly detailed and immersive land didn’t only allow visitors to experience a Harry Potter ride it literally put them into the world of the film series. Everything from the buildings and bathrooms to food and souvenirs were intricately designed to match the beloved series. Not so coincidently Disney has opened three lands of similar scope since 2011.

The first was the New Fantasyland expansion which opened in phases between 2012 and 2014. The expanded and rethemed land features the Seven Dwarf’s Mine Train coaster the Under the Sea ~ Journey of the Little Mermaid and areas themed to Beauty and the Beast and Dumbo’s circus.

Three years later Animal Kingdom saw the opening of Pandora: The World of Avatar. Themed after director James Cameron’s hit film Avatar this land allows guests to visit the home planet of the Na’vi through the Flight of Passage and Na’vi River Journey attractions as well as dining and shopping options.

The crown jewel of Disney’s 2010s themed lands is Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge which opened at Hollywood Studios in 2019. This massive expansion puts guests directly into the Star Wars universe thanks to the breakthrough Rise of the Resistance attraction as well as Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run and numerous other interactive experiences.

Hollywood Studios also saw the opening of Mickey and Minnie’s Runway Railway in 2020 which took over the space that previously housed the Great Movie Ride. The new attraction is notable for being the first Disney attraction to star Mickey Mouse.

EPCOT saw a controversial addition as the Maelstrom attraction in the World Showcase Norway pavilion was closed to make way for a boat ride themed to the massively popular film Frozen. Despite the anger of purists the change was massively popular among guests and seems to be serving as a template for the on-going refurbishment of the park which is incorporating more IPs.

The decade also saw the transformation of Downtown Disney to Disney Springs which transformed the entire area in both appearance and backstory.

Even during Walt Disney World’s 50th Anniversary Celebration we’ve seen new attractions open and some inch nearer to completion. We can only imagine how much we’ll be able to add to this list by 2031!

It’s no secret that Guests come from all over to step foot on Main Street U.S.A. U.S.A. and get a close-up view of Cinderella Castle in Magic Kingdom.

And as we get into 2021 and amid spring break more and more people are beginning to revisit theme parks.

Central Florida is starting to draw tourists again as families are eager to return during the first spring break season since the ongoing pandemic began. Last year spring break was nearly entirely canceled due to the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. So as the economy begins to recover slowly and COVID-19 cases begin to dwindle thanks to the vaccine families are taking advantage of 2021’s spring break.

However with this being said crowds are becoming the new norm especially at the Florida theme parks which is a concern to some.

Alvina Chu epidemiology program manager at the Florida Department of Health in Orange County told Orlando Sentinel “Since we’re in a pandemic I do have concerns about COVID spread and Central Florida which is why even for visitors and residents we still urge the pandemic precautions while we try to build this immunity in our community.”

Inside The Magic fan Marla D. also expressed their concerns with the current spring break crowd levels saying “There is no social distancing. People are packed in there like sardines […]”.

Another ITM reader Grace P. said the spring break crowds were also alarming to her and her family writing “I’m going next week. Increased crowds concern me because of the long lines. But on the other hand I went last August and it’s just weird being in Disney without many people.”

And Peter G. shared his insight in a recent Inside the Magic article writing “Heading to WDW the week after Easter Sunday. We are concerned that it will be crowded. One-hour wait times are pretty bad and no fast pass option.”

Additionally Orlando Sentinel stated that Disney has a 17% increase in traffic on its planDisney website compared to 2020. It seems that more families are thinking about vacations as we near the hopeful end of the current pandemic. It is no surprise that Park Passes for Walt Disney World’s theme parks — Magic Kingdom Disney’s Animal Kingdom Disney’s Hollywood Studios and EPCOT — are already sold out for most of March and even specific days in April.

Orlando Sentinel reached out to Disney for comments regarding spring break attendance but the company declined to answer. However spokeswoman Erica Ettori said “We are encouraged by what our Guests tell us about the experiences in our parks and resorts with our focus on health and safety. With the power of our brand and the magic of our Cast Members we remain optimistic that even better days are ahead.” In fact Inside the Magic reader Janet P. shared that on her recent visit to Walt Disney World she still had a great time even though it was different than before the pandemic hit. “I was there 1/22 – 1/26. Incredible experience. Sure it’s different but I thoroughly enjoyed myself” Janet said. Related: Grossly Insensitive Tweet Was Up “For FIVE DAYS” Before Fans Forced Disney to Remove It She continued “Thanks for all the attention to safety detail and I still love hearing ‘Welcome Home’ every time I scan my Magic Band. Even with COVID restrictions still managed to do all four parks in one day. Our first park on Saturday was Hollywood Studios and before 11:00 am we had completed six rides.”

Another Inside the Magic follower Marie shared with us that Cast Members have been very aware and enforcing the safety protocols saying “I have an incredible time and I love the way Cast Members are Very Attentive to Guests and asking them to comply unlike other theme parks I have visited.”

Aszkara another Inside the Magic reader and follower said that one of her favorite things to do at the theme parks now is to watch the pop-up character cavalcades! She said “It’s definitely different but I honestly had an amazing time. The lines looked A LOT longer than they actually were and even the wait times posted were longer than the actual waits for almost everything. My favorite new/different thing was the random character cavalcades. So fun!”

Disney’s busier crowds are helping the smaller businesses in Central Florida. Gatorland’s CEO Mark McHugh told Orlando Sentinel he couldn’t be happier with Disney’s busier crowds. Related: Disney World Park to Close Indefinitely Again “We’re the little dog here. We run around the big dogs’ feet trying to pick up crumbs. And they don’t let many crumbs drop that’s for sure” McHugh told Orlando Sentinel. “But when they’re having these capacity limits that they are that works out great for the smaller attractions because people are looking for something else to do.”

It’s not just Disney World that is drawing in the crowds. Universal Orlando’s theme parks have both regularly hit the maximum of their limited capacity in the past few weeks.

And at Legoland the hotels have seen an increase in occupancy. It’s the highest since they reopened last year which is great especially for employees. “We’ve been bringing employees back since we reopened on June 1” Rex Jackson Legoland Florida Resort’s general manager told Orlando Sentinel. “Currently we are actually hiring for 225 positions so we are eyes on the future.”

Orlando Sentinel also spoke to theme park analyst John Gerner managing director of Virginia’s Leisure Business Advisors who expressed that Disney is doing a great job operating amid the pandemic. “I think Disney is doing as good a job as you can expect” Gerner said.

And Inside the Magic fan LeAnna B. also explained how even though the parks look packed they aren’t as bad as they seem “Just got back yesterday from our week-long trip” LeAnna wrote. “As crowded as it looks it only took us 20 minutes to get out of the park each day! In fact we got on the 1st ferry boat each night we were in the magic kingdom. Now that never happens!! It’s because all of the line queues are outside. By the time you get the line inside the building you are going very quickly onto the ride.”

On the flip side theme park analyst John Gerner also expressed how it can be difficult to eliminate all the problems including face masks and social distancing issues. “People aren’t paying attention to it” Gerner told Orlando Sentinel. “You’re giving people instructions on what to do even when it’s in their interest is always going to be a challenge when people are just there wanting a good time and they’re just not thinking straight.”

Inside the Magic fan Joan also noticed this explaining that on their recent trip though many followed the rules a select few did not listen. “The rules are stated clearly and I agree that if you don’t want to wear a mask all day don’t go” Joan wrote. “I saw a couple of photos taken with masks off and one entire family eating while waiting in line but generally people kept their masks on.” She continued “What I had an issue with was people not distancing properly. I am an older person and don’t walk as fast as some people. I experienced many instances of patrons walking up from behind and practically breathing down my neck forcing me to step aside to prevent exposure. People really don’t understand the social distancing rules.”

The first of these was a virtual event that celebrated the 20th anniversary of Disney California Adventure and it was promised that it wouldn’t be the last. While the event was a retrospective of the park as well as a glance to the future there were still a few fun things that we managed to learn from this presentation.

The presentation hosted by Leslie Iwerks director of The Imagineering Story was full of special guests including:

Steven Davison Executive Parades & Spectaculars

Scot Drake Portfolio Creative Executive

Roger Gould Creative Director of Franchise Management and Parks Integration for Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios

Bob Weis President of Walt Disney Imagineering

Claire Weiss Creative Director

First up was Bob Weiss current president of Walt Disney Imagineering to talk about the history of the park. For the uninitiated this was a very candid (in Disney terms) look at the first version of the park citing its weak points and even mentioning its origins as WestCOT calling it “a great dream. A fantastic dream.” He also mentioned the decline of the Anaheim environment mentioning the increase in crime and other socioeconomic factors saying that really they had to work with the City of Anaheim before anything could really get started to expand.

Aside from that the usual story we’ve heard when it comes to the history of the park was repeated. The park was inherently flawed and Weiss pointed out that what they set out to do by making the park decidedly different than the neighboring Disneyland was their biggest mistake. This included anything in the realm of fantasy everything had to have its roots somewhere in reality. He also added that the then CEO Michael Eisner had a fascination with showcasing how things worked and were made whether it be in the form of a studio tram or a look into a sourdough bread factory. Characters would mostly stay in the neighboring kingdom as to be deeply differentiated they also didn’t want to tread on Disneyland’s already existing territory. Leslie pointed out that adults did love the decision to include alcohol in the park which Weiss pointed out proved original theories that it would bring certain undesirable elements to the park were unfounded. Weiss also pointed out that the Imagineers who worked on the original incarnation of the park are some of the best around because they were tasked with building a new theme park in the most challenging location to build a theme park on the entire planet right next to Walt Disney’s original masterpiece Disneyland.

After that Tom Fitzgerald quickly went over the transition into transforming the park from where it didn’t work into where they think it would have. He mentioned that the main inspiration came from the plaque above the entrance tunnel: “Here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday tomorrow and fantasy.” They would use this as a cue to address all the problems in the park using Condor Flats as an example saying here you have a real authentic desert facility that was just that. A desert. A hot uncomfortable desert that was home to one of the most popular attractions at the park. So to add more of the fantasy and charm they took it back to the nostalgic national park feel and extended out the Grizzly Peak area and absorbed Condor Flats retheming it into the Grizzly Peak Airfield.

Fitzgerald mentioned that Disney’s California Adventure was home to some of the most popular attractions at the Disneyland Resort attractions like California Screamin’ and Soarin’ Over California but the park was never as popular as they wanted it to be with the guests. They would show up for their favorite attractions and then head over to Disneyland especially for the park’s nighttime entertainment like Fantasmic! or any of the nighttime fireworks spectacular. One of the requirements of the new park enhancements would need to be a nighttime show that would keep guests at the park in the evening and the tired Electrical Parade wasn’t doing it.

In probably my favorite conversation of the entire program Steve Davison discusses with Leslie Iwerks the genesis of World of Color. Davison mentioned that they created the show under the guidance of a few rules: It can’t have human performers it must be able to performed multiple times a night and it has to be spectacular. While he doesn’t get into the original story premise (more on that can be found here) he does elaborate on how he and his team would study fountains around the world and realized yeah some of them had incredible lighting underneath but none of them ever incorporated color.

He said they had no real experience programming fountains but they did with lighting so they designed and built a lighting platform with fountains taking the place of programmable lights. The tests proved so successful that a platform featuring 1200 fountains the size of a football field was built in the main lagoon with the platform design now being the industry standard.

But now they have the technology figured out what do they do with it? They wanted to insert a lot of Pixar properties into the show as they have not been represented much elsewhere in the Disney Parks picking the journeys of evergreen properties and emotional and classic moments that can tie beautifully into the show. Programming the show once it was assembled also led to new accidental discoveries.

Davison tells the story of an effect that was born because the laser programmer had simply left a laser on while a fountain programmer was working. Davison was watching and saw the fountain hit the top of the lazer and you “suddenly had this beautiful thing” where everyone was asking how it was done and it “was chocolate and peanut butter.” A complete accident. The opening was changed to showcase this beautiful new effect which also appears in the Wall-E segment of the show.

Davison also tells the story of rehearsing and programming the show one night while in the performance corridor the parade staff was rehearsing Disney’s Electrical Parade. Going over to a captain that he knew Davison invited the performers to come watch the work-in-progress that was World of Color saying they knew they were on the right track when “the kids” loved it cheering at the right spots crying at the right spots and generally showing the emotions they were hoping for while sculpting the show.

Davison also reflects on a happy but intimidating one word response from Then-CEO Bob Iger after the initial pitch of the show a very excited “When?” As in “when can it be ready?” The new Little Mermaid: Ariel’s Undersea Adventure had been pushed back and now World of Color originally set to be #2 in line for the major changes coming to DCA would now be #1 ushering in the new era of the park and giving the park the nighttime spectacular it desperately needed.

It was much later in the program that Jeanette Lomboy Site Portfolio Executive for the Disneyland Resort spoke and subtly introduced the new pillars of DCA that would be taken into consideration for any new project at the park:

Innovation

Adventure

Discovery

Diversity

Though introduced later in the program you could see how they were implemented in the two major pieces of the five year relaunch of the park in 2012 Buena Vista Street and Cars Land.

Buena Vista Street was the first time a Disney park had redone an entire entryway but Lynne Itamura Executive Interior Designer said the most challenging part of the project was not just simply recreating the Los Angeles that Walt Disney would have arrived in but the Carthay Circle Restaurant that would become the icon of the new area and perhaps even the park. Countless photos exist of the exterior of the theater where Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered in 1937 but according to Itamura her team found maybe three photos after countless amounts of research of the actual interior of the building. So the team looked at other restaurants of the era for style choices to reflect a sort of party atmosphere that some Hollywood types would have gone to after the Snow White premiere. She said that one thing they felt that they must include were exclusive “power booths” where some of the Hollywood elite and their accompanying parties or entourage would join in.

She also talked about how Buena Vista Street has a subtle parallel to Walt Disney’s Career with some of it being more humble mom and pop shop designs as you enter the park moving more towards commercialized buildings like the Five and Dime building up to the end of the street where the grand and majestic Carthay Circle lies.

Elsewhere in the park Imagineer Kevin Rafferty and his team were working on a new expansion that would focus on California car culture and Route 66 Car Land.

According to Rafferty while developing this new area slated for an area that he and WDI Colleague Kathy Mangum once parked their own car in while working at the Disneyland Resort a new movie was in development at Pixar Animation Studios called Cars. Rafferty learned of the film while making early progress on what would become Toy Story Midway Mania and went with some of his team up to Pixar to see if there was anything from Cars that could be incorporated into the new Car Land. Long story short the “S” from Disney’s California Adventure went on to become part of the moniker Cars Land at now Disney California Adventure. Rafferty and the team immediately fell in love with the film and the entire team took a road trip down Route 66 to develop the land. After all the film Cars mostly shows you the exteriors of the buildings in Radiator Springs what do the interiors of say the curio shop look like. That research was all done in a super rare business trip to be in a car along the very reportedly very hospitable Route 66.

Cars Land falls into those pillars especially that of Adventure. While even though an authentic desert environment similar to what Fitzgerald said had to go with the removal of Condor Flats this new desert town was completely immersive transporting guests to another time place and world to retell the story of Cars. So much so that some will argue it still outshines Disney’s newer attempts at immersive environments including Pandora: The World of Avatar at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at neighboring Disneyland and Disney’s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World.

Others will also say it continues to outshine new projects at DCA still. Lomboy said that Buena Vista Street and Cars Land “really just elevated our game” in terms of design at the park. She then tells the story of how the team was looking at California Screamin’ still one of the most popular rides at the entire resort and how they felt the need to inject a Disney Story into the attraction that didn’t really have one found out that Incredibles 2 was in production and rode the attraction wearing a headset playing Micheal Giacchino’s score from the original film. From that experience they were taken aback and thought “wow how do we turn this into a 90 second story and make it a uniquely Disney experience.” The answer became the Incredicoaster which Lomboy admits she still laughs the entire time while riding.

This also led to the entire retheme of Paradise Pier. But why?

As was already mentioned the team had it in their mind that California Screamin’ could now be rethemed to The Incredibles to add that layer of Disney to add to the experience and they already had the already popular Toy Story Midway Mania nearby. Jeff Shaver-Moskowitz Executive Producer said “so you start to see that this picture is being painted of what it would be like to make this uniquely Disney land by bringing Pixar stories to life.” More jarring were his comments about how it ties into the overall California theme of the park “Anchoring it into a California story of seaside piers but also the very California story of Pixar and its animated films.” While that wasn’t the most jarring of these stories throughout the presentation (that comes later) Roger Gould describes that the whole concept was difficult because Pixar isn’t a story. It’s multiple stories. So the idea of “neighborhoods” (Incredibles Park Toy Story Boardwalk Pixar Promenade and Inside Out HQ) was developed focusing on multiple stories in one broad expanse of a land.

They said the land also helped more Pixar stories never seen in a Disney Park be injected including Inside Out Coco and even The Incredibles. Inside Out was determined as the story to be involved in a family attraction at one end of the boardwalk because the emotions appealed to everyone in the family so it was selected as the attraction without a height requirement that all could ride.

But Pixar Pier wasn’t the last example of the injection of synergy and tying attractions to relevant stories the presentation would discuss. For the next we head across the park back to the outskirts of Hollywoodland.

“What what are we doing? Why?” Imagineer John Mauro reportedly said when Bob Weiss called him about changing one of the highest rated popular attractions at the park (The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror) and adding a Guardians of the Galaxy overlay. Citing those aforementioned pillars Imagineer Claire Weiss said “Unlike Disneyland which is really about nostalgia and certain ‘time and place’ stories…[DCA] is about energy and diversity. Where [Tower of Terror] maybe felt at home in a different park for us it was the perfect place to inject energy. Guardians of the Galaxy franchise itself is Irreverent subversive it’s wild it's fast and we wanted to do something with that because that energy aligns with the park.”

Mauro added that the situation presented a challenge how do you take this already extremely popular attraction and make it as good as if not better than the original? Add to that a limited time frame where they have to do it quickly and well needed to debut alongside Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Claire Weiss said the design process was all visual storytelling having to scrap more traditional WED Processes to get the job done. “Massive Ingenuity Massive Creativity.” And really the attraction was considered a “down payment” for a new expansion that is on its way…

Under development and construction for about five years Avengers Campus proved to be easier than anticipated according to Steve Spiegel Executive Story Editor because the Marvel Superheroes are “like The Muppets. They live in our world. In some ways we can put them anywhere on Earth and it makes sense for an Avengers land.” But as for why they belong in Disney California Adventure? Spiegel says “Tony Stark has a house in Malibu the Pyms live in San Francisco and Stark Industries is in the South Bay. There are a lot of roots in California for the Avengers throughout their history already.”

Despite Lomboy’s insistence that DCA is different and a counter to Disneyland Brent Strong Executive Creative Director points out that so many parts of DCA are a fantastical and nostalgic “look back” but Avengers Campus has a spirit of innovation that allowed the opportunity to create DCA’s equivalent to Disneyland’s Tomorrowland. Really looking forward and tapping into the Silicon Valley and inventors like Stark. Mauro adds that hopefully it will be like a real Tomorrowland that is never complete and is always changing with the addition of new characters as the Marvel Universe continues to grow.

Spiegel adds that it’s also different because it’s not the usual “This is a top secret environment the guests are sneaking into” but the heroes have invited guests because they know the world needs more heroes.

Speaking on WEB Slingers the new Spider-Man attraction for the land Scot Drake Lomboy and Strong all decided they need an attraction with no height restriction for the smallest of kids to enjoy including their own.

The attraction will allow guests to sling webs with Spider-Man with Strong saying they knew they were on the right track and his three year old son (who had no previous exposure to a Spider-Man movie or comic book) saw the trademark web slinging pose while his dad was working and said “Oooo Spider-Man!”

The whole team also promises thanks to the time allotted by the global pandemic that there are tons and tons of easter eggs hidden throughout the WEB Slingers attraction so guests can “connect the dots” on how everything is interconnected to the Marvel Universe.

It has been a very busy 20 years for Disney California Adventure and the ride has been more thrilling and surprising than any attraction at any park anywhere.

However a high dependence on single-use plastics like multilayer sachets and pouches has led the Philippines to become a “sachet economy” that continues to worsen the alarming levels of marine plastic pollution in the region. By some estimates the Philippines consumes a staggering 163 million pieces of sachets every day.

Like many rapidly developing countries the Philippines grapples with unsustainable plastic production/consumption and insufficient solid waste management infrastructure. A staggering 2.7 million tons of plastic waste are generated in the Philippines each year and an estimated 20 percent ends up in the ocean. Comprised of more than 7500 islands the livelihoods of the Philippines’ coastal communities and the fishing shipping and tourism industries are especially vulnerable to the impacts of marine debris.

Understanding the urgent need to address the growth of the plastics industry and mismanagement of plastic waste the Philippines is developing and transitioning toward a circular economy. This study uses a plastic value chain approach to evaluate the Philippines’ plastics recycling industry and its role in supporting a circular economy. It identifies major challenges market drivers and opportunities for scaling-up recycling efforts via targeted public and private sector interventions.

The key plasThe Philippines recycled just 28% of key plastic resins in 2019.78% of the material value of the key plastic resins– upwards of US$890 million per year – is lost in the Philippines when recyclable plastic products are discarded rather than recycled into valuable materials.

78% of the material value of the key plastic resins– upwards of US$890 million per year – is lost in the Philippines when recyclable plastic products are discarded rather than recycled into valuable materials.

The Philippines had a large recycling capacity gap of 85% in 2019 (compared to Malaysia and Thailand across all four resins) and is a net exporter of plastic scrap.

Several structural challenges cause a market failure for plastics recycling:

High logistics costs limit recyclers from sourcing feedstock across the archipelago.

High electricity costs (38-67% higher than regional counterparts) especially burden recyclers that operate with low-efficiency equipment.

Intense competition from the informal recycling industry distorts the market for formal recyclers.

Significant material value is locked in low-value and hard-to-recycle flexible packaging which represents more than half of the plastics packaging used.

Low landfill tipping fees disincentivize local governments from investing in waste management solutions.

The small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that dominate the domestic recycling market are unable to meet multinational buyers’ requirements.

Other factors that exacerbate the market failure for plastics recycling include:

Fluctuations in virgin resin and oil prices

Lack of local recycled content requirements for key plastic resins

Challenging short- and long-term collection economics for the informal sector

Lack of “design for recycling” standards

Fragmented implementation of waste management

Lack of organic waste treatment facilities

Many of these challenges are amplified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in consumption patterns and low waste collection rates have led to supply reductions in the recycling industry while low oil prices have made it cheaper to use virgin rather than recycled plastic.

For example do organic waste diversion mandates result in in higher levels of physical contaminants such as glass plastics and other non-compostable materials? Are there added levels of chemical and biological compounds from the mandates as well including emerging contaminants (those compounds not yet regulated)?

The answers to these questions are important for several reasons. First composting and anaerobic digestion facility operators believe they are seeing increased non-compostable contamination which they say overburdens their operations and adds costs.

But another concern revolves around introducing contaminants harmful to humans such as heavy metals and pathogens back into the food system. For example food and other organic wastes can be turned into soil amendments through composting and used on gardens and fields. But that means any contaminants still residing in the waste could be reintroduced back into the food chain through crop production.

Recycling is further challenged because both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)hope to divert 50% of food waste going to landfills by 2030.

With funding provided by the Environmental Research & Education Foundation (EREF) researchers at the Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions at the University of Maine set about finding answers to these questions by collecting and analyzing food waste from two mandated food separation states (Massachusetts and Vermont) and one unregulated state (Maine). They also sampled waste from six different sources – groceries hospitals schools restaurants retirement communities and residential pick-up and drop-off locations. The food waste was processed in an industrial-grade food processor stored at -20°C and then shipped to the Maine Soil Testing Lab at the University of Maine for analysis. Seventy-one samples were submitted.

In addition to sampling different food wastes the researchers also wanted to know what perceptions food waste handlers had about the waste they were processing. For example were their suspicions that mandated food separation was contributing to an increase in physical biological and chemical contamination backed up by the science? And what were their perceptions about which kinds of chemical and biological contaminants were being collected along with the food waste?

The overall results surprised both the researchers and processors.

First the researchers found that mandated food source separation had no appreciable effect on contamination rates. In fact both mandated and non-mandated communities had similar levels of contamination whether it was physical (such as plastics) biological (such as common foodborne pathogens like Salmonella) or chemical (such as Per- and poly-fluorinated organics (PFAS)). Researchers suggested the results could have been from effective communication and outreach strategies in the roll-out of the food waste diversion efforts in Massachusetts and Vermont.

Second the perceptions of the composting and anaerobic digestion facility operators were different than reality. The operators believed there was appreciably more contamination rates in the communities where food waste diversion was mandated.

As far as the different types of contaminated materials that were found in the samples they broke down into several distinct groups: heavy metals organohalogens PFAS and antibiotic resistance genes.

HEAVY METALS

Eighty-two percent (82%) of the samples had some form of contamination whether they came from a state with mandated separation or one that was unregulated. Furthermore samples in both environments had similar non-compostable materials such as plastics gloves and fruit stickers. There were some variations in terms of where the food waste originated. For instance residential samples had significantly higher copper than retirement community and hospital samples which were higher than restaurant or school samples.

As for what chemical or biological contaminants were found in the samples researchers discovered a number of different compounds. For example researchers found a number of heavy metals in the samples such as lead chromium cadmium nickel tin and titanium. However the concentrations were all below the most stringent regulatory limits for soil used for comparison (75 and 25 mg/k) with the average concentrations being 21 and 4 mg/k and the maximum concentration being 71 and 14 mg/k respectively.

PATHOGENS

The samples were screened for three common foodborne pathogens as well -- Listeria monocytogenes non-typhoidal Salmonella and shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) – and while the pathogens were found in two of the samples researchers concluded that there was a relatively low incidence of pathogens in the food wastes they tested.

ORGANOHALOGENS

They also screened for organohalogenated compounds which are synthetic organic compounds that contain chlorine bromine and fluorine. Due to their persistence and bioaccumulative nature these compounds lead to environmental contamination and human exposure through multiple pathways such as direct skin contact inhalation drinking water and primarily food. Most of the sample however were below the detection limit of 5 mg/kg wet weight but 10 samples had measurable values that ranged from 5 – 89.7 mg/kg (ww) with all but the highest (ME restaurant) less than 12 mg/kg.

PFAS

Also found in the samples were different versions of PFAS (Per- and poly-fluorinated organics) a widely used industrial chemical compound. Fourteen of the samples had detectable perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) average 0.6; range 0.11-1 μg/kg); two contained perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) 0.11 and 0.15 μg/kg); and one contained perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) 0.28 μg/kg). The fact that a large number of the samples contained a PFAS compound was of concern to researchers because of the impacts these chemicals have on health and their potential to bioaccumulate.

Researchers also observed that food contact papers could be a source of contaminants such as PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) particularly at facilities that accept and compost coated papers with their food waste. This is an important finding as regulations are being proposed in different states to manage PFAS exposure. For example the state of New York recently enacted a law prohibiting the use of PFAS chemicals in food packaging.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE GENES

Another area of concern for the researchers was antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microbes evolve mechanisms that protect them from the effects of antimicrobials. When antibiotics are used in humans or animals approximately 80 - 90% of the ingested antibiotics are not broken down but pass through the body intact and enter the environment as waste. Thus they retain their ability to affect bacteria and promote antibiotic resistance even after they enter the soil or water as a waste product.

Three ARGs were screened in the study due to the use of the corresponding antibiotics in livestock (penicillins and tetracylines) -- tet(M) blaTEM and mcr-1. Sixty-eight (96%) samples were positive for tet(M) although 11 were below the researchers’ limit of quantification.

BlaTEM was also detected in 97% of samples although six of these detections were below their limit of quantification. β-lactams and tetracycline antibiotics are among the oldest antibiotics have been extensively used including in livestock rearing in the US and resistance genes were detected and isolated in food for a number of years. This could help explain the near ubiquitous detection of these antibiotic resistance genes in their food waste samples.

FOOD WASTE COMPOSTING AND ANAEROBIC DIGESTION

To better understand the perceptions of facilities that manage food waste related to contaminants the researchers sent surveys to 118 composting and anaerobic digestion facilities in Maine Vermont and Massachusetts from which they received 33 responses (28% response rate). The majority of respondents accepted waste from food processors followed by material from grocers restaurants institutions and residences.

What did the researchers learn?

Facilities who responded to the survey were primarily concerned about physical contamination a problem confirmed with the results (82% of samples contained non-food waste). However some did mention potential trace chemical and biological contamination but without much of a sense of the magnitude of the problem. Researchers also noted that much of their concern was about contamination of the carbon sources added to food waste during composting (wood chips hay bedding) which was not measured.

The food waste handlers also thought that the greatest risk of contamination came from institutions (e.g. colleges schools hospitals) followed by restaurants and residential sources.

Breanna Jackson was among about 20 Stockton residents who volunteered to pick up trash along Garfield Street in Stockton while participating in the Clean City Initiative. It employs new and existing programs to reduce trash accumulation and illegal dumping across the city. The effort is a collaboration between the City Manager's Office Public Works Department Stockton Police Department Republic Services Waste Management and community volunteers.



The community cleanup program has been going on since the beginning of the year. Program director Lana Lozano says ""there will be two community cleanups per district per year so 12 in all."" Another element of the initiative are community free recycling drop-off events. ""We work without haulers and you can drop off recycling there's shredding green waste (drop off) and these are all free to city of Stockton residents. There will 6 events starting in April.""



The Clean City Initiative has its own tab under Garbage and Recycling on the city of Stockton's website on which you can find upcoming events and a volunteer form. ""I think it's important because despite thinking 'it's their (the homeless') fault to pick up the trash' or anyone else's responsibility we're kind of in this together and all this trash affects us equally"" said volunteer Breanna Jackson.

When Wells Fargo hired Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in the late 1960s to advise on its plans for the first-ever index fund the economists made a curious discovery. The internal argument they triggered still echoes in the investment industry today.

Back then it was the heyday of Eugene Fama’s “efficient markets hypothesis”. This stipulated that the stock market was in practice unbeatable as all new relevant information was continually baked into prices. But professors Scholes and Black found that one could outperform by simply buying stocks with lower volatility possibly because investors systematically overpaid for more exciting choppier securities.

This was radical. Such a free lunch — getting both greater and steadier returns — contradicted economic dogma at the time which dictated that one could only generate greater returns by taking on greater risks. But the data was the data so Black and Scholes suggested that Wells Fargo set up a passive fund that would take advantage of this apparent anomaly.

Ultimately what was going to be named the Stagecoach Fund — a homage to Wells Fargo’s storied past — foundered. The bank instead eventually pivoted to a simpler S&P 500 index fund. But the core idea lives on in what is often called “minimum volatility” strategies. Today this is a nearly $90bn corner of the exchange-traded fund industry.

Unfortunately they have not lived up to expectations lately. The min-vol “factor” — as these investment signals are usually termed — is now the worst-performing of all the mainstream ones over the past year after cheap value stocks and smaller shares enjoyed a renaissance. This year min-vol has done worse than even once-hot momentum stocks which have been trashed in the recent violent equity market rotation caused by investors betting on a post-Covid old-economy boom.

Take BlackRock’s $28bn min-vol ETF the biggest in the field and a good proxy for how well the broader investment strategy is doing. Since the beginning of 2020 it is up about 4 per cent. The second-worst factor over that time is value which is now up nearly 15 per cent after a powerful bounce since last autumn. MSCI’s broader US stock market index has climbed almost 25 per cent over the same period.

This is not an isolated issue nor uniquely a US equity market phenomenon. BlackRock’s European global and emerging-market equivalents have all markedly underperformed their respective broader benchmarks.

Although the ETFs have largely done their job in being steadier than the broader market lately their volatility is only marginally lower. And that will be of little consolation to investors who have now somehow missed out on one of the most powerful 12-month periods for stock market returns in history. Worse for the argument that low-volatility stocks should at least in the long run deliver above-market returns the biggest min-vol ETFs have now all underperformed their conventional benchmarks over the past decade in some cases sharply so.

What has caused once-popular investment factor to fizzle so badly and can it enjoy a belated blossoming?

History holds some lessons in this respect: One of the reasons why Wells Fargo never followed through on the original idea proposed by professors Black and Scholes back in the late 1960s was that Bill Fouse one of its senior executives at the time and a pioneering quant in his own right argued that simply buying low-volatility stocks would erode the benefits of diversification: Steadier securities tend to be found in certain stable industries. In short he applied some common sense to what the data indicated.

It proved a fortuitous decision. If Wells Fargo had launched a leveraged low-volatility passive fund at the time it would likely have imploded in the 1974 bear market and might have set passive investing back by years.

Nowadays most factor strategies strive to be somewhat sector-neutral. In other words they try to avoid herding into just a few industries stay somewhat diversified and not diverge too far from the overall make-up of the stock market. But in practice min-vol strategies do tend to lean heavily into some specific corners of the market such as healthcare consumer staples and utilities which have underperformed lately.

However the broader more intractable problem may simply be that the min-vol anomaly first identified by Scholes and Black — greater and steadier returns — was simply too much of a free lunch to last for ever and has now gone the way of the dodo.

A suspect walked into the bank located at 5210 Laguna at 1:15 PM. Then the suspected handed a teller a note demanding money. The employees complied with the robber’s demand as they were afraid for their safety. They handed over an undisclosed amount to him.

The suspect was soon identified as 35 year old Jacob Garcia from Sacramento. With the help of the Sacramento Police Department the Elk Grove Police arrested Garcia at 2:00 AM on Wednesday morning March 17.

Seeking Community Aid

A photo of Garcia was shared on social media. This helped police catch him. On Tuesday evening a community member contacted the Elk Grove Police. The community member reported that the suspect was recognized and seen inside a business on Stockton Boulevard. When the police had arrived the suspect was no longer at the location. But police had confirmed that he was the man in the bank robbery.

In a press release the Elk Grove Police stated that Garcia had returned to the same business on Stockton Boulevard early Wednesday morning. It was at that location when Garcia was located and arrested.

Garcia has since been booked in the main county jail with a robbery charge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9mbHllcnMvd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tY2VudGVyLXJlb3BlbmVkLWZseWVycy1zaXhlcnMtMjAyMTAzMjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo Center GM on return of Flyers Sixers fans,"Flyers fans celebrate Flyers left wing Joel Farabee's first period goal against the Washington Capitals on March 7 the first day fans were allowed back into the Wells Fargo Center in more than a year.

The Flyers went 1-3 on their last homestand but the fans went undefeated. At least that’s the way Wells Fargo Center general manager Phil Laws saw it.

“The planning has paid off. The investment has paid off. And the fans have been great” said Laws. “We had heard all of these horror stories from other arenas and maybe were a little bit leery of how the fans were going to be when they came in. But the fact of the matter is the vast majority has been great.”

The Sixers play their fourth home game in front of fans tonight. The Flyers return to the Center with another four-game homestand starting Monday.

Pennsylvania last week eased the restriction on indoor capacity from 15% to 25% starting April 4. The city is maintaining the 15% but said it will review Gov. Tom Wolf’s recommendations. That would lift the Wells Fargo’s capacity from about 3000 to 5000 but Laws said they are still examining how to increase the size of crowds while still observing social distancing requirements.

The Sixers have 12 regular-season home games remaining from April 4 until the end of their season the Flyers 10.

“Fans have been cooperative. They’ve listened to the directions. They’ve worn their masks. They’ve done what we’ve asked of them. They’ve been fantastic. We feel good about moving to the next level.” - Wells Fargo Center general manager Phil Laws

Distancing at the merchandise store and making the QR code for the concession menu more visible to the fans was at the top of the lessons Laws and his staff have learned since allowing fans into the building on March 7.

“Putting it [the QR code] in the seats is really where it’s at” he said. “That’s working. People want to order food when they want to order food. They don’t want to go find a sign somewhere. They want to have it right there at their seat location.”

Now if only he could do something about the Flyers’ mediocre 7-5-2 home record ...

“We really have to thank the fans for their cooperation” he said. “Looking forward to seeing more of them as we move toward the playoffs. Can’t wait to get more folks in the building.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvNzZlcnMvbmV3cy9zaXhlcnMtZHdpZ2h0LWhvd2FyZC1sb3Zlcy1mYW5zLWJhY2stc291dGgtcGhpbGx50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dwight Howard Loves Having Fans Back in South Philly,"Dwight Howard never let the lack of Philadelphia 76ers fans at the Wells Fargo Center stop him from having a good time. Every time he took the floor at home Howard pretended to pump up a crowd that didn't exist to make the games in an empty arena feel as real as possible as he feeds off of the fans' energy.

But at this point Howard no longer has to pretend there are fans in the stands. While the Wells Fargo Center still isn't packing in 20000-plus people just yet the city of Philadelphia has allowed a little over 3000 fans in the building for the last few games.

As expected Howard was in his glory. No matter where he's at on the bench around the NBA's 'cool-off' station behind the basket on the court Howard finds ways to interact with the crowd. After Tuesday night's game against the New York Knicks Sixers head coach Doc Rivers mentioned that he believes the fans' presence fuels Howard and helps him play better.

""I think the fans help; he loves an audience"" Rivers said. And to no surprise the head coach was spot on. Following Wednesday night's game against the Milwaukee Bucks Howard expressed his appreciation for the crowd.

“I am so thankful” he said. “I’ve been loving every minute of having the fans in the stadium. It means so much to me. For me I know that everybody’s been at home during COVID. Now they get to see their team play. I just try to provide some energy and get the crowd into it because we miss these guys. We miss our fans. We miss them at the games.”

Sometime soon the Sixers could have even more fans added into the mix as the city is expected to raise the minimum from a little over 3000 fans in the arena to a little over 5000. For the 76ers that's a great sign as they always tend to play better in front of their own audience. For Howard specifically he'll surely enjoy it even more.

“It brings me so much joy and energy to see the crowd"" he continued. ""I’m grateful that the fans have been very appreciative of my hard work and energy and effort. When I get on the court it’s like I gotta hold myself to a higher standard because all the fans they’re looking for me to come out and play with energy and effort every night.”

Simply sign up to the Artificial intelligence myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Although the potential for artificial intelligence to transform healthcare in lower income countries has been much hyped the technology is proving genuinely useful in helping Africa overcome difficulties in tackling diseases.

Such technology can automate medical tasks and help doctors to do more with limited resources. It can even accelerate advances if certain barriers are overcome.

The work of minoHealth AI Labs the Ghana-based data science start-up that I founded offers one example. By collecting medical images we are seeking to automate radiology through the use of deep learning.

Using an algorithm called a convolutional neural network — a form of deep learning designed to emulate the way vision works in animals — we have been able to develop image recognition tools to help diagnose conditions including breast cancer pneumonia fibrosis and hernia.

We are exploring additional applications in neuroscience optometry oncology epidemiology and nutrition. We have developed systems to study and identify differences between populations with high and low immunity to malaria which could help develop more effective vaccines. We are researching digital diagnostics to speed up the detection of infectious diseases.

But to more fully realise the potential of AI we need to tackle five key barriers in lower and middle income countries.

Health facilities generate data but often lack the digital infrastructure for its proper storage. Patient records are poorly managed with medical centres often handing over test results to patients or other facilities without keeping a copy. This limits the data available to help develop and assess AI systems. Lower and middle income countries need to invest in more digital medical devices as well as digitisation systems.

Data culture

Health facilities need a “data culture” that values information and makes tools and resources available to clinicians. Those we work with in Ghana record and store digital patient records using multiple systems including electronic health records picture archiving and communication systems and radiology information systems.

Governments and health agencies should encourage health facilities and providers to adopt suitable clinical information systems — which are comprehensive and compatible — and support training for data-driven healthcare.

Regulations and standards

There is a need for appropriate regulations and standards for AI and data science. Some low- and middle-income countries already have legislation in place such as the pioneering 2012 Data Protection Act in Ghana adopted ahead of the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation. But legislation often does not include appropriate penalties — or goes unenforced.

Regulators need standards to assess AI applications in health before they are deployed.

An AI and health focus group on which I serve — a partnership between the UN’s International Telecommunication Union and the World Health Organisation — is developing new guidelines to help.

Many countries do not have the necessary expertise so we need open source digital benchmarking platforms that automatically audit machine learning systems and which countries can adopt or adapt. Companies also need to use “precision evaluation” — a technique to identify bias that scrutinises an AI system to assess its performance in different locations and by gender and age.

Adopting local solutions

While many countries rely on the use of western digital health technologies more need to prioritise foster and adopt their own approaches. Local developers are better able to understand and find appropriate solutions while fostering self-reliance and helping to nurture the local ecosystem.

We need more targeted investment for AI health start-ups in Africa connecting entrepreneurs with backers

For example Michael Endale worked with fellow Ethiopian software developers and the government last year to produce and support the uptake of seven apps to tackle Covid-19 from virus tracing to sharing patient information between health workers. The apps were more suited to Ethiopia than services developed abroad because they required little or no internet connectivity.

Funding

We need more targeted investment for AI health start-ups in Africa connecting entrepreneurs with backers. Across the Middle East and north Africa Turkey has provided most support so far followed by UAE and Kuwait. The pioneers who fund today have the potential to realise substantial returns in the future.

International development agencies should redirect funding from public universities to start-ups helping lower the risk for private investors to follow. Donors must not simply impose solutions but instead encourage proposals to meet broad gaps and needs. Positive models include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Grand Challenges and Unicef’s Innovation Fund which has supported 110 equity-free investments in 57 countries.

These five recommendations would help address the hurdles facing AI applications for health in Africa while allowing the sector to grow.

By bringing together local regional and global physicians researchers academics entrepreneurs and regulators societies with poor and expensive healthcare systems alike could see a democratisation of quality healthcare.

Experts advocate robust regulation of facial recognition technology to reduce discriminatory outcomes.

Font Size: A A A

After Detroit police arrested Robert Williams for another person’s crime officers reportedly showed him the surveillance video image of another Black man that they had used to identify Williams. The image prompted him to ask the officers if they thought “all Black men look alike.” Police falsely arrested Williams after facial recognition technology matched him to the image of a suspect—an image that Williams maintains did not look like him.

Some experts see the potential of artificial intelligence to bypass human error and biases. But algorithms used in artificial intelligence are only as good as the data used to create them—data that often reflect racial gender and other human biases.

In a National Institute of Standards and Technology report researchers studied 189 facial recognition algorithms—“a majority of the industry.” They found that most facial recognition algorithms exhibit bias. According to the researchers facial recognition technologies falsely identified Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more often than they did white faces. The technologies also falsely identified women more than they did men—making Black women particularly vulnerable to algorithmic bias. Algorithms using U.S. law enforcement images falsely identified Native Americans more often than people from other demographics.

These algorithmic biases have major real-life implications. Several levels of law enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection use facial recognition technology to support policing and airport screenings respectively. This technology sometimes determines who receives housing or employment offers. One analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union reportedly warned that false matches “can lead to missed flights lengthy interrogations watch list placements tense police encounters false arrests or worse.” Even if developers can make the algorithms equitable some advocates fear that law enforcement will employ the technology in a discriminatory manner disproportionately harming marginalized populations.

A few U.S. cities have already banned law enforcement and other government entities from using facial recognition technology. But only three states have passed privacy laws pertaining to facial recognition technology. Currently no federal law governs the use of facial recognition technology. In 2019 members of the U.S. Congress introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act. If passed it would direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to regulate the industry and require companies to assess their technology continually for fairness bias and privacy issues. As of now the FTC only regulates facial recognition companies under general consumer protection laws and has issued recommendations for industry self-regulation.

Given its potential for harm some experts are calling for a moratorium on facial recognition technology until strict regulations are passed. Others advocate an outright ban of the technology.

This week’s Saturday Seminar addresses fairness and privacy concerns associated with facial recognition technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9zcG9ydC5jb20vZjEvbmV3cy93aWxsaWFtcy1yZWQtbGl2ZXJpZXMtaW4tZGVmZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtd2luZmllbGQtZXJhLzU3ODg1NzEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Williams' red F1 liveries: In defence of the Winfield era,"The blue white and gold branding of Rothmans had become a motorsport staple of the 1980s and ’90s having emblazoned Porsche’s 956 prototypes the Prodrive-run Subaru World Rally Championship team and Honda’s 500cc grand prix bikes across the years. Then assuming title sponsorship of Williams’ Formula 1 team at its peak it enjoyed four successful years culminating in back-to-back titles for Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve in 1996 and 1997.

Then parent company Rothmans International made the decision to cede its famous colours and instead use the Williams team to promote its Australian brand Winfield. The Williams cars were stripped of the blue the team had run since 1985 and turned out in a red white and gold scheme for the 1998 season. It was deliciously sacrilegious particularly following a heated battle with Ferrari for supremacy in the 1997 title fight that it would cast aside its heritage and fall in line with its rival team.

Had any other team painted its car red in 1998 (except perhaps McLaren) then it’s doubtful that anyone would have batted an eyelid. Given that context of Williams and Ferrari having fought so fractiously against each other the previous year culminating in Michael Schumacher’s botched swipe at Villeneuve for Williams to ring the change seemed decidedly off the mark in many peoples’ eyes.

It’s perhaps unfortunate that the switch to a red scheme coincided with a decline in fortunes for Williams having been continuously at the sharp end of the grid. The loss of design dynamo Adrian Newey had deprived Williams of its driving force on the technical team while Renault’s departure also left the team fielding the second-string Mecachrome engines. Villeneuve duly went from winning a title to finishing fifth in the standings 79 points away from eventual title winner Mika Hakkinen as Williams embarked upon a fallow period.

Most of that performance shortfall was wrapped in Williams’ inability to adapt successfully to the narrow-track regulations that were installed to slow the cars down. McLaren now under the technical guidance of Newey did so expertly – moving the leading edge of the sidepod forward to cope more adeptly with the further-inboard tyre wake.

Naturally history does not look favourably on the red period at Williams. But taking out the context of a plunge in fortunes and the car looking a bit too similar to the Ferrari at a distance the cars looked great. The FW20 of 1998 perhaps took some refining and eventually the livery had some of the white patches whittled away to clean up the block of sponsors at the front but the 1999 rendition was a wonderfully ’90s concoction – fitting before the transition to the new millennium. The gold and blue flashes and the more sculpted white fill down the centre produced a very cool looking car.

The switch in Winfield’s font design also helped the car too as the serifs played with the brush-stroke flashes around the sidepod area. Perhaps from a true livery design standpoint the 1999 edition shouldn’t have worked but among an already-colourful field that season you could see it coming a mile off.

That year’s FW21 was an altogether neater machine too as designers Geoff Willis and Gavin Fisher had understood the previous year’s foibles. The team had lowered the centre of gravity in the new car and although the Mecachrome – now badged as Supertec – received upgrades it was still plenty of horsepower down on the leading powerplants.

Williams had expected the car to be much stronger than the 1998 machine however and although Ralf Schumacher scored an impressive 35 points in his first year with the team CART champion Alessandro Zanardi’s inability to score left Williams fifth overall in a congested midfield. Zanardi’s struggles were well publicised being unable to deal with the rock-hard grooved tyres in low-speed corners.

Schumacher almost won the madcap 1999 European Grand Prix however which would have earned the red scheme more adulation – after all the general consensus is that a successful car is a beautiful one. Unfortunately a puncture tore victory from his hands and Williams never managed to take either of its red Formula 1 cars to the top step of the podium.

F1 European GP ’99 retrospective: The day Ralf stepped out of Michael’s shadow

Perhaps it’s just the nostalgia talking given that the 1999 season was the first full season this writer watched but the ugly ducklings of the Williams era should be celebrated as daring designs.

Woody Woodpecker’s avian mug on the nose only adds to the nostalgia factor and although it’s hard to fully defend something’s sartorial qualities – especially when it’s completely subjective – the red Williams liveries were not the monsters they were made out to be.

Although the following BMW-influenced liveries arguably looked cleaner their corporate nature took away some of the soul. Admittedly they weren’t all bad; BMW’s test livery grafted onto the FW20 was wonderful. The dark blue car marked by pinstripes which all faded to white on the nose looked incredibly slick.

As a child that livery got me very excited about BMW’s return to F1 – only for me to open up a copy of F1 Racing (now GP Racing of course) a couple of months later to be dismayed by the much more insipid 2000 livery. Perhaps that crushing disappointment was the reason I cherish the red ones so much...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbG9jYWwtYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kdXN0cmlhbC11cGRhdGUtMjAyMS10aGUtd2VzdC1mcmFzZXItZmFtaWx5LXN0aWxsLWdyb3dpbmctYWZ0ZXItNzUteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INDUSTRIAL UPDATE 2021: The West Fraser family — still growing after 75 years,"Mauro Calabrese

Industrial Update 2021

It all started with a fishing trip by two brothers from Seattle and the purchase of Two Mile Planing Mills in Quesnel. In 1955 brothers Sam Pete and Bill Ketcham purchased the mill for $60000. Today West Fraser has become one of the largest manufacturers of solid wood and panels globally and is an integral part of the local economy here in Williams Lake.

Our start in B.C.

After the Ketcham brothers got started Sam moved to Quesnel to run the mill. As the mill was pretty run down the real value in the purchase was Doug Floyd and the 12-person crew that came with the mill. About the acquisition Pete Ketcham said “[It] worked out to $4000 for the mill and $56000 for getting Doug Floyd with the deal.”

Sam and Doug fine-tuned operations at that old planer starting a period of phenomenal growth. At the time there were many bush mills in the surrounding region and Sam’s effectiveness at purchasing those locations earned him the nickname of Bushmill Sam. He was determined to acquire enough fibre supply to feed the operation. In 1956 the Ketchams operated two bush mills that produced rough lumber in Riske Creek including the Bald Mountain #1 mill.

In 1957 the company expanded to Williams Lake with the majority acquisition of the Swetnam brothers’ lumber companies including Wright Lumber.

Wright lumber had a planer and a gang mill located at the site where Blacky’s Car Wash and Downtown Service are today. By 1961 the Ketchams had purchased the entire operation including several more acquisitions.

By this time the company had adopted the name West Fraser. They believed Williams Lake would be the centre of their operations feeding the mills with timber from west of the Fraser River. In 1963 the company purchased Quesnel’s largest sawmill Brownmiller Brothers which was vital in securing West Fraser’s future.

Sam Ketcham loved the outdoors which drew him to the Cariboo. He moved to Williams Lake in 1959 with his wife Janet to run the operations from Williams Lake and he was the heart and soul of West Fraser in its early years. He lived there until 1974 and was an integral part of the community. Ken Seaman an employee who designed built and renovated many of the early West Fraser facilities said “Sam Ketcham ruled by consensus before the word was invented.”

In 1972 a new sawmill was built in Williams Lake where the West Fraser Sawmill is currently located and the planer was moved shortly after to the new site.

Unfortunately Sam died in a plane crash on November 7 1977 along with West Fraser’s first forester Phil Bodman and pilot Ken Waines. The company eventually recovered from the loss with Janet Ketcham becoming a director Doug Johnston becoming president and Pete Ketcham became chairman of the board.

Over the decades West Fraser would expand across B.C. Alberta and now the world adding new forest products such as pulp and OSB to its portfolio. In 1985 Hank Ketcham (Pete’s son) became president and CEO and guided an era of significant expansion.

The acquisition of Weldwood of Canada in 2004 nearly doubled the size of the company and gave West Fraser ownership of a plywood plant along with the sawmill in Williams Lake.

West Fraser currently employs approximately 450 employees at the two facilities in Williams Lake with the same number of logging hauling forestry maintenance and other contractors.

With the recent acquisition of Norbord West Fraser has grown to be one of the largest manufacturers of solid wood products globally and now panels. Even though West Fraser is such a large company currently employing 10000 people worldwide it has been faithful to its small company roots and family feeling established by the Ketcham family 65 years ago. Visits by current West Fraser CEO Ray Ferris to town are not uncommon.

The company has had the same goals for decades. Those are developing and maintaining excellence in performance and people leadership in our field challenge and satisfaction responsibility in communities in which we work and profitability and growth.

The last year of dealing with Covid-19 has been difficult for many people with some parallels to the 2017 wildfires. It has been encouraging to see how the people and businesses in Williams Lake and surrounding communities have come together again and made the sacrifices necessary to get through this latest crisis.

Mauro Calabrese is a Professional Forester and Biologist and the planning superintendent for West Fraser’s South Cariboo Woodlands. He was born and raised in Williams Lake and is proud to call Williams Lake home with his wife Kendra and boys Massimo Luca Mattteo and Alessandro.

Ben Affleck’s Eastern Congo Initiative (ECI) was founded with the goal of helping the eastern region of the country develop and become successful and self-sustainable. The year 2020 marks 10 years of the organization’s existence.

The Eastern Congo Initiative

In 2006 actor and director Ben Affleck visited eastern Congo for the very first time. Not only was the country struggling with poverty but violent conflicts in Congo had also cost the lives of approximately 3.5 million people. Despite the suffering around him however Affleck was met with mostly optimism from the Congolese. He witnessed a lot of effort being put into the community to give people access to services like education and healthcare. In 2010 a few years after his first visit to eastern Congo he co-founded the Eastern Congo Initiative together with social entrepreneur Whitney Williams.

ECI’s Collaborative Work

Affleck and Williams founded ECI based on the belief that community-based approaches work best. This meant supporting Congolese organizations that were already familiar with the region and its problems as the best way to contribute to positive development. Thus ECI works closely with local community leaders and organizations to encourage self-sustainable solutions to address problems directly in the area. ECI’s contribution to improving the living conditions in eastern Congo comes mostly in the form of advocacy and grant-making. Affleck and Williams have been advocating for policy change so that the U.S. Government gets more involved in eastern Congo.

ECI’s 10 Years of Success

Over the last decade Ben Affleck’s Eastern Congo Initiative has provided $10.5 million worth of grants to support organizations in the region. One of its main focuses in grant-making is to encourage the empowerment of Congolese women and youth. For example ECI partnered to develop a program that allowed approximately 150 female cocoa farmers to learn important economic and literary skills. These efforts enabled the women to learn financial planning and understand economic processes better in order to help them sell their products.

Furthermore ECI’s advocacy attempts within the United States have been rather successful. For example the organization managed to get important politicians like Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA-9) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to co-sponsor bills and legislation to support eastern Congo.

The Asili Social Business Platform

Another more recent success of Ben Affleck’s Eastern Congo Initiative is that it became an autonomous part of the organization Alight in 2020. ECI now runs Asili a social business platform that Alight co-designed with Congolese locals.

Similar to ECI Asili works very closely with organizations in eastern Congo and has been providing capital for the establishment of independent and successful Congolese businesses since 2013. A total of 120000 people benefit from Asili services like access to health clinics and clean affordable water. For ECI the Asili model will help it to help more people more efficiently.

The Congolese Coffee Industry

Before the war destroyed most of Congo’s crops the country was among the world’s most successful suppliers of coffee. Regardless the weather conditions the natural resources and the knowledge of the Congo’s farmers still make coffee the country’s best chance for development and economic growth. Several famous companies like Starbucks and Theor Chocolate have already started using cocoa grown in Congo for their products and the market for coffee is constantly expanding all over the world. Both ECI and Asili have recognized the huge potential for Congo’s coffee industry and have been supporting the Congolese farmer and coffee cooperatives with financial means knowledge and global political outreach.

For example in 2019 Ben Affleck’s Eastern Congo Initiative gave an $18000 grant to three Congolese coffee cooperatives. More than 7000 member farmers benefited from supplies and training that the grant allowed for. This enabled them to supply the coffee giant Starbucks. The cooperatives are now self-sustainable and can now easily receive credits from banks without relying on aid.

Furthermore after ECI took over Asili the business platform instantly partnered up with Nespresso to sponsor the production and release of a single-origin coffee Kahawa ya Congo. The coffee comes from USDA-certified organic beans grown by Congolese farmers in the Minova region.

The Future

Ben Affleck’s Eastern Congo Initiative has made strides that clearly show the organization’s commitment and dedication to helping the people of Congo. The ECI’s efforts provide hope to Congolese people for a better and brighter future.

Enjoy this latest wave of Vegas casino resort openings,"With Circa opening in October Virgin Hotels Las Vegas debuting Thursday and Resorts World Las Vegas on deck for the summer the city is in the midst of a new wave.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

We’re in the middle of a wave of new casino openings which is perfect timing for Southern Nevada considering the need to emerge from the lost year of COVID-19.

Virgin Hotels Las Vegas opens its doors Thursday with some crowd-pleasing features highlighted by its restaurant lineup. Be assured that there’s not a single guitar or vinyl disc on any of the walls from the old Hard Rock Hotel that first opened in March 1995.

As openings go Virgin’s arrival will be a little different from the traditional ribbon-cutting although it continues a pattern that has been in place for the last three decades in our city: New casino openings often seem to come in waves of three.

The current trio includes Circa on Oct. 28 Virgin on Thursday and Genting Group’s Resorts World Las Vegas sometime in the summer.

So while many Virgin visitors will be looking for clues about what was where when the building existed as the Hard Rock others will just enjoy the fresh Virgin ambiance filled with imagery of a journey through the desert. It’s not quite the same as checking out a brand-new property but it’s still good.

It’s going to be interesting to see how that plays in Las Vegas in what will be the first casino operated by a tribal enterprise the Mohegan Sun group of Connecticut.

But back to that pattern of three that has been a part of our more recent history. It really started with the November 1989 opening of The Mirage although there were lots of casino-hotels already open before that.

The list of vintage properties starts in downtown with the Golden Gate (January 1906) the Golden Nugget (August 1946) and Binion’s (August 1951) with the Strip’s Flamingo sandwiched in there in December 1946.

After that came Sahara (October 1952) Tropicana (April 1957) what’s now The Linq (opened as Flamingo Capri in 1959) Planet Hollywood (opened as the Tally-Ho in February 1963) Four Queens (June 1966) Caesars Palace (August 1966) Circus Circus (October 1968) and Westgate (opened as the International in July 1969).

The ’70s opened with Harrah’s Las Vegas (July 1973) Bally’s (opened as MGM Grand in December 1973) Oyo (opened as a Howard Johnson in 1973) California Hotel (January 1975) Main Street Station (opened as the Holiday International in 1978) The Cromwell (opened as the Barbary Coast in March 1979) and D Las Vegas (opened as Sundance in July 1980).

Several other storied casino resorts with historic names came and went throughout those years: Riviera Stardust and Aladdin (which sat where Planet Hollywood is now) among them.

But it was in 1989 that things really got interesting when Steve Wynn opened The Mirage built at a cost of $630 million and critics said it was doomed to financial failure. They were wrong.

That first wave of development included The Mirage followed by the off-Strip Rio (January 1990) and Excalibur (June 1990).

The next trifecta wave was one of my personal favorites because the openings all occurred within three months of each other in 1993.

On Oct. 15 of that year the pyramid portion of Luxor with “inclinators” instead of elevators debuted. That was followed Oct. 26 by Treasure Island with a Hollywood panache only Steve Wynn could dream up coordinating cannon fire from one of the two sailing ships in front of the building with the implosion of the Dunes which was to become the site of Wynn’s next resort Bellagio.

The last of the three openings was the MGM Grand on Dec. 18 at the time the largest hotel in the world with a theme park that would open months later.

The next blast of openings were more spread out.

The Strat which saw multiple delays in its construction and once was the site of Bob Stupak’s Vegas World opened to the public in April 1996. That was followed by the Monte Carlo now known as Park MGM in June 1996 and New York-New York in January 1997.

The next wave of openings actually had four resorts opening within a year of each other.

Bellagio opened on a windy night in October 1998 — and the spray from the fountains rained on guests watching the show. Next came Mandalay Bay (March 1999) and The Venetian (May 1999) with openings coming full circle to Paris Las Vegas (September 1999) across the street from Bellagio.

One property the Palms opened in November 2001.

The last wave wasn’t much of a wave at all thanks to the Great Recession. Palazzo opened its doors in December 2007 M Resort in March 2009 and The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in December 2010.

The crest of the newest wave is fast approaching with details starting to emerge on Resorts World.

Is it available to purchase as memorabilia? I know when the Riviera was imploded they sold off casino floor and room furnishings and I wish I had bought a piece as it was my favorite old casino.

A:

There haven’t been too many implosions of consequence in recent years other than the Riviera which you mentioned. The Riv was imploded in 2015 just short of its 60th anniversary. Most of its furnishings including 2075 guest rooms and suites worth of furniture and fixtures all the gaming tables and stools from the casino the bar and restaurant furnishings a vast array of commercial kitchen equipment chandeliers office furniture pool and patio furniture sports memorabilia and on and on were ""re-marketed"" by National Content Liquidators in a $3 million sale. This is what happens to the furnishings from most hotels that close for one reason or another; in its business life NCL has conducted more than 1000 such sales.

Everyone was welcome to buy the items over the four-day sale. Admission just to get in to see it all was $10.

In the case of the Stardust brought down in 2007 Boyd Gaming spokesman David Strow says “All of the furnishings (and most of the other items) were sold after the property closed [presumably by a liquidator] but we did keep a few items around. Most notably we used some of the ‘stars’ from the Stardust marquee in the design of 90 Ninety one of our restaurants at the Suncoast. We do have a few small items left like dice cards and matchbooks … but that’s about all that is left now from the Stardust.”

Another famous implosion back in the day (1993) was Steve Wynn’s takedown of the Dunes. Recalls former Mirage Resorts spokesman Alan Feldman “In those days most old hotel furniture was sold to brokers like Guy Deiro who ran a pretty big auction company in Las Vegas. (He was also quite a character typical of old Vegas.). He in turn often packaged up the furniture in smaller lots and sold it to hotels and motels all over the country. I’m not 100 percent certain about the Dunes but that’s my best guess.

“A few years later when we remodeled Treasure Island all of that furniture went to Deiro. I asked him what on Earth he would do with 2800 sets of identical tables chairs headboards etc. He told me he was putting them in lots of 30-40 sets and selling them to Best Westerns across the country.”

Though it hasn't been imploded when construction on the Fontainebleau was shut down amidst bankruptcy proceedings its furnishings were sold off to the Plaza; the Downtown Grand brought several of its fancy escalators at fire-sale prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAzLTIxL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtb2ZmZXJzLXRvLWJ1eS1jcm93bi1yZXNvcnRzLWluLTYtMi1iaWxsaW9uLWRlYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone Doubles Down on Hospitality in $6.2 Billion Crown Bid,"Blackstone Group Inc. offered to buy Crown Resorts Ltd. in an A$8.02 billion ($6.2 billion) deal pouncing on the troubled Australian casino operator while it’s under assault from domestic regulators.

It’s like the week before Christmas for a tot who can’t wait to open presents.

In this case the present is a return to normal life in Southern Nevada and the sparkling wrapped gifts are the promises that things are going to get better sooner rather than later.

This is what pent-up demand looks like.

The evidence is all around with some indicators on the near horizon and some a little further away.

Trends hinting at Las Vegas’ return have been mounting over the past few weeks as COVID-19 case numbers fell.

Encouraging trends

Experts say the availability of vaccines should help make more Americans comfortable returning to destinations like Las Vegas.

“As more and more people are vaccinated more and more people are going to feel comfortable traveling and feel comfortable in crowds” said Clyde Barrow a gaming industry expert and professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

The change of heart comes just after the travel industry’s U.S. economic output was estimated to have lost $1.1 trillion in 2020 according to a recent report from the U.S. Travel Association.

But many people — including those who have not yet been vaccinated — view the dropping COVID-19 case numbers as a green light to travel again. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still advising Americans to delay their vacation plans but tourism experts say many have a desire to travel that outweighs concerns about catching the virus.

“Everything is going in a better direction and there’s a lot of pent-up demand” said Debi Nutton a gaming consultant and former Wynn Resorts Ltd. executive.

Higher room rates

And as more visitors fill Las Vegas’ resorts the city is starting to return to some sense of normalcy.

Room rates shot up over the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament. Hotel rooms at Palazzo Linq and Planet Hollywood are available seven days a week again. Buffets and dayclubs — two major taboos at the height of the pandemic — are returning albeit with amended operations. Fans are back at Golden Knights games again. Nearly 40 shows are performing on the Strip.

The list goes on.

Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority President and CEO Steve Hill said the problem many entertainment venues are facing now is that to maintain social distancing crowds are greatly reduced and many shows including Cirque du Soleil performances need a full house to be profitable.

“Elimination of social distancing will be key to filling entertainment venues” Hill said.

“We think as we head into summer the opportunity to open up attendance to 100 percent should be there with the caveats that we want to make sure we don’t have some completely left turn with a variant and obviously in order for that to take place the vaccine rollout needs to continue with at least the pace we’re at now.”

Gaming consultant Josh Swissman of The Strategy Organization said all of the trends that have been building up over the past few weeks are a sign that Las Vegas is on track to return to its former glory.

“In their own small individual way (these indicators) lead to a slow thoughtful building up of momentum and return to people actually coming to Las Vegas to enjoy themselves in greater numbers” he said.

“(These are signs) that point toward Vegas getting a little bit closer to what Vegas was in terms of America’s favorite place to come and enjoy yourself.”

Greater capacity

Loosened restrictions have helped open the doors for returning visitors. Restaurants and casino floors are allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity up from 25 percent a few weeks back and certain large gatherings that had been capped at 20 percent can fill up to half of their capacity.

“With Gov. Sisolak’s loosening of the capacity restrictions I think that has made (casino) companies even more confident that the recovery will continue” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said.

He added that even though booking windows are still short “Strip operators are just becoming more enthused about what the summer could look like.”

The positive trends seem to have come at an opportune moment. The tourist corridor’s newest property Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is set to open next week pool season is kicking off at resorts across the valley and the city is potentially just months away from seeing major conventions return.

“I think the COVID-related news has been positive of late and people are starting to travel again” said Nehme Abouzeid founder and president of marketing consultancy LaunchVegas LLC.

“My friends in entertainment tell me advance tickets are selling well” Abouzeid said. “The warm weather is arriving and the pools here look inviting. Quite rightly Vegas never stopped marketing itself to the world since we knew that while COVID was going to be serious and protracted it would still be a relative blip and that our core industry would have to find a way back. People still longed to come here — nothing went wrong structurally with consumer demand for Vegas; they were simply responding to the pandemic.”

The sense of optimism surrounding Las Vegas tourism is refreshing but experts warn that the city still faces a long road to recovery with possible bumps along the way.

For one weekday visitation is still struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels. Strip occupancies today hover between 70 and 90 percent but midweek rooms are typically only 40 to 60 percent full.

Those numbers aren’t expected to fully bounce back until the city sees the return of international visitors and meetings and convention bookings.

Truist gaming analyst Barry Jonas said in-person conventions are expected to return this summer but he expects a “more lagged” recovery for midweek business travel relative to the weekend leisure travel.

“We’re certainly starting to see a return of Las Vegas tourism” Jonas said but “the improvements are more pronounced on the weekends.”

Threat from variants

Another surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases could impede recovery. Some health experts worry about yet another spike in cases as variants of the virus continue to spread across the country.

That could lead to resorts facing strict operating restrictions again.

“While we are thankful that the destination is bouncing back well we need to be mindful that one slip in the numbers could reverse the trend as we saw last November when the governor imposed the cut in capacity” said Brendan Bussmann of Global Market Advisors.

The rapidly changing numbers in both reduced cases and vaccinations has resulted in some organizations having to speed up their plans to accommodate the pent-up demand.

Hill told a Nevada Commission on Tourism recovery subcommittee Thursday that the LVCVA and its advertising consultant R&R Partners is considering bumping up a paid advertising and marketing campaign to attract leisure travelers.

“We will evolve to telling our own message again … the governor’s decision to open up vaccinations to everyone on April 5 is also a signal for us to speed up from what we intended to do toward the end of April probably to the middle of April” Hill said.

“The trends on the leisure side have followed the health numbers almost exactly. As things have gotten better the interest in travel and the bookings we are seeing both now and in the future are really good showing a lot of improvement” he said.

There are other indications some of the long-term indications are looking good.

The Life is Beautiful music and arts festival scheduled for downtown Las Vegas Sept. 17-19 sold out 50000 passes in record time hours after they first went on sale.

World of Concrete approved

Organizers of the World of Concrete a major citywide convention that routinely draws 60000 people to Southern Nevada announced Wednesday that they had received permission from the Nevada Department of Business and Industry to stage their show from June 8-10 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Hill and other tourism leaders in the state had pointed to World of Concrete as the likely first major show to return to the trade show fold.

“The entire industry was watching to see if the World of Concrete could happen” Hill said. “The fact that it did has resulted in three shows approved in the last 24 hours following that.

“This will be the first major show to take place across the United States” he said. “Even though other states have been open to doing it those shows have not been able to move forward because of the health situation and getting exhibitors to commit to come and attendees to attend regardless of what the states’ protocols or rules were those major shows have not happened.”

And conventions can also be important to leisure travel.

“I think people are desperate to get out of their houses and go anywhere” said Pam Robinson chairwoman of the Commission on Tourism’s recovery subcommittee. “When people come for conventions they often add a day to their trips.”

Conventions and trade shows are big drivers of tourism for Southern Nevada. Executives for nearly every publicly traded Las Vegas-based company that have convention facilities — MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Inc. Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. among them — remarked during their fourth-quarter earnings calls how strong their convention calendars are looking for late 2021 2022 and 2023.

“We’ve been wandering in the abyss for almost a year now … and you can clearly see the light shining through at this point in Las Vegas” Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said during a February call with investors.

“We feel very good that we’ve seen the bottom in Vegas and in the business and that we’re only going to keep getting better.”

Anticipating eventual high demand the LVCVA tended to its convention infrastructure.

The organization months ago committed to having its new $987.1 million West Hall and its $52.5 million underground people-mover completed in time for the 2021 CES show. When the Consumer Technology Association operators of CES announced in July that it was canceling an in-person show the LVCVA went ahead and completed construction.

Trade shows that had been canceled or postponed began scrambling for available dates to stage their shows.

The LVCVA also moved ahead with its plan to purchase the Las Vegas Monorail Co. out of bankruptcy. Hill said the 3.9-mile elevated electric transit system is critical to moving conventioneers to shows when they return. As a result the LVCVA expects the monorail to resume operations around the Memorial Day weekend.

What could go wrong

While the Las Vegas reawakening shows blue skies in most areas there are still some reasons to doubt everything will go smoothly and many questions remain unanswered.

Clark County officials are hopeful that between 60 percent and 70 percent of its residents will get their vaccinations by the end of May. What if they don’t? What happens if the COVID-19 variants spread and the public has doubts that any vaccination would be effective?

Worse what if vaccinations aren’t effective against newly discovered variants?

While tourism leaders are confident that conventions and trade shows will come back strong what will attendance look like? Will a show that normally draws 50000 people see only 25000?

That’s one of the worries for shows that typically attract an international audience like CES. While Nevada and the United States are on track for more visitation there isn’t much they can do about travelers from Europe Asia and even Canada.

Nevertheless experts are optimistic for Las Vegas’ future.

“We don’t know what’s going to happen. … We may see some stops and starts” UNLV Assistant Professor of Hospitality Amanda Belarmino said. But “I think this is the beginning of a long-term recovery.”

Bussmann concurs.

“As long as this trend continues it bodes well for the long term recovery that will include the business and MICE (meetings incentives conferencing and exhibitions) customer coming back to Las Vegas” he said. “With World of Concrete set for June let’s hope the trend continues to allow this event to come off what has historically been one of the largest gaming shows in the destination. Assuming this happens and we have no set back it could make for a nice third and fourth quarter of bringing business back to Las Vegas.”

Encouraging numbers

The seven-day average for new cases reported in the U.S. was 53200 as of Friday according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a sharp decline from the seven-day average peak of 249389 in January.

The drop comes as more Americans are getting shots in arms; as of Friday about 16 percent of U.S. adults had been fully vaccinated.

The vaccination rate is expected to build as more age groups become eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Starting April 5 anyone 16 and over in Nevada will be able to get their shots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTIyL3doYXQtaHVyZGxlcy1kb2VzLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtZmFjZS1pbi1pdHMtMjQ4LWJpbGxpb24tdGFrZW92ZXItLzEzMjY3MDM00gEnaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEzMjY3MDM0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone's $8b Crown takeover bid faces hurdles like whether James Packer will want a higher price,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-22/what-hurdles-does-blackstone-face-in-its-248-billion-takeover-/13267034 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTIyL3doYXQtaHVyZGxlcy1kb2VzLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtZmFjZS1pbi1pdHMtMjQ4LWJpbGxpb24tdGFrZW92ZXItLzEzMjY3MDM00gEnaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEzMjY3MDM0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

That tournament was canceled by the MSHSL with two days left on March 13 2020 while the boys’ basketball section finals and state tournament the following week were also canceled.

State wrestlers were fortunate to see their season come to an end with the experience of a full tournament. Two wrestlers in the area that were certainly most fortunate were Derek Steele and Drayden Morton two Sibley East wrestlers that took home first-place medals after the individual tournament concluded on February 29 2020. Both wrestlers were also named last year’s All-Journal Co-Wrestlers of the Year.

Steele won his title at 113 pounds while Morton won his at 120.

Steele ended his season with a 50-2 record. On Day 1 of the state individual tournament he defeated Crookston’s Ethan Bowman by a 13-0 major decision and Belgrade-Brooten-Elrosa’s Ryan Jensen by a 4-1 decision. On Day 2 Steele picked up a 5-4 decision win over Kerkhoven-Murdock-Sunburg’s Coy Gunderson to move to a championship match with United North Central’s Ethan Hendrickson a match that he won by a 4-2 decision to claim Class A’s first-place medal at 113.

Morton went 28-3 last season and ended his second with his second consecutive first-place medal at state. On Day 1 of the 2020 individuals he first defeated Blue Earth Area’s Davis Sunken by a 5-2 decision and Long Prairie-Grey Eagle/Browerville’s Justin Crandall by a 10-1 major decision.

Morton then picked up a 2-1 decision over Atwater-Cosmos-Grove City’s Kelvin Andrade-Ponce in the semifinals before beating Caledonia-Houston’s Brandon Ross by a 3-0 decision for the first-place medal at 120.

Also for Sibley East Lincoln Carpenter finished with a fourth-place medal at 138.

New Ulm Area saw two wrestlers reach the state individuals in Cole Ranweiler and Colby Wenninger. Ranweiler competed at 170 pounds and dropped a 12-8 decision to St. Peter’s Eli Hunt. Ranweiler was unfortunately denied a wrestleback match later on finishing his season with a 38-8 record after Hunt lost his next match and was awarded the wrestleback match as a result.

Wenninger finished his senior year with a 32-15 record and fell to Fergus Falls’ Dustin Portales in the opening round by a fall in 58 seconds. In a wrestleback he was pinned by Annand/M Lk Lightning’s Kessler Kenning in 45 seconds.

Also competing at the tournament from the area last year were Springfield’s Owen Bertram (120) Kadin Johnson (170) and Mason Rummel (220).

Bertram finished his senior year with a 44-7 record and went 1-2 at the state individuals. After falling to Andrade-Ponce in the opening round Bertram stayed alive by pinning BOLD’s Austin Kiecker in 2:38. He then was eliminated by LPGE/Browerville’s Justin Crandall by a 9-7 decision.

Johnson was unfortunately eliminated on Day 1 after being pinned by Wyatt Simon of Maple River (3:06) and Kolbe Booker of All Saints Home School (2:20).

Rummel had the best showing at the tournament for the Tigers placing sixth. He first defeated BOLD’s Tim Peppel by fall in 4:59 before falling in a quarterfinal match to Dominik Vacura of Badger-Greenbush-Middle River by fall in 3:13.

Rummel then won back-to-back consolation matches one in an ultimate tiebreaker over Medford’s Brennon Hoffman and one in a 3-1 decision over Howard Lake-Waverly-Winstead’s Danny Mosford. In the consolation semifinals Rummel fell to Daniel Erlandson of Breckenridge by fall in 2:40. Rummel then lost a fifth-place match to Logan Sherwood of Atwater-Cosmos-Grove City by a narrow 7-6 decision.

Lance Wagner (182) and Derek Werner (195) represented Wabasso/Red Rock Central in the state individuals last year. Wagner dropped his lone match in the tournament to Bertha-Hewitt-Verndale-Parkers Prairie’s Gideon Ervasti by fall in 3:45. Wagner was eliminated from the tournament after Ervasti lost his next match and was granted a wrestleback.

Werner ended up finishing fifth in the individual tournament after kicking things off in a strong way with back-to-back wins. He first defeated Belgrade-Brooten-Elrosa’s Michael Doubek by a 6-2 decision and then defeated Zumbrota-Mazeppa’s Ethan Kovars by a 5-2 decision.

The wins moved Werner on to a semifinals match with Frazee’s Luke Tweeton. Tweeton won by an 11-3 major decision however dropping Werner to a consolation semifinals match with Zane Swanson of Ottertail Central a match that Swanson won by a 7-1 decision.

Werner then beat Elliot Mann of New York Mills by an 8-3 decision to claim the fifth-place title at 195 and finish his senior year 36-6.

O'Kane made her 36th save in the final seconds of regulation before the Rams Sports Center turned into Cardinal pandemonium. Players spilled out of the visiting bench as gloves sticks and helmets lay spread out over the defensive zone ice. It's a scene that every hockey player dreams of having.

""It's an unimaginable feeling"" O'Kane said. ""It's a moment that every goalie dreams of feeling. To see your teammates come off the bench and dog-pile you because you won a championship is just hard to put into words.""

The Cardinals didn't need O'Kane to be good. They needed her to be near perfect. After stopping 41 shots in Thursday night's 2-1 triple-overtime win over Brainerd-Little Falls she made 36 saves en route to winning a section championship.

""She's been our backbone to this whole section tournament"" Arola said. ""We couldn't have done it without her. I'm so proud of her. It's so well-deserved of her. She's earned it.""

Roseau dominated the better part of the first period and took a 1-0 lead on a goal from Helgeson. Senior forward Mariah Huglen was awarded with the assist. O'Kane was tested for 16 shots in total through the first period while the Cardinals only got six on Roseau freshman goaltender Jada Pelowski.

Alexandria turned its game around at the start of the second period. Maras beat Pelowski on the power play with a bar-down shot during a zone-entry. Maras scored again midway through the second when she put home a rebound shot from senior forward Marki Oberg to put the Cardinals up 2-1.

""It feels amazing but the credit goes to my teammates"" Maras said. ""They were pushing hard going to the net and doing everything they could to play hard and grind. Especially our goalie. She worked her butt off in all of these playoff games.""

The Cardinals' penalty kill was stellar on Saturday night. Not only did Roseau have two power-play chances in the final four minutes but four more throughout the night. The Rams' vaunted power play went 0-for-6 despite several quality scoring opportunities.

Alexandria has been to the state tournament 13 times but never as a Class AA team. Arola was overcome with emotion when thinking about what her girls accomplished on Saturday 240 miles from home.

""It sounds corny but it's just love"" Arola said. ""I just love this group and the love they have for each other to finally come together and get the job done for the girl next to them. It's really special.""

Each of Alexandria's section tournament games ended in a 2-1 score. Most notably the Cardinals took down two regulars of the state tournament in Brainerd-Little Falls and Roseau. In the section semifinals the Cardinals pulled a rabbit out of their hat when senior forward Hanley Block scored with one second remaining in regulation to force overtime with the Warriors at the Essentia Health Center. Three overtimes later senior forward Anna Doherty sent the Cardinals to the title game.

To beat the top two teams in Section 8AA is an accomplishment on its own. Doing it in each of their home arenas in three days is just another reason why this playoff run is so remarkable.

""They're the cardiac kids"" Arola said. ""It's a huge testament to them and the leaders on this team to come together to play united. This group is so deserving and I couldn't be more proud.""

The Cardinals are energized to be back at the Xcel Energy Center and feel for the first time what it is like there as a Class AA team.

""I can't put it into words"" O'Kane said. ""I've dreamt about this moment for the longest time. It feels so amazing to finally feel it.""

Rising more than 17 feet above the train tracks at Alameda Station is a new art installation: Four Gates by artist Herbert Bayer. Bayer was an Austrian student of the Bauhaus in Weimar Germany who then became its instructor in Dessau Germany. The Bauhaus is the century-old school of design that gave modern architecture and modern design a foundation.

Bayer became a U.S. citizen in 1944 after he fled the Nazi regime and resided in Aspen. He died in Montecito Calif. in 1985.

“Four Gates is Bauhaus at its best” said Ignacio Correa-Ortiz an RTD architect. “It is composed of clear and simple forms interposing four porticos painted in primary colors.”

The striking structure took eight weeks to install and is located at Alameda Station by license agreement among RTD the artist’s estate and the developer of the Denizen apartments located at the station Broadway Park North Metropolitan District N. 1 – also known as D4 Urban.

Correa-Ortiz worked on and managed the agreement for three years as both parties had to define limits of who owns what: RTD owns the plaza and D4 Urban owns the license for the sculpture to be located in the plaza noted Correa-Ortiz. RTD Construction Engineer Shayne Ford managed the construction side for the agency.

RTD contributed money left from an escrow account for the redevelopment of the station’s transit plaza and site improvements for the sculpture. D4 Urban contributed the rest of the funds.

Four Gates is Bayer’s second sculpture in Denver. You may have seen his other one driving north on I-25 as the highway snakes past the Denver Design District: Articulated Wall an 85-foot tall stack of rotated yellow concrete blocks. Articulated Wall is also visible during the commute between the Broadway and Alameda stations.

Four Gates joins 122 pieces of art at RTD stations all across the district and three other art installments at this station.

RTD is the patron of Hand Up by Scott Donohue installed in 1998 and refurbished in 2016. Additionally the wall owned by Xcel Energy to the east of the station has a 270-foot-long mural by Aaron Glasson and the Denizen building has an art installation on its façade named Moving Right Along by Sandra Fettingis.

“There is abundant art at this station true. The amount of public art should not be determined by quotas but rather by the expression of cultural participation in a public place” Correa-Ortiz said.

Hand Up was originally planned to be relocated to where Four Gates is today. Before transplanting the sculpture the artist made the assessment that the sculpture would not survive the move; therefore RTD decided to leave Hand Up in its original location and leave the proposed location empty. D4 Urban saw the opportunity and approached RTD to collaborate with making Four Gates possible where it stands now.

RTD’s ADA division recognized the design team because the sculpture eliminated physical barriers to allow RTD patrons with disabilities full access to the sculpture.

“RTD is proud of making art accessible and eliminating barriers to all” Correa-Ortiz said.",,,

His plan for a Florida salad company wilted. Ditto for a seafood concept that never got off the beach.

And when he finally persuaded three Elizabethtown doctors to invest in Texas Roadhouse — after 80 other investors turned him down — three of his first five restaurants failed and he had had to close their doors.

""I think you have a better more open mind when you fail"" Taylor once said.

He eventually succeeded and then some.

Before he took his life Thursday racked by post-COVID 19 symptoms his family said became unbearable Taylor 65 had built his casual dining chain into a goliath of more than 600 restaurants in 49 states and seven countries worth more than $6 billion.

A graduate of Ballard High School in Louisville who started in the business busing tables at Captain Quarters Taylor built a personal fortune worth more than $600 million about half in company stock.

Over the past 15 years he cashed in stock worth more than $300 million including $6.8 million worth he sold three days before his death.

But he forsook his salary and bonus over the past year so the money could go to hourly employees stung by the coronavirus pandemic.

Kent Taylor:3 things to know about late Texas Roadhouse CEO and founder

He liked to say Texas Roadhouse was “a people company that happened to sell steaks” — that happy employees make happy guests.

Recalling the abuse he suffered early in his career managing restaurants for other companies he said “I swore to myself if I ever had my own business I would take care of employees first guests second.”

“He was unwavering with his commitment to the quality of the food design layout and ambiance of the restaurant but his biggest strength was the amazing culture he developed within his organization"" said Steve Ritchie a former CEO at Papa John’s where Taylor was a director. ""He loved his employees and they reciprocated by sharing his passion for excellence.""

Ritchie who now owns a restaurant group that includes LouVino said “I can unequivocally say he was the most talented restauranteur I have ever worked around.”

David Novak the retired chairman and CEO of Yum! Brands said Taylor “was a master at hospitality and never took himself too seriously.

""He understood the business was all about people and making the customers happy and that made him an iconic leader in the industry.”

He paid his managers well vesting them with stock and he minted many millionaires said former Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. who invested in another of Taylor’s ventures Buckhead Mountain Grill.

Despite his wealth and successes Taylor remained ""modest and humble” Brown said.

He also liked to have fun — he took off three months a year to ski including at his second home in Deer Valley Utah Brown said.

And he always seemed to be in good spirits which made his death shocking said the former governor who made his fortune in the restaurant business when he sold Kentucky Fried Chicken.

“I am heartbroken” Brown said.

The guy who like to hire people who 'maybe got in trouble'

Born in Sept. 27 1955 to Marilyn and Powell Taylor Wayne Kent Taylor grew up in Louisville.

His father helped start the GE Answer Center. His mother was a buyer for a local boutique.

Taylor attended the University of North Carolina on a track scholarship.

According to company legend he designed the Texas Roadhouse concept on a cocktail napkin.

He opened the first Texas Roadhouse on February 17 1993 at the Green Tree Mall in Clarksville Indiana.

Earlier in his career he managed restaurants for Bennigan’s in the 1980s and at KFC in Charlotte North Carolina where he was raising two daughters on his own according to a December profile in Business First.

But innovations he adopted at KFC stores like hot wings only got him in trouble.

“KFC was too bureaucratic for him” Brown said.

Years later Taylor said he liked to hire people who ""maybe got in trouble at other companies because they were a little bit of an entrepreneur.""

Uncomfortable working for others Taylor decided to try and raise capital for one of his restaurant ideas.

He had lived in Colorado where he had worked at nightclubs and restaurants and returned home to Louisville in 1990 with thoughts of opening a Colorado or Texas cowboy-themed restaurant.

He launched both serving as executive chef at Buckhead but sold that to focus on Texas Roadhouse.

Offering customers a free bucket of peanuts — and the freedom to throw the shells on the floor — along with free dinner rolls with honey cinnamon butter and non-stop country music the concept caught on.

""There's nothing special about them it's just a good honest American steakhouse"" Brian Connors a restaurant consultant told the Tampa Bay Times.

""They aim and shoot right down Middle America he said. Do they “attract the health-conscious city-living millennials? Probably not but the 30-somethings with a minivan and two kids? Absolutely.""

Taylor made sure his steak dinners cost less than Outback and other competitors. And to enhance quality Taylor decided to serve dinner only except on Fridays and weekends.

Still the average location serves 5000 guests a week making it one of the busiest restaurants in the industry. And it continued to open new stores including in the Middle East.

Texas Roadhouse ate the competition’s lunch according to FSR (for full-service restaurant) Magazine reporting 32 consecutive quarters of sales growth through 2018.

Even during the 2008 recession the company opened new restaurants hired more corporate staff and managed to boost profits.

""He built a better concept of food and fun"" said Brown who lives a block from a Texas Roadhouse in Lexington Kentucky and stops by twice a week for salmon. “They have a cult following.”

There were a few hiccups along the way.

In trouble for hiring practices

In 2006 when two officers were fatally shot in Chantilly Virginia forcing police to cordon off streets and close businesses the manager of a Texas Roadhouse store calculated the closures cost his restaurant $9000 — and submitted a bill to the police department according to a story in the Washington Post headlined “It’s enough to make your stomach turn.”

The company apologized and said the manager had been disciplined.

And in a 2011 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleged in a lawsuit that the chain — known for its line-dancing staff — did not hire workers over 40 for front-of-the-house positions such as servers and hosts.

Taylor criticized the agency — and the Obama administration — for targeting his company which had not been the subject of an employee complaint. But in 2017 Texas Roadhouse paid a $12 million settlement and agreed to change its recruiting and hiring practices the EEOC said.

But Taylor and his company largely avoided controversy.

It has no national spokesman and instead relies on its cartoon mascot “Andy the Armadillo"" as its brand representative Vice President of Communications Travis Doster said.

""One of my favorite things about Andy is that he doesn't talk so he can't get in trouble” Doster said.

For years Texas Roadhouse employees have contributed to a charity “Andy’s Outreach” a nonprofit which now has $7 million in assets and helps workers known as “Roadies” when they are in need.

The company which advertises “legendary food and legendary service"" relied on extensive charity campaigns in local communities rather than conventional advertising.

Taylor was also known for his philanthropy and personal generosity.

“He was a caring individual who would never seek credit for helping others” Ritchie said in a text. “The infinite number of people he touched will be forever grateful and that includes me and my family.”

Editor's Note: A previous version of this story inaccurately explained why Travis Doster vice president for communications likes having a mascot rather than a human spokesperson for the company.

She said she bought Connie Bodycare Men Shower Gel after being confused by its close similarities to the Nivea product she intended to buy.

But an appeal court judge asked Nivea's senior counsel Reinard Michau if Serrurier worked for his instructing attorneys.

“After taking instructions counsel confirmed that at the relevant time Ms Serrurier had been employed by [Nivea's] attorneys. He then rightly requested that her evidence be ignored” said Friday's appeal judgment penned by Judge Ashton Schippers.

Ferguson's lawyers argued this was a “serious and material non-disclosure” on the part of Adams & Adams said Schippers who pointed out that Serrurier's status as an employee of the law firm was also not disclosed when Nivea won its case against the actress's company‚ Koni International Brands in the Johannesburg high court in 2019.

“It took into account her affidavit and referred to her as ‘a consumer’ in arriving at the conclusion that [Koni's] get-up exhibited signs of straining every nerve to evoke [Nivea's] product in the minds of consumers” said Schippers.

“Attorneys are required to discharge their professional duties with integrity probity and complete trustworthiness. The failure by Mr Du Plessis to disclose to the high court and this court the fact that Ms Serrurier was employed by [Nivea's] attorneys prima facie falls below these standards.

“So too the non-disclosure by Ms Serrurier even though she was not acting in a professional capacity when she purchased the Connie Men shower gel.”",,,,,,
