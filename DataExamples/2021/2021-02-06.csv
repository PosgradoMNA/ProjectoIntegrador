Here's how to tell the difference,"CNN —

There’s one mask guideline that hasn’t changed throughout the pandemic – you definitely should be wearing one.

But what happens when you’re not sure if your mask is real?

These photos were from a CBP seizure of 400 counterfeit 3M N95 respirators at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington DC in April 2020. U.S. Customs and Border Protection

Between the time the pandemic began and the year ended US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized over 14.6 million counterfeit face masks entering the US the agency told CNN.

N95 masks are considered the gold standard for mask usage but counterfeit doppelgängers may threaten Americans’ safety. Not meeting US safety standards means they may not filter out airborne particles effectively the agency said.

N95 masks can also be mistaken with KN95 masks which meet standards in China yet are not certified by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Here’s how you can spot a fake N95 mask.

The most important thing: NIOSH approval

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is a part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that focuses on worker safety and health.

Before filtering facepiece respirators – a fancy term that includes N95 masks – can be used in any workplace they must be certified by NIOSH.

For an N95 mask to get a NIOSH stamp of approval it needs to filter at least 95% of airborne particles.

When finding out if an N95 mask is fake or not NIOSH markings are your compass. But there’s some vetting you can do before you even have a mask in hand.

What to consider before you buy

When buying masks online there are a few things you can ask yourself according to CDC guidance on spotting fake PPE.

If you’re buying directly through a website:

Are there typos bad grammar or other errors on the site?

Are there website flaws like unfinished or blank pages dummy text broken links and misspelled domains?

If you’re buying through a third-party marketplace:

Does the listing call the product “genuine” or “real”? Legitimate companies don’t need to tell buyers their products are real – at least not in the product name.

at least not in the product name. Have reviews been left on the product or on the seller? Buyers unhappy with the product may reveal that it is poorly made or illegitimate.

Is the price too good to be true? It probably is.

It probably is. Is the seller selling the same items over time or keeping with trends? Legitimate businesses tend to stay consistent.

Does the seller put their contact information in images? If so they may be skirting around marketplace policy to keep interactions between buyers and sellers on the site.

How to check if your mask is real

Okay but what if you’ve already bought masks off a website or marketplace and don’t know if they’re the real deal?

Here’s your rule-of-thumb: No markings means no approval.

NIOSH-approved masks have an approval label on or within the mask packaging – either on the box or in the users’ instructions. The mask should also have an abbreviated approval marking.

The approval number on your mask should begin with “TC.” The mask should also have a NIOSH logo printed on it. This image from the CDC can help you identify your mask’s markings.

Then you can check for the approval number on NIOSH certified equipment list.

Some other red flags to look out for include:

Any decorative elements like sequins.

Ear loops instead of head bands. Head bands are crucial to the N95’s tight fit.

Claims for the approval for children. NIOSH does not approve masks for children.

Got a real mask? Share these resources

The CDC and NIOSH have resources to help you in spotting counterfeit masks or even other PPE and medical gear. You can start here and get more tips on vetting masks. You can also look through photos of non-NIOSH-approved masks.

Then you can read about how to protect yourself from buying counterfeit goods.

Got a fake mask? Report it

Fake masks aren’t the only counterfeit products being sold nor the only scam to capitalize on the pandemic.

Criminal organizations are also trying to sell counterfeit pharmaceuticals other PPE and medical devices to “unsuspecting American consumers” CBP Executive Director for Trade Policies and Programs John Leonard told CNN.

Covid-19 has been a fertile time for other scams of all kinds to proliferate – most recently regarding vaccines.

While staying aware and keeping up-to-date you can report any counterfeit masks to CBP through their reporting system or by calling 1-800-BE-ALERT.

You can also report to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center online or by telephone at 1-866-IPR-2060.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzA2LzMtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWhlbHAteW91LWpvaW4tMTAwLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLWNsdWIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks to Help You Join the $100 Billion Dollar Club,"A look at why three industrial giants are a great buy for investors right now.

It's not often when you can genuinely describe three of the highest profile stocks in the industrial sector as ""unloved"" or ""ignored"" but that's the case right now. In a nutshell there appears to have been a flight to quality in the sector and that's left some of the less-fancied names like General Electric (GE 0.90%) Raytheon Technologies (RTX -0.48%) and 3M (MMM 0.35%) looking undervalued relative to their growth prospects.

By a quirk of coincidence the stocks for all three companies currently trade on an individual market cap of around $100 billion. Here's why they are a good value for investors.

It's the free cash flow that matters

The thing that ties all three companies together is their future free cash flow (FCF). In layman's terms it's the flow of cash in the year that a company has left over from earnings after working capital and capital expenditures are taken out.

In a nutshell it's the ""free cash"" that a business has available to do all the value-enhancing things for shareholders like buying back stock paying dividends investing in acquisitions or paying down debt. As a rough guide a price-to-FCF multiple of around 20 is seen as a fair value for an industrial conglomerate growing revenue in line with the economy.

The case for why all three are good investments is based on their FCF valuations.

1. 3M

The business generates a lot of cash and currently trades at a significant valuation multiple to its peers. The chart below compares 3M to its closest peer Illinois Tool Works (ITW 0.78%). Both are multi-industry conglomerates with significant exposure to the auto industry. To be fair ITW is a great business and I'm the first person to argue that it deserves to trade at a premium to 3M.

Moreover 3M has potential liabilities from litigation over PFAS a group of chemicals the company produced that are believed to be hazardous. In addition 3M's execution and deliverance on guidance -- particularly in the healthcare segment -- has left a lot to be desired in recent years.

However the question is how much of a premium does ITW deserve and how much should one discount 3M's performance?

Let's put it this way. If 3M traded on a 10% discount to ITW and we use a price-to-FCF multiple of 21.9 then based on this year's adjusted FCF ($6.7 billion) 3M's market cap would be $147 billion. That's a figure nearly $46 billion above its current market cap. Alternatively using a multiple of 20 suggests that 3M is undervalued by $34 billion.

Frankly those are huge numbers to assume for PFAs liability and a valuation discount particularly as CEO Mike Roman is actively restructuring the company and reshaping the healthcare segment. Throw in a well-covered dividend (current yield 3.4%) and 3M stock looks like a good value.

2. General Electric

It's no secret that the commercial aviation market took a severe hit from the COVID-19 pandemic and most observers don't expect it to return to 2019 levels until 2023. Knowing that there's two ways to look at this. The first is to be wary of the lost revenue/FCF and the uncertain timeline of recovery -- something largely dependent on the subduing of the pandemic. The second is to look at it as a multi-year growth opportunity for companies like GE and Raytheon Technologies as they will start from ground zero in 2020.

The investment case for GE is based on a combination of recovery at GE Aviation ongoing solid FCF generation at GE Health Care and multi-year improvement in earnings margin and FCF generation at GE Renewable Energy and GE Power.

The evidence from the latest earnings report is that GE is making progress on these objectives. Consequently management guided toward FCF of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in 2021.

The midpoint of the range would put GE on a price-to-FCF multiple of around 27 times 2021 FCF. While this looks expensive readers should note that GE is set for a multi-year recovery in FCF and it won't be until 2023 at the earliest that GE Aviation can expect to get back to the kind of $4.4 billion in FCF generated in 2019 compared to zero in 2020.

3. Raytheon Technologies

A similar argument applies to GE's aviation rival Raytheon Technologies. The two compete with engines on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. In addition within commercial aviation Raytheon's Collins Aerospace also makes aerostructures avionics mechanical systems power systems and even cabins.

It's going to take time for Raytheon to recover but in the meantime it will receive solid support from its defense business (missiles defense systems radar intelligence systems and space solutions including satellites). In fact defense now makes up around two-thirds of total company revenue.

Management predicts a strong recovery in commercial aviation profitability beginning in the second quarter and is targeting $5 billion in adjusted FCF for 2021. That's a figure that would put Raytheon on a price-to-FCF multiple of 20 times projected 2021 FCF. That's a very good value for a company headed for ongoing recovery in FCF from commercial aviation. Throw in a 2.9% dividend yield and Raytheon is an attractive stock all round.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdtYW5ldHdvcmsuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvc2hvd2Jpem5ld3MvbmV3cy8xMzU5Ny90cml2aWEtdGlrdG9rLWNvbnlvLWdpcmwtcmFpbi1tYXRpZW56by1pcy1ub3ctYS1rYXB1c28vcGhvdG_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TRIVIA: TikTok 'Conyo Girl' Rain Matienzo is now a Kapuso! | GMA Entertainment,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhb2ZmaWNlLmFlL2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMS9GZWIvMDYtMDIvUlRBLWNvbXBsZXRlcy00NzVtLWxvbmctcGVkZXN0cmlhbnMtYW5kLWN5Y2xpc3RzLWJyaWRnZS1vdmVyLVJhcy1BbC1LaG9yLVJvYWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RTA completes 475m long pedestrians and cyclists bridge over Ras Al Khor Road,"Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the completion of a bridge for pedestrians and cyclists crossing over Ras Al Khor Rd (Dubai-Hatta) extending 475 metres in length. The bridge which has a width of 5 metres (3m for bikers and 2m for pedestrians) is fitted with rails between the lanes and on both sides.

The bridge links the International City and Al Warqaa and eases the mobility of pedestrians between the two sides of Ras Al Khor Rd. It also links the cycling tracks from Al Khawaneej Mushrif and Al Warqaa with International City and Dragon Mart.

“RTA constructed this bridge in response to the directives of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Dubai Crown Prince Chairman of the Executive Council to make Dubai a bicycle-friendly city which requires the provision of suitable alternatives that encourages people to practice cycling. It is also constructed in the context of RTA’s efforts to improve the standard of living in the city make residents happier and migrate to sustainable transit means with the least environmental pollutants. It also echoes Dubai Traffic Safety Strategy envisioning zero fatalities to make Dubai the safest city in the world in 2021” said His Excellency Mattar Mohammed Al Tayer Director-General Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA.

370 Tons of Steel

“The new bridge has a steel and concrete structure that required the transportation of 370 tons of structural steel to the site in four different pieces. A reinforced concrete layer was then placed on the upper deck of the bridge. The bridge spans 475 metres in length which includes a steel structure part that extends 110 metres. The bridge is built on three concrete pillars and connects with ascending and descending slopes on both sides extending about 180 metres. The bridge extends five metres in width: three metres for cyclists and two meters for pedestrians. It is fitted with slip-resisting flooring and subdued decorative lighting. It has metal railings on both sides for the safety of pedestrians and cyclists” explained Al Tayer.

“RTA had previously completed cycling tracks in different parts of Dubai including Al Warqaa Mushrif and Al Khawaneej. It also constructed two bridges shared by cyclists and pedestrians on Al Khawaneej and Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan Al Nahyan Road” he noted.

129 Footbridges

“The number of footbridges in Dubai has rocketed from 13 bridges in 2006 to 129 bridges in 2020. RTA intends to construct 31 additional footbridges between 2021 and 2026 which will bring the total number of footbridges in Dubai to 160 bridges. RTA’s efforts to improve pedestrians safety contributed to reducing pedestrian fatalities in Dubai by as much as 81% between 2007 and 2020” commented Al Tayer.

The total length of cycling tracks constructed in Dubai till the end of 2020 is 425 km. RTA plans to build more cycling tracks that will increase the length of cycling tracks to 668 km by 2025. Through the construction of cycling tracks RTA aims to link Dubai’s hotspots with stations of various mass transit means. It also adds to the efforts of making Dubai friendlier to cyclists. Such a drive contributes to Dubai 2021 vision that seeks to make the city the ideal place for living and business as well as the favourite and safest destination for visitors.

Cycling Speed Limit

RTA has set a speed limit of 30 km/h for bicycles on dedicated tracks and 20 km/h for bicycles on tracks shared with pedestrians inside urban areas. Varying speeds were set for training tracks. Setting speed caps for bicycles stems from RTA’s keenness on the safety of both pedestrians and cyclists.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzLXRlbmRlcnMvMjcwNTMwLXJ0YS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtNDc1bS1icmlkZ2Utb3Zlci1yYXMtYWwta2hvci1yb2Fk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RTA completes 475m bridge over Ras Al Khor Road,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-tenders/270530-rta-completes-475m-bridge-over-ras-al-khor-road on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzLXRlbmRlcnMvMjcwNTMwLXJ0YS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtNDc1bS1icmlkZ2Utb3Zlci1yYXMtYWwta2hvci1yb2Fk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

For six seasons on the mega-hit ""The Walking Dead"" Yeun played fan favorite Glenn Rhee pizza delivery guy-turned-zombie slayer.

Correspondent Tracy Smith asked ""Did you have any idea what you were getting into when you read for that part?""

""No. I was just trying to work you know what I mean? Like I was just trying to work"" he laughed.

For Yeun Glenn represented someone not seen on television before: ""An Asian American character that wasn't explicitly defined by his race or talked about in that way.""

Still Glenn had limits. ""He's always a good guy"" Yeun said. ""He has to do the right thing at all times. And it almost then felt like in order for this Asian American character to exist he has to be useful.""

""So then when you left 'Walking Dead' was it good guy role after good guy role?"" asked Smith.

""Yeah. It's not that there's anything wrong with those things. But it's that we can only be those things. And I think that's the battle.""

But choosing his latest complicated role in a film called ""Minari"" was relatively easy. ""I read the script and I was blown away"" he said. ""I was in tears. Seeing the words of how a life similar to mine could be put on a page was very liberating.""

""And it left you in tears?""

""Oh yeah. This thing continues to leave me in many many tears. I've been crying throughout this whole process"" he laughed.

Steven Yeun stars in ""Minari"" as a Korean immigrant who brings his family to a farm in Arkansas. A24

Yeun plays Jacob a Korean immigrant who moves his family from California to an Arkansas farm in pursuit of his American Dream.

Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung based the film (which was shot in Oklahoma over 25 days) on his own family's story: ""Jacob he's an interesting man. He decided once he got to America that he doesn't want to be around other Korean Americans. And he wants to strike out on his own into the wild west in a way to Arkansas.

""For me this film is about a family first and foremost that moves to a brand-new place in a whole new situation that they've never been in and they only have each other"" said Chung.

Yeun saw his family's own American Dream in the movie too: ""My dad he was an architect in Korea. He was doing well for himself. And he took a business trip over to Minnesota and he told me that he saw the land and he was like 'I need to move here.' And then my dad had to restart from scratch.""

The Yeuns left South Korea when Steven was four and ended up in Michigan with hopes that their son might someday go to med school.

The Yeuns emigrated from Seoul when Steven was four years old. Family Photo

""I really broke my parents down from an early age"" said Yeun. ""I didn't give 'em any false hope that I was gonna be a doctor. I think it was just like let me take a bio class and then I'll show you the grade that I get so you know that this is not for me.""

Yeun went to college to study psychology. But when he joined an improv group everything changed: ""It kinda just like clicked in for me. And I was like 'That is fascinating.'""

""Why do you think it clicked?"" asked Smith.

""Maybe it was freedom.""

After graduation he earned a coveted spot with the Second City improv group in Chicago. His parents were supportive of his career choice to a point: ""My parents and my worried uncles and aunts told my cousin Mikey to call me to persuade me away from doing this. And then Mike calls and he's like 'Hey man look my mom and dad told me to call you to like tell you to stop doing this. But like just do whatever you want. Just like just do it!'""

So Yeun took a huge leap. He left the Midwest and headed to Hollywood.

Smith asked ""How scary was that?""

""It wasn't that scary if i'm gonna be honest with you. I just woke up one day and I was like 'I gotta go.' I told everybody I was moving. So I couldn't back out.""

And at the tender age of 26 Yeun won what was essentially the casting lottery – that part on ""The Walking Dead.""

""How soon after you got to L.A. were you able to find work?"" Smith asked.

""I botched a bunch of auditions 'cause I was so nervous. And then six months after I had gotten there – which is not a popular thing to tell I apologize …""

""Six months?""

""Yeah.""

""And you apologize for that?""

""Yeah. I'm sorry. My bad!""

""It happened too fast?""

""Yeah. I just you know that's usually not the traditional journey"" Yeun laughed. ""So I'm very grateful.""

Actor Steven Yeun star of ""Minari."" CBS News

Now his non-traditional journey has earned the 37-year-old a bunch of Oscar predictions. If they're right he would be the first Asian American nominated for Best Actor. But to Steven Yeun married father of two the film itself is a gift.

""To have kind of understood my parents in such an immersive and profound way that I don't think anyone else has ever experienced in this way – to like act it out in a movie – that's crazy!"" he said.

And he got to watch it with his parents at Sundance. ""After the movie was done I looked over at my dad. And then he put his hand on my shoulder and then I put you know I reciprocated. And then we just like sobbed.""

Smith asked ""What do you think gets to you talking about this?""

""It's a reconnection. I think generations miss each other right now. So it's connection that's making me emotional. 'Cause I don't know if I've had it in a way that I thought I did until now.""

Patsy Lorraine Abbott Reeder 80 of Hagerstown Maryland passed away on February 3 2021 at Meritus Medical Center.

She was born to parents George W. Abbott and Clara V. Butts Abbott on June 27 1940 in Hagerstown.

She graduated from Boonsboro Senior High School in 1958.

In her lifetime Mom worked as a loving wife devoted mother homemaker and personal care taker to many.

In her early career she worked for Washington County Hospital Reeders Nursing Home Avalon Manor Home Call and a private duty nursing agency all in the capacity of a nurse’s aide companion or caretaker.

Mom loved many things people and places and often spoke about the past. She always had stories about NASCAR races she attended trips to Walt Disney World softball games at high school family holiday gatherings and various other trips and times spent with my father and her siblings.

During the 1960’s Mom and Dad were involved with two local race cars “Red Cloud” and “Duster.” Both cars were raced at Mason Dixon Dragway and various other tracks with their racing partners Larry Mohar and Josephine and friends Louise and Harry Huntzberry.

Above all things and those who knew her best Mom loved to talk about her family her siblings their grandkids and her nieces and nephews.

Even though she had no grandchildren of her own she adopted many of her siblings’ grandkids. Family was the thing that meant most to her — her life with Daddy and the proud accomplishments of her own children.

Patsy met Gerald L. Reeder Sr. in 1956. They were married on April 5 1956 in Mt. Briar Maryland. Together they raised three children Jeffery L. Reeder Timothy L. Reeder and Gerald L. Reeder Jr.

Patsy is survived by her sons Timothy L. Reeder and husband James of Fort Myers Florida and Gerald L. Reeder Jr. and his wife Lori of South Carolina; two sisters Martha L. Jones of Boonsboro and Faye L. Breeden of Hagerstown; and brother Eddie C. Abbott of Hagerstown.

In addition to her parents and husband she was preceded in death by her son Jeffery L. Reeder; her sister Marjorie; and six brothers Garland Leon George Homer Gerald and Gene.

Reynolds stepped down from full-time staff duties in August 2019 but continued to write his weekly columns until late last year. Along with former Journal staff writer Elizabeth Abbott Reynolds is working on a compilation of many of his past columns including his looks at the late Providence College star Marvin Barnes and Chris Herren the former Durfee High School and Boston Celtics player.

COMING SUNDAY: Columnist Mark Patinkin pays tribute to Bill Reynolds.

""Bill Reynolds is a legend in Rhode Island and his 'For What It's Worth' column has been a big part of that. But just as big a part is the way that he treats everyone with dignity and respect"" said Michael McDermott The Journal's managing editor and the former sports editor.

""When I came to The Journal nearly 20 years ago Bill was one of the first people who made a point of introducing himself and getting to know me. And as I saw over and over again as his editor Bill always gives the time to talk to people to listen to people from successful athletes to everyday fans to stressed-out colleagues who need a sympathetic ear. It's the reason he is such a good journalist. I'll miss reading him in The Journal but I'll always consider him a friend and a role model.""

""For What It's Worth"" spanned sports culture books movies trivia and featured ongoing complaints about Connecticut tourists at South County beaches jokes about the Independent Man statue that stands atop the State House the General Assembly and of course ""Bunky"" — the recurring everyman character.

A Barrington native Reynolds starred on the basketball court for Barrington High School and Brown University and later taught at Barrington High before pursuing a career in writing. He began freelancing for The Journal then joined full-time in the 1980s first as a news reporter then moving to cover his passion sports.

“What’s better than this?” Reynolds would say. “I get paid to go to games.”

Soon Reynolds became religious reading for Rhode Island sports fans and his work not only appeared in the pages of The Journal but in the many books he authored including ""Success is a Choice"" with coach Rick Pitino; ""Fall River Dreams"" and ""Hope"" among others.

""Thanks to all of you who have read it faithfully and sometimes suggested input"" Reynolds wrote as a farewell.

Of course Bill could do a lot of damage in a short amount of time!

Sally Spectra (Courtney Hope) was wary about working with Bill when Lauren Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) brought up Summer Newman’s (Hunter King) deal with Spencer Publications. If you followed Sally’s story on B&B you know she had major issues with Bill.

Sally hinted about some of those during her conversation with Lauren – including the fact that Bill blew up the Spectra building with Sally inside. Since Sally could’ve died in that blast their war was obviously pretty cutthroat!

Bill also happens to be the father of Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks) the ex that Sally went to such drastic lengths to get back. In other words Bill knows everything that Flo Fulton (Katrina Bowden) knows and could easily spill all Sally’s secrets during this Genoa City visit. That is if Summer doesn’t spill first!

Summer may not be too happy with Sally after she becomes the catalyst for Kyle Abbott’s (Michael Mealor) buried New York secret coming out.

Part of Summer may be grateful once she finally knows Kyle fathered a child by a married woman in New York but another part of her may want messy Sally’s past to be exposed too.

Whatever the case it looks like Sally’s own past may come back to haunt her in the near future.

The Young and the Restless spoilers say Bill will meet with Lauren during his trip to GC but he’ll also cross paths with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Jack may get a warning and some shocking stories about Sally.

During the week of February 15-19 Y&R spoilers state that Jack will rush to Sally’s defense. Bill’s attempts to attack and vilify Sally may not go over well with Jack especially once he hears Bill nearly killed Sally in that building explosion.

There are other things that Bill did that may come to light as well.

Sally isn’t the only one capable of faking a terminal illness to meddle in love lives. It was Bill’s idea for Caroline Spencer (Linsey Godfrey) to pretend she was dying to steal Thomas Forrester (Pierson Fode at the time) away from Sally.

It was one of the many times Sally got her heart broken so Jack may end up being even more sympathetic to Sally’s plight after this Bill battle.

This could give Sally a chance to share everything with Jack – the good the bad and the ugly. Sally might admit everything she did wrong but maybe Jack could learn what drove Sally to do the things she did too.

Y&R spoilers say it looks like Jack and Bill will go to war over Sally soon enough!

As other Y&R news comes in we’ll deliver updates. The Young and the Restless spoilers say some bombshells are brewing in GC so stay tuned.

Ruston Kelly is a singer-songwriter

Kelly is a singer-songwriter who has worked with country music icons like Tim McGraw the Josh Abbott Band Rob Baird Hayes Carll and Lucie Silvas. Kelly’s music has also been used in TV shows like Scorpion — his song “Black Magic” played in the season 2 finale — and Nashville. Kelly co-wrote “Face the Sun” a song Charles Esten sings in the series.

Outside of his work with other artists Kelly has a solo career. He has three EPs: The Bootleg Sessions (2013) Halloween (2017) and Dirt Emo Vol. 1 (2019) which contains a cover of Taylor Swift’s emo anthem “All Too Well.”

Kelly’s first studio album Dying Star came out in 2018. His sophomore album Shape & Destroy came out in 2020. In addition to being a song-writing force in country music Kelly is widely known for his marriage to Musgraves.

Kacey Musgraves and Ruston Kelly had a Nashville-inspired romance

The duo met at the Bluebird Café in Nashville in 2016. During an interview with Glamour Musgraves talked about meeting Ruston.

“His songs made me really emotional” Musgraves told the outlet after seeing Ruston perform at the Nashville hotspot. “I thought ‘This guy’s really clever whoever he is.’” A few months later Ruston was helping Musgraves write. He provided much of the inspiration for Musgraves’ 2018 release Golden Hour including the song “Butterflies.”

“Then it was ‘That’s all she wrote’ — pun intended” Musgraves continued. “Everything was right. I didn’t have to shift any part of my personality to make it fit together which isn’t really something I’ve had before.”

Ruston proposed to Musgraves on Christmas Eve the following year but their marriage didn’t last.

Kacey Musgraves is divorced

After nearly three years of marriage Musgraves and Ruston filed for divorce in July 2020.

“With heavy but hopeful hearts we wanted to put our own thoughts into the air about what’s happening” their statement read (via Associated Press).

These kinds of announcements are always met with scrutiny and speculation and we want to stop that before it even starts. We believe that we were put into each other’s lives for a divine reason and have both changed each other infinitely for the better. The love we have for each other goes far beyond the relationship we’ve shared as husband and wife. It’s a soul connection that can never be erased. We’ve made this painful decision together — a healthy decision that comes after a very long period of trying the best we can. It simply just didn’t work. Though we are parting ways in marriage we will remain true friends for the rest of our lives. We hold no blame anger or contempt for each other and we ask for privacy and positive wishes for us both as we learn how to navigate through this.

Ruston Kelly fans can watch him live Feb. 19 2021

With the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic at play Kelly cannot tour at this time. He is still planning a special live stream for his fans in February.

“While we wait to take my album Shape & Destroy on the road I’m VERY excited to announce Stream & Destroy — a live-streamed show from the Blue Room at Third Man Records” Kelly announced on Mandolin. Fans can purchase tickets at various prices through the Madolin site."

The Landmark

STERLING — Haley and Natalie Woodbury 11 are pretty young to be humanitarians. But the twins were inspired to sell colorful friendship bracelets and donate the proceeds to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis Tennessee.

“The kids wanted to help other children” said their mother Stacey Woodbury. “St. Jude’s is an amazing hospital that helps kids beat childhood cancers and takes the financial burden off of families to receive treatment services.”

The young duo made around 70 bracelets with a rainbow loom kit they received for Christmas from a family member. They sold half of the bracelets at a contactless pickup stand in front of their house; bracelets with charms sold for $2 each and ones without went for $1. Some people stopped by the stand just to donate money toward the cause and AbbVie the biopharmaceutical company their father Casey Woodbury works for matched what they made in sales bringing their total St. Jude’s donation to $180.

“They (the girls) were so appreciative of all the people who came by the stand to make bracelet purchases and for the generous donations” Stacey said.

It took the fifth-graders 15 to 20 minutes to make each bracelet. They spent several weeks making them during a lot of their free time over the December holiday school vacation and then before and after school once school resumed.

“We wanted to spread friendship in the new year and thought it would be great to help other kids who are sick at the same time” Natalie said. “We are grateful to be healthy and wanted other kids to get healthy too.”

Haley said they liked making the bracelets together for a good cause.

“We enjoyed using our creativity to make the bracelets in different colors and fun patterns and hoped others would enjoy wearing them” she said.

Stacey said she and Casey and the girls’ two younger siblings are proud of Haley and Natalie and their outreach efforts.

“I think it’s fantastic the girls took the initiative themselves to give back and do something good for others” Stacey said. “Even if children don’t have a lot of money themselves they can create and do big things if they have empathy time and love.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Times of Malta and Reuters last year exposed how 17 Black owner and murder suspect Yorgen Fenech walked away from the deal with a €4.6 million profit after secretly financing an intermediary used to sell the wind farm project shares to Enemalta.

The intermediary Cifidex was owned by Turab Musayev who was on the Electrogas consortium board along with Fenech.

RELATED STORIES Watch: The money trail to 17 Black via Montenegro... in two minutes

Musayev has denied any wrongdoing.

The audit report recommended Enemalta should draw up policies about how the company goes about investing in new projects or existing ones including safeguards against money laundering attempts on the part of potential business partners.

It said due diligence processes should cover not only the project being invested in but the potential business partners involved.

The investigation found a failure to carry out proper due diligence on Cifidex and a lack of professional scepticism by Enemalta’s board at the time of the project acquisition.

At the time Enemalta’s board gave the go-ahead to enter the deal with Cifidex in January 2015 the intermediary company did not even own the shares in the wind farm project.

Enemalta went on to buy the shares from Cifidex for €10.3 million in December 2015 weeks after the intermediary had finally acquired the shares itself from the actual owners the Spanish consortium Fersa for €2.9 million.

Enemalta then passed on the shares to a consortium set up for the project which included Enemalta shareholders Shanghai Electric Power (SEP).

'Passive stance' by Enemalta

The “passive stance” taken by Enemalta during the negotiations was highlighted by the internal audit.

It found that early negotiations with Cifidex and fellow project promoters London-based Vestigo Capital were led by Accenture representative Chen Cheng who was acting on behalf of SEP.

Vestigo Capital would go on to become members of the project consortium along with Enemalta SEP and Envision Energy.

We are not trying to kick off the ladder as it is a firm legal requirement

The report highlighted how Nexia BT the company at the heart of the Panama scandal in Malta was contacted by Accenture to carry out an acquisition fee evaluation report about the project to ensure the price being paid was a fair one.

Accenture’s request highlighted that a report was needed with a conclusion clearly pointing out how much the project was worth given the conditions provided.

The internal investigation was unable to get its hands on the ultimate report by Nexia BT as it was claimed that the document was sent directly to Accenture and SEP even though the Nexia BT engagement letter was addressed to both Enemalta and SEP.

RELATED STORIES 17 Black-funded firm was introduced as ‘sole agent’ for Montenegro project

Chen Cheng used the services of Nexia BT to set up a company in the British Virgin Islands and a Pilatus Bank account with expected cash flows of €1 million in 2015. No cash was ever paid into the account.

Konrad Mizzi the former minister who was responsible for Enemalta at the time also used Nexia BT’s services for secretive offshore structures along with former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri.

Their Panama structures were according to a leaked Nexia BT e-mail set to receive up to €2 million from Fenech’s company 17 Black.

Profits from the Montenegro wind farm deal were wired to 17 Black by Cifidex. Chen had written an e-mail to Cifidex in December 2014 asking for evidence clarifying the company’s ownership of the wind farm project.

'Not trying to kick off ladder'

“We hope you could reply to us no later than tomorrow and provide PROOF that clarifies your ownership of the project.

“In case you haven’t obtained full ownership yet we will request your introduction to the actual owner (the Spanish Company right?).

“Please understand that we are not trying to kick off the ladder as it is a firm legal requirement. Actually we can talk to you and the actual owner together to move things forward” the e-mail quoted by the report states.

The internal probe did not trace any further reference to due diligence on the seller following the December 2014 exchange.

A month later Enemalta’s project director Kevin Chircop now chairman was minuted in a board meeting as saying Cifidex was the present owner of the project along with Fersa.

At the time the board was chaired by Fredrick Azzopardi who now heads the roads agency Infrastructure Malta.

The internal report notes that while due diligence-related tasks were assigned to SEP Enemalta should still have commissioned separate and independent legal and financial due diligence exercises on both the project and its sellers and owners before paying out any money.

Former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat travelled to Montenegro to inaugurate the wind farm project in November 2019 weeks before his resignation. He has denied any involvement in the deal or knowledge of wrongdoing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5c2lha2luaS5jb20vbGV0dGVycy81NjE5MTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LETTER | Beware of the dark sides of cashless payments,"LETTER | The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the transition to cashless payments in most Southeast Asian countries to facilitate contactless transactions and further curb the spread of the virus.

Nevertheless it is also crucial for us to be cautious because the method also has some drawbacks without us knowing it.

Indeed cashless payment has become the most preferred payment method for both consumers and sellers in this pandemic era.

However the blind use of cashless payments can have numerous adverse effects on people’s well-being especially poor consumer behaviour which is defined as a process through which an identifiable consumer group actually makes buying decisions.

Based on Accenture’s study titled “Covid-19: How consumer behaviour will change” it is clear the crisis drives permanent changes in consumer behaviour. Consumer preferences have also been centred on the most basic needs sending demand soaring for hygiene cleaning and staple products while non-essential categories are slumping.

Although it is definitely a positive thing to note that Covid-19 has triggered the high use of the cashless payment individuals should be conscientious about its dire consequences especially on how they spend and how much they spend on products.

Besides the apparent factor of poor spending behaviour is that it can lead to panic buying where individuals appear to overspend without even worrying about their financial condition.

The Covid-19 pandemic also seemed to provide individuals with a high degree of fear and anxiety which later shifted their habits to panic buying that could adversely affect their income during the crisis.

This form of behaviour would have a positive effect on the economy as a whole as it revs up private consumption spending essential to uplift the economy. At the same time however it may also have a direct impact on the customers. So this would highly require people to spend moderately depending on their actual ability to pay.

At first some developed countries such as Denmark have entirely encouraged cashless society but they have subsequently slowed down their initiatives for fear that it will mean that some people are unable to manage their money efficiently and cost-effectively.

As revealed recently on a study on “Economy SEA 2020” by Google Temasek and Bain & Company which is about the significant impact of digital payments during the Covid-19 period on Southeast Asian countries consumer cash transactions declined to 37 percent from 48 percent pre-Covid-19.

Not just that contactless and digital payments have also gained traction because of the effect of Covid-19 stimulus fund transfers on people such as Covid-19 relief measures in Singapore.

Malaysia is also no exception in this as previous stimulus packages such as Prihatin and Penjana have successfully generated an enormous effect on cashless transactions not to mention the latest Permai stimulus package that will inevitably add to the effect.

Following the recent reimplementation of movement control order (MCO) Darshiniy Selvaratnam senior market analyst for IDC Financial Insight stated that this year’s MCO was the game-changer as many transactions that would typically have taken place in person and be conducted in cash terms moved online.

However one thing has to be considered: the widespread use of cashless payments via credit cards or mobile apps could substantially increase unhealthy food consumption based on the new research published in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research.

In particular it demonstrates that when the participants considered making cashless payments the absence of the negative arousal reduced their attention to the health risks increasing their purchase likelihood and willingness to pay.

It is relatable because the Covid-19 which comes with numerous measures to curb the virus’ spread particularly lockdown has undoubtedly increased the possibility of an unhealthy lifestyle.

It can generally be deduced that people will tend to spend their money on unhealthy food due to pandemic fatigue resulting from feeling unmotivated and overwhelmed by the endless amounts of standard operating procedures and countless recommended behaviours to protect themselves and others from the virus.

Health experts also agreed that there would also be negative emotions like worry sadness and frustration abnormal routine lack of focus disturbance in eating or sleeping patterns as indicators of pandemic fatigue.

This would also illustrate that pandemic fatigue will have many unhealthy effects on individuals forcing them to spend more on unnecessary things to alleviate the pandemic’s harmful effects.

Therefore this is likely to be the major role of policymakers to overcome the problem by educating consumers adequately about the unintended negative impacts of cashless payments. Public awareness is genuinely essential to cushion the people’s financial blow caused by the pandemic’s detrimental effects.

It has to be emphasised this is not a suggestion to go against cashless payment as it is still a preferred payment method in this era. It is only a matter of public awareness that people should acquire to avoid the risk of over-spending and unnecessary spending due to the pandemic.

After all during the country’s rapid transition into a cashless society people should be mindful because their financial status is still the top priority which will determine whether they’ll have financial anxiety to contend with.

Although cashless payment is a convenient method remember that we could cross a line at some point where convenience can cause us more harm than good.

The historic photographs selected for the show which opened at 1200 N. Broadway on Feb. 2 trace the outlines of the land and the people who have moved through it with stunning intimacy and scale.

But the show is also a project that spans multiple History Colorado museums and it plans to stick around for quite a while.

“The Arkansas River in Colorado (or Rio Nepesta) once carved the border between the United States and Mexico” History Colorado officials wrote. “Our El Pueblo History Museum marks the site of the original El Pueblo established in 1842 along the border.”

The exhibition looks at the big moves — populations and borders — and small ones such as the daily lives of the indigenous Mexican and American people who have called the region home. The exhibition includes a virtual speaker series featuring food writer Gustavo Arellano (Feb. 11) and others starting this month and scheduled to continue at least through April.

The exhibition will be presented in English and Spanish organizers said and is included with museum general admission.

After 25 years of helping shape the Internet with interactive content and online games Adobe Flash Player reached the end of life on January 1st 2021 and all browser support has been removed. Later that month a kill switch in Adobe Flash Player came alive that prevents Flash content in the player.

Adobe Flash Player was historically riddled with vulnerabilities and Adobe fixed new ones almost every month. As nearly every browser included an Adobe Flash plugin attackers created specially crafted websites and scripts that could infect a computer by merely visiting a web site.

While the end of Adobe Flash Player and browser plugins is a good thing it does pose a problem for those who have amassed a large collection of Flash games over the years that they can no longer use.

Ruffle may be the answer

Ruffle is a Flash Player emulator written in the Rust programming language that has run every one of the old school SWF games that I could throw at it.

""Ruffle is a Flash Player emulator written in Rust. Ruffle runs natively on all modern operating systems as a standalone application and on all modern browsers through the use of WebAssembly.

""Leveraging the safety of the modern browser sandbox and the memory safety guarantees of Rust we can confidently avoid all the security pitfalls that Flash had a reputation for. Ruffle puts Flash back on the web where it belongs - including iOS and Android!"" describes the Ruffle web site.

You can use Ruffle in three different ways - a standalone desktop application embedded in a website as web assembly or through a browser extension that allows you to run Flash content throughout the web.

In our tests we used the standalone desktop application that when opened automatically asks you to load an SWF file. Every one we tried worked flawlessly and you can see some examples below.

Games loaded in the Ruffle Flash Player emulator

The real question though is it safe?

While any program can have vulnerabilities as Ruffle is coded in Rust it benefits from the programming language's built-in memory protection feature.

This feature eliminates many memory bugs such as buffer overruns use-after-free data race conditions and pointer related bugs. These bugs types commonly lead to vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player allowing attackers to crash a system allow arbitrary code execution or leak information from a computer.

Though some portions of Ruffle's code utilize the 'unsafe' feature of Rust most of the program uses memory protection which significantly increases its security.

If you have an extensive collection of Flash games and no Adobe Flash Player to play them the standalone desktop Ruffle player is a great option to allow you to play your old games in Windows Linux and Mac OS.",,,,,,

Soaring demand for computing devices during the pandemic has helped fuel a global shortage of semiconductor chips. PC sales exploded in 2020 as people worked from home marking the first time since 2010 that the market grew so quickly according to IDC. Apple's iPads have seen a resurgence with the tech giant reporting 40% growth in its latest quarter and demand for the new game consoles from Sony and Microsoft is off the charts.

Tight capacity at semiconductor manufacturers is now leading to some big problems. General Motors and Ford are idling some production because they can't secure enough chips and CPU maker Advanced Micro Devices lost market share to Intel in the fourth quarter because its chips were hard to find. Intel largely manufactures its own chips while AMD relies on third-party foundries.

One industry that benefits from a shortage of semiconductor manufacturing capacity is the semiconductor-equipment industry. The companies that make the many complicated machines that are required to manufacture assemble and package semiconductor chips should do very well as capacity is increased to bring supply closer to demand.

While there are many options in this space one of my favorites is Kulicke & Soffa Industries (KLIC 2.13%).

An ideal environment

Kulicke & Soffa specializes in semiconductor packaging equipment. At the end of the semiconductor manufacturing process the semiconductor material is put into a protective case and connections are made so the final product can interface with a circuit board. Kulicke & Soffa sells wire bonders which facilitate these connections as well as advanced packaging equipment.

The semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical with sales dependent on the pace at which semiconductor manufacturers are building out capacity. Kulicke & Soffa's results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year as shown in the chart below.

The current environment is ideal for a company like Kulicke & Soffa and it shows in its latest results. Revenue rocketed 86% in the company's fiscal first quarter on a year-over-year basis to $267.9 million and adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled to $0.86. The company expects this strong demand to persist calling for revenue of $300 million and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 in the second quarter.

""We expect trends demanding assembly complexity will increase and further enhance the capital intensity of our broad served markets over the long-term"" said Kulicke & Soffa CEO Fusen Chen in the company's earnings release.

One word of caution: Slapping a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) on a stock like Kulicke & Soffa based on current earnings can lead you astray since the company's financial performance isn't consistent. The average analyst estimate for fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS is $3.04 up from $0.95 in fiscal 2020. That puts the P/E ratio at a paltry 13.5 but that's not necessarily a good indicator of value. Using the average of that 2021 estimate and the 2020 results the P/E ratio stands at a pricier 20.

However analysts expect the company's strong earnings to continue into fiscal 2022. Given the extent of the semiconductor manufacturing-capacity shortage that view doesn't seem farfetched. Kulicke & Soffa could be in for a multiyear period of exceptional results depending on how semiconductor demand evolves.

Regardless of what happens with Kulicke & Soffa's results the company's rock-solid balance sheet should see it through. The company had $577 million of cash and investments as of Jan. 2 and there's no debt on the balance sheet. This cash allows the company to make strategic acquisitions pay a dividend and buy back shares when it makes sense to do so.

Kulicke & Soffa is far from a household name and it's one of the smaller players in the semiconductor-equipment industry. The company is thriving right now and the stock doesn't seem overly expensive. If you're looking for a way to play the global chip shortage Kulicke & Soffa looks like a good bet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mYXNoaW9uLXN0YXJ0LW1vZGEtZGVzaWduLWRpc3RyaWN0LTEyMzUwMDY3MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fashion Start-Up Moda Design District Announces the Successful Completion of Seed Round,"Over 110 Fashion Designers from Around the World Have Signed Up for Moda Design So Far and Have Created Over 2000 Unique Fashion Products

Coffee mate has been a roll with coffee creamer flavors lately. Case in point: the M&M’s Glazed Donut and Oatmeal Crème Pie varieties. Despite the creativity that the brand pumps out they’ve been missing what some consider to be a common flavor: Caramel.

Yes believe it or not Coffee mate is just stepping into the caramel game. It has had Vanilla Caramel Powder Sugar Free Vanilla Caramel Powder Sugar Free Chocolate Caramel and Caramel Latte Powder but no plain liquid caramel creamer. Hey better late than never!

Coffee mate shared the news on Instagram on Feb. 5 and people swarmed to the comments asking one question: Will there be a sugar-free version too? Sadly there won’t be at this time. However there are plenty of sugar-free options with caramel (as listed above) so let us have this one sugar-free drinkers.

“Caramel gets added to a lot of delicious treats but we think that the caramel should be the start of your coffee. Warm pure caramelized sugar flavor that tastes as good as it smells. With Coffee mate non-dairy coffee creamer you can create your perfect dessert any time you want it!” the description says.

You can find at the new Coffee mate Caramel Liquid Coffee Creamer wherever the brand is sold including at grocery stores Walmart and Target. The 32-ounce bottles is expected to stick around so it just might be your new favorite variety.

2020 was an eventful year for IPOs despite the economic hardships caused by COVID-19. Over $300 billion was raised in U.S. equity markets with companies from the tech sector generating a significant amount of hype.

Among these companies were Airbnb DoorDash and Snowflake all of which raised over $3 billion. To put this into perspective let’s look at the 10 biggest U.S. tech IPOs of all time.

The Top 10 U.S. Tech IPOs

Airbnb DoorDash and Snowflake muscled their way into the top 10 raising a combined $10.3 billion dollars in the second half of 2020.

Rank Company IPO Date Amount Raised (USD billions) 1 Facebook May 2012 $16.0 2 Uber May 2019 $8.1 3 Agere Systems March 2001 $4.1 4 Snap March 2017 $3.9 5 Airbnb December 2020 $3.5 6 Snowflake September 2020 $3.4 7 DoorDash December 2020 $3.4 8 Lyft March 2019 $2.6 9 Altice USA June 2017 $2.2 10 Twitter November 2013 $2.1

Not adjusted for inflation.

More than eight years after going public Facebook maintains a sizable lead over industry peers. The $16.0 billion IPO by the social networking company is also the second largest in U.S. business history falling only shy of the $17.9 billion raised by Visa in March 2008.

The Airbnb IPO

Airbnb is an online vacation marketplace that connects vacationers with “hosts” who offer accommodations for short-term booking. Since its creation in 2008 Airbnb has grown in size and influence disrupting the hotel industry in the process.

Airbnb’s IPO raised $3.5 billion by selling 51.5 million Class A shares at $68 each. Airbnb shares closed 112% higher after their first day of trading on December 10 a sign of strong investor optimism.

The Snowflake IPO

Snowflake is a data-warehousing company that provides its customers with cloud-based data storage services. Noteworthy clients of Snowflake include CapitalOne Logitech and the University of Notre Dame.

Snowflake’s IPO raised $3.4 billion by selling 28 million Class A shares at $120 each. Similar to Airbnb shares of Snowflake made an impressive climb on their first day of trading even surpassing the $300 mark. With this achievement Snowflake became the largest company to double its market cap on opening day.

The DoorDash IPO

DoorDash is a food delivery platform similar in concept to Uber Eats and Grubhub. The business was well-positioned to take advantage of COVID-19 lockdowns which had led to a surge in food delivery orders.

DoorDash’s IPO raised $3.4 billion by selling roughly 33 million Class A shares at $102 each. Like its peers DoorDash rose on its first day of trading closing at $189.51 a share.

Investor Optimism Outweighs Traditional Thinking

A common factor among each of these tech IPOs is that none of the companies have turned a profit. This has drawn criticism from members of the investment industry especially regarding DoorDash’s IPO.

This is Silicon Valley selling public markets an asset at a huge premium…and I think a lot of individual investors rushing into this are going to lose a lot of money.

—David Trainer CEO New Constructs

Regardless DoorDash investors remain bullish. As of February 3 2021 the company’s shares have climbed 27% year to date (YTD).

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAyLTA2L2dvb2dsZS1zLWxvb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yYWlzZWQtYW4tYXdrd2FyZC1xdWVzdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google's Loon Failure Raised an Awkward Question,"A decade ago less than a third of the people in developing regions had access to fast mobile internet connections. This “coverage gap” as it came to be known was a worrisome phenomenon especially to governments keen to compete in the knowledge economy and tech companies eager to profit from it. So in 2013 Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced Loon a “moonshot” project to provide internet to rural and remote regions using high-altitude balloons.

Seven years later 93% of the planet has access to mobile internet which sounds like a huge success. Yet Loon announced in January that it was shutting down. What happened?



From the start challenges abounded for the project including significant technical hurdles and the emergence of other competing means of providing mobile internet. But ultimately Loon didn’t take off because Alphabet failed to recognize that socioeconomic problems — including illiteracy the cost of data and handsets and discrimination — would play a bigger role in keeping people off the internet than a lack of cell towers.



Back in 2010 Google’s founders announced an R&D arm called Google X that would aim to make the world a “radically better place.” Expanding internet access to those who don’t have it was a problem that fit well into the portfolio. The impediments as Loon saw it were primarily low-tech — “jungles archipelagos mountains” — and thus well-suited to its innovations.



The result was a far-out Wi-Fi network flown on high-altitude AI-controlled tennis-court-sized balloons. Astro Teller the “captain of moonshots” at the company gave it a 1% or 2% chance of success initially. But for cash-flush Google the potential payoff was worth the risk. Success would achieve a social good (universal internet access) and lead to a profitable new business. In 2017 Loon provided emergency connectivity to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria and in 2020 it began offering 4G-speed connections to a remote segment of Kenya.



The latter was an impressive achievement but it came much too late. Over the past decade mobile broadband access has expanded rapidly across emerging markets reducing costs. But even as the coverage gap narrowed a persistent “usage gap” remained. According to GSMA the global trade association for mobile network providers there are still some 3.4 billion people living in an area with a mobile broadband network who aren’t using any mobile internet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzE4NzU3LXR5c29uLWZvb2RzLW5hbWVzLW5ldy1jZW_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Foods names new CEO | 2021-06-02,"SPRINGDALE ARK. — Donnie King is the new president and chief executive officer of Tyson Foods Inc. He replaces Dean Banks who is leaving the company and board of directors for personal reasons. The change is effective immediately according to the company.

Mr. King was most recently chief operating officer of Tyson Foods a role he was appointed to in late February. As COO the presidents of Tyson Foods’ fresh meats prepared foods and international businesses reported to Mr. King. He was president of Tyson’s poultry business when he was named COO and retained the responsibility.

Mr. Banks’ tenure as president and CEO was brief. He stepped into the position on Oct. 3 2020 replacing Noel White. Mr. Banks joined Tyson Foods as a director in 2017 and became president of the company in 2019.

“The board and I know that Donnie has a deep understanding of our business values and culture and the solid leadership skills needed to continue to implement our strategy and deliver strong results” said John H. Tyson chairman of the board. “We want to express our appreciation to Dean for his contributions as a board member and executive.”

The difference in professional experience between Mr. Banks and Mr. King is stark. Prior to joining Tyson Foods Mr. Banks worked in technology. He was a project lead and on the leadership team at X a business unit of Alphabet Inc. He also was managing partner of SEED Ventures a group that invested in and developed early-stage health care technologies before joining Alphabet.

Mr. King has spent 35 years in the meat and poultry industry. He joined Tyson Foods in 1982 and held positions in poultry plant and supply chain management. He has held multiple executive leadership positions including group president and chief administration officer president of North American operations and group president of international.

“I’m humbled but excited about leading Tyson Foods a company that feeds millions of people and means so much to me personally” Mr. King said. “I believe we need to be sharply focused on operating with excellence executing our strategies and continuing to innovate across our businesses throughout the world. With our strong leadership team we are committed to winning with our customers and delivering an outstanding team member experience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8wNi9pcy1iaWctdGVjaC1ub3ctanVzdC10b28tYmlnLXRvLXN0b21hY2jSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS9mZWIvMDYvaXMtYmlnLXRlY2gtbm93LWp1c3QtdG9vLWJpZy10by1zdG9tYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is big tech now just too big to stomach?,"The coronavirus pandemic has wrought economic disruption on a global scale but one sector has marched on throughout the chaos: big tech.

Further evidence of the industry’s relentless progress has come in recent weeks with the news that Apple and Amazon both raked in sales of $100bn (£72bn) over the past three months – 25% more than Tesco brings in over a full year.

Amazon also revealed that its founder Jeff Bezos is to step down as chief executive. It was a big moment for the company founded in Seattle 26 years ago. But the shares barely stuttered and few expect the company to either.

The relentless rise of the big six tech firms - Facebook Amazon Netflix Google owner Alphabet Apple and Microsoft now known as the Fangam stocks – powered US markets last year.

The S&P index – the barometer of corporate America – ended the year up more than 18% an extraordinary outcome given the market crash of March. But two-thirds of that gain was entirely down to the increases in value registered by the six Fangam stocks.

The gains are eye-watering. Amazon’s share price is up 62% over the past year valuing the business at $1.7tn $650m more than a year ago. Apple stock is up 70% over the same period an increase which has taken its valuation up by more than $1tn to $2.3tn.

Results published so far in 2021 show no sign that the gains will let up. Apple in January reported its most profitable quarter ever and Facebook also said the pandemic had helped it grow.

Amazon recorded sales of more than $100bn for the first time in the last quarter of 2020 – allowing Bezos to sound a positive note as he changed roles to focus on his ambitions in space his Earth Fund and his ownership of the Washington Post – and Alphabet posted record revenues for the second successive quarter.

The eye-catching performance of big tech has prompted increased political scrutiny and the threat of heightened regulation from Washington especially now that the Democrats have won control of the Senate.

There is now a real possibility that President Biden will take on tech companies over issues such as privacy liability and market dominance. And such is the collective scale of the US tech titans it will be difficult for them to hide.

How big is big tech?

Apple became the world’s first trillion-dollar company in August 2018 (barring a few state-owned oil companies whose true valuations remain murky). Just over two years later – in the midst of the pandemic in August 2020 – Apple notched up the $2tn (£1.5tn) milestone.

The extraordinary size of these companies can be difficult to comprehend. Alphabet’s $162bn of revenues outweighed the size of Hungary’s economy in 2019.

Apple’s $67bn earnings before tax from its last financial year would pay for the UK government’s combined spending on defence and transport.

Amazon’s army of workers worldwide now numbers 1.2 million and it is rated the third biggest employer in the world after Walmart and the China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation.

A late (and perhaps debatable) entrant to the big tech ranks is Tesla. Investors appear to be valuing the US electric car manufacturer more like a tech platform in the hope it will use its brand and nascent autonomous driving software to dominate transportation in the future.

That logic has propelled it into the ranks of the world’s most valuable companies (and has recently made its chief executive Elon Musk the world’s richest man). Its shares have rocketed from $86 at the start of 2020 to $845 now with some investors fearing it is in the throes of an investment bubble.

So how did big tech get so big?

One common complaint about the stock market is that it is disconnected from economic reality with booming growth in share prices even as economies suffer historic recessions.

The flip side is the argument that these companies are more connected to our new reality than ever before: in fact between them the big tech companies are involved in a huge proportion of human interactions with digital tech every day from mobile phones for locked down families to the computers used in businesses all over the world.

The electric car technology pioneered by Tesla will play a key role in fighting the climate crisis – and investors have belatedly got on board.

But big tech’s fate has become disconnected from the rest of the corporate world. As Jeremy Grantham a high-profile investor pointed out last month Tesla’s stock market value is equal to about $1.25m for every car it sells over a year. At rival carmaker General Motors the company is valued at $9000 per car.

Tech’s rise has meant the concentration of market value in the five biggest companies has returned to levels last seen in the early 1970s.

Back then the stock market was dominated by the old industrial economy: photographic film company Eastman Kodak ExxonMobil predecessor Standard Oil and General Motors were in the top five along with IBM and AT&T. Big tech has completely displaced older industries in the top five.

Who benefits from the share price surge?

The rise of big tech has created the biggest personal fortunes ever seen and a new class of hyper-rich: the centibillionaires. Almost all of that wealth comes from shares retained by founders of the business.

During the pandemic that wealth has increased at a phenomenal rate: in 2020 both Bezos and Musk gained more than $100bn apiece – or about $3000 per second.

But there are other beneficiaries. Among the biggest shareholders in all of them are Wall Street and City investment companies such as BlackRock Vanguard and Legal & General. While those asset managers earn juicy fees by charging clients such as pension funds a percentage of stock market gains from the growth of big tech their growth also benefits the ultimate owners – including the pension funds providing for hundreds of millions of people saving for retirement.

UK fund manager Baillie Gifford’s investments in Tesla have made an extraordinary $29bn (£21bn) for investors including pension funds foundations and charities according to figures released to the Guardian. Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust which is managed by Baillie Gifford began buying Tesla heavily in 2013 when the shares were changing hands at about $6 each compared with today’s $840. That soaring share price led Scottish Mortgage to be admitted into the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s biggest listed companies in 2017 and last year the price rise made Scottish Mortgage the best-performing company in the FTSE 100.

Why is size a problem?

With size comes power. A simple change in an algorithm can wipe out smaller companies reliant on tech companies’ platforms or even nascent industries. Changes to Facebook’s algorithm in 2018 hit some viral publishers’ revenues hard while the complexities of negotiating Amazon’s search rankings have spawned an advisory industry.

And the companies have also sought increasingly to influence politics. Google overtook Goldman Sachs as the biggest spender on political donations for the first time in 2014. The six tech companies’ total spend on lobbying in the US had risen to $64m in 2019 according to the US Center for Responsive Politics. While that amount is tiny compared with the companies’ profits its rapid rise represents big tech’s increasing attempts to influence policy directly.

Big tech’s increasing size gives it another big advantage: the bigger it becomes the harder it is to challenge.

This has always been a problem with dominant companies who are able to use their scale to win better deals and lower prices. But with the tech platforms such as social networks or Amazon’s retail network the more users they have the faster their value grows. It is what economists call the network effect.

Where could big tech fall foul of regulators?

Some of the big tech companies have been able to avoid any major competition enquiries in part because they offer consumers cheaper services than ever before. However there is increasing scrutiny of monopolistic practices.

One area of focus has been their willingness to pay what seemed like very high prices for fast-growing competitors.

Emails unearthed by US Congress showed that Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook should buy Instagram in part to neutralise its threat. Facebook has – contravening previous pledges – started to slowly combine Instagram’s messaging technology with its other social network Whatsapp.

Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny in the US over its dominance of internet search which the EU in 2017 found it had abused by boosting results for its own services.

Apple is facing a growing backlash by companies trying to sell services to iPhone users. Epic Games the maker of the wildly popular Fortnite franchise and music streaming platform Spotify have both launched legal complaints against Apple’s insistence that it takes a 30% cut of all sales made through the app store – including music streaming subscriptions that Spotify and many other third-party app developers have long complained is an unfair “tax”.

And tax? How much do they pay?

One controversy is common to all of the US tech companies (although by no means confined to them): tax avoidance techniques that critics see as aggressive and unfair to smaller competitors.

All of the big tech companies use subsidiaries in low-tax countries such as Luxembourg Bermuda and Ireland to sell services to end markets such as the UK. Fair Tax Mark a non-governmental organisation last year singled out Amazon in particular for its opaque tax structures and low amounts of tax paid relative to profits.

Globally Fair Tax Mark calculated the six big tech companies had paid $100bn less cash in taxes over a decade than they had provided for in their accounts primarily by shifting profits to tax havens and using creative accounting techniques that are legal but are usually unavailable to smaller companies.

The companies paid $155bn less than might be expected under headline tax rates – money that could have been used to fund public services and infrastructure around the world.

Complex legal structures make it impossible to work out precisely how much profit the big tech companies shift out of individual countries but Tax Watch UK a campaign group estimated that Google Facebook Apple and Microsoft as well as network tech company Cisco avoided £5bn in UK corporation tax between 2012 and 2017.

None of the companies have confirmed such data although all have said their tax structures follow the law.

Can they be forced to pay more?

World leaders are acutely aware of tax issues in particular and there has been some progress on moving towards a global tax regime to reduce profit shifting from country to country. The US government has up until now looked askance at efforts coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to allow other countries to tax American tech champions more. However a Biden administration may make a limited deal more likely.

Individual countries have tried to target big tech including the UK with its digital services tax. But Amazon’s revelation that it will not itself pay the levy – but will pass it on to other sellers which use its platform – shows how difficult it is for one country to strike out on its own.

Could big tech be broken up?

The most likely challenges to the big tech companies are likely to come from policymakers in their two biggest markets: the US and the EU.

The EU has won some notable victories against the tech companies but has also some painful defeats – such as a court ruling last year that Apple did not have to pay a €13bn (£11.4bn) Irish tax bill. More onerous regulations in the second biggest market could be costly for tech companies.

In the US businesses have been forcibly broken up in the past. Most famously in 1911 the Sherman Act of 1890 was used to force Standard Oil to split into 34 separate companies. It was used again to force the breakup of the AT&T telephone company in 1984 and against Microsoft in 1998 though an order to split that company into two was later overturned on appeal.

More recently in the US Congress a committee report found big tech has “too much power” and Google and Facebook face significant if limited antitrust actions by US regulators and prosecutors. In October last year the US Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Google and said it was “again enforcing the Sherman Act to restore the role of competition”.

However these complex cases could last years and it is likely that the authorities would settle for remedies short of a complete breakup.

There is growing consensus on both sides of the bitter political divide that some of the big tech companies need more oversight although finding consensus on solutions will be much more difficult.

Kamala Harris then a US senator said in 2019 that there needed to be more regulation. Whether that attitude is picked up by Joe Biden’s White House now Harris is the vice-president is the biggest question facing big tech over the next four years.

Now a Swiss technology company says it has made a breakthrough by using quantum computers to uncover vulnerabilities in commonly used encryption. The company believes it's found a security weakness that could jeopardize the confidentiality of the world's internet data banking transactions and emails.

Terra Quantum AG said its discovery “upends the current understanding of what constitutes unbreakable” encryption and could have major implications for the world's leading technology companies such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.

Terra Quantum AG has a team of about 80 quantum physicists cryptographers and mathematicians who are based in Switzerland Russia Finland and the US “What currently is viewed as being post-quantum secure is not post-quantum secure” said Markus Pflitsch chief executive officer and founder of Terra Quantum in an interview. “We can show and have proven that it isn't secure and is hackable.”

Pflitsch founded the company in 2019. He's a former finance executive who began his career as a research scientist at CERN the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Terra Quantum's research is led by two chief technology officers – Gordey Lesovik head of the Laboratory of Quantum Information Technology at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Valerii Vinokur a Chicago-based physicist who in 2020 won the Fritz London Memorial Prize for his work in condensed matter and theoretical physics.

The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers including the Advanced Encryption Standard or AES which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.

Vinokur said in an interview that Terra Quantum's team made the discovery after figuring out how to invert what's called a “hash function” a mathematical algorithm that converts a message or portion of data into a numerical value. The research will show that “what was once believed unbreakable doesn't exist anymore” Vinokur said adding that the finding “means a thousand other ways can be found soon.”

The company which is backed by the Zurich-based venture capital firm Lakestar LP has developed a new encryption protocol that it says can't be broken by quantum computers. Vinokur said the new protocol utilizes a method known as quantum key distribution.

Terra Quantum is currently pursuing a patent for the new protocol. But the company will make it available for free according to Pflitsch. “We will open up access to our protocol to make sure we have a safe and secure environment” said Pflitsch. “We feel obliged to share it with the world and the quantum community.”

He replaces Dean Banks who is leaving the company and board of directors for personal reasons. The change is effective immediately according to the company.

Mr. King was most recently chief operating officer of Tyson Foods a role he was appointed to in late February. As COO the presidents of Tyson Foods’ fresh meats prepared foods and international businesses reported to Mr. King. He was president of Tyson’s poultry business when he was named COO and retained the responsibility.

Mr. Banks’ tenure as president and CEO was brief. He stepped into the position on Oct. 3 2020 replacing Noel White. Mr. Banks joined Tyson Foods as a director in 2017 and became president of the company in 2019.

“The board and I know that Donnie has a deep understanding of our business values and culture and the solid leadership skills needed to continue to implement our strategy and deliver strong results” said John H. Tyson chairman of the board. “We want to express our appreciation to Dean for his contributions as a board member and executive.”

The difference in professional experience between Mr. Banks and Mr. King is stark. Prior to joining Tyson Foods Mr. Banks worked in technology. He was a project lead and on the leadership team at X a business unit of Alphabet Inc. He also was managing partner of SEED Ventures a group that invested in and developed early-stage health care technologies before joining Alphabet.

Mr. King has spent 35 years in the meat and poultry industry. He joined Tyson Foods in 1982 and held positions in poultry plant and supply chain management. He has held multiple executive leadership positions including group president and chief administration officer president of North American operations and group president of international.

“I’m humbled but excited about leading Tyson Foods a company that feeds millions of people and means so much to me personally” Mr. King said. “I believe we need to be sharply focused on operating with excellence executing our strategies and continuing to innovate across our businesses throughout the world. With our strong leadership team we are committed to winning with our customers and delivering an outstanding team member experience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8wNi9pcy1iaWctdGVjaC1ub3ctanVzdC10b28tYmlnLXRvLXN0b21hY2jSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS9mZWIvMDYvaXMtYmlnLXRlY2gtbm93LWp1c3QtdG9vLWJpZy10by1zdG9tYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is big tech now just too big to stomach?,"The coronavirus pandemic has wrought economic disruption on a global scale but one sector has marched on throughout the chaos: big tech.

Further evidence of the industry’s relentless progress has come in recent weeks with the news that Apple and Amazon both raked in sales of $100bn (£72bn) over the past three months – 25% more than Tesco brings in over a full year.

Amazon also revealed that its founder Jeff Bezos is to step down as chief executive. It was a big moment for the company founded in Seattle 26 years ago. But the shares barely stuttered and few expect the company to either.

The relentless rise of the big six tech firms - Facebook Amazon Netflix Google owner Alphabet Apple and Microsoft now known as the Fangam stocks – powered US markets last year.

The S&P index – the barometer of corporate America – ended the year up more than 18% an extraordinary outcome given the market crash of March. But two-thirds of that gain was entirely down to the increases in value registered by the six Fangam stocks.

The gains are eye-watering. Amazon’s share price is up 62% over the past year valuing the business at $1.7tn $650m more than a year ago. Apple stock is up 70% over the same period an increase which has taken its valuation up by more than $1tn to $2.3tn.

Results published so far in 2021 show no sign that the gains will let up. Apple in January reported its most profitable quarter ever and Facebook also said the pandemic had helped it grow.

Amazon recorded sales of more than $100bn for the first time in the last quarter of 2020 – allowing Bezos to sound a positive note as he changed roles to focus on his ambitions in space his Earth Fund and his ownership of the Washington Post – and Alphabet posted record revenues for the second successive quarter.

The eye-catching performance of big tech has prompted increased political scrutiny and the threat of heightened regulation from Washington especially now that the Democrats have won control of the Senate.

There is now a real possibility that President Biden will take on tech companies over issues such as privacy liability and market dominance. And such is the collective scale of the US tech titans it will be difficult for them to hide.

How big is big tech?

Apple became the world’s first trillion-dollar company in August 2018 (barring a few state-owned oil companies whose true valuations remain murky). Just over two years later – in the midst of the pandemic in August 2020 – Apple notched up the $2tn (£1.5tn) milestone.

The extraordinary size of these companies can be difficult to comprehend. Alphabet’s $162bn of revenues outweighed the size of Hungary’s economy in 2019.

Apple’s $67bn earnings before tax from its last financial year would pay for the UK government’s combined spending on defence and transport.

Amazon’s army of workers worldwide now numbers 1.2 million and it is rated the third biggest employer in the world after Walmart and the China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation.

A late (and perhaps debatable) entrant to the big tech ranks is Tesla. Investors appear to be valuing the US electric car manufacturer more like a tech platform in the hope it will use its brand and nascent autonomous driving software to dominate transportation in the future.

That logic has propelled it into the ranks of the world’s most valuable companies (and has recently made its chief executive Elon Musk the world’s richest man). Its shares have rocketed from $86 at the start of 2020 to $845 now with some investors fearing it is in the throes of an investment bubble.

So how did big tech get so big?

One common complaint about the stock market is that it is disconnected from economic reality with booming growth in share prices even as economies suffer historic recessions.

The flip side is the argument that these companies are more connected to our new reality than ever before: in fact between them the big tech companies are involved in a huge proportion of human interactions with digital tech every day from mobile phones for locked down families to the computers used in businesses all over the world.

The electric car technology pioneered by Tesla will play a key role in fighting the climate crisis – and investors have belatedly got on board.

But big tech’s fate has become disconnected from the rest of the corporate world. As Jeremy Grantham a high-profile investor pointed out last month Tesla’s stock market value is equal to about $1.25m for every car it sells over a year. At rival carmaker General Motors the company is valued at $9000 per car.

Tech’s rise has meant the concentration of market value in the five biggest companies has returned to levels last seen in the early 1970s.

Back then the stock market was dominated by the old industrial economy: photographic film company Eastman Kodak ExxonMobil predecessor Standard Oil and General Motors were in the top five along with IBM and AT&T. Big tech has completely displaced older industries in the top five.

Who benefits from the share price surge?

The rise of big tech has created the biggest personal fortunes ever seen and a new class of hyper-rich: the centibillionaires. Almost all of that wealth comes from shares retained by founders of the business.

During the pandemic that wealth has increased at a phenomenal rate: in 2020 both Bezos and Musk gained more than $100bn apiece – or about $3000 per second.

But there are other beneficiaries. Among the biggest shareholders in all of them are Wall Street and City investment companies such as BlackRock Vanguard and Legal & General. While those asset managers earn juicy fees by charging clients such as pension funds a percentage of stock market gains from the growth of big tech their growth also benefits the ultimate owners – including the pension funds providing for hundreds of millions of people saving for retirement.

UK fund manager Baillie Gifford’s investments in Tesla have made an extraordinary $29bn (£21bn) for investors including pension funds foundations and charities according to figures released to the Guardian. Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust which is managed by Baillie Gifford began buying Tesla heavily in 2013 when the shares were changing hands at about $6 each compared with today’s $840. That soaring share price led Scottish Mortgage to be admitted into the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s biggest listed companies in 2017 and last year the price rise made Scottish Mortgage the best-performing company in the FTSE 100.

Why is size a problem?

With size comes power. A simple change in an algorithm can wipe out smaller companies reliant on tech companies’ platforms or even nascent industries. Changes to Facebook’s algorithm in 2018 hit some viral publishers’ revenues hard while the complexities of negotiating Amazon’s search rankings have spawned an advisory industry.

And the companies have also sought increasingly to influence politics. Google overtook Goldman Sachs as the biggest spender on political donations for the first time in 2014. The six tech companies’ total spend on lobbying in the US had risen to $64m in 2019 according to the US Center for Responsive Politics. While that amount is tiny compared with the companies’ profits its rapid rise represents big tech’s increasing attempts to influence policy directly.

Big tech’s increasing size gives it another big advantage: the bigger it becomes the harder it is to challenge.

This has always been a problem with dominant companies who are able to use their scale to win better deals and lower prices. But with the tech platforms such as social networks or Amazon’s retail network the more users they have the faster their value grows. It is what economists call the network effect.

Where could big tech fall foul of regulators?

Some of the big tech companies have been able to avoid any major competition enquiries in part because they offer consumers cheaper services than ever before. However there is increasing scrutiny of monopolistic practices.

One area of focus has been their willingness to pay what seemed like very high prices for fast-growing competitors.

Emails unearthed by US Congress showed that Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook should buy Instagram in part to neutralise its threat. Facebook has – contravening previous pledges – started to slowly combine Instagram’s messaging technology with its other social network Whatsapp.

Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny in the US over its dominance of internet search which the EU in 2017 found it had abused by boosting results for its own services.

Apple is facing a growing backlash by companies trying to sell services to iPhone users. Epic Games the maker of the wildly popular Fortnite franchise and music streaming platform Spotify have both launched legal complaints against Apple’s insistence that it takes a 30% cut of all sales made through the app store – including music streaming subscriptions that Spotify and many other third-party app developers have long complained is an unfair “tax”.

And tax? How much do they pay?

One controversy is common to all of the US tech companies (although by no means confined to them): tax avoidance techniques that critics see as aggressive and unfair to smaller competitors.

All of the big tech companies use subsidiaries in low-tax countries such as Luxembourg Bermuda and Ireland to sell services to end markets such as the UK. Fair Tax Mark a non-governmental organisation last year singled out Amazon in particular for its opaque tax structures and low amounts of tax paid relative to profits.

Globally Fair Tax Mark calculated the six big tech companies had paid $100bn less cash in taxes over a decade than they had provided for in their accounts primarily by shifting profits to tax havens and using creative accounting techniques that are legal but are usually unavailable to smaller companies.

The companies paid $155bn less than might be expected under headline tax rates – money that could have been used to fund public services and infrastructure around the world.

Complex legal structures make it impossible to work out precisely how much profit the big tech companies shift out of individual countries but Tax Watch UK a campaign group estimated that Google Facebook Apple and Microsoft as well as network tech company Cisco avoided £5bn in UK corporation tax between 2012 and 2017.

None of the companies have confirmed such data although all have said their tax structures follow the law.

Can they be forced to pay more?

World leaders are acutely aware of tax issues in particular and there has been some progress on moving towards a global tax regime to reduce profit shifting from country to country. The US government has up until now looked askance at efforts coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to allow other countries to tax American tech champions more. However a Biden administration may make a limited deal more likely.

Individual countries have tried to target big tech including the UK with its digital services tax. But Amazon’s revelation that it will not itself pay the levy – but will pass it on to other sellers which use its platform – shows how difficult it is for one country to strike out on its own.

Could big tech be broken up?

The most likely challenges to the big tech companies are likely to come from policymakers in their two biggest markets: the US and the EU.

The EU has won some notable victories against the tech companies but has also some painful defeats – such as a court ruling last year that Apple did not have to pay a €13bn (£11.4bn) Irish tax bill. More onerous regulations in the second biggest market could be costly for tech companies.

In the US businesses have been forcibly broken up in the past. Most famously in 1911 the Sherman Act of 1890 was used to force Standard Oil to split into 34 separate companies. It was used again to force the breakup of the AT&T telephone company in 1984 and against Microsoft in 1998 though an order to split that company into two was later overturned on appeal.

More recently in the US Congress a committee report found big tech has “too much power” and Google and Facebook face significant if limited antitrust actions by US regulators and prosecutors. In October last year the US Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Google and said it was “again enforcing the Sherman Act to restore the role of competition”.

However these complex cases could last years and it is likely that the authorities would settle for remedies short of a complete breakup.

There is growing consensus on both sides of the bitter political divide that some of the big tech companies need more oversight although finding consensus on solutions will be much more difficult.

Kamala Harris then a US senator said in 2019 that there needed to be more regulation. Whether that attitude is picked up by Joe Biden’s White House now Harris is the vice-president is the biggest question facing big tech over the next four years.

When we launched the Climate Pledge Amazon set a goal to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2030. We now believe we are on a path to reach this goal by 2025.

Our latest renewable energy investment the Amazon-Shell HKN Offshore Wind Project is Amazon’s largest single-site renewable energy project to date.

The offshore wind farm is operated by the Crosswind Consortium a joint venture between energy companies Shell and Eneco. It is scheduled for operation by 2024 and will have an overall capacity of 759 megawatts (MW) that will supply the electrical grid powering the Netherlands without government subsidies. Amazon is purchasing over 50 percent of that capacity a total of 380 MW to power our operations in Europe. Our investment further enables the development of this large-scale innovative wind project.

Our collaboration combines Amazon's scale with the innovation of the Crosswind Consortium. In this project the Consortium has proposed a number of unique innovations for the wind farm including technology demonstrations that could be implemented at full scale in the future. These include a floating solar park short-term battery storage optimally tuned turbines and ‘green hydrogen’ made by electrolysis as a further storage technique. In addition this project offers the opportunity to demonstrate the combination of these measures to ensure a continuous power supply regardless of wind conditions.

About Amazon’s Climate Pledge

In 2019 Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040.

Significant investments in renewable energy are a critical step to reduce Amazon’s carbon footprint globally. With 187 solar and wind projects worldwide Amazon is the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 GW and deliver more than 20 million MWh of energy annually. They include 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment centers and sort centers around the globe.

Across Europe these investments include 20 solar rooftops atop Amazon fulfillment centers and 16 utility-scale wind and solar projects in Ireland United Kingdom France Germany Spain Italy and Sweden. This is Amazon’s second offshore wind project.

Permanent Representatives of Member States Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

Dear Ambassadors

As the OECD Environment Policy Committee (EPOC) prepares to review Brazil’s status with the committee at its upcoming meeting in February we are urging member states’ delegations to examine the environmental and human rights impacts of President Jair Bolsonaro’s disastrous policies in the Amazon which we believe should disqualify Brazil from a status upgrade at this time.

EPOC’s mandate includes supporting “the development of policies aiming at protecting and restoring the environment as well as responding to major environmental issues and threats.” It also includes ensuring that “the views and expertise of non-government institutions are drawn upon in the conduct of OECD’s environmental work.”[1]

The Bolsonaro administration however has actively and openly worked against these objectives. It has sabotaged Brazil’s environmental law enforcement agencies falsely accused civil society organizations of environmental crimes and sidelined them from policymaking and sought to undermine Indigenous rights. As we detail in the attached briefing document these policies have contributed to soaring deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon an ecosystem vital for containing global warming.

President Bolsonaro’s rhetoric and actions have effectively given a green light to criminal networks that are driving much of the deforestation. These mafias engage in acts of violence and intimidation against Brazilian forest defenders including environmental enforcement agents Indigenous communities and other local residents. The fires that they and others set to clear deforested land produce pollution that poisons the air breathed by millions of Brazilians taking a grave toll on public health in the region. Those responsible for the environmental crimes violence and fires are almost never brought to justice.

If OECD member states were to upgrade Brazil’s EPOC status while the Bolsonaro government is so flagrantly flouting the principles espoused by the committee in its mandate – with devastating consequences for the environment and human rights in the Amazon – it would undermine the credibility of the EPOC’s commitment to these principles. It would also send a discouraging message to the many Brazilians who are facing violence and intimidation in retaliation for their efforts to preserve the world’s largest rainforest.

More broadly in future discussions on Brazil’s request for OECD accession we urge you to pay close attention to the Bolsonaro’s administration’s record with regard to environmental policies deforestation and respect for the rights of forest defenders and Indigenous peoples. OECD member states should send a clear signal to the Bolsonaro government that they will not support Brazil’s candidacy unless its current policies on those issues radically change to protect the environment and support its defenders and until Brazil demonstrates concrete results in reducing deforestation and lawlessness in the Amazon.

Environmental Setbacks Under the Bolsonaro Administration

I. Deforestation

Since President Bolsonaro took office in 2019 deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased dramatically. The increase was more than 30 percent during the first year of his administration and an additional 9.5 percent during the second year according to official figures.[2] Last year over 11000 square kilometers of rainforest were lost nearly triple the 3925 square kilometers target that Brazil committed itself to reaching by 2020 as part of its National Climate Change Policy.[3] Overall deforestation under President Bolsonaro has reached the highest level over the past decade.

The accelerated destruction of the Brazilian Amazon could have devastating consequences for the region and global efforts to mitigate climate change. Scientists estimate that 17 percent of all the Amazon has already been deforested. If the current rate of destruction continues between 20 and 25 per cent of the rainforest could be cleared in under two decades pushing the Amazon towards a tipping point when vast portions of the rainforest would turn into dry savannah decimating Brazilian agriculture altering weather patterns and water cycles across South America and releasing billions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere.[4]

Official Deforestation Figures

The Deforestation of the Legal Amazon Satellite Monitoring Project (PRODES) a system run by Brazil’s National Space Research Agency (INPE) produces annual official estimates of clear-cut deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon through analysis of satellite imagery.[5] The consolidated figure covers the 12-month period from August of the previous year through July (it does not provide month-to-month estimates). As evidenced by PRODES figures deforestation under President Bolsonaro is significantly higher than any other year over the past decade (see graph below).

The Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER) operated by INPE provides near real-time alerts of deforestation based on satellite imagery to guide environmental enforcement efforts. The alerts are an indication of deforestation but because of cloud cover and other factors they often underestimate total deforestation in relation to PRODES. Unlike PRODES however DETER does provide daily and monthly estimates of deforestation. DETER monthly estimates show that over two thirds of the deforestation in the period between August 2018 and June 2019 took place after President Jair Bolsonaro took office.[6]

II. Forest Fires

Forest fires are closely linked to deforestation in Brazil. They do not occur naturally in the wet ecosystem of the Amazon basin but rather are frequently started by people completing the process of deforestation where the trees of value have already been removed often illegally. A total of 55 percent of the area cleared in the rainforest in 2019 was burned equivalent to over 5500 square kilometers.[7] Data is not available for the area deforested and burned in 2020 but the number of fires detected in 2020 increased by 157 percent in relation to 2019.[8]

The impact of these fires extends beyond the deforested lands when they spread to the remaining forest destroying healthy trees and opening up the overstory. This enables more sunlight to penetrate the forest drying up vegetation on the ground and making it more flammable leaving the forest more vulnerable for the next burning season.

In addition to the environmental consequences the forest fires linked to deforestation produce air pollution that has a significant negative impact on public health in the Amazon region. In 2019 the pollution from the fires led to 2195 hospitalizations due to respiratory illness according to a report by Human Rights Watch the Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazônia (IPAM) and the Instituto de Estudos para Políticas de Saúde (IEPS) that analyzed official health and environmental data.[9]

Hospitalizations are a small fraction of the overall health toll of the fires. In total the air pollution affected millions of people. In August 2019 nearly 3 million people in the Amazon region were exposed to harmful air pollution levels above the World Health Organization’s recommended threshold. The number increased to 4.5 million people in September the report showed (see graphs below). [10]

III. Weakened Environmental Agencies

Since President Bolsonaro took office in 2019 his administration has moved aggressively to undermine the enforcement of environmental laws in Brazil.

The Bolsonaro administration has weakened the country’s main federal environmental enforcement agency the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). Shortly after beginning his term at an agribusiness fair attended by landowners President Bolsonaro said he had ordered Environment Minister Salles to “clean out” IBAMA.[11] Subsequently Minister Salles removed 21 of the 27 regional directors who were responsible for anti-logging operations marking the largest such removal in the institution’s thirty-year history.[12] An inspection by a federal oversight body concluded that several of the replacements appointed by Salles did not meet the minimum requirements for the positions they filled; these included the new directors for Mato Grosso Pará–Brazil’s largest timber producers–and four other Amazon states.[13]

In 2009 IBAMA employed some 1600 inspectors throughout Brazil. While numbers have declined over the years the Bolsonaro administration has made aggressive cuts: in 2019 when he took office IBAMA employed 780 inspectors in 2020 it employed 667.[14] Inspectors conduct field monitoring and are deployed for environmental law enforcement including fining loggers and confiscating their equipment. Only a fraction of these inspectors is devoted to the Amazon region leaving large swaths of the rainforest with limited presence of inspectors. For instance in May 2019 there were only eight IBAMA inspectors for the western half of Pará – an area almost as big as France – an IBAMA official informed Human Rights Watch.[15]

In addition to being severely understaffed environmental agencies are also facing historic budgetary cuts. The 2021 budget proposed by the federal government for its environmental agencies is the lowest in 13 years according to data from the Brazilian transparency research center Contas Abertas. The government’s budget proposal for the Environment Ministry the agencies under its administration and other environment-linked expenditures programs is 2.9 billion reais (US$530.50 million). That represents a 5.4% drop from the government’s budget proposal for environmental protection last year down to the lowest level in the Contas Abertas analysis going back to 2008.[16]

The government has also imposed strict restrictions on environmental agencies’ ability to share information directly with the media undermining accountability and transparency. In March 2019 news reports stated that Minister Salles had decided that the Environment Ministry would manage the press requests addressed to IBAMA and another environmental enforcement agency interfering with the autonomy of these two federal bodies. (Minister Salles had previously also dismissed IBAMA’s head of communications.)[17] Subsequently in March 2020 the president of IBAMA– an appointee of Minister Salles–required that IBAMA officials report any attempt by a journalist to contact them.[18]

In February 2020 President Bolsonaro issued a decree creating an ‘Amazon Council’ charged with protecting the rainforest.[19] The vice-president a retired army general presides over the council and has the authority to make all final decisions side-lining seasoned environmental officials to secondary roles.[20] As part of the move to centralize command control in the Amazon Council in May 2020 the federal government transferred responsibility for leading environmental enforcement efforts in the Amazon from IBAMA and other environmental agencies to the armed forces which do not possess the technical expertise nor training necessary to fulfill this role.[21]

The armed forces have been largely ineffective at significantly curbing environmental destruction of the Brazilian Amazon. The extension of public forests illegally deforested was 2265 square kilometers in 2020 in comparison to an average of 1128 square kilometers between 2014 and 2018 indicating a surge in invasions of public lands under the army’s watch.[22] The number of fires detected in the Amazon in 2020 was 15.7 percent higher than in 2019 despite a decree issued by the federal government in mid-July prohibiting the burning of vegetation in the Amazon for four months.[23]

IV. Impunity for Environmental Destruction

The Bolsonaro administration also moved to reduce the sanctions faced by those caught engaging in illegal logging and other environmental crimes.

Under the Bolsonaro administration the number of environmental fines issued by IBAMA for illegal deforestation and other environmental infractions has dropped dramatically. In previous years IBAMA had issued an average of 16000 fines every year. In 2019 it issued only 11914. In 2020 that number dropped to 9516 the lowest in 20 years and 40 percent below the average.[24] President Bolsonaro publicly celebrated the decrease in fines and promised these would continue to be slashed: “in the first two months of this year we had the least fines issued in the field and these will continue to diminish” he said in June 2019 “we will end this fine factory.”[25]

In addition to issuing fewer fines the Bolsonaro administration effectively stopped enforcing them. In October 2019 it implemented new procedures establishing that environmental fines should be reviewed at “conciliation hearings” in which a commission can offer discounts or eliminate the fine altogether. The Environment Ministry suspended all deadlines to pay those fines until a hearing could be held. Between October 2019 – when the decree came into force – and November 2020 federal environmental agencies held only five such conciliation hearings.[26] In practice this means that the requirement to pay for nearly all the fines imposed during that period of more than a year was effectively suspended. In November 2020 the Ministry of Environment established through a new ordinance that those fined for environmental infractions would have 30 days to opt for the conciliation hearing; if there is no interest in attending a hearing deadlines to pay or challenge the fine must resume. The new system will have to contend with a backlog of thousands of unpaid fines.[27]

V. Undermining Protection of Indigenous Territories

The demarcation and protection of Indigenous territories has been a cornerstone of successful conservation efforts in the Amazon as well as a fundamental step toward the recognition and respect of Indigenous rights.[28] Under the Bolsonaro administration illegal incursions and environmental destruction within these areas have greatly increased encouraged by the president’s rhetoric and actions to undermine oversight of these territories.[29]

Since President Bolsonaro took office in January 2019 the federal government has not demarcated any new Indigenous territories even though the constitution requires it to demarcate and protect such territories (there are currently 237 pending requests for demarcation).[30] President Bolsonaro vowed not to designate “one more centimeter” of land as Indigenous territory and tabled a bill in Congress to open up Indigenous land to mining and other commercial enterprises.[31]

In April 2019 the Bolsonaro government eliminated by decree the committee to implement the National Policy of Environmental and Land Management in Indigenous Territories designed to promote environmental protection in Indigenous territories.[32]

During President Bolsonaro’s first year in office there was a 135 percent increase in illegal invasions illegal logging land grabbing and other infringement upon Indigenous areas according to the Indigenist Missionary Council (CIMI) a non-profit organization.[33]

Under Bolsonaro deforestation in Indigenous lands is higher than it has been over the past ten years and 2019 marked the worst year since Brazil began monitoring deforestation in Indigenous territories according to data from INPE.[34] While 2020 registered a decrease compared to the 2019 peak deforestation in Indigenous territories remained significantly higher than in previous years on record (see graph below).

VI. Impunity for Violence Against Forest Defenders

A 2019 report by Human Rights Watch documented criminal networks engaged in illegal deforestation in the Amazon use violence and intimidation against anyone who threatens their illegal activities including against enforcement agents and members of local communities.[35]

Impunity for these and other acts of violence in the Amazon is the norm. During a decade more than 300 people were killed in conflicts over the use of land and resources in Amazonian states — many of them by people involved in illegal deforestation — according to data provided to Human Rights Watch by the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) a nonprofit organization that has offices across the country to provide legal and other aid to victims. Only 14 of these killings have ultimately gone to trial. Of the 28 killings that Human Rights Watch documented in our 2019 report only two have gone to trial and of the more than 40 cases of threats none did.

VII. Corruption Linked to Environmental Destruction

Corruption and money-laundering facilitate environmental crimes and undermine enforcement of environmental regulations. Therefore addressing environmental crimes effectively requires not only solid environmental governance but also strong anti-corruption institutions.[36]

In the states of Mato Grosso and Pará Brazil’s two main producers of timber 39% and 70% respectively of timber production exploitation is carried out in violation of logging regulations and laws studies by Brazilian environmental research centers have shown.[37] Environmental crimes such as these are made possible by widespread fraud in Forest Management Plans and forged documentation that misrepresents the origin of timber major investigations by the Office of the Federal Prosecutor suggest.[38] Those investigations indicate that these “timber laundering” schemes were facilitated by corrupt public servants who allegedly received bribes in exchange for approving fraudulent documents or turning a blind eye to environmental crimes.[39]

There have been significant setbacks in anti-corruption governance under the Bolsonaro administration according to Transparency International Brazil including growing political interference in the bodies responsible for preventing and combating corruption and money-laundering. [40]

The Bolsonaro administration has also dismantled transparency and participatory governance mechanisms. For instance it reduced civil society representatives in the National Council for the Environment (CONAMA) and the Climate Fund’s steering committee.[41] Meanwhile high-level officials – including the president and vice-president – have questioned the data on deforestation produced by INPE without producing evidence of any inaccuracies in the data from the government’s own institution in an apparent attempt to reduce transparency on pressing environmental issues.[42]

VIII. Hostility Toward Civil Society

President Bolsonaro called NGOs working in the Amazon a “cancer” that he “can’t kill” and accused them without any proof of being responsible for the destruction of the rainforest. He also blamed Indigenous people and small farmers again without evidence for Amazon fires.[43]

In September 2020 Environment Minister Ricardo Salles petitioned a federal court to order a leading environmental defender to explain comments criticizing the minister a measure seemingly intended to intimidate the defender.[44] Previously Salles took the same measure to target a scientist from INPE who publicly referred to the minister’s conviction for administrative misconduct in an interview about deforestation in the Amazon according to press reports.[45]

In October 2020 media reported that the Bolsonaro administration had deployed the country’s secret service to spy on the Brazilian delegation NGOs and others at the December 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid.[46]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NTkyNzk3OdIBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NTkyNzk3OS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon: The unstoppable rise of the internet giant,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHmh0dHBzOi8vb3Vyd29ybGRpbmRhdGEub3JnL3NvedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is our appetite for soy driving deforestation in the Amazon?,"Is our appetite for soy driving deforestation in the Amazon? Soy production – particularly in the Amazonian region – has been linked with deforestation. How much forest is cut down for soy? Cite this article Reuse our work freely

Summary Global soy production has increased more than 10-fold over the past 50 years. This has been driven by increased demand for meat – three-quarters of global soy is fed to livestock – and to a lesser extent soybean oil and biofuels. The United States and Brazil each account for more than one-third of global production. More and more land has been devoted to soy production. For years this came at the cost of rainforest in the Amazon until 2006 when Brazil introduced a ‘Soy Moratorium’ which stipulated that farmers who grew soy on illegal or legal deforestation areas would not be able to sell them to suppliers. This was a success: deforestation for soy in the Brazilian Amazon declined rapidly. Unfortunately soy production was displaced to other areas where forests are at risk: to tackle this zero-deforestation policies need to be extended beyond the Amazon region and the indirect impacts of soy need to be traced more closely.

Soy has earned itself a bad reputation with many consumers. Its links to deforestation means that alongside palm oil soy has become a product to avoid. Is this reputation justified?

In this article we will take a look at the story of soy: how production has changed over time; where it is produced; what it is used for; and whether it really has been a key driver of deforestation. Although the research suggests that by far the largest driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been driven by the expansion of pasture land for beef production soy is likely to have played at least some role in the loss of forest.

More than three-quarters (77%) of global soy is fed to livestock for meat and dairy production. Most of the rest is used for biofuels industry or vegetable oils. Just 7% of soy is used directly for human food products such as tofu soy milk edamame beans and tempeh. The idea that foods often promoted as substitutes for meat and dairy – such as tofu and soy milk – are driving deforestation is a common misconception.

How has demand for soy changed over time?

Global soy production has exploded over the past 50 years. Global production today is more than 13 times higher than it was in the early 1960s. Even since the year 2000 production has more than doubled.

In the chart here we see the change in global soybean production from 1961 onwards.1 Back in the 1960s we were producing 20 to 30 million tonnes per year. This is now 350 million tonnes.

We can increase agricultural production in two ways: by improving yields (growing more on a given plot of land) or expanding the amount of land we use. As we will see later although countries have seen yield gains over time much of the increase in production has been driven by the expansion of croplands. Unfortunately some of this has been at the expense of forests.

Which countries produce the most soy?

Global soy production has increased rapidly over the past 50 years. But to understand whether this has come at a major environmental cost we also need to understand where this growth has come from.

Which countries are the main producers of soy?

In the map we see the distribution of soybean production across the world. Most of the world’s soy comes from only two countries: the US and Brazil. Combined they account for more than two-thirds (69%) of global soy production.2 In fact they produce almost exactly the same amount: in 2018 the US produced 123 million tonnes and Brazil 118 million tonnes. Individually they each account for around one-third of global production. The other major producer is Argentina which accounts for 11% (at 40 million tonnes).

To understand soy as a potential driver of deforestation it’s also useful to understand how each country’s production has changed over time. It is the change in production and how this was achieved (either increased yields or cropland expansion) that is the potential driver of deforestation.

In the other chart we see the change in soy production in Brazil and the US. The US was already producing a lot of soy throughout the 1960s 70s and 80s and so its growth in recent decades has been much slower than Brazil. The US was growing 20 million tonnes per year as early as 1960. Brazil did not reach this level of output until 1990 – three decades later. This means that its rate of growth in the last 30 years has been much faster.

More than three-quarters of global soy is fed to animals

Before we look at the evidence for whether Brazilian soy is responsible for the clearing of the Amazon we should first understand what products have been driving this growth.

When someone mentions soy we often think about foods such as tofu soy milk tempeh or edamame beans. This feeds into the argument that meat and dairy substitutes – such as switching from meat to high-protein tofu or from dairy to soy milk – is in fact worse for the environment. But only a small percentage of global soy is used for these products. More than three-quarters (77%) of soy is used as feed for livestock.

In the chart here we see the breakdown of what the world’s soy was used for in 2018. On the left we have total global soy production; in the middle the three categories of uses (direct human food animal feed and industrial processes); and on the right we have the end use products. This data is sourced from an analysis published by the University of Oxford’s Food Climate Research Network (FCRN) which relies on the USDA’s PSD database.3 Over one-third (37%) of global soy is fed to chickens and other poultry; one-fifth to pigs; and 6% for aquaculture. Very little soy is used for beef and dairy production – only 2%.

One-fifth of the world’s soy is used for direct (i.e. not from meat and dairy) human consumption. Most of this is first processed into soybean oil. Typical soy products such as tofu soy milk tempeh and edamame beans account for just 7% of global demand.

Soy can also be used for industrial purposes. Around 4% is used for biofuels lubricants and other industrial processes. Biodiesel alone accounts for 2.8%.

We might therefore conclude that the increased demand for soy has been driven by a growing appetite for meat dairy and soybean oil. But to double-check we should look beyond this static single-year view and see how demand has changed over time. Maybe demand for these products has always been high and instead the growth in demand has come from the increased popularity of products such as soy milk and tofu.

In the chart we see the allocation of soybeans to three categories. Processed products include all animal feed from soybean cake (i.e. 70% of global demand); soybean oil; and industrial products such as biofuels. Direct human food includes all non-animal-sourced foods from soy excluding oils. Direct animal feed is soybeans fed directly to livestock (rather than been processed into soybean cake first).

We see that most of this growth has come from the increased demand for processed soy – animal feed biofuels and vegetable oil. This rise has been particularly steep since 1990. By 2013 it had increased from 88 million to 227 million tonnes. Over this period demand for human food products such as tofu and soy milk increased by only 3 million tonnes (from 7.4 to 10.7 million).

This should not surprise us. Global meat production has more than tripled over the last 50 years. This increase has been most marked for poultry – the largest consumer of soy feed.

Using the ‘change country’ toggle you can see how this allocation varies by country. For example we see that this distribution is similar for Brazil.

Is soy production driving deforestation?

So far we’ve established that demand for soy has increased rapidly over the past 50 years; most soy is produced in the US Brazil (and to a lesser extent Argentina); and most of this has been driven by increased demand for animal feed biofuels and vegetable oils.

The big question is whether this has been a key driver of deforestation.

The first step to answering this is to understand whether the amount of land we use to grow soy has increased. If improvements in crop yields were able to keep up with this rise in production then we wouldn’t need any additional land and there would be no need to cut down forests.

In the chart we see the change in soy production yields and area harvested. This tells us the percentage change in each of these variables relative to the first year shown. Here the starting year is 1961 but you can change this by adjusting the time slider at the bottom of the chart.

Crop yields have not been able to keep up with production. Since 1961 global yields increased by 150%. But production increased by 1200%. This means the area used to grow soy has more than quadrupled.

This is also true for Brazil [you can see this using the “Change country” toggle]. Since Brazilian soy production was very low in 1961 it makes sense to adjust the time slider to see the change since 1980. Soy yields have doubled since 1980. This is impressive but not enough to keep up with demand: soy production increased by 680%. Instead Brazil has had to devote more and more land to soy production: land use has tripled since 1980.

Brazil has devoted increasing amounts of land to soy production. But has this come at the expense of forests? Has the Amazon been cleared to make room for it?

This is a question many researchers have tried to answer. What makes it complex is that agricultural and land use systems are intricately linked: it’s possible to assess whether soy production has a direct impact on deforestation but much harder to understand whether it is indirectly causing harm elsewhere.

In a study published in Science Alexandra Tyukavina et al. (2017) look at the drivers of forest loss in the Brazilian Legal Amazon.4 The change in these drivers from 2000 to 2013 is shown in the chart. Note that this overall trend suggests a major decline in forest loss since 2000 – unfortunately in the years since 2013 rates have increased again.

From this we would conclude that the dominant driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was the expansion of pasture for beef production. If we look at forest loss from commercial crops – which is mainly soybeans – we see a significant decline especially following the introduction of ‘Brazil’s Soy Moratorium’. The ‘Soy Moratorium’ was a campaign involving civil agencies and soybean companies which stipulated that farmers who grew soy on illegal or legal deforestation areas would not be able to sell them to suppliers. Since 2009 satellite imagery has been used to help to identify soybean crops being grown on deforested areas.5

Numerous studies have reached a very similar conclusion: it is pasture not soybean production that is driving most deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.6 But this only looks at the direct drivers of deforestation. In other words the cutting down of forest today to make space for cropland for soy production.

The indirect impacts of soy production

Soy may no longer be a direct driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. But we should also think about the indirect impacts of increased production. We know that the area being used to grow soy is still increasing and that land has to come from somewhere. In particular regions such as Mato Grosso studies have found that instead of replacing forest these croplands are replacing pasture.7 If this pasture land is simply shifting into forested areas we could argue that soy is still a major underlying cause of deforestation.

A recent study by researchers Nikolas Kuschnig Jesús Crespo Cuaresma and Tamás Krisztin reached this conclusion.8 They combined high-resolution satellite imagery from the Mato Grosso region in Brazil with socioeconomic panel data to not only quantify the direct impacts of soy production but also the spillover effects. The results suggest that by only looking at direct impacts we are underestimating the role that soy continues to play in deforestation.

It’s also the case that the Amazonas region in Brazil gets most of the attention. But most soy is now grown in other regions of the country. In 2015 only 13% came from the Amazon while 48% came from the Cerrado region.9 Some researchers therefore make a strong case that interventions such as the ‘Soy Moratorium’ need to be extended to cover regions beyond the Amazon if they are to be effective. Without wider implementation of these policies we will continue to see deforestation simply shift elsewhere.

Whilst the expansion of pasture for beef production is the leading driver of deforestation in Brazil soy still plays a significant role when we take its indirect impacts into account. To end deforestation there are a couple of key actions we can take. For consumers since most deforestation is driven by expanding pastures for beef or soy to feed poultry and pigs reducing meat consumption is an effective way to make a difference. For companies and regulators zero-deforestation policies must be more widely implemented (i.e. not only focused on the Amazon) and must be more carefully designed to take spillover effects into account.

And since then former TWA employees have felt like they’ve gotten the short end of the stick. The most recent case involves ex-TWA pilots suing both American Airlines and its pilots union arguing that they conspired to strip these pilots of their senior in the airline’s 2011 bankruptcy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit threw out the suit John Krakowski et al. v. Allied Pilots Association et al.

The three-judge panel ruled that two New York federal courts — the district court and the bankruptcy court — were correct to toss litigation accusing American and the Allied Pilots Association of conspiring to cost a group of former Trans World Airlines pilots their seniority perks during an arbitration stemming from American’s bankruptcy. “We affirm the dismissals of the [pilots’] claims against APA and American Airlines for substantially the reasons stated by the bankruptcy court [and district court]” the panel wrote in its summary order affirming the dismissal. “We have considered the [pilots’] remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.”

TWA pilots coming from an airline which had entered into bankruptcy as part of its acquisition by American lost their seniority when they became American Airlines pilots. However they received ‘special job opportunities’ at the ex-TWA St. Louis base but those were foreclosed as part of its bankruptcy (and the St. Louis hub itself was later closed). They lost the commitments they’d received a decade earlier and took their case to arbitration which they thought would restore their seniority and they expected the union to fight for this.

That was never realistic since the TWA pilots were a minority of union members and doing so would have disadvantaged other more senior pilots in the union. When employees join a union it’s often not employees versus the company but some employees sacrificing for the benefit of other employees. American’s flight attendants certainly learned this when their union negotiated that the most junior employees would work early in the pandemic while senior employees would sit home and get paid.

There were 162 ex-TWA pilots based in St. Louis half captains and half first officers out of 900 ex-TWA pilots in total at American when the 2013 deal happened. The captains faced a downgrade to first officer though they were offered captain slots on legacy US Airways Embraer E-190s as part of the merging of pilot seniority across the two airlines though this would mean moving or commuting. Other pilots were expected to drop to reserve status.

There were complicated contractual language disagreements at issue whether the protections TWA pilots had received a decade earlier were guaranteed until one named pilot would have reached the level of captain in the airline’s regular system meant doing so on legacy American Airlines aircraft or whether those US Airways Embraer E-190 jets counted.

The ex-TWA pilots wanted a court to rule that their union had failed to honor its duty to represent them and American was part of the suit because the airline the pilots argued was part of collusion to undermine them.

However the second circuit rejected arguments that had already been rejected in New York bankruptcy court “in 2014 2015 2017 and 2018” for insufficient evidence of collusion and by a federal district court in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1zb3V0aGVybi1hZnJpY2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Doesn't American Airlines Fly To Southern Africa?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1zb3V0aGVybi1hZnJpY2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvcGFuYXNvbmljLWNvbmR1Y3RzLW9uYm9hcmQtc3RyZWFtaW5nLWludGVybmV0LXRyaWFscy13aXRoLWFpcmxpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Panasonic conducts full streaming Internet trials with airlines,"Panasonic Avionics has conducted “full streaming” onboard Internet trials with undisclosed airlines after upgrading its customers’ aircraft to its third-generation (Gen-3) Ku-band satellite communications network.

The recent trials “are producing truly impressive results” said Panasonic Avionics VP of connectivity solutions Jeff Sare in an interview with Runway Girl Network.

Being able to support a satcom-based streaming class of Internet service for passengers requires high-throughput connectivity hardware and ample satellite capacity. In recent years Panasonic Avionics grappled with a choke point in its network – that of a legacy modem which could not take full advantage of the spot beams on high throughput satellites (HTS).

Migration to the Gen-3 network has involved installing a new Newtec modem on aircraft fitted with Panasonic’s eXConnect-branded Ku IFC solution. Panasonic which counts Aer Lingus Emirates Etihad Airways American Airlines and United Airlines among its customers is set to complete the upgrade of the 2544 aircraft installed with its Ku connectivity service to Gen-3 within the next month.

Sare explained the upgrade process to RGN: “It wasn’t a difficult upgrade from a technical perspective it was effectively changing a server and a software load on an airplane. The bigger part was the upgrade of all of our teleports and making sure the infrastructure was there to support all our airplanes.

“We pushed forward and with a minor exception for one customer on a dedicated piece of the older network that was isolated already. [Outside of that] we have shut down the Gen-1 network and everyone is working on our Gen-3 network. It’s all good news. It has provided us with tremendous efficiency gains and probably more important tremendous reliability gains so we’re feeling very good about our network right now hence some of those streaming trials I referred to.”

Panasonic’s Gen-3 network supports faster Internet as well as improved video streaming VoIP applications 4G phone services and greater bandwidth for crew applications. Live TV picture quality and broader channel choice are also supported by the network.

Panasonic’s IPTV service which features Sport 24 and Sport 24 Extra channels – and is showcasing the Super Bowl today – was part of the airline trials. Sare said data from the tests will be shared with the market in the coming months.

Panasonic also reported last week that it is now availing of capacity on the “extreme throughput” APSTAR-6D satellite from APT Mobile Satcom (APSATCOM).

The satellite which Panasonic helped to design has entered service over the Asia-Pacific region including covering “a big chunk” of the gap in Ku coverage over the Pacific.

“It better manages the peaks it better manages the valleys” said Sare of the satellite.

Panasonic also has Ku HTS partnerships in place with Intelsat SES Eutelsat and others. Sare said it is now viable for Panasonic to “put a full streaming service out not only in terms of capacity and capabilities but also in terms of cost”.

Talbot Special to The Journal

The September trip to South Korea was supposed to be a goodwill mission sponsored by the Defense Department. At the time Reginald Centracchio was adjutant general of the Rhode Island National Guard and it was his honor to escort 42 veterans of the Korean War back to the place where they had served.

“It was somewhat overcast” he remembers. A storm was brewing to the south that day as General Centracchio was standing on the edge of the demilitarized zone with some staff members and the group of Rhode Island veterans.

“We had been invited by South Korea to experience a ceremony which they did to recognize the end of what they call the Battles of the Outposts” the final bloody two years of the Korean War when half of America’s casualties occurred.

The event was being held to recognize the contributions that these Rhode Island veterans had made a half-century earlier.

While the group was gathered the security force that had accompanied them shared “there was the possibility of some unrest or some kind of terrorism but they didn’t say where” Centracchio remembers. “There was a lot of chatter going on” but he doesn’t remember feeling alarmed as they boarded their Korean Air flight for the trip home.

“We were scheduled to land at JFK Airport around 9 a.m.” on Tuesday he remembers. Typhoon Danas was bearing down on Japan as their plane lifted off so “we were taken off-course a little bit” but it was smooth sailing back to the United States.

As soon as the group hit California however Centracchio remembers “We were told we were going to be put down.”

They landed in Minnesota amid confusion. The FAA had ordered a national ground stop the first time that it had been implemented since the dawn of aviation. All aircraft including those operated by military and law enforcement were grounded.

“We were on a Korean airline so no one was speaking to us — at least in English” Centracchio recalls. “They weren’t sharing anything with us so I insisted on speaking to the pilot. … He really didn’t know much at that juncture either.”

Using the only technology available to them at the time Centracchio and his assistants picked up their cell phones and reached out to their office in Rhode Island. It was then they were told that terrorists had overtaken the crew of American Airlines Flight 11 and flown it into the North Tower of the Word Trade Center.

“Finally I insisted that myself and the couple of aides that I had with me would depart the plane” Centracchio said.

The pilot relented but nobody else was given permission to leave for security reasons.

Members of the Minnesota National Guard picked the group of four up at the airport and brought them to their headquarters. They were shown the horrifying images of both planes hitting the World Trade Center the wreck in Shanksville Pennsylvania and the unimaginable devastation wrought upon the Pentagon.

Centracchio knew he needed to get back to Rhode Island quickly.

“At the same time that I served as the adjutant general commanding general I was also the director of Rhode Island Emergency Management” he explains. “I was wearing several hats.”

While he knew that the state was in the capable hands of the assistant adjutant general James Reed “I felt anxious to get back home to learn exactly what we had to do.”

Centracchio suggested commandeering one of the Rhode Island National Guard aircraft to come pick him up but quickly learned that even military flights had been grounded. So the crew of four from the Rhode Island National Guard borrowed a military vehicle from their counterparts in Minneapolis and began the long drive back to Rhode Island.

“It took us about 50-some hours to do that” he recalls. While the drive back to the Ocean State was a long and anxious one there’s one scene imbedded in his memory. “I can remember vividly driving just north of New York and still seeing the plumes of smoke from the Twin Towers.”

Sept. 11 2001 changed many people’s lives including those of the men and women who served in the National Guard.

“The [National] Guard is the only armed force in the world that has a duality to it"" says Centraccio. ""One is the federal mission for the President of the United States and the ability to fight a war and the second is to ensure that you have adequate support for the governor.”

As a result of the ensuing war on terrorism “We began to mobilize the National Guard to Iraq and Afghanistan and other places in the world. During my tenure the entire Rhode Island National Guard was mobilized at least once from 9/11 through 2005.”

Centracchio also took on more responsibilities after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. After President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security Gov. Lincoln Almond named Centracchio the first homeland security officer for the State of Rhode Island a job he assumed in addition to his leadership positions with the National Guard and Emergency Management. In the months that followed he met with President Bush and made many trips between here and Washington where he represented the state in meetings at the Pentagon.

Centracchio saw many men and women join the Armed Forces as a result of the events of Sept. 11. But now almost two decades have elapsed since the day that changed America.

Many of today’s recruits were born after Sept. 11 2001 — including Centracchio’ s own grandson Luke who will be enlisting when he graduates from high school this spring. Many people may have no memory or faded images of that horrible day. But seeing billowing smoke rising above lower Manhattan days after the Twin Towers had collapsed is something that affected a man with more than 40 years of military experience.

Retired Lt. Gen. Reginald Centracchio says the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was “an eerie thing that I’ll never ever forget.”

Sherri Gibson has been named the new economic recovery coordinator working with the Coshocton Port Authority. The position is being made possible through the Resilience Initiative for Southeastern and Eastern Ohio (RISE Ohio). The program is a $2.7 million two-year push led by the Voinovich School of Ohio University in partnership with the Buckeye Hills Regional Council and Ohio Mid-Eastern Governments Association (OMEGA) with funding coming from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Rise Ohio is focused on helping communities in an 18-county region make an economic transition to new industries and ensuring continued job creation as well as economic growth and diversification. The new funding will enable these communities to engage in opportunity zone planning along with assisting them with the impacts of coal-fired power plant closures. The American Electric Power plant in Conesville closed in May 2020.

OMEGA Executive Director Jeannette M. Wierzbicki said her organization is grateful for the EDA funding.

“Following the closure of the AEP Conesville coal fired power plant in Coshocton County hundreds of men and women found themselves without employment. The addition of an economic recovery coordinator will not only help these men and women but countless others across the county who have lost their jobs in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic” she said in a press release. “OMEGA will also be working with its communities to more fully develop opportunity zones in our region to facilitate recovery from the pandemic and to develop resiliency throughout the region.”

One of the goals of the program is to retain local students for the workforce. High school and college students will have the opportunity to work for local businesses during school breaks which will hopefully translate to permanent jobs once they finish school.

“Our desire is to have these students understand they can be connected in ways to see an absolute potential for career entry right after education” said Tiffany Swigert executive director of the Coshocton Port Authority.

Gibson was previously the business coordinator for Ohio Means Jobs of Coshocton County through Coshocton County Job and Family Services. She left the position in December and was replaced by Shanna Stanton.

“We are appreciative of EDA’s investment and commitment to Ohio’s Appalachian region which will allow JobsOhio and several regional partners to collaborate and diversify economic development in the coming years” said Gov. Mike DeWine in a press release.

RISE Ohio is supported by $300000 in match funding through the Voinovich School’s Appalachian New Economy Partnership (ANEP) state appropriation and $250000 from JobsOhio. ANEP is an investment made through the Ohio Department of Higher Education designated to the Voinovich School to fuel regional and state economic growth and social impact.

Instead of relying on job creation and tax base generated from historic dependence on coal mining coal fired power plants and coal supply chain industries in their communities RISE Ohio will enable local communities in Appalachian Ohio to examine market opportunities available to build community resilience.

Leveraging its expertise in venture capital angel investment and entrepreneurship the Voinovich School will support opportunity zone development and creation of investment-ready communities.

“Appalachian Ohio faces unique economic challenges and emerging opportunities that no one organization can fully address” Dr. Jason Jolley professor of rural economic development and RISE project lead said in the release. ""The RISE Ohio grant represents the best practice in organizational partnerships between a university and two economic development districts with financial support from ANEP state appropriations and JobsOhio to work across the region to support economic diversification and community resiliency.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evc2NpZW5jZS1oZWFsdGhfc29sYXItZW5lcmd5LXBvd2VyaW5nLW1vcmUtdXMtbG9jYWwtZ292ZXJubWVudC1idWlsZGluZ3MvNjIwMTU4NC5odG1s0gFwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NjaWVuY2UtaGVhbHRoX3NvbGFyLWVuZXJneS1wb3dlcmluZy1tb3JlLXVzLWxvY2FsLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtYnVpbGRpbmdzLzYyMDE1ODQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar Energy Powering More US Local Government Buildings,"While President Joe Biden has issued executive orders aimed at reducing America's carbon footprint efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions at the local level have been gaining strength for years even as the former Trump administration sought to reinvigorate the fossil fuel industry.



Those efforts include a growing number of local governments switching to solar energy to power office buildings and other structures. The initial costs of moving to solar including installing solar panels have decreased by 90% over the past decade often making renewable energy more affordable than using the electric grid which in many regions continues to be powered by burning coal.

""For the most part we've seen a dramatic growth in the solar sector despite the headwinds that were associated with a less-than-supportive Trump administration"" said Gregory Wetstone president and chief executive of the American Council on Renewable Energy.

""The absence of federal action on climate change"" during the past few years actually contributed to the growing trend explained Tatsatom Gonçalves an energy research analyst at the World Resources Institute who wrote an article last year about U.S. cities and counties embracing renewable energy.

The rollback on environmental protections ""prompted a lot of local governments to make a commitment to clean energy"" including solar Gonçalves told VOA.

""Municipalities and counties know that solar is the wave of the future"" said Warren Leon executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance. ""They also want to encourage their residents and businesses to install solar. By putting solar on their own buildings they are leading by example.""

That includes Maryland's most populous jurisdiction Montgomery County a Washington D.C. suburb that encompasses 19 municipalities and is home to more than 1 million people.

Christopher Brown chief of Montgomery County's Office of Energy and Sustainability said in the past five years solar panels have been installed atop libraries recreation centers and a fire station. In deploying the technology Brown said Montgomery County aims to set an example for other counties and cities about the benefits of solar programs.

That is also true in Peterborough New Hampshire according to the town's capital project manager Rodney Bartlett.

""Peterborough was one of the first communities in New Hampshire to pass a resolution to reduce our carbon footprint"" he said noting that the town's wastewater treatment plant is solar-powered saving $20000 in energy costs per year.

Like Montgomery County Peterborough has a power purchase agreement with a private company that paid for all the solar energy costs upfront including buying and installing solar modules. Bartlett calls it a win-win situation.

""We buy the power from the company at a rate that saves us money in the long run and it is less expensive than buying power from our local utility company"" he said.

Conversion to solar energy continues to gain steam. Fairfax County Virginia will begin putting solar panels on county-owned buildings this year.

""Our policy is to leave no rooftop behind"" said Kambiz Agazi director of the county's Office of Environmental and Energy Coordination.

Despite a flurry of local initiatives clean energy advocates hope the Biden administration will put the power of the federal government behind a national effort.

""We are at a key moment where municipalities are going to need some help in order to maintain momentum in terms of solar"" said Leon of the Clean Energy States Alliance who added that an extension of solar energy tax credits would keep the momentum going.

Here are seven ways to think about that.

1. Here is what happens in the ad that General Motors will air during the Super Bowl: Standing in a garage inspired half by the storage unit in True Detective and half by the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia conspiracy meme Will Ferrell announces that the United States has not adopted electric cars as quickly as Norway. He punches a globe. He fetches his friends Kenan Thompson and Awkwafina (he is on a first-name basis with both as celebrities always are); they set off for Norway. Along the way Ferrell describes GM’s new EV fleet. “GM’s Ultium battery is made for all types of vehicles so soon everyone can drive an EV” he says.

2. It is a normal Super Bowl ad: oversaturated slightly self-aware blandly patriotic. The setting a luxe subdivision is normal. The interactions are normal. (The pandemic appears not to exist.) And triumphantly the cars are normal. Ferrell is driving a silver luxury crossover which is as much the iconic family car of this decade as the station wagon was the iconic family car of the 1970s. Awkwafina and Thompson are driving GM’s new Hummer.

The only twist is that both cars—Ferrell’s Cadillac Lyriq and his friends’ Hummer EV—have electric motors. Gone are the humpty-dumpty lines of older GM electric vehicles such as the Chevy Bolt. Gone is the playboy sensuality of the Tesla Model 3. These are normal American cars being driven in a normal American Super Bowl ad. Since the modern era in American climate politics began in 1988 when the NASA climate scientist James Hansen informed a U.S. Senate committee that the long-hypothesized threat of global warming had begun to make itself felt 33 years of effort—from environmentalists scientists activists engineers bureaucrats politicians the whole societal caboodle—have gone into this moment of making electric cars seem normal.

3. The point of the ad isn’t Norway. Norway is the MacGuffin the foil for Will Ferrell’s hapless masculinity. The point of the ad is that America has lagged behind other rich countries in adopting an important piece of consumer technology which is (1) correct and (2) partially GM’s fault.

Like it is GM’s fault recently. Ferrell was an inspired choice because there’s a certain type of Will Ferrell character—the flabby guy misled by his vanities who eventually winds up in the right place partly because of others’ love—that mirrors GM’s past few years. Because GM has had a change of heart on EVs and it has had it since October.

4. Which is why it’s noteworthy that GM is running this ad—because GM has lately lagged behind its crosstown rival Ford. In 2017 Mary Barra GM’s CEO sat next to Donald Trump when he announced a rollback of climate-pollution rules. Ford’s executive chairman Bill Ford opposed that rollback the next year. When the Trump administration sought to strip California of its power to regulate vehicle pollution GM joined in the lawsuit. Ford and four foreign automakers took California’s side.

GM in fact continued to argue that California did not have the power to regulate vehicle pollution until November 23. Then it abruptly announced that after thinking about it—and perhaps after reviewing the election results—the company had decided that California did have that power all along. A pre-Thanksgiving miracle!

This final misery capped four years of defeats. The American public has never seemed to absorb how completely the car industry—and how much GM specifically—fumbled under Trump.

Read: An inside account of Trump’s fuel-economy debacle

In 2016 the industry celebrated Trump’s win: Finally here was a pro-business president that it could really work with! What it got instead was a parade of expensive inconveniences. The Obama administration had for instance put in rules meant to decrease the carbon pollution that cars emit from their tailpipes; automakers wanted those rules weakened; the Trump administration froze them entirely—a drastic change that had more costs than benefits. Trump harangued GM on Twitter without warning and threatened to impose new tariffs on its supply chains. And the White House declined last year to extend the federal tax credit for EVs a move that harmed Tesla and GM specifically while helping foreign automakers.

Federal support for these kinds of policies matters. EVs command 54 percent of the market share in Norway not because Norwegians love Tesla but because Norway has thrown a small fjord’s worth of incentives and mandates behind them. It is safe to say that had Trump won 81000 more votes across four states we would not be talking about this ad at all.

5. Ferrell really should have carpooled with Thompson and Awkwafina. They would have prevented more emissions that way. (And to be clear: EVs alone won’t eliminate carbon pollution from the transportation sector—we also need electric buses better trains and more public transit—but they’re much better than gas-powered cars.)

6. In the future Americans’ mass adoption of electric vehicles will seem inevitable. After all EVs cost less to run than gas-powered cars (because electricity is cheaper than gas); they require cheaper maintenance; they break less; they are quieter. For many types of drivers—daily commuters for instance or errands-around-towners—they are already preferable to gas-powered cars.

But their triumph was never written in stone. Last September California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered that by 2035 all new cars and light trucks sold in the state had to be emissions-free. That goal was “ambitious but feasible” pronounced one clean-energy analyst. And this was remember a goal of California a state that has always led the country in air-pollution control. Yet in late January GM announced that it wouldn’t have any gas-powered cars to sell by 2035—because that was its deadline for going all electric.

To repeat: 20 or 30 years from now Americans’ mass adoption of electric vehicles will seem like something that was always going to happen. I can tell you from where I’m sitting it’s never felt inevitable before. It feels inevitable now.

7. GM is still a profit-driven company so regulators should seize this moment. Now that the company has demonstrated such deep and sincere concern for America’s rate of EV adoption regulators should bind it—and every other automaker—to even more ambitious schemes.

Editor’s note: This story was originally published by Yale Climate Connections an initiative of the Yale Center for Environmental Communication.

Imagine a deployment of federal investments to curb US greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors including electricity transportation and agriculture with the goal of creating millions of jobs and an eye on correcting environmental injustices in the process.

It sounds just like what was outlined in the February 2019 House Green New Deal Resolution but also describes President Biden’s new Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. Although he disavowed the Green New Deal on the presidential campaign trail Biden’s latest climate executive order adheres closely to its framework.

Though smaller in scale given that executive orders only apply to federal agency actions rather than the nation as a whole this effort could reasonably be described as a mini-Green New Deal.

Targeting clean electricity and electric vehicles (EVs). To curb greenhouse gas emissions the climate crisis executive order targets the electricity and transportation sectors combined responsible for more than half of American carbon pollution. The order calls on federal agencies to use “all available procurement authorities to achieve or facilitate:

i) a carbon pollution-free electricity sector no later than 2035; and

(ii) clean and zero-emission vehicles for federal state local and tribal government fleets including vehicles of the United States Postal Service.”

The executive order applicable only to federal agencies and properties also notes “the plan shall recommend any additional legislation needed to accomplish these objectives.” The Environmental Protection Agency can use the order to justify regulating fossil fuel pollution but given the legal challenges to EPA’s previous power plant greenhouse gas regulation efforts under the Clean Power Plan first launched by the Obama/Biden administration in 2015 reaching the goal of zero emissions from the electricity sector by 2035 may require legislation from Congress. That’s a plausible but challenging prospect.

The directive for government fleets to transition to zero-emissions vehicles may be one of the most consequential components of President Biden’s climate executive orders. The transportation sector accounts for the largest chunk of US greenhouse gas emissions at 28 percent. Unlike the electricity sector where emissions have steadily declined over the past decade as coal is replaced by cheaper and cleaner alternatives transportation emissions remain stagnant at 2005 levels. Electric vehicles over time are expected to substantially reduce the transportation sector carbon footprint especially when fueled by a steadily cleaner electric grid. But for now EVs and plug-in hybrids account for just 2 percent of new US vehicle sales. The average lifespan of a passenger car is close to 12 years so turnover to cleaner alternatives will take time.

However the federal fleet includes nearly 650000 vehicles. There are currently 1.4 million EVs (including plug-in hybrids) in the United State so electrifying the federal fleet would increase that number by nearly 50 percent. The order did not stipulate a timeframe for the transition or whether federal vehicles will be replaced by EVs once they have reached the end of their lifespans or sooner. Regardless this federal procurement will create a stable boost in demand for the EV industry and will thus help reduce the costs of the vehicles and key components like batteries.

California Governor Gavin Newsom similarly signed an executive order in September 2020 which mandated that all new passenger cars and trucks sold in the state must be emission-free by 2035. (Large freight-carrying trucks are regulated by the California Air Resources Board.) Massachusetts’ Republican Governor Charlie Baker set the same 2035 target just over a month ago in his state’s Clean Energy and Climate Plan. The auto industry appears to have received the message: Two days after Biden signed his climate crisis executive order General Motors announced its intent to offer only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 and GM has begun hiring over a thousand workers at two US facilities to make batteries and EVs.

A focus on climate jobs. At the executive order signing ceremony on January 27 President Biden said “When I think of climate I think of jobs” and that mindset is evident in the orders. Biden took office with the US unemployment rate at 6.4 percent which is about halfway between the peak of the Great Recession in 2009 (10 percent) and the pre-COVID low of 3.5 percent a year ago. As the country slowly recovers from the coronavirus pandemic there are still nearly 11 million Americans looking for jobs. Tackling the climate crisis could provide ample employment opportunities.

For example the executive order calls for the establishment of a Civilian Climate Corps that will create jobs “to conserve and restore public lands and waters bolster community resilience increase reforestation increase carbon sequestration in the agricultural sector protect biodiversity improve access to recreation and address the changing climate.” It harkens back to the Civilian Conservation Corps created in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the original New Deal which employed 3 million young men over a nine-year period in jobs relating to the conservation and development of natural resources. Green New Deal proponents Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash pushed for the creation of a climate corps from their positions on Biden’s climate task force. Much of the detail on how the new effort will work remain to be determined over the next three months as cabinet-level positions fill in the blanks.

The order also aims to create jobs in clean technology sectors by stipulating that in making procurement decisions for EVs clean energy and energy efficiency federal agencies will follow Biden’s Made in America executive order which requires that such products be purchased from American businesses whenever possible.

Environmental justice and natural carbon sequestration. Also like the original incarnation of the Green New Deal Biden’s climate crisis executive order focuses heavily on environmental justice—directing funding towards communities of color and low-income Americans disproportionately harmed by fossil fuel pollution and revitalizing communities whose economies and jobs have historically relied on fossil fuels.

The order outlines the administration’s policy “to secure environmental justice and spur economic opportunity for disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment in housing transportation water and wastewater infrastructure and health care.” It also establishes the Justice40 Initiative to recommend how federal investments can be made in a way that directs 40 percent of benefits to disadvantaged communities.

The Green New Deal resolution never passed by the Senate and Biden’s climate crisis executive order both also call for efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in soil and forests by restoring natural ecosystems. In addition to the Civilian Climate Corps the order calls on the US Department of Agriculture to “encourage the voluntary adoption of climate-smart agricultural and forestry practices that decrease wildfire risk fueled by climate change and result in additional measurable and verifiable carbon reductions and sequestration and that source sustainable bioproducts and fuels.”

Climate advocacy groups and Green New Deal advocates like the Sunrise Movement are cheering President Biden’s executive orders and the prioritization of the climate crisis among a broad swath of his administration nominees. Most recognize and reluctantly accept that a full-blown Green New Deal may be out of reach given the divided Senate but federal agencies can make progress toward its goals by implementing President Biden’s executive orders while congressional Democrats continue to weigh what climate measures they can pass through the budget reconciliation process infrastructure bills and foreign aid."

When you've misplaced your favorite credit card what do you do? Everyone who uses credit cards has likely had this happen at least once. You could retrace your steps with the hope of finding the missing card at the last restaurant you ate at or perhaps in the pocket of the pants you wore yesterday.

The safe bet though is to contact the card issuer and report it missing. However this will permanently invalidate the lost card and you'll have to wait until you receive a replacement. This can be troublesome especially if you have high hopes that the card will turn up in a few days.

Fortunately though there is a better option. Many major credit card issuers allow you to temporarily disable a particular card and reactivate it later. As you'll see it has lots of potential uses even beyond a misplaced card.

Major card issuers that offer a pause button

Here's a look at which issuers offer this option.

American Express Freeze Your Card

American Express's Free Your Card option prevents your card from being used for new purchases but allows payment of recurring bills on the account. You can also continue to use for digital wallet transactions like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. However your card will automatically be unfrozen in seven days. Both primary and authorized card holders can use this feature. Amex also makes it extremely easy to freeze and unfreeze your card right in the Amex app.

Bank of America Lock/Unlock

Although Bank of America makes it incredibly easy to lock and unlock your card this feature is only available to Bank of America debit card holders.

Barclays SecurHold™

Barclays allows you to instantly lock and unlock your card from its mobile app. And to go one step further they offer a Control Your Card feature which allows you to set transaction limits and even block certain purchases for yourself or authorized users. This is a great feature since Barclays is one of the few card issuers that gives authorized users unique card numbers. The Barclays app can also notify you of each transaction in real time which can be great for monitoring spending and catching fraudulent purchases as soon as they happen.

Capital One Card Lock

Capital One's Card Lock feature allows you to easily lock and unlock your card straight from the mobile app. It blocks all in-store online in-app and phone purchases for cards. However you can continue to return items make payments and redeem rewards while your card is locked.

Chase Lock and Unlock

This feature allows Chase card holders to lock and unlock their credit card from the Chase Mobile app or on their computer. Locking the card doesn't affect automatic payments so there are no disruptions to recurring charges. You also can still use your digit wallet to make purchases. However when you lock your card it will lock any other cards that share the same account number.

Citi Quick Lock

Citi allows card holders to lock and unlock their credit card online or from its mobile app. Even when your card is locked recurring transactions will still hit your credit card without any disruption.

Discover Freeze it®

Discover was one of the first card issuers to offer a card freeze feature which can be activated online or through its mobile app. Even though Discover will not authorize new purchases cash advances or balance transfers while your account is on hold recurring payments returns dispute adjustments and delayed authorized will still post to your account.

US Bank Lock and Unlock

A relatively new feature to US Bank is that they now offer the capability to lock and unlock your card. The easiest way to do this with US Bank is from their mobile app.

Wells Fargo Control Tower

Wells Fargo Control Tower allows you to turn your cards on and off as well as restrict international use. It will also allow you to view digital wallets and turn digital card numbers stored in your devices on or off. Recurring payments may still be approved or processed even if you turn your card off.

When to use your credit card's pause button

Aside from misplacing your credit card there are many other situations where a pause button can come in handy.

To control spending: Credit cards are so convenient to use that some people overspend. By pressing pause on your credit card it could help you control any impulse purchases. This extra step might also make you think twice on whether or not you actually need to make that particular purchase.

Put your cards in safe mode: If you have cards that you don't use often or you only use for recurring monthly payments then you might want to pause them to prevent unauthorized use. This is an extra measure of security for those cards especially if you don't look at these accounts often enough to pick up on fraudulent charges.

Controlling the use of authorized card holders: Pressing pause can be a good way to prevent an authorized card holder from using his or her card. Just keep in mind that not all card issuers will freeze authorized cards holders when you freeze the primary card members' account.

Bottom line

It's great that most major card issuers now offer the option of temporarily pausing your credit card. Best of all this feature is completely free and typically there is no limit on the number of times you lock or unlock your account.

Of course if it becomes apparent that your card is never to be found again you'll want to call the card issuer to let them know. They'll then send you a new card but unfortunately it will come with a different card number.

Is Delta Air Lines Trolling Us?

It is one thing to raise prices during a time of inflation. It is quite another to raise prices during a deflationary period as we currently find ourselves in especially when partners are going in the opposite direction.

Earlier this week we booked a round-trip journey from Los Angeles to Rome via Amsterdam on KLM for 103000 Air France/KLM Flying Blue miles. Taxes/fees were just under $500.

Were I to book the same flights on the same dates via Delta the price would have been 240000 miles and about $125 in taxes/fees.

Do you think we made the right choice?

United raised prices too (and I condemned it) but Delta continues to raise prices on partner awards to levels that are so far out of the norm that you have to wonder if they are just trolling us. By that I mean Delta does this to intentionally upset its customers.

Back in the day Karen Zachary the Managing Director of SkyMiles seemed to gloat at raising prices. That’s the vibe I feel with these sort of devaluations.

Delta says:

Delta regularly evaluates Award Pricing which can result in the increase or decrease of the mileage amount you need to purchase an Award Ticket.

Certainly Delta wants to discourage these sorts of redemptions in favor of absurd redemptions on Delta’s own metal but the latest string of price increases feeling like mocking all those who have saved miles in hopes of aspirational travel.

Prices for partner awards keep rising and I simply do not see value in collecting SkyMiles any more when you can collect points in a flexible currency instead.

I’ve long warned that miles and points are depreciating assets meant to be spent not hoarded. Nothing changes in terms of that general advice. But there’s an implied contract of good faith and fair dealing here…if I entice you to collect miles and save up for an award it’s manifestly unreasonable to massively inflate the price without notice.

But that’s simply what Delta does. Over and over again. Delta has raised prices without warning for years.

Your Response

Here’s what I’d do if I were you: rip up your Delta American Express cards. Call up American Express to complain and cancel them. Use a flexible card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or American Express Gold instead.

Delta only does this because it can get away with it. But I can tell you the values are simply not there. There once was value in paying 85K and $5.60 in taxes for a last-minute New York to London ticket when Virgin Atlantic was charging 45K miles but $600 in taxes/fees for the same ticket.

Not anymore. If you think 195K miles and $24.50 is a better deal than 45K miles and $600 please just switch to a cash-back card.

CONCLUSION

While I understand Delta does what it can get away with I think it shows deliberate disdain for members when prices accelerate without notice in an era of empty flights. In fact I think it rises to trolling. It’s as if Delta is daring us to book away. We should do so…

Does Delta’s conduct concerning partner award pricing constitute trolling?

But she said that hasn't been the case: ""Restaurants more than ever are a place where people feel relatively comfortable.""

Indeed in cities around the country restaurants have adapted for colder conditions and diners are proving game even in northern latitudes. On a recent weekday in Portland Maine where the high was 28 degrees the eatery Little Giant turned its back patio into an outdoor dining deck with 35000 watts of electric heat. In Seattle the seafood spot Westward has installed two fire pits to keep patrons cozy. Scarpetta in New York built private dining ""chalets."" It's a testament to local food cultures and the universal human need for social connection that people are willing to eat outside in the depths of winter.

But between the not-freezing part and the not-getting-covid-19 part if you decide to visit a restaurant eating out has become something you need to plan for: whose outdoor setup promises warmth what to wear to battle the elements what to order that won't get cold as soon as it hits the table (or maybe will still taste good even if it is cold). Getting a table used to be the main concern. Now you have to think about wind chill and the chance of snow.

How are diners and restaurateurs making it work? Here are the new rules for eating outside.

KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FACING

The pandemic diner will quickly discover that every restaurant offers its own version of the outdoor experience. Heated custom-designed tents called Yurt Villages a collaboration between American Express and dining app Resy have been set up at 13 in-demand restaurants across the country including Zahav in Philadelphia and Arlo Grey in Austin Texas. Many more eateries have erected cheap rustic structures made of wood or plastic which Sugar of Grubstreet has codified by architectural style from Upmarket Shanty to Cold-Weather Cabana.

You'll want to do some research to know exactly what the setup will be: Are there heaters at every table? Blankets on loan? How windy and exposed is the location?

""I generally won't go to a restaurant without having seen their outdoor situation beforehand"" said William Li a founder of the Hao Life a wellness brand who on a recent week ate out in New York nearly every night. ""A lot of them are just tables outside without any heating whatsoever. Even if you're dressed appropriately it's not comfortable.""

Jessica Siskin a food artist behind the popular Instagram account Misterkrisp follows the same rule but for different reasons. Siskin won't eat inside plastic enclosures or structures that approximate indoor settings. ""I don't think of plastic as a ventilated material"" she said.

Siskin does a scouting mission she said for her sake and the restaurant's: ""The last thing I want is to get to a restaurant feel uncomfortable and leave. That's a reservation that could have gone to someone else.""

Which brings up another point about planning: Make a reservation where you can. Many restaurants are operating with far fewer tables than normal and on weekends (at brunch especially when it's relatively warmer) those tables fill up fast.

BUNDLE UP

Jeremy Levitt a founder of Parts and Labor Design a hospitality design firm has a piece of advice about dress. ""Go as if you're having a hot toddy outside in front of a bonfire that doesn't exist"" he said.

Levitt who lives in Manhattan has learned the hard way that his feet become blocks of ice when he sits outside for an hour or more. He has taken to wearing warm shoes with a few layers of socks and he and his wife and children also make sure to take blankets.

With their beanies winter jackets and gloves outdoor diners have the look of winter athletes. Erika Chou a Manhattan restaurateur who operates the spots Kimika and Wayla has seen people come in ""with a full snowboarding outfit like [cold-weather-gear maker] Burton head to toe"" she said.

Li swears by fleece-lined Heattech pants from Uniqlo and thick wool socks from L.L. Bean. Siskin has ""a couple of tricks I picked up"" she said including layering long underwear beneath her jeans and a thin Patagonia liner under her coat.

On a recent night ""I went out to dinner and wore those air-activated foot warmers that you buy for skiing"" she said. ""I also got this hand warmer that's been a game-changer"" a rechargeable model by Ocoopa.

Restaurant owners are helping their customers stay warm too. At the Odeon in New York's Tribeca neighborhood there are the ubiquitous infrared heat lamps along with microfiber blankets to rent for $7 or buy for $20. The restaurant also has Mylar blankets like the ones given to marathon runners for customers to use for free. Many other restaurants are providing blankets too which they wash or dry-clean after each use.

ORDER THE SOUP

Even the best dishes don't taste as good cold so it's worth considering how a restaurant has adapted.

Back in the fall Cedric Vongerichten the chef and owner of Wayan which serves Indonesian food with a French flair found that dishes like lobster noodles were getting cold in minutes. Inspired by his childhood in France Vongerichten introduced a burner device like the ones for cheese fondue which plugs into an electrical outlet at select tables a concept he calls Indo-Chalet.

In addition Wayan's kitchen staff now plates hot dishes in cast-iron pans which Vongerichten said would retain heat throughout a meal. Off the menu? Es Teler a shaved ice dessert. And while the restaurant still offers ice cream servers are suggesting hot desserts such as a cookie baked in a cast-iron pan.

When ordering it helps to think about your courses to minimize having dishes sit on the table for too long or to focus on warming items.

At Heights Cafe in Brooklyn Heights a popular brunch spot even on frigid days soups and hot toddies have become popular orders. The Odeon has been selling a lot of French onion soup and cassoulet said the owner Lynn Wagenknecht.

It makes sense to adapt your appetite to the weather as well. Shanise Djuhari a dental resident who lives in Brooklyn recently ate outside on a very cold windy and rainy day. ""I typically don't go for stews"" she said. ""But that day we had a couple of stews on the table. It seemed weather-appropriate.""

Even if a restaurant's menu pays no deference to the cold there are simple ways to warm up. ""I always order hot water"" said Chou the restaurateur. ""I think that helps. It's good for your digestive system as well.""

TIME AND

TEMPERATURE CHECK

With daylight hours limited lunch is the new dinner and dinner begins at an hour more common to retirement communities.

At Kimika Chou now starts dinner service at 4 p.m. ""It's lighter out so maybe slightly warmer"" she said. ""I'm sure people are trying to eat at earlier times when there's less crowding.""

Wagenknecht said 4 to 8 is her busiest time on weekends. And anyway a lingering late-night meal is virtually impossible: In New York state restaurants must close by 10. Massachusetts also enacted a 10 p.m. curfew while other states and cities (like Chicago which requires restaurants to close one hour later) have similar rules. The compressed dinner service could mean that your restaurant will no longer hold a table if one or more guests arrives late so maybe ditch your friends who are always texting that they're five minutes away.

""We have such a small window of service if everyone's late we lose half a turn"" Wagenknecht said.

In addition to being conscious of time check the weather during your planned dining hour.

Even worse than the cold rain or snow is the wind. It rattles under canopy roofs renders the portable heaters useless and frays the servers' nerves. On blustery days it's better to stay home.

EMBRACE IT

For Levitt who dines outside frequently the cold is ""part of the fun"" he said. ""I'm going out to dinner and I'm going to be sitting outside for an hour. People need to embrace that.""

Li expressed a similar sentiment. He said he has adopted a Scandinavian approach to dining out: There's no such thing as bad weather only bad clothing.

Wagenknecht perhaps sums it up best with advice for eating outside if not for life itself: ""If you don't approach it with a spirit of fun and adventure you're probably going to be miserable.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9jaGFzZS1zYXBwaGlyZS1yZXNlcnZlLWFkZHMtdXMxMDAtc3RhdGVtZW50LWNyZWRpdC10b3dhcmRzLWV4aXN0aW5nLWFjY291bnRzLXdpdGgtdXBjb21pbmctcmVuZXdhbC1kYXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chase Sapphire Reserve Adds US$100 Statement Credit Towards Existing Accounts With Upcoming Renewal Dates,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2021/02/07/chase-sapphire-reserve-adds-us100-statement-credit-towards-existing-accounts-with-upcoming-renewal-dates/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9jaGFzZS1zYXBwaGlyZS1yZXNlcnZlLWFkZHMtdXMxMDAtc3RhdGVtZW50LWNyZWRpdC10b3dhcmRzLWV4aXN0aW5nLWFjY291bnRzLXdpdGgtdXBjb21pbmctcmVuZXdhbC1kYXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

As states around the world pile on debt to combat the coronavirus pandemic and bolster flagging economies fears of such possible seizures have only amplified.

Seen this way China’s internationalization—as laid out in programs such as the Belt and Road Initiative—is not simply a pursuit of geopolitical influence but also in some tellings a weapon. Once a country is weighed down by Chinese loans like a hapless gambler who borrows from the Mafia it is Beijing’s puppet and in danger of losing a limb.

The prime example of this is the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota. As the story goes Beijing pushed Sri Lanka into borrowing money from Chinese banks to pay for the project which had no prospect of commercial success. Onerous terms and feeble revenues eventually pushed Sri Lanka into default at which point Beijing demanded the port as collateral forcing the Sri Lankan government to surrender control to a Chinese firm.

The Trump administration pointed to Hambantota to warn of China’s strategic use of debt: In 2018 former Vice President Mike Pence called it “debt-trap diplomacy”—a phrase he used through the last days of the administration—and evidence of China’s military ambitions. Last year erstwhile Attorney General William Barr raised the case to argue that Beijing is “loading poor countries up with debt refusing to renegotiate terms and then taking control of the infrastructure itself.”

As Michael Ondaatje one of Sri Lanka’s greatest chroniclers once said “In Sri Lanka a well-told lie is worth a thousand facts.” And the debt-trap narrative is just that: a lie and a powerful one.

Read: What happens when China leads the world

Our research shows that Chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country much less the port of Hambantota. A Chinese company’s acquisition of a majority stake in the port was a cautionary tale but it’s not the one we’ve often heard. With a new administration in Washington the truth about the widely perhaps willfully misunderstood case of Hambantota Port is long overdue.

The city of Hambantota lies at the southern tip of Sri Lanka a few nautical miles from the busy Indian Ocean shipping lane that accounts for nearly all of the ocean-borne trade between Asia and Europe and more than 80 percent of ocean-borne global trade. When a Chinese firm snagged the contract to build the city’s port it was stepping into an ongoing Western competition though one the United States had largely abandoned.

It was the Canadian International Development Agency—not China—that financed Canada’s leading engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin to carry out a feasibility study for the port. We obtained more than 1000 pages of documents detailing this effort through a Freedom of Information Act request. The study concluded in 2003 confirmed that building the port at Hambantota was feasible and supporting documents show that the Canadians’ greatest fear was losing the project to European competitors. SNC-Lavalin recommended that it be undertaken through a joint-venture agreement between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and a “private consortium” on a build-own-operate-transfer basis a type of project in which a single company receives a contract to undertake all the steps required to get such a port up and running and then gets to operate it when it is.

The Canadian project failed to move forward mostly because of the vicissitudes of Sri Lankan politics. But the plan to build a port in Hambantota gained traction during the rule of the Rajapaksas—Mahinda Rajapaksa who served as president from 2005 through 2015 and his brother Gotabaya the current president and former minister of defense—who grew up in Hambantota. They promised to bring big ships to the region a call that gained urgency after the devastating 2004 tsunami pulverized Sri Lanka’s coast and the local economy.

We reviewed a second feasibility report produced in 2006 by the Danish engineering firm Ramboll that made similar recommendations to the plans put forward by SNC-Lavalin arguing that an initial phase of the project should allow for the transport of non-containerized cargo—oil cars grain—to start bringing in revenue before expanding the port to be able to handle the traffic and storage of traditional containers. By then the port in the capital city of Colombo a hundred miles away and consistently one of the world’s busiest had just expanded and was already pushing capacity. The Colombo port however was smack in the middle of the city while Hambantota had a hinterland meaning it offered greater potential for expansion and development.

To look at a map of the Indian Ocean region at the time was to see opportunity and expanding middle classes everywhere. Families in India and across Africa were demanding more consumer goods from China. Countries such as Vietnam were growing rapidly and would need more natural resources. To justify its existence the port in Hambantota would have to secure only a fraction of the cargo that went through Singapore the world’s busiest transshipment port.

Armed with the Ramboll report Sri Lanka’s government approached the United States and India; both countries said no. But a Chinese construction firm China Harbor Group had learned about Colombo’s hopes and lobbied hard for the project. China Eximbank agreed to fund it and China Harbor won the contract.

This was in 2007 six years before Xi Jinping introduced the Belt and Road Initiative. Sri Lanka was still in the last and bloodiest phase of its long civil war and the world was on the verge of a financial crisis. The details are important: China Eximbank offered a $307 million 15-year commercial loan with a four-year grace period offering Sri Lanka a choice between a 6.3 percent fixed interest rate or one that would rise or fall depending on LIBOR a floating rate. Colombo chose the former conscious that global interest rates were trending higher during the negotiations and hoping to lock in what it thought would be favorable terms. Phase I of the port project was completed on schedule within three years.

For a conflict-torn country that struggled to generate tax revenue the terms of the loan seemed reasonable. As Saliya Wickramasuriya the former chairman of the SLPA told us “To get commercial loans as large as $300 million during the war was not easy.” That same year Sri Lanka also issued its first international bond with an interest rate of 8.25 percent. Both decisions would come back to haunt the government.

Finally in 2009 after decades of violence Sri Lanka’s civil war came to an end. Buoyed by the victory the government embarked on a debt-financed push to build and improve the country’s infrastructure. Annual economic growth rates climbed to 6 percent but Sri Lanka’s debt burden soared as well.

In Hambantota instead of waiting for phase 1 of the port to generate revenue as the Ramboll team had recommended Mahinda Rajapaksa pushed ahead with phase 2 transforming Hambantota into a container port. In 2012 Sri Lanka borrowed another $757 million from China Eximbank this time at a reduced post-financial-crisis interest rate of 2 percent. Rajapaksa took the liberty of naming the port after himself.

By 2014 Hambantota was losing money. Realizing that they needed more experienced operators the SLPA signed an agreement with China Harbor and China Merchants Group to have them jointly develop and operate the new port for 35 years. China Merchants was already operating a new terminal in the port in Colombo and China Harbor had invested $1.4 billion in Colombo Port City a lucrative real-estate project involving land reclamation. But while the lawyers drew up the contracts a political upheaval was taking shape.

Rajapaksa called a surprise election for January 2015 and in the final months of the campaign his own health minister Maithripala Sirisena decided to challenge him. Like opposition candidates in Malaysia the Maldives and Zambia the incumbent’s financial relations with China and allegations of corruption made for potent campaign fodder. To the country’s shock and perhaps his own Sirisena won.

Steep payments on international sovereign bonds which comprised nearly 40 percent of the country’s external debt put Sirisena’s government in dire fiscal straits almost immediately. When Sirisena took office Sri Lanka owed more to Japan the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank than to China. Of the $4.5 billion in debt service Sri Lanka would pay in 2017 only 5 percent was because of Hambantota. The Central Bank governors under both Rajapaksa and Sirisena do not agree on much but they both told us that Hambantota and Chinese finance in general was not the source of the country’s financial distress.

There was also never a default. Colombo arranged a bailout from the International Monetary Fund and decided to raise much-needed dollars by leasing out the underperforming Hambantota Port to an experienced company—just as the Canadians had recommended. There was not an open tender and the only two bids came from China Merchants and China Harbor; Sri Lanka chose China Merchants making it the majority shareholder with a 99-year lease and used the $1.12 billion cash infusion to bolster its foreign reserves not to pay off China Eximbank.

Read: How Xi Jinping blew it

Before the port episode “Sri Lanka could sink into the Indian Ocean and most of the Western world wouldn’t notice” Subhashini Abeysinghe research director at Verité Research an independent Colombo-based think tank told us. Suddenly the island nation featured prominently in foreign-policy speeches in Washington. Pence voiced worry that Hambantota could become a “forward military base” for China.

Yet Hambantota’s location is strategic only from a business perspective: The port is cut into the coast to avoid the Indian Ocean’s heavy swells and its narrow channel allows only one ship to enter or exit at a time typically with the aid of a tugboat. In the event of a military conflict naval vessels stationed there would be proverbial fish in a barrel.

The notion of “debt-trap diplomacy” casts China as a conniving creditor and countries such as Sri Lanka as its credulous victims. On a closer look however the situation is far more complex. China’s march outward like its domestic development is probing and experimental a learning process marked by frequent adjustment. After the construction of the port in Hambantota for example Chinese firms and banks learned that strongmen fall and that they’d better have strategies for dealing with political risk. They’re now developing these strategies getting better at discerning business opportunities and withdrawing where they know they can’t win. Still American leaders and thinkers from both sides of the aisle give speeches about China’s “modern-day colonialism.”

Over the past 20 years Chinese firms have learned a lot about how to play in an international construction business that remains dominated by Europe: Whereas China has 27 firms among the top 100 global contractors up from nine in 2000 Europe has 37 down from 41. The U.S. has seven compared to 19 two decades ago.

Chinese firms are not the only companies to benefit from Chinese-financed projects. Perhaps no country was more alarmed by Hambantota than India the regional giant that several times rebuffed Sri Lanka’s appeals for investment aid and equity partnerships. Yet an Indian-led business Meghraj joined the U.K.-based engineering firm Atkins Limited in an international consortium to write the long-term plan for Hambantota Port and for the development of a new business zone. The French firms Bolloré and CMA-CGM have partnered with China Merchants and China Harbor in port developments in Nigeria Cameroon and elsewhere.

The other side of the debt-trap myth involves debtor countries. Places such as Sri Lanka—or for that matter Kenya Zambia or Malaysia—are no stranger to geopolitical games. And they’re irked by American views that they’ve been so easily swindled. As one Malaysian politician remarked to us speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss how Chinese finance featured in that country’s political drama “Can’t the U.S. State Department tell the difference between campaign rhetoric that our opponents are slaves to China and actually being slaves to China?”

The events that led to a Chinese company’s acquisition of a majority stake in a Sri Lankan port reveal a great deal about how our world is changing. China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another. And it would be a shame if the U.S. fails to learn alongside them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMTIvMDgvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9maXJlZXllLWhhY2tlZC1ydXNzaWFucy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FireEye a Top Cybersecurity Firm Says It Was Hacked by a Nation-State (Published 2020),"WASHINGTON — For years the cybersecurity firm FireEye has been the first call for government agencies and companies around the world who have been hacked by the most sophisticated attackers or fear they might be.

FireEye revealed on Tuesday that its own systems were pierced by what it called “a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities.” The company said hackers used “novel techniques” to make off with its own tool kit which could be useful in mounting new attacks around the world.

But some of the hugely wealthy residents who have since moved into the 1396ft structure have reportedly found that living in the western hemisphere’s “tallest residential tower” had unsettling drawbacks – potentially attributable to its great height.

According to the New York Times some of 432 Park’s residents are sparring with its developers over issues such as “millions of dollars of water damage from plumbing and mechanical issues; frequent elevator malfunctions; and walls that creak like the galley of a ship”. This building which opponents had compared to a “middle finger” to the rest of the city due to its controversial height seemed to now be giving some of its own residents the same cheeky gesture.

“I was convinced it would be the best building in New York” Sarina Abramovich an early 432 Park resident complained to the newspaper. “They’re still billing it as God’s gift to the world and it’s not.”

Abramovich and her husband described as “retired business owners” in the oil and gas industry bought a 3500-sq-ft apartment there for almost $17m in 2016 as a “secondary home” close to their adult children. When Abramovich was poised to move in she said neither the building nor apartment were finished.

“They put me in a freight elevator surrounded by steel plates and plywood with a hard-hat operator” she reportedly remarked of 432 Park the design of which was inspired by a designer trash can. “That’s how I went up to my hoity-toity apartment before closing.” The problems worsened and included “a number of floods”. In one instance water rushed into Abramovich’s apartment from several floors above allegedly resulting in some $500000 in damage.

There’s also “wind sway”. A 1000ft building may sway several inches on a day with normal winds. On days with 50mph wind such a tower may move approximately six inches. In the rare event of 100mph gusts this height structure could move up to two feet the New York Times reported.

New York City’s Empire State Building with a roof height of 1250ft is supposed to move approximately one inch in rapid winds per Discovery. Chicago’s Willis Tower with a roof height of 1450ft has an average sway of six inches from its “true center” but is designed to move a maximum of three feet.

However wind sway is especially pronounced in supertall buildings that are also super-skinny – they are often referred to as pencil towers. For 432 Park the height-to-width ratio is reportedly 15:1. The property website Curbed New York explained that “to put that in perspective if you place a standard ruler on its end it has a ratio of 12:1.” Another way: the Empire State Building is 424ft across whereas 432 Park stretches slightly more than 90ft across.

In a statement Lendlease the construction manager said: “As a leading builder in the industry Lendlease is always committed to delivering its projects safely and in accordance with the highest specified standards. We have been in contact with our client regarding some comments from tenants which we are currently evaluating. We cannot elaborate at this time since we are in the midst of this review.”

One of 432 Park’s developers CIM Group said in a statement to the Times that it’s “a successfully designed constructed and virtually sold-out project … Like all new construction there were maintenance and close-out items during that period.”

Complaints about perils of living in a luxurious supertall building on a stretch of similarly luxurious supertall buildings known as “Billionaire’s Row” feels like the apex of rich people problems. Given the deadly pandemic and ongoing economic devastation in the rest of New York reaction to the Times article has included gleeful schadenfreude and sombre told-you-sos by many citizens.

“Condos at 432 Park are like GameStop shares for billionaires” Daniel Bergstresser finance professor at the Brandeis International Business School wrote on Twitter.

Twitter user @eddiemajor commented: “432 Park Avenue is the most obnoxious building in all of Manhattan and this story warmed my heart.”

One reader commented on the Times’ website: “I was about to complain that the Times never published any feel good stories and then y’all come through with this little gem. Thanks for making my morning!”

Abramovich herself admitted to the Times that the woes of billionaires wouldn’t spur significant sympathy but came forward as a matter of principle commenting: “Everything here was camouflage … If I knew then what I know now I would have never bought.”

Others see a more serious side to the story.

“We’ve been following the safety concerns of supertalls for a long time” Sean Khorsandi executive director of the preservation group Landmark West! told the Guardian. “I was in architecture school on 9/11. We watched the towers fall. There were all sorts of symposiums and public statements that we’re never going to build [that] tall again” he said. “All we’ve done in the 20 years since is build even taller.”

Architect Stephen B Jacobs president and founder of Stephen B Jacobs Group PC has worked on a wide variety of projects since starting his firm in 1967 – ranging from historic preservation to large-scale residential design. Some have exceeded 50 storeys and his firm is presently working on a slender 800ft building on Manhattan’s East Side that has spurred its own controversies over height.

Although Jacobs is no stranger to height he said of supertalls: “They’re totally irrational.”

Jacobs who believes that these buildings were conceived to create the experience of “living up in the sky for the richest” of the one-percenters said: “I’m not really that interested in serving that market. I think the challenges that we have that we should be focusing on is how we provide housing for the vast majority of people that really need it.

“The whole purpose here is to be the tallest” Jacobs continued. “I don’t necessarily want to put a Freudian spin on that – but people have.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9nYWxlcmllLXBoaWxpYS13YWxrZXItdG93ZXItZnVybml0dXJlLWV4aGliaXRpb24tdXNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Galerie Philia presents design exhibition in New York's Walker Tower,"Studio Noon's chubby pink concrete chair and an alabaster infinity chandelier star in Galerie Philia's exhibition of furniture design set in an apartment inside New York City's art deco Walker Tower.

Completed in the Chelsea neighbourhood in 1929 by American architect Ralph Walker the Walker Tower was restored and converted into apartments in 2013.

Named Galerie Philia at Walker Tower the show is co-curated by architect and designer Pietro Franceschini and the anonymous founder of furniture gallery Galerie Philia.

The exhibition showcases over 70 works by 40 international designers.

Presented works include Infinity 12 an alabaster chandelier resembling a tunnel of smoke by Alain Ellouz and a stool which is also a side table handcrafted from subvolcanic rock by Georgian design duo Rooms as part of their Life on Earth collection.

""The common thread between the works can be expressed in a few key words: neutral colours minimal but not reductive and incredible craftsmanship"" Franceschini told Dezeen.

The exhibition space comprises a loft-style apartment spread across two floors of Walker Tower. This backdrop intends to straddle both a gallery and a real liveable apartment.

The curators' specific focus is how the works on display interact with each other rather than the styling of the apartment itself.

""The idea was to establish a dialogue between the art deco architecture of the building the omnipresent New York skyline and the collectible art and design pieces"" said Galerie Philia's founder.

Set against white walls the majority of the pieces share a colour palette of black white and brass.

Einstein by Jérôme Pereira is an elegant floor lamp made of glass and wood resembling a cluster of matchsticks. Gold Arch Console a brass table by Franceschini is also exhibited.

Torn is a high console table in black wood by Lucas Morten also featured alongside Goddess a brass sconce light fixture by Paul Matter.

A separate pastel-themed bedroom displays objects softly tinted in yellow green and pink.

These include a chubby chair and equally as plump stool named Elephante by Studio Noon both made in light pink pigmented cement. Laurids Gallée's Green Console a translucent green resin table also features in the pastel bedroom.

As co-curators Franceschini and Galerie Philia's founder are confident that minimalist design does not have to be reductive despite acknowledging that this can often be the case. Their exhibition they say is different.

""Our minimalism is clear in its initial statement but it also has a narrative that goes beyond a first impression"" explained Franceschini.

""Materiality and detail entice the viewer to look more closely"" he said of the works exhibited.

""What brings these works together as a coherent ensemble is their intrinsic quality both aesthetic and conceptual"" continued Galerie Philia's founder.

The Walker Tower is what Franceschini considers the ideal contrasting backdrop to the minimalist exhibition with its ""hybrid of brick volumes and metal ornamentation.""

How will the stock do going forward? Varun Anand of Starlight Capital says while BCE is solid investors might want to look beyond the telecom providers to an infrastructure play like cell towers.

“We do like Telus Rogers and BCE” said Anand portfolio manager at Starlight Capital who spoke to BNN Bloomberg on Thursday. “But our preferred way to play the cellular tower space is through the tower companies.”

“Remember with Bell Rogers and Telus they own the network and they also have the towers but then they also have very price competitive consumer businesses like the cellphone plans home internet and whatnot” Anand said.

BCE reported a solid fourth quarter on Thursday to wrap up what it called an overall good year considering the challenges posed by COVID-19. The company saw revenues fall by 2.8 per cent year-over-year to $6.102 billion for the Q4 2020 while adjusted EBITDA dropped by 3.2 per cent to $2.404 billion. Earnings came in at $0.98 per share compared to $0.74 per share a year earlier while analysts had called for earnings of $0.74 per share on a topline of $6.16 billion.

For the year BCE’s revenue dropped 3.8 per cent to $22.883 billion and adjusted EBITDA fell 4.0 per cent to $9.607 billion.

“In every successive quarter since COVID-19 began Bell has delivered sequential quarterly improvement in our operating results underscoring the stability and resiliency of our company and the strength of our financial position” said CFO Glen LeBlanc in a press release.

Management spoke of the company’s resilience in the face of social and economic impacts of the pandemic but the focus in its commentary was on the future specifically its plans to add another $1-1.2 billion in capital spending over the next two years. BCE aims to step up its fibre-optic and fixed wireless network buildout and double its 5G wireless capacity during 2021 saying that shareholder value will be enhanced through the infrastructure layout.

“Bell plans to increase the number of new locations covered with fibre and WHI by as many as 900000 in 2021 – bringing the combined footprint to up to 6.9 million homes and businesses by the end of the year – while doubling the population coverage of Canada’s fastest 5G network” the company said in the Q4 press release.

“Funded by proceeds from the sale of Bell data centres in 2020 the investment acceleration is in addition to Bell’s typical capital expenditures over the last decade of approximately $4 billion a year (growing to $4.2 billion in 2020 due to added investment in network capacity and digital platforms in response to unprecedented usage demand during the COVID crisis)” BCE said.

The company even provided guidance for the year ahead a big of a rarity these days as companies grapple with a host of pandemic-related unknowns. BCE expects both revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow by between two and five per cent in 2021.

“Overall revenue is expected to reflect a gradual economic recovery in 2021 combined with subscriber revenue growth and strategic pricing on advertising sales. However revenue performance is expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on many sectors of the economy” the company said.

BCE’s share price has been flat to trending downward since last spring finishing 2020 down 9.5 per cent and so far trading up two per cent for 2021. By comparison Telus (Telus Stock Quote Chart News Analysts Financials TSX:T) ended the year at even while Rogers Communications (Rogers Communications Stock Quote Chart News Analysts Financials TSX:RCI.B) dropped almost eight per cent.

Anand says he leans towards cell tower holding companies some of whom had a mildly better year than the Canadian telcos. Of the bigger players in the US Crown Castle ended 2020 up 12 per cent American Tower lost three per cent and SBA Communications finished up 17 per cent. Not yet established in Canada where the big telco companies own their own towers these REITs (real estate investment trusts) in the US have done well over the past decade.

“We’d rather play that through tower companies that just own the towers and collect the contracted cash flows from the carriers because there’s more leverage in that business and it’s more stable and as a result you don’t have as much price competition” Anand said.

“So a company like American Tower or SBA Communications would be our preferred play rather than a telco incumbent like BCE” Anand said.

Of the cell tower REITs Jim Cramer of CNBC’s Mad Money recently picked Crown Castle as his preferred choice saying that while the company has spent billions in building out its 5G network in densely populated areas these investments “have yet to pay off in a 4G world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhbXBzaGlyZWxpdmUubmV3cy93aGF0cy1vbi93aGF0cy1vbi1uZXdzL3NlZW4tdGFsbGVyLXRvd2Vycy1xdWlya3ktcG9ydHNtb3V0aC00OTYwMjk30gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGFtcHNoaXJlbGl2ZS5uZXdzL3doYXRzLW9uL3doYXRzLW9uLW5ld3Mvc2Vlbi10YWxsZXItdG93ZXJzLXF1aXJreS1wb3J0c21vdXRoLTQ5NjAyOTcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Seen taller towers': Quirky Portsmouth Spinnaker and Historic Dockyard reviews posted by American tourists,"Portsmouth is rightfully known as a city steeped in maritime history and culture.

“I’ve just been to too many more famous taller towers”

Bathany from Denver in Colorado only rated the Spinnaker Tower three out of a possible five stars following her visit.

Her review said: “I liked Spinnaker Tower but at the same time maybe I've just been to too many more famous taller towers with more people space in them because I didn't LOVE it.

“The most exciting thing was the Sky Walk (glass section of floor) which not all towers have but that only gave me about three minutes of adrenaline and then I looked outside at the pleasant but not crazy breathtaking view again. It was even a nice day.

“Most of the staff also seemed like they didn't want to be there. It's a Saturday sure but they work in customer service/tourism so that surprises me when it happens. Especially when I'm paying that much.

“I would recommend it but just don't have too high of expectations (literally) if you've been to a lot of high places.

“Except for the failing elevator it is pretty good”

Lawrence from the city of Mountain View in California was more impressed and gave the tower four out of five stars.

He did though warn of tower staff “pouncing” on people if they are caught wearing shoes on its glass floor.

He said: “The Tower is a great landmark for Portsmouth... everyone I spoke with seemed quite proud of their Tower and except for the failing elevator on opening day it is pretty good.

“From up high you have an amazing view of the surrounding area and there are plenty of guides at the top to help point out what you are looking at. The glass floor for being the largest in the area is kind of a joke. Just don't wear your shoes on it because the docents will pounce on you.”

“Tourists deserve a much better experience”

Betty’s trip to the dockyard was ruined due to a lack of audio guides and felt “tourists deserve a much better experience”.

Havre de Grace in Maryland agreed saying: “We drove two hours on our England vacation to experience the Victory warship. While the cost wasn't inexpensive we were excited to see the ship. Imagine our dismay when we were blithely told that there were no audio guides to use as ""they are being charged"". There were no instructions on how to go through the ship and there were no explanatory placards.

“If these are not readily available the museum should certainly post docents at each level to explain what we were seeing. The only bright spots were two such docents and Jason especially answered many questions and was very helpful.

“With the cost of entry tourists deserve a much better experience.”

“My wife was dubious about the entire visit”

A key part of any trip to a tourist attraction is keeping our partner happy and William from Minneapolis Minnesota knew this all too well ahead of his trip to the Historic Dockyard.

The entire family fortunately left pleased with their day out.

His review said: “A visit there had been on my to do list for many years and I finally did it accompanied by my wife daughter son-in-law and two grandchildren aged 6 and 9. We took the train down from London and spent the night at the nearby Holiday Inn Express.

“My wife was dubious about the entire visit but afterwards she rated the Mary Rose as one of the highlights of the trip. I was however disappointed in the nearby Victory which could have been an outstanding display but which had poor signage and was dark and in poor repair.

“I think anyone who wasn't somewhat knowledgeable about ships of the late 18 th and early 19 th centuries would not have gotten much out of a visit to this historic ship.”",,,

The fiberglass skiff Lazora idled on the darkened Pacific Ocean a few miles south of American waters. It was roughly 25 feet long and seven feet wide unlit overloaded and offering no shelter from the elements. Twenty people were crammed aboard. Most were seated on narrow benches. A few huddled on the vomit-splattered deck. Some had opened slits in plastic garbage bags and pushed heads and arms through flimsy protection against the damp October chill. Few life jackets were visible. At the boat’s stern two Mexican men tended a 200-horsepower outboard engine and 10 plastic barrels of fuel. They were in the final hour of ferrying a load of undocumented migrants toward American land in waters nearly three-quarters of a mile deep: human smugglers running a boat through a seam where black sea met black sky.

The boat operators one a former commercial fisherman and the other his cousin had picked up their passengers earlier in the night on a beach on Mexico’s coastline and worked their way offshore and northward. Shortly after midnight they arrived at a de facto loitering zone for maritime smugglers preparing for runs into the United States a patch of ocean just south of the American line where Mexican law-enforcement vessels rarely patrol and American vessels have no authority. Now their uneventful ride was giving way to tension and fear.

The lights of San Diego and Tijuana twinkled in the eastern distance. The Lazora’s destination was the steep outcropping of Point Loma beside the entrance to San Diego’s harbor where the men running the skiff had been told a pickup crew would guide them to the beach with a flashing light. From there the migrants were expected to follow a Southern California human-smuggling routine — a leap into the surf a scramble ashore a rush to waiting vehicles a drive to safe houses where they would be held until the balance of their smuggling fees had been paid. And then if it all worked if no one drowned if the ever-shifting network of federal state and municipal law-enforcement agencies did not catch them they would embark on a furtive form of opportunity in the United States.

They came from multiple Mexican states and matched familiar profiles of undocumented migrants seeking to cross. One was a 56-year-old widower from Colima who supported three children and two grandchildren. Another was a young man from Nayarit who cared for a mother sick with cancer. A teenage minor was among them as was a man from Oaxaca who turned 18 two weeks earlier and wanted a job. A 41-year-old man from Michoacan had boarded the skiff to seek reunion with his daughter who preceded him to the United States with hopes of studying in an American school.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzAyLzA3L2JyaWVmcy1idXNpbmVzc3Blb3BsZS1pbmNsdWRpbmctdGltb3RoeS1jLW1vbmFoYW4tcGhpbC1idWxsaW5nZXItYW5kLXJvYmVydC1ndXRtYW5uLzQzNjQ4MTEwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefs on businesspeople including Timothy C.

Of particular note are inventions by the somewhat mysterious Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais whose tech claims to be able to “engineer reality.” His slate of highly-ambitious borderline sci-fi designs meant for use by the U.S. government range from gravitational wave generators and compact fusion reactors to next-gen hybrid aerospace-underwater crafts with revolutionary propulsion systems and beyond.

Of course the existence of patents does not mean these technologies have actually been created but there is evidence that some demonstrations of operability have been successfully carried out. As investigated and reported by The War Zone a possible reason why some of the patents may have been taken on by the Navy is that the Chinese military may also be developing similar advanced gadgets.

Among Dr. Pais’s patents are designs approved in 2018 for an aerospace-underwater craft of incredible speed and maneuverability. This cone-shaped vehicle can potentially fly just as well anywhere it may be whether air water or space without leaving any heat signatures. It can achieve this by creating a quantum vacuum around itself with a very dense polarized energy field. This vacuum would allow it to repel any molecule the craft comes in contact with no matter the medium. Manipulating “quantum field fluctuations in the local vacuum energy state” would help reduce the craft’s inertia. The polarized vacuum would dramatically decrease any elemental resistance and lead to “extreme speeds” claims the paper.

Not only that if the vacuum-creating technology can be engineered we’d also be able to “engineer the fabric of our reality at the most fundamental level” states the patent. This would lead to major advancements in aerospace propulsion and generating power. Not to mention other reality-changing outcomes that come to mind.

Among Pais’s other patents are inventions that stem from similar thinking outlining pieces of technology necessary to make his creations come to fruition. His paper presented in 2019 titled “Room Temperature Superconducting System for Use on a Hybrid Aerospace Undersea Craft” proposes a system that can achieve superconductivity at room temperatures. This would become “a highly disruptive technology capable of a total paradigm change in Science and Technology” conveys Pais.

Another invention devised by Pais is an electromagnetic field generator that could generate “an impenetrable defensive shield to sea and land as well as space-based military and civilian assets.” This shield could protect from threats like anti-ship ballistic missiles cruise missiles that evade radar coronal mass ejections military satellites and even asteroids.

Dr. Pais’s ideas center around the phenomenon he dubbed “The Pais Effect”. He referred to it in his writings as the “controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma) via accelerated spin and/or accelerated vibration under rapid (yet smooth) acceleration-deceleration-acceleration transients.” In less jargon-heavy terms Pais claims to have figured out how to spin electromagnetic fields in order to contain a fusion reaction – an accomplishment that would lead to a tremendous change in power consumption and an abundance of energy.

According to his bio in a recently published paper on a new Plasma Compression Fusion Device which could transform energy production Dr. Pais is a mechanical and aerospace engineer working at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) which is headquartered in Patuxent River Maryland. Holding a Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Ohio Pais was a NASA Research Fellow and worked with Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. His current Department of Defense work involves his “advanced knowledge of theory analysis and modern experimental and computational methods in aerodynamics along with an understanding of air-vehicle and missile design especially in the domain of hypersonic power plant and vehicle design.” He also has expert knowledge of electrooptics emerging quantum technologies (laser power generation in particular) high-energy electromagnetic field generation and the “breakthrough field of room temperature superconductivity as related to advanced field propulsion.”

Suffice it to say with such a list of research credentials that would make Nikola Tesla proud Dr. Pais seems well-positioned to carry out groundbreaking work.

The patents won’t necessarily lead to these technologies ever seeing the light of day. The research has its share of detractors and nonbelievers among other scientists who think the amount of energy required for the fields described by Pais and his ideas on electromagnetic propulsions are well beyond the scope of current tech and are nearly impossible. Yet investigators at The War Zone found comments from Navy officials that indicate the inventions are being looked at seriously enough and some tests are taking place.

The expansion of the company is expected to help expand the number of employees from the existing workforce of 100 to 200 to deal with the demand for a particular product.

Based in Japan the company manufactures gas appliances including energy-efficient tankless water heaters which are in great demand in the U.S. and home heating appliances.

Talking about the expansion the Chief Operation Officer of Rinnai America Frank Windsor expressed hope that the company will be the largest manufacturer of energy-efficient products by 2021.

“Rinnai America is the leading provider of tank-less water heaters in North America with 40 percent market share. We participate in the residential and in the commercial business. One of the big steps that had taken place for business here this year was the expansion of our new corporate headquarters. We also opened up the domestic manufacture in Griffin Georgia about 30 miles away. And in 2021 we will be building larger manufacturing facilities to support the business” Windsor said.

Rinnai Corporation Vice President Derrick Black underscored that the most important goal of the company is to achieve a great quality of customers so that the firm becomes reliable to them.

“People enjoy the fact that they can get a continuous flow of hot water. It never runs out of hot water which can be common in the U.S. Our main goal is the fundamental concept of ‘Quality is our destiny.’ We want to achieve great quality for customers so that they can rely on the Rinnai water heater to work perfectly all the time. That is our first and most important goal” Black said.

“The share of quality products by Japanese trusted technology has already been expanding worldwide. And efforts of the company continue to support and contribute to better people’s daily life” he added.

Groundbreaking ceremonies were held July 28 2017 on International Drive in Peachtree City for the more than $15 million expansion including a new two-story headquarters and establishment of its North American Innovation and Training Center.

Upon completion of the company’s proposed 37560-square-foot two-story headquarters and 25110-square-foot Innovation Center Rinnai’s expansion project will see its 8.4 acre campus expand by nearly 63000 square feet and include new buildings testing equipment and other amenities.",,,

The speakers in your iPhone or Mac likely sound weak compared to your stereo system. But how do you get the music from your device to those speakers? AirPlay is Apple’s super-cool technology that enables you to stream audio from an Apple device to your speakers over Wi-Fi. But the stereo system to which you’re streaming needs to support AirPlay for that to work.

One way to add music streaming support to such a system would be to upgrade its amplifier to one that supports AirPlay—something like this Denon DRA-800H. If you’re buying new make sure you get one with AirPlay 2. But that’s a pricey solution for being able to play music wirelessly from your Apple devices through your best-sounding speakers.

A cheaper solution would be to use one of Apple’s now-obsolete AirPort Express base stations. It connects to your devices over Wi-Fi and to your stereo through a standard headphone jack. The second-generation AirPort Express 802.11n with the version 7.8 firmware update even supports AirPlay 2 but modern Macs iPhones and iPads can still stream even to older AirPort Express models that support only AirTunes the audio-only predecessor to AirPlay. If you can find one it will do the job quite well—you’ll just need a copy of AirPort Utility for macOS or iOS to configure it. In fact I was using an AirPort Express for years until it died a few months ago leaving me scrambling for a new solution. I could have tried to replace it with another but I recalled that I still had a second-generation Apple TV that could step into the breach. With a little effort I got it working beautifully.

So if you’re interested in bringing your classic stereo system into the modern music streaming world without spending much you could look for a used second-generation AirPort Express. Or you could do what I did and press an old Apple TV into service. I did this because I had the Apple TV in the closet making this project a fun alternative to an AirPort Express. I had even lost the Apple TV remote; I’ll explain briefly how to work around that problem in the steps below.

Parts List

Here are the parts you will need:

Second- or third-generation Apple TV: You’ll need a power cord; a remote is helpful but not essential.

You’ll need a power cord; a remote is helpful but not essential. TOSLINK Digital-to-Analog (D/A) Converter: This is the magical gadget that connects your Apple TV to your stereo converting digital audio to analog. I got this Easycel model recently for $13 but if it’s unavailable there are others that should work such as this Techole unit. The converter should accept a TOSLINK (or “optical”) audio input (digital) and deliver a pair of RCA stereo outputs (analog). Make sure it includes a TOSLINK (“optical”) cable; if not you’ll have to buy one separately.

Pair of RCA Cables: You probably have some of these cables sitting around—cable TV providers often handed them out in the days before TVs supported HDMI and many people have extras for connecting stereo gear. You only need two and while standard practice suggests using red and white for audio the colors don’t matter. Otherwise you can grab an inexpensive pair online.

HDMI Cable: You’ll need this cable to connect the Apple TV to your TV but it’s necessary only while you’re setting up the Apple TV for the first time.

Step by Step Instructions

Without further ado here are the steps to AirPlay-enable your classic stereo system with an old Apple TV. First let’s run through setting up the Apple TV after which we’ll connect it to your stereo with the TOSLINK digital-to-analog converter.

Plug the Apple TV in near your TV and connect the two using the HDMI cable. Remember to change the input on your TV. If you don’t have a remote but you do have a Bluetooth keyboard you can still do the necessary configuration. Put the keyboard into pairing mode and then go to Settings > General > Bluetooth and choose the keyboard. You can now use the arrows to navigate around the Apple TV interface in lieu of the remote; press Return to make selections and Escape to go back. If your Apple TV was previously restored to factory settings you should see a screen asking you to select your language. In that case follow the on-screen instructions. Otherwise you should see the normal home screen.

If you want to start with a predictable baseline navigate to Settings > General > Reset and select Reset All Settings. Navigate to Settings > General > Network select a Wi-Fi network and enter the password (the keyboard will come in handy here). In Settings > General > Name enter a name that reflects where the speakers will be located. In Settings > General > Time Zone set the time zone. I’m not sure if this matters but it’s usually a good idea. Disable the screen saver by navigating to Settings > Screen Saver > Start After > Never. Again I’m not sure if this matters but I see no reason why the device should be burning CPU memory and possibly network bandwidth trying to display a screen saver that no one will ever see. Leave all audio settings at their default values.

At this point you should be all set to stream audio! Test to make sure AirPlay is working by trying to stream some audio from your iPhone to the TV your Apple TV is currently connected to. Open the Music app play a song tap the AirPlay icon and tap your newly created AirPlay destination.#

If anything doesn’t work back up and troubleshoot before proceeding. Once you unplug the Apple TV from the TV screen it will be harder to troubleshoot.

Now we’re in the home stretch! Next we’ll connect the Apple TV to your stereo in a few quick steps:

Disconnect the HDMI cable from the Apple TV; you won’t need it again. Unplug your Apple TV and relocate it close to the amplifier driving the speakers you are upgrading with AirPlay support. Plug the Apple TV in to power it up. Plug in your digital-to-analog converter and connect it to the Apple TV using the TOSLINK cable. The TOSLINK port (labeled SPDIF on my device which technically also refers to the coaxial port next to it) is the D-shaped port with a flap to keep dust out. If you peek inside you’ll see a red light. Fiber optics baby!

Connect your RCA cables to the red and white (L/R) ports of the digital-to-analog converter and into your stereo amplifier perhaps in a CD AUX or Tape input. Don’t use Phono inputs! Those are designed to work only with record players.

Change the input on your amplifier to whatever you chose to plug the RCA cables into.

When you’re all done your connections should look something like this photo.

Finally go back to the Music app and try the streaming test again noting that you may have to reselect the AirPlay destination. (Remember that you should always start with the volume down low to prevent damage to your speakers and your ears.) You should hear your iPhone playing back through your stereo! This AirPlay destination will be visible everywhere on your Wi-Fi network including all your iPhones iPads and Macs. Even guests will be able to use it if they have access to your Wi-Fi.

A Few Techie Notes

Given that we’re talking about older hardware there are a few technical details that might raise additional questions.

What do I lose by not having AirPlay 2? The second- and third-generation Apple TV support AirPlay but not the newer AirPlay 2. The main downside there is that they cannot participate in a multi-speaker destination such as having all the speakers in your house play the same music in sync. For that you would need to modify these steps to use an Apple TV HD or Apple TV 4K. While I’ve always been intrigued by this multi-room feature I’ve never found a practical use for it.

What would be different if I want to use a current Apple TV? The third-generation Apple TV is the last model to include the TOSLINK/optical audio port. If you want to use a current Apple TV model for this project you will need a different digital-to-analog converter that accepts HDMI as an input such as this AGPtek unit. The rest of the steps should be similar.

The rest of the steps should be similar. Why can’t I use the headphone jack? You might be tempted to use the headphone output on the digital-to-analog converter rather than the RCA outputs (the red and white jacks in the photo below). Resist the temptation. While some headphone output jacks are capable of driving a line-level device like your amplifier most are good only for headphones and will sound lousy when connected to an amplifier. (That said the headphone output on the old AirPort Express drove a line-level device quite well.)

A frequent example that appears in projects on Hackaday is the reading of utility meters and in that arena [jomjol] has a very neat solution involving an ESP32 camera module and a software neural network to identify meter readings directly.

The ESP and camera sit at the top of a 3D-printed housing that fits over the meter. The clever trick comes as each photo’s orientation is determined and not only is OCR used to read digits but also figures are derived from small dial meters and other indicators on the meter face. It’s a very well-thought-out system with a web-based configuration tool that allows full customisation of the readable zones and how they should be treated.

This project makes full use of the ESP32’s capabilities and the attention to detail that has gone into making it usable is particularly impressive. It certainly raises the bar against previous OCR meter reading projects.

Following the publication yesterday of allegations made in parliament this week by the opposition APC party parliamentary leader – Chernor M. Bah accusing the Bio-led government of secretly permitting the Chinese mining company – Kingho Mining Company Ltd to ship millions of dollars worth of iron ore from the shores of Sierra Leone without parlaiment’s approval the ministry of mines and mineral resources has responded in a presss statement.

Justifying its decision to allow the shipment to go ahead the ministry of mines says that:

“The ownership of the iron ore stockpiled at the Pepel Port rests with the State and under the authority of the Minister of Mines and Mineral Resources. Hence the Minister of Mines and Mineral resources urgently put modalities in place through the Cabinet to legally morally and ethically authorize Kingho Investment Company Ltd to export (on a one-off commercial basis as agreed in the One-Off APA) the Iron Ore Stockpile at the Pepel Port on behalf of the State.

“An Advance Pricing Agreement which is a requirement (when selling to.an affiliated company) in the Mines and Minerals Act 2009 and Extractive Industries Revenue Act 2018 (as enacted into law by Parliament) does not (and had never been) have to go to Parliament. An Advance Pricing Agreement is an executive operational and regulatory instrument developed and implemented by the Regulatory Agency (NMA ) and the MMMR in consultation with Ministry of Finance/NRA; not by Parliament.”

This is the full statement published by the mimnistry of mines:

“Kingho Mining Company Ltd was granted a Large-Scale Mining Licence by the GOSL on 8 January 2020. On 21 December 2020 Kingho Investment Company Limited (the parent Company for Kingho Mining Company Ltd and Kingho Railway and Port Company Ltd) submitted an Expression of Interest (EOI) to export the iron ore mineral product stockpiled (Iron Ore Stockpile) situated at Pepel Port site on behalf of the GoSL on commercial basis.

The EOI as submitted by Kingho Investment Company Limited (KICL) covers the Iron Ore Stockpile at the Pepel Port site only. The EOI also drew the attention of the GoSL to the fact that the Iron Ore Stockpile is being stored on a pad that will be used by Kingho Mining Company Ltd (KMCL) for stockpiling its iron ore transported from the Tonkolili Mine Site that will be in production in January/February 2021.

Furthermore KICL indicated that considering the volume of Iron Ore stockpile and the space it occupies agreeing to export the Iron Ore Stockpile now will create sufficient space for its incoming iron ore from the Tonkolili Mine Site.

The GoSL on 8 January 2021 concluded the GOSL-Kingho Rail and Port Lease Agreement (Lease Agreement) with Kingho Railway and Port Company Limited to operate the Tonkolili-Pepel Railway and Pepel Port facilities.

Also the two subsidiary companies of Kingho Investment Company Limited (i.e. Kingho Mining Company Ltd and Kingho Railway and Port Company Ltd) are at an advanced stage of the mobilization and site preparation to commence operations at the Tonkolili Mine site and Pepel Port.

These recent developments put Kingho Investment Company Ltd in a better position to have the right of first refusal to export (on a one-off commercial basis) the Iron Ore Stockpile at the Pepel Port on behalf of the State.

Having thoroughly assessed the situation both locally (i.e. nature of the iron ore product current state of preparedness and acquisition of right to operate the Railway and Pepel Port by Kingho Rail and Port Company Ltd) and internationally (i.e. current global price of iron ore) the GOSL asked KICL to tentatively make marketing arrangements and secure a third-party buyer for the Iron Ore Stockpile.

In January 2021 the NMA conducted a detailed assessment and verification exercise (including volumetric drone survey) at the Pepel Port to ascertain the tonnage (quantity) and quality of the iron ore already stockpiled at the site and also collected representative samples of the iron ore stockpiles for laboratory analysis to ascertain the product quality including moisture content and Transportable Moisture Limit (TML).

The iron ore product from the Tonkolili Mine Site historically fetches a considerably lower price in comparison to the benchmark prices of iron ore products with a similar iron (Fe) content. Benchmark prices only cover a certain range of product specifications – iron ore in particular is known to display an extremely large range in product specifications depending on for example their geological properties the geography and climate of the area it is mined in.

Accordingly even though the iron ore product from the Tonkolili Mine Site has a 57-58% Fe content (and thus falls into the bracket covered by the Platts’/TSI’s 58% Fe iron ore spot price index) it became evident that this product was always valued significantly lower than the benchmark product due to its inferior specifications.

Not only does this product display a much higher alumina (Al2O3) content than commonly preferred (6-7% instead of the 1.5% prescribed by the benchmark) it also has extremely high levels of moisture (15% instead of the maximum of 9% prescribed by the benchmark).

Moreover this product is also marred by a large loss of ignition (LoI) and general efficiency losses in handling of the product due to the high clay content and the chemical properties of the ore. All these properties combined cause this Iron Ore Stockpile to be of significantly inferior quality in comparison to other companies’ products with a comparable iron (Fe) content.

The MMMR and the NMA in collaboration with the relevant MDAs estimated a fair price on the stockpiled iron ore mineral product as it leaves the Pepel Port. However it is important to note that sales of iron products seldom take place at this point (i.e. as the iron ore product leaves the Pepel Port) so the method chosen was determined by a trade-off between the ease of administration and the desire to provide an economically efficient and equitable system.

In this specific case the valuation points included published price (including deductions given the specifications of the iron ore product in question) and Free on Board (FOB) – deduct freight costs insurance any legal costs quality adjustments and marketing fees etc.

GoSL and Kingho Investment Company Ltd negotiated a One-Off Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) prior to the export of the Iron Ore Stockpile at the Pepel Port subject to a Cabinet concurrence.

The APA determines in advance the terms and conditions of the one-off commercial transaction/sale of the Iron Ore Stockpile and ensures price transparency and predictability based on publicly published iron ore price indices.

As part of the One-Off APA negotiations process the NMA MMMR and MOF/NRA ensured that Kingho Investment Company Ltd committed to providing certain critical information in relation to the sale of the Iron Ore Stockpile at the Pepel Port.

The documents included: Provisional invoice; Freight invoice from carrier; Draft survey report; Sales contract with third-party; Copy of certified laboratory report for shipment samples taken; Customs certificate at the port of delivery (e.g. Qingdao); Final invoice; Supporting documents that can explain all differences between the Platts Iron Ore price and the quoted “base price” (e.g. size of the particles and penalty for it moisture penalty TiO2 penalty LOI penalty etc.); and an Excel file tracking shipment and status/availability of the requested documents as well as provisional revised and final invoices.

The ownership of the iron ore stockpiled at the Pepel Port rests with the State and under the authority of the Minister of Mines and Mineral Resources. Hence the Minister of Mines and Mineral resources urgently put modalities in place through the Cabinet to legally morally and ethically authorize Kingho Investment Company Ltd to export (on a one-off commercial basis as agreed in the One-Off APA) the Iron Ore Stockpile at the Pepel Port on behalf of the State.

An Advance Pricing Agreement which is a requirement (when selling to.an affiliated company) in the Mines and Minerals Act 2009 and Extractive Industries Revenue Act 2018 (as enacted into law by Parliament) does not (and had never been) have to go to Parliament. An Advance Pricing Agreement is an executive operational and regulatory instrument developed and implemented by the Regulatory Agency (NMA ) and the MMMR in consultation with Ministry of Finance/NRA; not by Parliament. (End of Statement).

Is this the end of this political row or will the opposition parliamentarians come up with further revelations about this Chinese iron ore shipment deal?",,,,,,,,,,,,

After sputtering in development several years ago and then being shut down before it saw the light of day the tech giant’s car project is apparently back on track.

Several outlets including CNBC and the Wall Street Journal have reported that Apple is discussing a deal to manufacture a vehicle in the U.S.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment but the company rarely discusses future products.

Given Apple’s status as the world’s most valuable company – it’s worth about $2.3 trillion on the stock market – any new product it's pursuing should be taken seriously.

“We continue to believe it’s a matter of when not if Apple enters the EV race” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note referring to electric vehicles.

But assuming it actually happens what will the vehicle look like what will it cost and how much different will it be from other EVs on the market? We attempt to answer some of those questions below.

Dinosaur no more:Nissan Frontier pickup totally redesigned for first time in 17 years

Consumer Reports:These are the 10 most and least reliable 2021 cars trucks and SUVs

Will it be an electric vehicle?

Without a doubt. There’s essentially no chance that Apple takes on the competitive market for gasoline vehicles. Expect it to be a battery-powered electric vehicle.

Given the company’s expertise in battery-powered consumer electronics it makes sense that it would attempt to extend that expertise to cars.

“Look for Apple to introduce potentially next-level/game-changing battery tech into its cars” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a research note.

Just keep in mind: Batteries for cars are much different than batteries for consumer electronics. You wouldn’t leave your laptop sitting out in the rain overnight and expect it to work in the morning.

What will it be called?

OK speculators seem to think it will be called iCar. But that might be a little too cute for a product for which you pay tens of thousands of dollars.

Apple’s code name for its car project was Project Titan – at least when it was canceled around 2016 after a couple of years of development.

This much we know: The vehicle won’t be called the Titan. That’s the name of a full-size Nissan pickup truck.

How much will it cost?

Have you ever heard of a cheap Apple product? We didn’t think so. No one is offering a price estimate for an Apple vehicle yet – we don’t even know if it would be a passenger car an SUV a pickup a van or something else altogether.

But it would be shocking if it cost less than the average price of a new vehicle sold in the U.S. in the fourth quarter which topped $40000 according to car-research site Edmunds.

Who will make it?

The reports suggest that Apple is in discussions with the company that manufactures Hyundai and Kia vehicles. The company would make a more than $3 billion investment to assemble the vehicle at a plant in Georgia.

The southeastern U.S. is generally where foreign automakers have gone to assemble their vehicles in large part to avoid the likelihood of a unionization effort in the Midwest where the United Auto Workers represents hourly workers at General Motors Ford and Fiat Chrysler.

Another possibility is that contract manufacturer Magna International will be involved according to Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally. Magna has experience managing complex vehicle production projects for clients.

Will it be a self-driving car?

All the major automakers and numerous tech companies are working on self-driving vehicles in some capacity. And analysts said they’d be surprised if Apple isn’t doing the same.

“Don’t expect steering wheels” Jonas said. “We have a hard time imagining Apple entering the automotive market with a vehicle design that involves human intervention in the driving process.”

He compared an Apple car with a steering wheel to “an iPhone with physical buttons and a coiled rubber cord connected to a wall.”

But a self-driving car could introduce a “longer timeframe” in part due to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s cautious approach to unveiling new products Ives said. Automakers and tech companies have yet to solve the thorniest challenges associated with autonomous driving.

When will it arrive?

It’s at least a few years off. Ives suggested that it could be unveiled as soon as 2024. But will it be ready to produce by then? That seems unlikely.

The pattern in the industry is to announce vehicles that are still a long way out. Tesla has made a habit of revealing cars more than two years before they’re ready to roll out. But it would be natural to expect Apple to begin taking reservations as soon as the car is announced.

Keep in mind that it typically takes three to five years to design and build a new vehicle from scratch so 2024 may require “Herculean-like auto production capabilities” plus solving battery production issues and regulatory hurdles Ives said.

Why now?

Battery technology has improved and advancements in autonomous vehicle systems have reached a point where it might finally be feasible to do an unconventional vehicle.

But there’s another factor that can’t be ignored: the political environment.

“Taking a step back we believe this speaks to what we believe is a golden age of EVs on the horizon with a green tidal wave expected in the US under a Biden Administration and China seeing skyrocketing consumer demand across the board” Ives said.

Bottom line: Biden is expected to support incentives to produce or purchase electric cars which don’t emit climate change-causing emissions like gasoline vehicles do.

Could it all fall apart again?

Yes. Apple’s previous car project was disbanded after it reportedly delivered insufficient results.

Perhaps the greatest risk is that Apple decides it’s just too expensive to dive into auto manufacturing which is where cash can go to die.

Just ask Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He’s openly acknowledged that Tesla came within weeks of running out of money when production of the Model 3 compact car was struggling in 2018.

Apple won't be running out of money any time soon. But shareholders may not react kindly to a money-losing venture when the company's other products are cash cows.

This time last year we wrote about the critical role hypersonic weapons and counter-hypersonic capabilities are going to play for our national defense and the importance of investing in our capabilities at the University of Arizona.

During the past 12 months the Covid pandemic has changed the way we learn and interact with one another and reinforced the importance of investing in our research institutions.

While Covid certainly has had an impact on our daily lives it has not eliminated the challenges we face from foreign governments and adversaries who see an opportunity to challenge American exceptionalism.

As was true a year ago Arizona has an opportunity to be a major player in the new frontier of hypersonics — and investments are required.

Hypersonic systems travel and maneuver at Mach 5 or faster.

Russia and China continue to invest heavily to further develop their hypersonic capabilities and our federal government has made great strides to encourage industry and university partnerships.

The Department of Defense will have operational systems in the field in the near future; its proposed budget through fiscal 2024 calls for upward of $10.5 billion in hypersonic weapons development with $100 million dedicated to research partnerships between experts and educators through the establishment of the Joint Hypersonics Transition Office.

The opportunity for Arizona to become a leader in the future of hypersonic research is now.

Tucson-based Raytheon Missiles & Defense and the University of Arizona have long had a wildly productive relationship partnering on research manufacturing and workforce development. In fact Raytheon is hiring UofA engineers as fast as they graduate.

We continue to aggressively invest in our partnership this year. As home to the state’s only public wind tunnels the University of Arizona has the equipment used to test high- speed weapons and understands the implications of high-speed flight and maneuvering. With three wind tunnels now operational we must upgrade the infrastructure to test materials at speeds greater than Mach 5.

Picking up where we left off in 2020 Raytheon and the University of Arizona are requesting targeted technical investment to achieve operational proficiency and maximize these wind tunnels’ capabilities.

Here’s what the wind tunnel upgrade means for Arizona:

Industry can test and understand hypersonic travel in our own backyard rather than shipping products to other states like Indiana or California. It is important to note that Raytheon is also a university customer and pays for its wind tunnel test time to understand how applied materials react in various environments commercial flight and even space travel. By keeping this research in Tucson students and faculty at the University of Arizona not only are exposed to hypersonic technology but they also have the opportunity to lead the nation in new research and technology advancement. As one of only a handful of available hypersonic tunnels in the United States the University of Arizona is furthering its reputation as a magnet for uniquely talented students researchers and professionals opening opportunities to attract other space flight and defense companies.

There is tight competition for the future of hypersonic research. Indiana has made significant investments at Purdue and Notre Dame. To maximize our capabilities the University of Arizona has partnered with Texas A&M to carryout federal research programs as directed by the Joint Hypersonics Transition Office — a huge win for our university.

Raytheon and the University of Arizona will continue to grow our existing partnership. We have an opportunity to support research and development for technology upgrades included in the state budget. Arizona lawmakers can ensure our state is at the forefront of hypersonic research by approving our small yet strategically critical appropriation to allow state-of-the-art wind tunnel upgrades that will ultimately increase our ability as a nation to accelerate testing.

However there is concern about the transfer of potentially harmful materials such as silver nanoparticles from these types of containers to consumables.



Now researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces illustrate that silver embedded in an antimicrobial plastic can leave the material and form nanoparticles in foods and beverages particularly in sweet and sugary ones.



Some polymers containing nanoparticles or nanocomposites can slow the growth of microorganisms responsible for food and beverage spoilage and foodborne illness. Although these polymers are not currently approved for use in packaging in the U.S. researchers are investigating various types of nanoparticle-embedded polymers that could be incorporated into containers in the future.



Prior studies have shown that some of these polymers can leach nanoparticles dissolved compounds and ions into water-based food simulants but so far little is known about how such packaging might interact with real foods and beverages.

Large aggregations of silver nanoparticles form when dissolved silver is added to a sugary soft drink.



Some sugar compounds which are typical food ingredients can effectively convert silver ions into potentially harmful nanoparticles and could then be ingested by humans. So Timothy Duncan and colleagues wanted to see how the complex ingredients in sugary foods and beverages influenced the formation of these nanoparticles both when directly exposed to dissolved silver and when they are stored inside silver-laced packaging.



To test if dissolved silver aggregates in complex edible mixtures the researchers spiked silver into liquid foods and beverages including naturally and artificially sweetened solutions soda milk juices yogurt and a starch-based slurry.



The mixtures were incubated at 104 F for 10 or more days simulating long-term storage in a packaging material. Nanostructures were detected at two silver concentrations one at the scale expected from polymer-contact leaching and the other at an unrealistically high concentration allowing the team to monitor nanoparticle formation by eye.



Sugary liquids with starches citrates and fats had the most nanoparticles while acidic liquids initially formed silver aggregates that later dissolved. In another experiment the researchers stored water and two sugary liquids in small packets of silver-laced polyethylene polymer at 104 F for 15 days.



There was an initial release of dissolved silver from the polymer surface but only the sugary solutions sustained further leaching and the creation of nanoparticles. The researchers concluded that silver nanoparticle dietary exposure is possible from sweetened foods and beverages packaged in antimicrobial materials under the conditions typical of long-term storage.

Travis Kelce's longtime girlfriend Kayla Nicole reacted on social media after the Kansas City Chiefs' loss to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during Super Bowl LV on Sunday.

With victory out of reach for the Chiefs in the final minutes of the game — which they eventually lost 31-9 — Nicole posted a picture of herself to Instagram with a caption calling out the referees for what she thought was a no-call. In the image she wore a trendy matching bra top and white pants while posing in a box at the Florida stadium.

""Holding: the illegal restraining of another player who is not in possession of the ball"" she wrote. ""Holding is prohibited in most football leagues unless you're playing against Tom Brady.""

Nicole later changed the caption of her photo to read ""go team.""

The model — who runs fitness brand Strong Is Sexy — continued her criticism on Twitter before offering her congratulations to the Buccaneers.

""If yall wanted to see the Chiefs vs the refs just say that"" she wrote.

""Congrats to the @Buccaneers"" she added in a later tweet. ""Tough game to watch but y'all got it.""

If you’re in a hurry click to skip ahead to the 5 Best 5G Stock to Buy Under $10.

5G is the next generation of mobile internet connection. The industry has the ability to pave the way to a more advanced way of living with new kinds of modern-day tech products. “The benefits of the new technology are expected to fuel transformative new technologies not just for consumers but also for businesses infrastructure and defense applications” said CNN. Previously we covered the 10 Best Communication Equipment / 5G Stocks to Buy Now in an article.

As the world of technology expands the need for 5G networks has become inevitable. In an article published by Statitsa by 2024 5G subscriptions worldwide will be around 1.9 billion. In a separate article published on Cision “The global 5G technology market size is anticipated to be at $5.53 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $667.90 Billion by 2026 registering a CAGR of 122.3% from 2021 to 2026.”

Although the industry has not been around for very long it has continuously proven its importance to the economy. Enforced lockdown and social distancing brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has only further emphasized the need for 5G networks. Many across the country relied solely on working remotely to keep their businesses alive and socialize during the pandemic. Ericsson’s Mobility Report showed that there was an up to 90% increase in voice over Wi-Fi calls for some service providers. The report also showed that 83% of their survey respondents claim that ICT helped them cope with the lockdown.

10 Best 5G Stocks to Buy Under $10

The 5G industry seems positive under The Biden Administration. Newly elect Joe Biden has expressed his intent of prioritizing universal broadband for economic recovery. He plans to spend $20 billion in expanding rural broadband infrastructure tripling funding for broadband expansion to rural areas and reforming the Lifeline program which subsidizes internet and phone services for low-income participants. President and CEO of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council said

""There will be significant consensus for infrastructure spending on broadband. Focusing on building out 'the last mile' winning the race to 5G and implementing other needed reforms to get to universal access will be attainable by President-elect Biden if he focuses on strengthening the public-private model. That would be a major accomplishment under his watch.""

The race to the most efficient 5G network heats up. Tech giant Apple (AAPL) recently launched their 5G iPhone and since then they have reported an overall iPhone sales of $66 billion (2020 Q4). CEO Tim Cook commented that it was the largest number they have seen: “we saw the largest number of upgraders than we’ve ever seen in a quarter so we were thrilled about that”.

Voss Capital is the third largest hedge fund holder of EXTR among the 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Travis Cocke said the following about EXTR in his 2020 Q3 investor letter seen by Insider Monkey:

""EXTR provides software driven networking solutions for large enterprise campuses universities hospital systems large outdoor venues like stadiums public mass transit networks and data centers worldwide (i.e. it enables Wi-Fi in extreme situations). It sells wired and wireless network infrastructure equipment as well as software for network management analytics and security. EXTR is remarkably similar to AVID in that it’s trading at depressed multiples (0.75x EV/Sales 1.25x EV/Gross profit and 7x FCF) has moderate leverage (~$215 million net debt) and has been left for dead by the investment community after years of underperformance and operational missteps. However Voss’s variant view is the company has industry leading technology in the Wired and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) industry and a burgeoning subscription and recurring revenue business built off its large customer base (~60000 enterprises globally). This recurring revenue transition was accelerated through the acquisition of Aerohive that occurred 14 months ago (which multiple of our industry contacts have coincidentally called a “game changer”)....Extreme has a market cap of $575 million and an Enterprise Value of $795 million. We believe on a normalized basis the business should generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in revenues (currently valued at 0.7-0.8x sales) 61-62% aggregate gross margin (~1.3x EV/gross profit the third cheapest stock on this basis across the entire North American tech universe) and 15% operating margins. We believe the company will generate over $80 million in FCF over the next twelve months (versus $40 million consensus) and $105 million in unlevered FCF in the next twelve months implying a 7.0-7.5x multiple which is cheap compared with revenue growth in mid to high single digits and gross profit growth potentially into the teens.""

6. Limelight Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:LLNW)

No of HFs: 17

Total Value of HF Holdings: $74.2 Million

LLNW shares currently trade at $4.56. At the end of September a total of 17 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider recently purchased 21550 shares at around $2 in July 2019. The stock is up 50% since then. Recently the company announced a change in their board of directors where Bob Lyons was named the new President and CEO of the company. Walt Amaral Chair of the Limelight Networks Board of Directors said

“We are excited to welcome Bob Lyons as we believe he is uniquely qualified to lead Limelight into its next phase of accelerated growth profitability and innovation.

(Simon Berlyn)

Sylvester Stallone the Oscar-nominated star of the “Rocky” and “Rambo” franchises has officially set the price for his Beverly Park mansion: $110 million.

It spans 3.5 acres in North Beverly Park one of L.A. County’s most exclusive enclaves with celebrity residents including Denzel Washington Magic Johnson Justin Bieber and the late Sumner Redstone whose house neighbors Stallone’s.

The property also enjoys the rarified air of being one of only a handful of homes offered at more than $100 million in Southern California. At $110 million it’s tied with Steve Wynn’s Beverly Hills mansion as the fourth-priciest listing in L.A. County.

The high-profile listing is exclusively held by Rick Hilton Jeff Hyland and the husband-and-wife team Barron N. Hilton and Tessa Hilton of Hilton & Hyland.

Stallone and his wife Jennifer Flavin are swapping the West Coast for the East Coast Rick Hilton said. The listing arrives a few months after the movie star paid $35.38 million for a sprawling compound in Florida’s Palm Beach.

His Beverly Park mansion covers 21000 square feet with eight bedrooms and 12 bathrooms on what Hilton considers the best view lot in the 61-home neighborhood.

“Even the garage has a great view” Barron N. Hilton said.

Stallone updated the home every few years during his ownership adding a Richard Landry-designed guesthouse and touching up the living spaces with steel-framed windows and doors. Originally built as a Mediterranean the house’s upgrades brought a more contemporary feel to many of the living spaces.

The actor saved plenty of room for amenities as well; there’s a movie theater gym and cigar room with an air-filtration system. A life-size Rocky Balboa statue anchors the memorabilia room. The eight-car garage includes an art studio.

Outside the park-like grounds include rolling lawns and a massive patio with an infinity pool and spa which boasts a second Rocky statue at the edge. Balconies and terraces overlook the scenic space from above.

An actor producer director and screenwriter Stallone has been a Hollywood mainstay since the 1970s. He received two Oscar nominations for the 1976 hit “Rocky” and another one for his role in the 2015 spin-off “Creed.” His other credits include “First Blood” “Cobra” and the “Expendables” franchise.

A friendly offer

A few months after buying a smaller place down the coast in Pacific Palisades actor Matthew Perry has sold his oceanfront home in Malibu for $13.1 million.

It’s one of two properties the “Friends” star is trying to jettison. The other — a 9300-square-foot Century City penthouse dubbed a “mansion in the sky” — relisted last summer for $27 million.

Story continues

His Malibu home spans 5500 square feet nearly double the size of the Palisades estate he picked up for $6 million last year. Overlooking the ocean it boasts walls of glass that open to multiple outdoor spaces including wood decks on both levels and a secluded patio with a spa.

Inside dramatic beams hang above an open floor plan with a wood-covered dining room and kitchen. At the center of the space a dual-sided fireplace runs floor to ceiling.

A floating staircase ascends to the top level where the primary bedroom connects to the upper deck. In total there are four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms as well as a movie theater with tiered seating.

Perry 51 has kept busy since his days playing Chandler Bing appearing on the shows “Mr. Sunshine” “The Good Wife” and “The Odd Couple.” In 2017 Perry played Ted Kennedy on the television miniseries “The Kennedys After Camelot.”

Josh Flagg and Bobby Boyd of Rodeo Realty Beverly Hills held the listing. Luis Robledo of Douglas Elliman of California represented the buyer.

‘Idol’ winner chops the price

Grammy-winning singer Kelly Clarkson is tuning in to the Encino market once more relisting her modern farmhouse for $9 million. The “American Idol” winner was originally asking $10 million last summer records show.

A sale would cap a three-year stay for Clarkson who paid $8.5 million for the property right after it was built in 2018.

There’s a farmhouse feel throughout with rustic wood drawing the eye across the exterior. Inside living spaces are bright and open with clean lines and walls of glass. The kitchen is a highlight complete with three islands and a dramatic marble backsplash.

The main home and guesthouse combine for eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms in more than 10000 square feet. Amenities include a movie theater gym billiards room and wine cellar. Topped by high-pitched beamed ceilings the primary suite opens to a private patio and lounge.

Out back the L-shaped residence frames a swimming pool and spa. The half-acre estate also holds an outdoor entertaining area with a lounge fire pit and pizza oven.

Clarkson 38 rose to stardom in 2002 when she won the inaugural season of the singing competition series “American Idol.” Since then she has released eight studio albums including the Grammy-winning records “Breakaway” and “Stronger.”

In 2019 she began hosting a daytime talk show called “The Kelly Clarkson Show” which has won three Daytime Emmy Awards in two seasons.

Chris Corkum and Lisa Brende of Compass hold the listing.

Actor completes home-selling quest

Kevin Sorbo the actor from “Hercules: The Legendary Journeys” made a journey out of his Westlake Village home sale. He just sold the Mediterranean villa for $3.35 million seven years after his initial offering.

The 62-year-old still managed a profit though; records show he bought it for $3.2 million in 2008.

The gated estate sits on 1.5 acres in North Ranch a posh country club community with owners over the years including Lakers star Anthony Davis and billionaire Thomas Tull. In addition to the pink stucco mansion there’s a swimming pool spa pool house gym putting green and multiple lounges that take in the surrounding mountains.

A motor court approaches the three-car garage and double-door entry. Inside massive living spaces include a foyer with a sweeping staircase and a double-height great room with paneled walls and a dramatic fireplace.

Elsewhere are six bedrooms eight bathrooms two offices a formal dining room movie theater and billiards room. Upstairs a terrace overlooks the colorful grounds dotted with fruit trees rose bushes and vegetable gardens.

Sorbo is best known for his roles in “Hercules: The Legendary Journeys” and “Andromeda” both of which ran for more than 100 episodes. More recently he starred in “The O.C.” “God’s Not Dead” and “Let There Be Light.”

Sigi and Pam of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Realty held the listing. Samantha Kirkpatrick of Compass represented the buyer.

Golfer seeks green in Florida

If at first you don’t succeed demolish your house rebuild it even bigger and try again. That’s Greg Norman’s strategy at Jupiter Island Fla.

The Australian golfer who held the top spot in the Official World Golf Ranking for 331 straight weeks in the 1980s and ‘90s first listed his estate for $65 million in 2008. After years of relists and price cuts he removed it from the market and erected a brand-new compound that just surfaced for sale at $59.9 million.

The estate stretches across the length of the island which means it overlooks water on both ends. There’s 370 feet of frontage along the Intracoastal Waterway and 172 feet on the ocean.

Seven houses combine for nearly 32000 square feet across the 8.3-acre spread. The largest is the main house a sleek space with two 1900-bottle wine cellars a movie theater trophy room wraparound bar gallery and elevator. Walls of glass take in views of the water.

The two-story coach house adds two bedrooms and bathrooms and the pool house includes two terraces — one covered and one open. It sidles up to the property’s two pools: a 14-foot pool with a diving board and a smaller plunge pool with a spa.

Measuring 6000 square feet the carriage house features a gym cardio room equipment room and three bedrooms. There’s also a boat house stocked with equipment a newly built beach house overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and a generator house with a dog kennel.

Last is the tennis house which holds a bar and multiple entertaining spaces. It adjoins a full-size tennis court surrounded by hedges. Flat grassy lawns and palm trees distinguish the grounds.

Norman has owned the estate for three decades; records show he paid $4.9 million for it in 1991.

The 65-year-old racked up 20 PGA Tour tournament victories during his time in the sport and won the British Open in 1986 and 1993. In 2001 he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

Jill Hertzberg of Coldwell Banker Realty’s Jills Zeder Group and Michelle Thomson of Coldwell Banker Realty’s Thomson Team hold the listing.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats.

Une partie de ces anticorps ont pu franchir la barrière du placenta pour se mêler au sang des nouveaux-nés leur assurant ainsi une protection.

A la naissance aucun des nourrissons n'a été testé positif à la Covid-19 mais les chercheurs ne savent pas combien de temps cette immunité persistera.

Les femmes enceintes peuvent produire des anticorps contre la Covid-19 et les transmettre à leur enfant sans que l’on n’en sache davantage sur la persistance de cette protection dans le temps. Des chercheurs de l’université de Pennsylvanie (Etats-Unis) ont découvert des anticorps anti SARS-CoV-2 dans le placenta de plusieurs femmes enceintes testées positives à la Covid-19 durant leur grossesse. Les résultats de cette étude ont été publiés dans le Journal of the American Medical Association le 29 janvier 2021.

Avec la pandémie de Covid-19 qui sévit sur la planète depuis plus d’un an maintenant la communauté scientifique internationale cherche à mieux comprendre les effets du coronavirus sur les personnes contaminées et les femmes enceintes sont un cas intrigant. Plusieurs recherches suggèrent qu'elles sont plus exposées au risque de développer des symptômes graves que la population générale. Toutefois la partie la plus préoccupante concerne le devenir des enfants tant pendant la grossesse qu’après l’accouchement.

Une immunité à la portée encore inconnue

Afin de mieux comprendre la situation les chercheurs ont examiné les placentas de 1 470 femmes infectées par le SARS-CoV-2. L'équipe a recherché à la fois la présence du virus et les anticorps qui apparaissent dans le cadre d'une réponse immunitaire et ont trouvé des anticorps contre le SARS-CoV-2 dans 83 placentas. Ainsi il est probable que les anticorps se soient rendus jusqu'aux bébés leur donnant ainsi une protection contre le virus.

Etrangement le nombre d'anticorps trouvés dans le placenta reflétait le niveau de contamination de la mère et le moment où elle a été infectée. Pour preuve il a été trouvé davantage d'anticorps dans les placentas de femmes qui avaient été infectées au début de leur grossesse que dans celles qui avaient contracté le virus en fin de gestation. Pour l’heure il reste cependant impossible de savoir quel est le niveau de protection que ces anticorps assurent au bébé ni pendant combien de temps ils arrivent à persister chez le nourrisson.

Dans leur étude les chercheurs ont découvert que seuls les anticorps de l'immunoglobuline G étaient capables de se frayer un chemin dans le sang du cordon ombilical. Ils ont noté qu'aucun des bébés de leur étude n'a été testé positif à la Covid-19 ce qui est un bon signe mais pas assez pour affirmer que les bébés ne peuvent pas être infectés alors qu'ils sont encore dans l'utérus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91ZXN0LWZyYW5jZS5mci9wYXlzLWRlLWxhLWxvaXJlL3NhdXRyb24tNDQ4ODAvcG9sYXItYW5uZS1zYXJhLW5vdXMtcGxvbmdlLWVuLXBsZWluZS1tYW5pcHVsYXRpb24tNzE0NjEwMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Polar.

Erik ten Hag hit back at comments made by Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese coach said he never had the same level of support as the Dutchman enjoys at Manchester United.

Mourinho suggested that Ten Hag has been given more backing in the transfer market than he had during his 2½ years at Old Trafford.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga Bundesliga more (U.S.)

However Ten Hag hit back by claiming that Mourinho is the only manager in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era to ""get the players they wanted.""

""Apart from Mourinho the manager didn't get the players they wanted and that is what you need"" Ten Hag said in an interview with ESPN Brasil.

""I am confident we will achieve our goals but it is a tough competition. It is not a two-horse race anymore.

""There are seven eight [teams in the Premier League] who all go for the title who all have very good squads. So if you want to go to the title you have to construct that squad.""

Ten Hag 54 is facing an uncertain future at United following a disappointing second season in charge. He has a year left on his contract but he has been given no formal guarantees by new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he will continue as manager beyond the summer.

The former Ajax boss has tried to bring in the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Harry Kane in the past but said the club's decision to bring in younger players such as Rasmus Højlund means that he should be afforded patience to get things right.

""You need outstanding players"" Ten Hag said. ""Otherwise you are in a process and you have to be patient. That is where we are now. We went for players who have high potentials and we have to develop them as individuals and as a team. But you need patience with the process.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vMTN3aGFtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2Nhci1jcmFzaGVzLWludG8tdHJlZS1hdC10aGUtb2FrLWhpbGwtY291bnRyeS1jbHVi0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly8xM3doYW0uY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2Nhci1jcmFzaGVzLWludG8tdHJlZS1hdC10aGUtb2FrLWhpbGwtY291bnRyeS1jbHVi?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two killed in crash at Oak Hill Country Club,"Pittsford N.Y. — Police are investigating a fatal crash that happened Sunday night at Oak Hill Country Club.

The week which usually takes place in the last week of the calendar year saw this year a variety of apps dedicated to employee safety and collaboration in the era of Covid-19.

The first app Table 41 was developed by one of its 150 employees to help book and reserve social-distanced desks in the office. Described as the ‘WeWork’ of hotdesking the service allows people to check up on the availability of office chairs and make sure they reserve space that is safely at a distance from other employees. The second app WorkSpot pegged as the ‘Airbnb’ of workspaces helps employees organize outdoor spaces as remote office locations such as parks beaches or forests.

Tom Winter Autodesk TLV’s Site Manager credits the company’s ‘startup environment’ to being the backbone of a larger and more stable organization. Autodesk which was founded in 1982 is a Fortune 500 company with 12000 employees across three major industries: multimedia manufacturing and construction. “Today when you attract talent they’re not just looking for technology and they’re not just looking for nice offices and what you have in the kitchen” he told CTech. “It’s more about what culture you build.”

In total 2020’s ‘Bazinga’ Hackathon had 27 projects and 22 teams that worked on anything they wanted. On top of the annual event Autodesk also dedicates one day each month to personal development. Employees can choose if they want to learn something new or keep on working on projects. “If they have a passion to pursue a project not necessarily related to writing code right now so if they want to meet-up or give to the community… They have passions to learn and we give them tools whether it’s public speaking or how to deliver messages and storytelling.”

According to Winter Autodesk TLV focuses on the soft skills and the professional skills of each employee to help them foster creativity and innovation.

The death of Floyd a Black man killed by a white police officer in May 2020 prompted thousands to peacefully protest across the city. But violence soon erupted which police say began with a masked man seen in a viral video with an umbrella and smashing windows of an auto-parts store in south Minneapolis. The AutoZone store was the first among dozens of buildings across the city set on fire in the days following.

The search warrant compelled Google to provide police with the account data on anyone who was “within the geographical region” of the AutoZone store when the violence began on May 27 two days after Floyd’s death.

These so-called geofence warrants — or reverse-location warrants — are frequently directed at Google in large part because the search and advertising giant collects and stores vast databases of geolocation data on billions of account holders who have “location history” turned on. Geofence warrants allow police to cast a digital dragnet over a crime scene and ask tech companies for records on anyone who entered a geographic area at a particular time. But critics say these warrants are unconstitutional as they also gather the account information on innocent passers-by.

TechCrunch learned of the search warrant from Minneapolis resident Said Abdullahi who received an email from Google stating that his account information was subject to the warrant and would be given to the police.

But Abdullahi said he had no part in the violence and was only in the area to video the protests when the violence began at the AutoZone store.

The warrant said police sought “anonymized” account data from Google on any phone or device that was close to the AutoZone store and the parking lot between 5:20pm and 5:40pm (CST) on May 27 where dozens of the people in the area had gathered.

When reached Minneapolis police spokesperson John Elder citing an ongoing investigation would not answer specific questions about the warrant including for what reason the warrant was issued.

According to a police affidavit police said the protests had been relatively peaceful until the afternoon of May 27 when a masked umbrella-wielding man began smashing the windows of the AutoZone store located across the street from a Minneapolis police precinct where hundreds of protesters had gathered. Several videos show protesters confronting the masked man.

Police said they spent significant resources on trying to identify the so-called “Umbrella Man” who they say was the catalyst for widespread violence across the city.

“This was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the city” the affidavit read. At least two people were killed in the unrest. (Erika Christensen a Minneapolis police investigator who filed the affidavit was not made available for an interview.)

Police accuse the Umbrella Man of creating an “atmosphere of hostility and tension” whose sole aim was to “incite violence.” (TechCrunch is not linking to the affidavit as the police would not say if the suspect had been charged with a crime.) The affidavit also links the suspect to a white supremacist group called the Aryan Cowboys and to an incident weeks later where a Muslim woman was harassed.

Multiple videos of the protests around the time listed on the warrant appear to line up with the window-smashing incident. Other videos of the scene at the time of the warrant show hundreds of other people in the vicinity. Police were positioned on rooftops and used tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowds.

Law enforcement across the U.S. are increasingly relying on geofence warrants to solve crimes where a suspect is not known. Police have defended the use of these warrants because they can help identify potential suspects who entered a certain geographic region where a crime was committed. The warrants typically ask for “anonymized information” but allow police to go back and narrow their requests on potential suspects of interest.

When allowed by law Google notifies account holders of when law enforcement demands access to the user’s data. According to a court filing in 2019 Google said the number of geofence warrants it received went up by 1500% between 2017 and 2018 and more than 500% between 2018 and 2019 but has yet to provide a specific number of warrants

Google reportedly received over 180 geofence warrants in a single week in 2019. When asked about more recent figures a Google spokesperson declined to comment on the record.

Civil liberties groups have criticized the use of dragnet search warrants. The American Civil Liberties Union said that geofence warrants “circumvent constitutional checks on police surveillance.” One district court in Virginia said geofence warrants violated the constitution because the majority of individuals whose data is collected will have “nothing whatsoever” to do with the crimes under investigation.

Reports in the past year have implicated people whose only connection to a crime is simply being nearby.

NBC News reported the case of one Gainesville Fla. resident who was told by Google that his account information would be given to police investigating a burglary. But the resident was able to prove that he had no connection to the burglary thanks to an app on his phone that tracked his activity.

In 2019 Google gave federal agents investigating several arson attacks in Milwaukee Wis. close to 1500 user records in response to geofence warrant thought to be one of the largest grabs of account data to date.

But lawmakers are beginning to push back. New York state lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would if passed ban geofence warrants across the state citing the risk of police targeting protesters. Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) grilled Google chief executive Sundar Pichai at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing last year. “People would be terrified to know that law enforcement could grab general warrants and get everyone’s information everywhere” said Armstrong.

Abdullahi told TechCrunch that he had several videos documenting the protests on the day and that he has retained a lawyer to try to prevent Google from giving his account information to Minneapolis police.

“Police assumed everybody in that area that day is guilty” he said. “If one person did something criminal [the police] should not go after the whole block of people” he said.

The story has been updated.

Boulder County space exploration industry is poised to take off. With large corporations that are involved in NASA’s Moon to Mars plan and expanding home-grown businesses in the region the industry saw significant growth last year and isn’t ready to slow down.

Major contractors including Sierra Nevada Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp. have increased their presence in Boulder County. Locally born companies Blue Canyon Technologies in Lafayette and Boulder and Longmont’s Roccor are also expanding after being acquired last year. As job creation continues. Colorado’s talent pipeline is supported by the University of Colorado Boulder.

Aerospace companies respond to U.S. visions

All forms of aerospace companies whether big or small or conducting civil or defense activity work towards national goals said Vicky Lea director aerospace and aviation at the Metro Denver Economic Development Corp.

“You have kind of a national vision a national space-exploration vision and then that obviously drives companies a commercial response to provide the products and the technologies that are going to be needed to fulfill that mission” Lea said.

The NASA Artemis program a goal to return to the moon with the first woman to land on its surface by 2024 has an estimated economic impact of $2.6 billion on the state Lea said more than half of the entire space industry’s $4.5 billion economic impact on Colorado.

Lockheed Martin is the lead contractor for the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis program. On Jan. 14 Lockheed Martin transferred the Orion spacecraft to NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems for the first flight of the program Artemis I. The flight is slated for November and will orbit the moon and return to Earth without a crew.

The design work in Colorado mostly happens at the Waterton Canyon facility in Jefferson County while assembly is completed at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida said Colorado-based Joe Rice director of government relations at Lockheed Martin Space.

Part of Lockheed Martin’s operations in Boulder County — Boulder and Longmont — includes cyber security and artificial intelligence. The company’s WindTracer a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) wind and aerosol measurement technology that can inform air traffic controllers of wind hazards is based out of its Louisville facility.

“WindTracer is used around the world to improve aviation safety and airport departure and arrival efficiency in addition to wind resources and meteorological research” Rice said in an email.

Lockheed Martin Space has more than 600 employees in Boulder County and 9400 total for the state. Last year the company experienced a 6% growth and is recruiting for around 650 positions in Colorado.

Lockheed’s Orion will ultimately carry astronauts to orbit and a human landing system will carry them to the surface. Sierra Nevada is bidding for that contract to build the human landing system that will land the first woman and second man on the moon for the Artemis III flight. It would be a subcontractor to Alabama-based Dynetics Inc. a subsidiary of Leidos Holdings Inc. to astronauts and cargo to and from the moon’s surface. Dynetics and Sierra Nevada are up against SpaceX and Blue Origin.

In Louisville Sierra Nevada is building the Dream Chaser Space Plane a commercial vehicle capable of landing on a runway. Dream Chaser has a contract with NASA to fly six cargo missions to the International Space Station by 2024 but Janet L. Kavandi veteran NASA astronaut and executive vice president in the Sierra Nevada’s Space Systems Group based in Louisville said the ultimate goal is to transport people.

Sierra Nevada is proposing its Large Inflatable Fabric Environment as part of NASA’s modular Gateway orbiting the moon which will replace the aging International Space Station. The habitat will be large enough to accommodate living amenities and a hydroponic garden for astronauts to grow fresh food said Kavandi.

She added that the industry is entering a new era of space exploration where commercial companies can build off of NASA’s discoveries.

“What the new era of space is about is commercializing now. Now that NASA sort of paved the way with exploration and we pretty much got down the science living in low-Earth orbit(LEO) that’s why we can build the space station … put that in low-Earth orbit by commercial companies and then that sort of frees up NASA to then do the harder things again” Kavandi said such as achieving human habitation on the surface of the moon and later applying that research to exploring Mars.

Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. a subsidiary of Ball Corp. that has operated in Boulder since 1956 wants to add a 375000-square-foot expansion at its Boulder campus at 1600 Commerce St. It submitted preliminary plans to Boulder to extend its planned unit development agreement that is set to expire in August and to build three non-manufacturing buildings along with a parking garage and a sky bridge over Commerce Street. In addition “numerous” large spacecraft clean rooms would be included in the expansion according to planning documents BizWest reported.

Ball is seeking to build the buildings up to 55 feet and increase the floor-to-area ratio past what is currently allowed according to planning documents. In planning documents Ball wrote that its ability to expand on the Boulder Campus is to increase aerospace production and testing capabilities and will “help determine the future of Ball Aerospace in Boulder.”

“Ball Aerospace a leading developer of spacecraft instruments sensors and advanced data solutions has a long and robust relationship with Boulder that spans nearly 65 years. As our business has grown so has our community footprint. Beginning in 1969 as a 319-square-foot manufacturing facility in 2014 we expanded the Ball Fisher Manufacturing Complex by an additional 82000 square feet to create a modern production complex” a Ball spokeswoman said in an email as previously reported by BizWest. “Ball continues to expand in both the number of programs and employees recently hiring an additional 1000 new local team members.

“In order to maintain our ability to continue growing our presence in Boulder in a way that aligns with the community’s unique history culture and strong commitment to sustainability we are renewing Ball’s existing Planned Unit Development with the Boulder County Planning Division” the spokeswoman continued. The updated PUD will ensure that the business maintains options for expansion which is essential to support continued growth additional hiring and program execution.”

BizWest reported that a traffic-assessment by Civtrans Engineering Inc. for Ball estimates that the current 841 employees at the Boulder Campus would grow to 1932 by the end of buildout in 2034.

It is unclear how the company will proceed if it can’t build the large expansion that it’s proposing. Ball submitted its concept plan on Jan. 25 and should receive comments back from city planners on Friday. The Boulder Development Review Committee could be reviewed mid-February according to reporting by BizWest.

Small companies make large contributions to commercial space

While Colorado and Boulder County have operations from large aerospace corporations Sierra Nevada and Lockheed Martin smaller businesses make up most of the state’s profile. According to 2019 data from the Metro Denver EDC 60% of the 280 direct aerospace companies in 2019 employ fewer than 10 people. Colorado now has about 290 companies in the sector Lea said.

“Colorado has always sort of been a major aerospace state based on its military roots. That means that that attracts prime contractors. Prime contractors you know then attract sort of more employment growth” Lea said. “And then you’ve got here in Colorado this kind of exceptional combination of those big prime aerospace and defense contractors but also with a really robust segment of smaller aerospace companies that really kind of reflect that kind of more entrepreneurial innovation component that Colorado does so well.”

Lea said that successful companies in Colorado are being acquired and becoming stronger. Two Boulder County-grown businesses doing just that are Roccor and Blue Canyon.

Blue Canyon a Lafayette small-satellite and spacecraft company was acquired by Raytheon Technologies Corp. in December. Blue Canyon reports to the Raytheon Intelligence and Space business unit adding small-satellite technologies and mission services to the parent company’s space portfolio.

Blue Canyon is a vertically integrated small-satellite company said George Stafford co-founder and CEO meaning that it controls its supply chain. He said Blue Canyon tries to lower the barrier of entry to space for any customer.

“The acquisition will ultimately allow Raytheon to deliver more robust mission capabilities to customers. The great part of the acquisition is that Blue Canyon continues to operate as the same vertically integrated and consumer-focused company that we have always been — just now as a part of Raytheon Technologies” Stafford said in a prepared statement.

Blue Canyon doubled its staff last year to 300 between its Boulder and Lafayette facilities and is still hiring he said. It opened up the Crescent Satellite Constellation Factory the 80000-square-foot facility in Lafayette in June. Stafford said that the new factory can hold up to 275 workers at full operation and build about 200 satellites a year between it and the Boulder location.

Roccor LLC a Longmont-based aerospace technology and small-satellite maker was acquired by Redwire LLC in November. Redwire was formed that summer by private equity firm AE Industrial Partners LP. Roccor kept its headquarters in Longmont with plans to grow its staff from about 80 to more than 100 by early 2021 BizWest previously reported.

“Through the acquisition of Roccor Redwire adds deployable booms structures antennas thermal products and solar arrays that have a proven performance record with over 75 successfully launched systems in orbit today with additional systems planned to launch next year” Redwire spokesperson Austin Jordan wrote in an email.

Redwire and Roccor won a subcontract to develop a deployable structure for NASA’s Solar Cruiser mission the companies announced Tuesday. Roccor’s deployable structure is for a solar sail that will allow researchers to view the sun from different perspectives.

The talent pipeline

While several sectors continue to face economic difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic Colorado’s aerospace industry upped its workforce in 2020. Total direct employment for state aerospace companies totaled 33110 a 10% growth between 2019 and 2020 Lea said.

Though California still beats Colorado in total aerospace employment Colorado is leading in workers per capita. Lea said that the national average of private-sector aerospace employment to its population is 0.2%. Colorado is 1.1%.

While companies are attracting workers CU Boulder is producing new talent.

“Another reason why we have such a robust aerospace industry cluster here and why companies want to continue to locate here and expand here it is partly because we have such a robust talent pipeline from education institutions like CU Boulder which is a leader in aerospace research and development” Lea said.

CU Boulder’s Ann & H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences of the

College of Engineering and Applied Science annually graduates about 10 Ph.D students 50 master of science students and 200 bachelor of science students in aerospace engineering sciences said Mark Meaney scholar in residence with the Division of Social Responsibility and Sustainability at CU Leeds School of Business.

Meaney is the principal instigator for the Space Sustainability Initiative a program between the Leeds School of Business and Smead. On Jan. 25 CU Boulder and the Secure World Foundation announced a memorandum of understanding to launch the initiative.

With the aerospace sector positioned for growth orbital debris surrounding Earth from every launch could also increase. SSI was created to ensure the commercialization of space proceeds with sustainability in mind.

The initiative is backed by an external advisory board with representatives from NASA Ball Aerospace Lockheed Martin and more.

The first phase of the initiative would calculate the orbital debris within low-Earth orbit and then develop a commercial space market analysis. A guide for business models based on that commercial space market analysis would then inform space entrepreneurs entering the sector. Meaney said that it will help companies understand their potential contribution to existing orbital debris.

Ultimately a set of norms of behavior for business activity would be voluntarily adopted by commercial companies.

“Our interest is economic but the economic as it relates to sustainability” Meaney said. “If everyone does what they want to do in space then no one will be able to do what they want to do in space because it’s a common pool resource. And if we don’t coordinate our activity we will degrade that resource. And so we will prevent economic growth within the commercial space industry.”

Meaney said that space exploration will have a positive impact on economic activity. But to ensure this aerospace industry launch keeps growing the sector will need to be sustainable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvYXBvbGxvLTE0LWFzdHJvbmF1dHMtbG9zdC1nb2xmLTIzNDUzMDY40gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtbmV3cy9hcG9sbG8tMTQtYXN0cm9uYXV0cy1sb3N0LWdvbGYtMjM0NTMwNjguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apollo 14 astronaut’s ‘lost’ golf ball found on moon 50 years later,"Astronaut Alan Shepard famously took a golf swing with makeshift iron and balls during his 1971 Apollo 14 Mission and claimed his golf balls had travelled 'miles and miles'

A golf ball which an astronaut had claimed was 'lost' on the moon after a massive golf swing has been found 50 years later.

Astronaut Alan Shepard famously took a golf swing with makeshift iron and balls during his 1971 Apollo 14 Mission.

Hitting two balls he originally claimed one had gone into a crater and the other had travelled 'miles and miles'.

But newly restored images have revealed that he may not have been as successful as he first thought.

Image specialist Andy Saunders managed to enhance high-resolution scans of the footage from the original mission using a 'stacking technique' including smaller 16mm footage shot by the crew.

This showed that the first ball had actually only travelled 24 yards from Shepard while the second flew just 40 yards.

Yet despite the new revelations Saunders said it was still a significant achievement that Shepard was able to hit the ball while on the moon.

The restored images are set to feature in Saunders' upcoming book 'Apollo Remastered'.",,,,,,
BAC,Bank of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS11bmRlci1maXJlLWZvci1oZWxwaW5nLWZlZHMtaW4tY2FwaXRvbC1yaW90LXByb2JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Security experts blast Bank of America for helping feds in Capitol riot probe,"Security experts — including the NYPD’s former top cop — ripped Bank of America for reportedly handing over customer data to the feds probing the Capitol riots warning Saturday of a “fishing expedition” that was chilling in its overreach.

The bank handed over financial data 211 of its clients who happened to use credit and debit cards for lodging food and other purchases in Washington in the days before and after the Jan. 6 siege Fox News’ Tucker Carlson reported.

“That’s just not a good reason to hand over private information. If that’s the way they do business now then the people of this country really have something to worry about” said Bernard Kerik a security consultant who headed the NYPD in 2000 and 2001.

Kerik said that during his time with the NYPD the department did seek information about suspects from financial institutions in particular during terror probes.

The distinction he noted was that the department always had a specific suspect in mind when it sought the data said Kerik who tweeted “Move over Russia China and Venezuela” when the news broke.

“I am sure there were people who had nothing to do with the Capitol riots and were profiled as well just because they went to the ATM in Washington” Kerik told The Post.

Only one person among the 211 who had their information snooped has been interviewed by the feds and none have been arrested according to Fox.

Former NYPD sergeant Joseph Giacalone likened the fed probe to a “fishing expedition” in the absence of a subpoena or specific targets.

Giacalone too said he sought information from banks in homicide cases — but only after a suspect was targeted.

“If it was an emergency we had a ‘riding DA’ on call who could write up a subpoena on the spot” said Giacalone adding that banking and credit card information could determine the accuracy of a suspect’s alibi.

“For instance a person was murdered and their ATM or credit card was used there may be surveillance video of them individual using it” he said.

The FBI did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment and Bank of America refused to say whether they were complying with a federal subpoena.

“We don’t comment on our communications with law enforcement” said spokesman William Halldin repeating an earlier statement by the country’s second largest bank which is now facing growing calls for a boycott.

He added: “All banks have responsibilities under federal law to cooperate with law enforcement inquiries in full compliance with the law.”

Under the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act financial institutions must cooperate with law enforcement in money laundering terrorism cases “and other criminal acts.”

While not bound by that law companies such as Apple and Google have refused to cooperate with the feds in the past.

In 2016 Apple refused to help the FBI unlock a phone that belonged to a suspected terrorist.

“At stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people and setting dangerous precedent that threatens everyone’s civil liberties” Apple CEO Tim Cook said when he refused to help unlock an iPhone used by Syed Farook one of two shooters in the 2015 San Bernardino attack which killed 14 people and injured 22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvaG93LWVkZC1hbmQtYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLW1ha2UtbWlsbGlvbnMtb24tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlkZW1vY3JhdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9ob3ctZWRkLWFuZC1iYW5rLW9mLWFtZXJpY2EtbWFrZS1taWxsaW9ucy1vbi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXVuZW1wbG95bWVudC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How EDD and Bank of America make millions on California unemployment,"She didn’t know it at the time but last September was when everything started to unravel for Julie Hansen. It was late in the month when the furloughed Disneyland candy maker noticed a string of suspicious charges totaling $12222.23 on her state-issued Bank of America unemployment debit card. First the money was credited back to her account. Then it disappeared again setting in motion a chain of events that left her and her son homeless.

Behind the scenes California’s Employment Development Department and longtime debit card contractor Bank of America were scrambling to rein in rampant fraud. They froze some 350000 unemployment accounts around the time Hansen’s card was cut off.

The catch: while Hansen and other out-of-work Californians were left in financial purgatory unable to access unemployment money a Great Recession-era contract ensured that the state and the bank kept raking in millions of dollars in merchant fees whenever debit cards still in circulation were swiped. In September the EDD made $5.2 million on a debit card revenue sharing agreement with Bank of America — a sizable chunk of the $22.5 million the state raked in from March to October according to public records requested by CalMatters.

How much money did Bank of America make on its end of the deal? The state says it doesn’t know and the bank won’t say despite a contract requirement to report unemployment debit card fees and revenue each month. “EDD does not track BofA’s revenue” the agency told CalMatters. The bank declined to comment on its unemployment revenue and financial reporting.

“This is essentially a nifty little hidden kickback scheme” said Assemblymember Jim Patterson a Republican from Fresno. “This is becoming far too familiar. EDD just does not tell us what’s going on.”

Basic questions unanswered

In recent weeks California lawmakers rushing to introduce new unemployment reform bills have struggled to get basic questions answered about when and how jobless workers are paid — and who profits in the process.

Under Bank of America’s exclusive 2010 unemployment debit card contract with the state which was first detailed by CalMatters the Employment Development Department does not pay the bank directly for its financial services. Instead the two parties split revenue on merchant transaction fees when the cards are swiped and the bank charges limited consumer fees for things like ATM use or rush shipping on new debit cards. The contract specifies only that the state’s share of the fee revenue will “assist in offsetting program costs.”

The bank was supposed to report at least monthly on any fees earned and its average revenue according to the contract provided by the state. But when CalMatters asked for those reports the state said it did not have any records on bank fees. The agency said only that Bank of America made $37.8 million in transaction fees during 2013 — a figure disclosed as part of a bond estimate in a year when California paid out a sliver of the record $111 billion in unemployment benefits from March to December last year.

“I’m stunned that EDD doesn’t know” Patterson said “and I’m not sure that I believe that they don’t know.”

Bank of America said it suspended some consumer fees including rush shipping charges in the spring. The bank declined to comment on transaction fees. Faiz Ahmad managing director of transaction services for Bank of America told lawmakers last week that despite any money the bank may have made during the pandemic it “lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the contract” last year due to fraud and a need to hire more customer service workers to respond to complaints.

“Bank of America’s contract with EDD belongs to California’s taxpayers” said Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo a Democrat from Los Angeles. “Its contents are not secret. They belong to the public record.”

Lauren Saunders associate director of the National Consumer Law Center has studied unemployment debit card contracts including the one Bank of America has in California. She found that many states are “not paying any attention” to fees earned by banks — a lack of transparency that makes it hard to know how much unemployed workers are paying to use their benefit money — but that California’s revenue sharing agreement appears to be unique.

“Banks have to make money. They are selling a product” Saunders said. “What’s more unusual is the state making money. That’s because California is such a big market and there was so much interchange revenue that the bank was willing to share some with the state but that money should go back into making sure that people aren’t paying fees and to making sure that people get the money where they want to get it.”

A long fight

As fall turned to winter Hansen tried everything she could think of to get her missing unemployment money back. She spent hours on hold with the bank then called the state when she was told it was an identity verification issue. After waiting hours longer to get through to the state agency and often hung up on in the process she was told that she needed to call the bank. She called politicians and posted online and briefly saw the account reopened just long enough for another $672 to post to the account only to have the card frozen again.

By December it was too late. Hansen and her son slept in her Fiat or stayed with friends after they were forced to leave their two-bedroom rental in the Inland Empire to avoid eviction proceedings. There were no Christmas presents that month.

“Nobody helps. They blame it on each other” Hansen said. “I don’t know if they’re trying to make it to where I just don’t fight anymore but that’s $13000.”

Stories like Hansen’s where both the state and the bank have added to confusion make the prospect of unraveling California’s unemployment crisis more daunting. In Sacramento both Democrats and Republicans have proposed legislation to add a direct deposit option for claimants crack down on fraud and strengthen oversight. Bank of America’s current contract ends this summer.

In addition to refunding legitimate unemployment claimants caught up in the mess Patterson worries about tax bills and unsuspecting people asked to repay the government for benefits paid out to fraudsters. He said lawmakers are weighing requirements for the agency to act fast.

Meanwhile unemployment claimants accused Bank of America in a class-action lawsuit filed last month of putting them at risk of debit card fraud. The bank argues that the “vast majority” of fraud during the pandemic involved fraudulent unemployment applications that the state failed to catch rather than debit card fraud. While lawmakers and the state auditor press for more details on up to $31 billion in total fraud Saunders said it’s also possible that federal watchdogs like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could get involved if the bank fails to provide claim documentation or timely credits for fraud as required by law.

“If they’re found not to have complied” Saunders said “then the bank would be responsible to reimburse the consumers.”

When you've misplaced your favorite credit card what do you do? Everyone who uses credit cards has likely had this happen at least once. You could retrace your steps with the hope of finding the missing card at the last restaurant you ate at or perhaps in the pocket of the pants you wore yesterday.

The safe bet though is to contact the card issuer and report it missing. However this will permanently invalidate the lost card and you'll have to wait until you receive a replacement. This can be troublesome especially if you have high hopes that the card will turn up in a few days.

Fortunately though there is a better option. Many major credit card issuers allow you to temporarily disable a particular card and reactivate it later. As you'll see it has lots of potential uses even beyond a misplaced card.

Major card issuers that offer a pause button

Here's a look at which issuers offer this option.

American Express Freeze Your Card

American Express's Free Your Card option prevents your card from being used for new purchases but allows payment of recurring bills on the account. You can also continue to use for digital wallet transactions like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. However your card will automatically be unfrozen in seven days. Both primary and authorized card holders can use this feature. Amex also makes it extremely easy to freeze and unfreeze your card right in the Amex app.

Bank of America Lock/Unlock

Although Bank of America makes it incredibly easy to lock and unlock your card this feature is only available to Bank of America debit card holders.

Barclays SecurHold™

Barclays allows you to instantly lock and unlock your card from its mobile app. And to go one step further they offer a Control Your Card feature which allows you to set transaction limits and even block certain purchases for yourself or authorized users. This is a great feature since Barclays is one of the few card issuers that gives authorized users unique card numbers. The Barclays app can also notify you of each transaction in real time which can be great for monitoring spending and catching fraudulent purchases as soon as they happen.

Capital One Card Lock

Capital One's Card Lock feature allows you to easily lock and unlock your card straight from the mobile app. It blocks all in-store online in-app and phone purchases for cards. However you can continue to return items make payments and redeem rewards while your card is locked.

Chase Lock and Unlock

This feature allows Chase card holders to lock and unlock their credit card from the Chase Mobile app or on their computer. Locking the card doesn't affect automatic payments so there are no disruptions to recurring charges. You also can still use your digit wallet to make purchases. However when you lock your card it will lock any other cards that share the same account number.

Citi Quick Lock

Citi allows card holders to lock and unlock their credit card online or from its mobile app. Even when your card is locked recurring transactions will still hit your credit card without any disruption.

Discover Freeze it®

Discover was one of the first card issuers to offer a card freeze feature which can be activated online or through its mobile app. Even though Discover will not authorize new purchases cash advances or balance transfers while your account is on hold recurring payments returns dispute adjustments and delayed authorized will still post to your account.

US Bank Lock and Unlock

A relatively new feature to US Bank is that they now offer the capability to lock and unlock your card. The easiest way to do this with US Bank is from their mobile app.

Wells Fargo Control Tower

Wells Fargo Control Tower allows you to turn your cards on and off as well as restrict international use. It will also allow you to view digital wallets and turn digital card numbers stored in your devices on or off. Recurring payments may still be approved or processed even if you turn your card off.

When to use your credit card's pause button

Aside from misplacing your credit card there are many other situations where a pause button can come in handy.

To control spending: Credit cards are so convenient to use that some people overspend. By pressing pause on your credit card it could help you control any impulse purchases. This extra step might also make you think twice on whether or not you actually need to make that particular purchase.

Put your cards in safe mode: If you have cards that you don't use often or you only use for recurring monthly payments then you might want to pause them to prevent unauthorized use. This is an extra measure of security for those cards especially if you don't look at these accounts often enough to pick up on fraudulent charges.

Controlling the use of authorized card holders: Pressing pause can be a good way to prevent an authorized card holder from using his or her card. Just keep in mind that not all card issuers will freeze authorized cards holders when you freeze the primary card members' account.

Bottom line

It's great that most major card issuers now offer the option of temporarily pausing your credit card. Best of all this feature is completely free and typically there is no limit on the number of times you lock or unlock your account.

Of course if it becomes apparent that your card is never to be found again you'll want to call the card issuer to let them know. They'll then send you a new card but unfortunately it will come with a different card number.

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

Two of the murderer’s 16-year-old friends who were also carrying zombie knives were detained for nine years and nine years and six months after being found guilty of the manslaughter of Mikey Roynon 16.

During his sentencing remarks Mr Justice Saini said the killing was an example of the “plague of knife crime” that was blighting Bristol and surrounding areas. He said: “The lives of young boys who carry knives continue to be taken at the hands of other boys who carry knives.”

He said Mikey from Kingswood South Gloucestershire was still a child but had a “bright musical career ahead of him”.

Mikey’s mother Hayley Ryall said: “Every morning I wake up and it hurts as much as the last morning. I keep having awful dreams that Mikey is lost and I’m looking for him but even the awful dreams are better than waking up to reality. At least in my dreams he is somewhere whereas in reality he is gone.”

She described how difficult she found what would have been Mikey’s 17th birthday in November without him and spoke of her sadness that she would never be called “mum” again. She said: “I feel like I’m living in a film or a nightmare and soon I’ll wake up and I’ll be able to hug and kiss him and Mikey will say ‘It’s OK Mum.’”

The judge lifted an order banning identification of the killers. The boy convicted of murdering Mikey is Shane Cunningham who will serve 16 years before being considered for parole. The two boys convicted of manslaughter are Cartel Bushnell and Leo Knight.

A jury at Bristol crown court rejected the claims of the boys who are from the Wiltshire market town of Devizes that they were acting in self-defence.

They travelled to Bath by bus in June last year for an open-invitation birthday party. They were each armed with zombie knives hidden beneath their clothes. One other member of the party took a knife. The judge said: “You took a total of four big knives to what was supposed to be a fun occasion. How you each got hold of these horrendous and unlawful weapons and why you took them to the party will never be known.”

The three did not know Mikey. He arrived at the party with friends from Bristol. He had a reputation as a rapper and his appearance at the party went down well and some of his songs were played.

There were about 70 young people at the party. The judge said he was sure Mikey also had a knife. The judge said: “Something happened in the garden which led to the violence. A number of the Bristol boys began drawing knives.”

Cartel and Leo took their knives out ready to fight. The judge said: “Mikey drew a knife and struck towards Cartel. Shane stabbed Mikey in the neck. The knife passed through his neck and severed a major artery.”

DI Mark Newbury the senior investigating officer said: “Knife crime is a disease which leaves a horrifying and long-lasting mark on everyone it affects. It’s a national problem which isn’t limited to specific towns or cities and we must come together as a society to tackle it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzM4NjQwNy9GV0FXLWZhbnMtc2xhbS1jcmluZ2UtYmF0aC1kYXRlLUZhcm1lci1Kb2UtQ2xhaXJlLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTMzODY0MDcvYW1wL0ZXQVctZmFucy1zbGFtLWNyaW5nZS1iYXRoLWRhdGUtRmFybWVyLUpvZS1DbGFpcmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farmer Wants A Wife fans slam 'cringe' bath date between Farmer Joe and Claire: 'It felt awkward watching it!',"Farmer Wants A Wife fans were left 'cringing' on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

You’ve probably seen athletes or other fitness trendsetters on social media taking an ice bath or tried one yourself to reap the benefits of the potential health benefits including faster recovery increased metabolism and reduced stress.

“People want to try (an ice bath) usually for three reasons: the physical benefits the mental benefits or because it’s trendy and they want to know what the hype is about” says Alex Corbett a physical therapist with BreakThrough Physical Therapy with locations throughout North Carolina.

But is that bone-chilling dip worth the purported benefits?



Key Takeaways:

Ice baths also called cold water immersion involve plunging part or most of your body into cold icy water.

Studies have shown that ice baths have the potential to increase fat loss reduce inflammation improve mood and speed recovery.

Cold water immersion isn’t for everybody and it is possible to experience frostbite or hypothermia if your water is too cold or you stay in for too long.

What Is an Ice Bath?

An ice bath is a planned exposure to cold water. It can be water made cold by ice or it can be water in lakes or oceans that’s seasonally cold. In the latter example it may be called a cold plunge. Some people even partake in charity cold plunges or ring in the new year with an icy cold shock.

An ice bath temperature is typically below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and often ranges from 50 to 59 degrees. Sometimes people may want their ice bath temperature to be even lower.

Ice baths are different from cryotherapy which involve exposure to very cold air (typically -220 to -240 degrees). However cryotherapy doesn't involve any submersion in water.



Ice Bath Benefits

Fans of ice baths claim that they have several potential benefits including:



Quicker recovery after intense exercise and reduced muscle soreness.

Fat burning by stimulating the body’s production of brown fat

Improved circulation

Improved mood focus and stress relief

Reduced inflammation and pain

A 2023 analysis of 20 studies published in Frontiers of Physiology concluded that cold water immersion performed immediately after exercise could help lower muscle soreness and speed up fatigue recovery. However despite their initial benefits for muscle recovery some research has found that ice baths can actually reduce muscle strength and growth over time Corbett says.

While an ice bath can increase your metabolism and help with fat burning you’re not likely to see overnight benefits with just one ice bath session. Studies have noted that while researchers have seen decreases in body fat in people who take cold plunges much more research is needed to recommend ice baths for weight loss.

Beyond physical health benefits ice baths can also give your mental wellness a boost.

“Ice baths make people feel refreshed and invigorated leading to a sense of overall well-being” says Dr. Yoshua Quinones a board-certified internist with the Medical Offices of Manhattan in New York and a contributor to the website Lab Finder.



Dangers of Ice Baths

Before you take the plunge it's important to first consider some of the potential dangers of ice baths.

These include:



Frostbite. This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long.

This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long. Hypothermia. This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure.

This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure. Cold shock. Sudden immersion in cold water can cause increased blood pressure heart rate and breathing which increases the risk of drowning. This is due to blood vessels contracting when your body is exposed to cold. People who have cardiovascular issues are at higher risk for experiencing this type of response to cold.

Because of the potential dangers of hypothermia or cold shock make sure there's someone else keeping an eye on you while you plunge into the cold no matter how experienced you are with cold temperatures.



Who Shouldn’t Take an Ice Bath

For most healthy people it’s OK to try an ice bath. However you’ll want to avoid an ice bath or check first with a health care provider if you have:



An open wound or infection. An ice bath could slow healing.

An ice bath could slow healing. Cardiovascular disease . Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate.

Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate. Peripheral neuropathy. A type of nerve damage that may cause tingling and numbness this condition is often associated with diabetes.

A type of nerve damage that may cause tingling and numbness this condition is often associated with diabetes. Raynaud’s disease. An ice bath could make your condition worse.

An ice bath could make your condition worse. Respiratory issues. Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems.

Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems. Uncontrolled high blood pressure. Increased blood pressure can occur during an ice bath.

You should also check with a healthcare provider or avoid ice baths if you are pregnant or hypersensitive to cold.

Ice Bath Tips

If you’re ready to take the plunge with an ice bath keep these tips in mind:



Plan to have someone with you or someone nearby who can help in case you need help during the ice bath.

Start gradually as you would with an exercise routine. Don’t go too cold or for too long during your first time.

Aim for water that’s uncomfortably cold but still feels safe.

Less is more. A few minutes is good but more than 30 minutes is too long.

Listen to your body. Exit if you feel dizzy or uncomfortable.

Plan to warm yourself up gradually after exiting an ice bath.

Don’t take any medication that might impair you before an ice bath.

Stay hydrated after an ice bath.

Additionally consider when is the best time to do an ice bath and how often you'll incorporate it into your routine.

“If you’re using it for muscle soreness then doing an ice bath after exercise is the optimal timing. Ten minutes post-exercise may help with delayed onset muscle soreness” says Dr. Justin Mullner a primary care sports medicine physician for adults and children with Orlando Health Jewett Orthopedic Institute in Orlando Florida.

For general mental health benefits like mood and focus you can do an ice bath three to four minutes at a time a couple of times a week for its benefits he adds.

Ice Bath Alternatives

If you want the benefits of an ice bath but can’t fathom immersing yourself in that frigid water you still may be able to obtain some of the same benefits in other ways:

Jake Geruson

Jake Geruson

Saratoga California Feb. 06 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jake Geruson is a new social media influencer who has quickly found success. Unlike most the fifteen-year-old’s success did not happen from a lucky video going viral overnight but rather he soared up using a savvy strategy and solid tactics. His most recent success has been on a burgeoning platform known as Tik Tok. Today we at Influencivewire are going to discuss “Jake Geruson”.

How did he do it? He built his success by focusing on two key things: strategy and tactics and--importantly--understanding that they are different tools. Strategy is extremely important: it boils down to defining your end goal. Jake emphasizes that you must have a vision of exactly what you want from social media for example to grow your brand or business. It is okay to have that end goal change throughout your journey but if it's something shallow like “to gain followers” then you may find your success plateauing or worse plummeting.

To prevent that Jake recommends three tactics. First it’s important to balance creating content that is aimed at growing your fan base with content that is intended to connect with people who already follow you.

Second Jake Geruson says it’s important to experiment with the content you create and post and take some risk but you must balance taking the right amount of risk with what you know will do the best in your community. An example of this is posting content that you know your community already enjoys versus posting something that's unique and creative. For example you might know that a different kind of post--maybe something edgier than your normal fare-- holds tremendous potential but you don't know how your community is going to react to it.

Finally Jake emphasizes that consistency when posting on social platforms is ultimately what determines who will be successful in building a large following of fans. Consistency enables you to connect with your community on a regular basis whether that’s daily or weekly and it cements your bond with followers. They feel connected to you which creates a stronger community.

The business tycoon told CNBC about the first time he met the Princess of Wales and described how her confession about a famous politician she found attractive surprised other guests. During the interview he said his first meeting with the royal at a party was “a total disaster”.

Trending

Mr Buffett said: “I was in a room alone one time with Princess Di at a party. “Somehow we found ourselves in this library and I — in 15 minutes I don’t think I could take it. “I had trouble remembering my name I couldn’t — I couldn’t think of anything to say and it was a total disaster.” In their second and last encounter before she tragically passed away the pair had attended Washington Post publisher Kay Graham’s party.

Warren Buffett says Princess Diana told him who she considered ‘the sexiest man alive’

Both guests were sat across from each other at the dinner table with American businessmen Barry Diller and Teddy Forstmann sitting at either side of the Princess. Mr Buffett recalled being contacted by media outlets weeks later to ask him what Diana spoke about during the evening ahead of her death. He added: “I didn’t tell them but I will tell you today that a comment she made which was absolutely true and I can see Barry and Teddy’s faces as she said it. “She had been at the White House that day and she said that Bill Clinton was the sexiest man alive.” READ MORE: Queen told to press ‘nuclear button’ over Meghan and Harry's titles

For years Tesla has caught heat over quality control issues — whether it's improperly affixed roofs loose bolts or shoddy bodywork — with one of the most vocal critics being Sandy Munro an auto-manufacturing expert who once likened the build quality of a 2018 Model 3 to a Kia from the 1990s.

In a one-on-one interview with Munro published this week Tesla CEO Elon Musk fessed up to some of the company's production hiccups and recommended the best time of year to buy a new Tesla.

If you’re in a hurry click to skip ahead to the 5 Best 5G Stock to Buy Under $10.

5G is the next generation of mobile internet connection. The industry has the ability to pave the way to a more advanced way of living with new kinds of modern-day tech products. “The benefits of the new technology are expected to fuel transformative new technologies not just for consumers but also for businesses infrastructure and defense applications” said CNN. Previously we covered the 10 Best Communication Equipment / 5G Stocks to Buy Now in an article.

As the world of technology expands the need for 5G networks has become inevitable. In an article published by Statitsa by 2024 5G subscriptions worldwide will be around 1.9 billion. In a separate article published on Cision “The global 5G technology market size is anticipated to be at $5.53 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $667.90 Billion by 2026 registering a CAGR of 122.3% from 2021 to 2026.”

Although the industry has not been around for very long it has continuously proven its importance to the economy. Enforced lockdown and social distancing brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has only further emphasized the need for 5G networks. Many across the country relied solely on working remotely to keep their businesses alive and socialize during the pandemic. Ericsson’s Mobility Report showed that there was an up to 90% increase in voice over Wi-Fi calls for some service providers. The report also showed that 83% of their survey respondents claim that ICT helped them cope with the lockdown.

10 Best 5G Stocks to Buy Under $10

The 5G industry seems positive under The Biden Administration. Newly elect Joe Biden has expressed his intent of prioritizing universal broadband for economic recovery. He plans to spend $20 billion in expanding rural broadband infrastructure tripling funding for broadband expansion to rural areas and reforming the Lifeline program which subsidizes internet and phone services for low-income participants. President and CEO of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council said

""There will be significant consensus for infrastructure spending on broadband. Focusing on building out 'the last mile' winning the race to 5G and implementing other needed reforms to get to universal access will be attainable by President-elect Biden if he focuses on strengthening the public-private model. That would be a major accomplishment under his watch.""

The race to the most efficient 5G network heats up. Tech giant Apple (AAPL) recently launched their 5G iPhone and since then they have reported an overall iPhone sales of $66 billion (2020 Q4). CEO Tim Cook commented that it was the largest number they have seen: “we saw the largest number of upgraders than we’ve ever seen in a quarter so we were thrilled about that”.

Riding on its success in Thailand KT will be able to expand its IPTV business to other Southeast Asian countries and further around the world.""

7. Extreme Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:EXTR)

No of HFs: 16

Total Value of HF Holdings: $68.6 Million

The 7th best 5G stock to buy under $10 is EXTR. The top hedge fund holder of this stock is D.E. Shaw’s DE Shaw which had over $18 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 10000 share at around $4 in November 2020. The stock is up 150% since then. During the fiscal third quarter that ended March 31 2020 the company reported a revenue of $209.5 million.

Voss Capital is the third largest hedge fund holder of EXTR among the 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Travis Cocke said the following about EXTR in his 2020 Q3 investor letter seen by Insider Monkey:

""EXTR provides software driven networking solutions for large enterprise campuses universities hospital systems large outdoor venues like stadiums public mass transit networks and data centers worldwide (i.e. it enables Wi-Fi in extreme situations). It sells wired and wireless network infrastructure equipment as well as software for network management analytics and security. EXTR is remarkably similar to AVID in that it’s trading at depressed multiples (0.75x EV/Sales 1.25x EV/Gross profit and 7x FCF) has moderate leverage (~$215 million net debt) and has been left for dead by the investment community after years of underperformance and operational missteps. However Voss’s variant view is the company has industry leading technology in the Wired and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) industry and a burgeoning subscription and recurring revenue business built off its large customer base (~60000 enterprises globally). This recurring revenue transition was accelerated through the acquisition of Aerohive that occurred 14 months ago (which multiple of our industry contacts have coincidentally called a “game changer”)....Extreme has a market cap of $575 million and an Enterprise Value of $795 million. We believe on a normalized basis the business should generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in revenues (currently valued at 0.7-0.8x sales) 61-62% aggregate gross margin (~1.3x EV/gross profit the third cheapest stock on this basis across the entire North American tech universe) and 15% operating margins. We believe the company will generate over $80 million in FCF over the next twelve months (versus $40 million consensus) and $105 million in unlevered FCF in the next twelve months implying a 7.0-7.5x multiple which is cheap compared with revenue growth in mid to high single digits and gross profit growth potentially into the teens.""

6. Limelight Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:LLNW)

No of HFs: 17

Total Value of HF Holdings: $74.2 Million

LLNW shares currently trade at $4.56. At the end of September a total of 17 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider recently purchased 21550 shares at around $2 in July 2019. The stock is up 50% since then. Recently the company announced a change in their board of directors where Bob Lyons was named the new President and CEO of the company. Walt Amaral Chair of the Limelight Networks Board of Directors said

“We are excited to welcome Bob Lyons as we believe he is uniquely qualified to lead Limelight into its next phase of accelerated growth profitability and innovation. His passion for the customer and demonstrated track record of building high performing innovative organizations aligns very well with our strategic objective to build on our current strengths and become a leader in delivering edge-based solutions.

For lying on the beach or poolside they might be just the trick but for busy spaces and public transport they miss the mark.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

Two-minute review

The original Bose Frames were certainly an interesting piece of tech and while they were well-designed we weren’t impressed by the fairly short battery life lack of volume control and slightly cheap materials. So Bose has taken another crack at its audio sunglasses and produced three new styles to join the existing Rondo and Alto – these are the sporty Tempo and the everyday-use Tenor and Soprano.

Like their predecessors the three new Frames are great if you want to lie by the beach or pool and listen to music or enjoy your tunes while on a walk run or hike. While Bose has done a lot to improve sound quality the new Frames don't quite cut it in louder environments like train stations or public transport.

That said they aren’t designed to replace standard earphones but are more for people who want to be aware of their surroundings while also listening to some background music. If you’re keen to pay the price for them the new Bose Frames (Tempo Tenor and Soprano) are certainly still interesting to flaunt especially since they look more premium than their slightly plasticky predecessors.

While the Tenor and Soprano are essentially the same differing only in style the Tempo takes things up a notch to keep you entertained while you're running cycling hiking or doing something else equally athletic. The Tempo has larger speakers and better battery life to keep you moving and they're definitely louder and bassier than the Tenor and Soprano. But the build feels less premium than the two everyday sunnies and the arms are so thick they don't quite fit everyone.

In the meantime the Tenor and Soprano not only look good but sound better than the older Rondo and Alto and offer decent battery life with touch controls working more smoothly than on the Tempo.

The one great thing about all three designs of the Bose Frames is that you can fit prescription lenses quite easily. While only select optometrists in the US offered lens options for the Rondo and Alto any good optometrist should be able to swap out the original lenses in the Tempo Tenor and Soprano. We got prescription lenses for the Soprano fitted in Australia and have had no complaints.

Price and availability

The second generation of Bose Frames were launched in September 2020 and are available to buy either directly from Bose or from select retailers for $249.95 / £239.95 / AU$399.95. That's a fair chunk pricier than the original Rondo and Alto ($199.95 / £199.95 / AU$299.95) but then you are getting better audio and a more premium set of sunglasses for the higher price tag.

Keep in mind that this isn't a product to replace a standard pair of headphones and that’s fine – that isn’t what Bose set out to do. If you need things like noise-cancellation or just a regular pair of headphones then there are plenty of other ones on offer from Bose.

Design

To the naked eye the Frames look just like a normal pair of sunglasses and that’s a good thing. The last thing you want to do with a wearable is draw unnecessary attention to it so we’re thankful that the design doesn’t give away the tech that’s hiding away here.

One thing you’ll immediately notice about the Frames however is just how thick the arms are but there's no way around that issue. It’s where the battery drivers and touch controls are housed so it adds a bit of heft to the design. If you’re a fan of thinner arms on your sunglasses then sadly these won’t be the ones for you.

There’s only one physical button on the Frames – located on the right arm – which is what you use to turn them on as well as to answer calls or control music. Bose has shifted the button much further back as compared to the older models which prevents accidental presses when you’re taking them off. The button is now black and blends seamlessly into the design as opposed to the gold accents on the older Rondo and Alto models.

Touch controls are available for volume adjustment – again on the right arm – with swipes forward and backward allowing you to decrease and increase volume respectively. This feature was not available in the previous generation of Bose Frames and is a welcome addition this time round. However we found that volume controls work really well in the Tenor and Soprano but aren't as smooth on the Tempo presumably because of the different materials used – the former two have premium smooth plastic while the latter uses a matte finish.

Double taps will bring up your preferred digital assistant (Siri or Google Assistant depending on your paired phone's platform) while laying the Frames upside down anywhere will turn them off – another great feature that makes them user-friendly as it's a natural thing to do when removing any pair of sunglasses.

You'll find the speaker grilles in the middle of the arms on the Frames positioned just before they slim down to tuck in behind the ear. This places them right above the ear ensuring your music podcast or audiobook is for you and you alone. Design-wise the speakers are discreetly blended into the arms so even when you place the Frames on a table they continue to look like regular sunglasses.

You can easily pair them with your smartphone using the accompanying Bose Music app but you won’t be able to adjust EQ levels in any way.

The Frames comes in two polarized lens styles (the more colourful of which is sold as an optional extra) that are fairly easy to pop out and swap around should you desire. Prescription lenses are also an option with participating retailers though this will vary by availability in each country. In Australia we got the Soprano lenses swapped out for polarized prescription ones by just going to Specsavers.

Wearing any of the new Frames models is an interesting experience – despite their large appearance they’re fairly light and don’t weigh down on your nose. However for users that have a slightly larger head these are going to be quite uncomfortable.

We'd expect these to loosen up over time and use but when a colleague tried out the Frames Tempo the arms were pressing down on his temples too tightly to assume they'd get better with use. When this reviewer used the Tempo though they were loose.

The Tempo fit can be adjusted by swapping out the nose clamps but finding the right fit isn't easy. (Image credit: TechRadar)

Designed for athletes the Tempo also comes with different sized nose clamps to adjust fit but we found that none of the provided options helped. On the other hand this reviewer found the Soprano to be a great fit but others found it too tight. Moral of the story – try these on first before you decide to buy a pair.

The Bose Frames Tempo also benefit from IPX4 rating making them water- and sweat-resistant while the Tenor and Soprano only have an IPX2 rating.

One thing we’re disappointed to find with the Frames Tenor and Soprano is the use of a proprietary charging port on the right arm. This means keeping track of yet another charging cable instead of using a USB-C cable which oddly you can find on the Frames Tempo.

Audio performance

The burning question of course is how these things actually sound. It seems that Bose listened to customer feedback from their first iteration and have definitely improved upon the sound quality. The Frames no longer sound like someone’s playing a song on their phone speaker two rooms away and we were surprised by both the clarity and quality of the sound playing. It’s certainly something that takes a while to get used to – having audio streamed into your ears while still being able to hear the outside world is a real multitasking feat.

All three of the new Frames models have an improved mic system for clearer voice calls with a dual-beam-forming array replacing the previous single mic.

There's a major difference in sound quality and loudness between the Tempo and the two everyday sunnies. Again given the Tempo has been designed for athletes they benefit from 22mm drivers in each arm and the sound is surprisingly bassy. Mind you it's not like listening to music on dedicated headphones or earphones but it's still quite impressive.

On the other hand the Tenor and Soprano have 16mm drivers and the sound is still quite enjoyable. These two models aren't quite as loud as the Tempo – at 50% volume the Tempo was more than sufficient on a riverside walk with squawking birds and chatting strollers while we needed to up the volume on the Soprano to about 65% to enjoy our tunes.

That said it’s important we remain realistic with our expectations of the Frames. They are certainly not designed to isolate the outside world or even replace standard headphones. So they’re not the best mix for noisy environments – you’ll want to keep to regular noise cancelling cans instead. On public transport they produce mixed results – we could hear announcements being made but we couldn’t listen to our normal podcast over the chatter in the carriage. Even in a relatively empty bus the sound of the engine was enough to drown out the Soprano at full volume.

There’s also considerable audio leakage at volume levels higher than 60% so if you’re sitting near someone they’ll be able to hear tinny sounds emanating from your sunglasses and unfortunately you'll need them at full volume to enjoy them over the sounds of public transport.

Where we did genuinely enjoy using the Frames Tenor was poolside. It’s great to be able to have music chiming in your ears while wearing sunglasses and not having to balance headphones as well. Mind you the Frames Tenor and Soprano are only rated as IPX2 water resistant so while they’ll survive a light splash don’t let them fall into water.

Call quality is surprisingly excellent with callers coming through clearly and our voices being picked up even with lots of background noise. Yes it’s weird for people to watch you speaking into thin air while walking but it’s something we’ll take in our stride. The only thing we’ll keep in mind is that these aren’t meant to be worn when the weather isn’t sunny or if you’re indoors – that’s just plain silly.

Battery life

Battery life has gotten a boost as well. Depending on which model you prefer you can get up to 8 hours of playback from a single charge. In fact in our tests we pushed the boundaries a little and got more than what Bose advertises.

You'll get the best battery life from the Tempo with a promise of the aforementioned 8 hours of playback but we squeezed out over 8.5 hours in our test. On the other hand the Tenor and Soprano have smaller batteries promising up to 5.5 hours of playback but again we ended up with almost 6 hours while testing the Soprano and that included a 30-minute call as well.

Considering these aren't dedicated audio devices this is reasonable – we don’t expect to wear sunglasses for extended periods of time so with intermittent use you can make them last for quite a while. Moreover if you're expecting better battery life than this keep in mind they'll need to fit into an arm of the Frames and there's only so much you can get in there without making them bigger/thicker than they already are.

Recently we discovered that there are CAFs in GIST (Supplementary Fig. S1a) and platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC) secreted from CAFs promotes tumor progression and metastasis via a paracrine PDGFC-PDGFRA-SLUG axis12. Since the CAFs were isolated from gastric GIST we obtained a commercially available normal GF line to compare with CAFs. To understand the differences between resident GFs and CAFs isolated from human GIST we compared the morphology and mRNA expression of PDGFC as a functional biomarker of CAFs in these cells. We observed that CAFs had a more stellate morphology and higher expression of PDGFC as compared to GFs (Fig. 1a b). In addition CAFs from GISTs with different mutations (i.e. KIT or PDGFRA) and distinct locations (i.e. stomach and rectum) were isolated and characterized. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that PDGFC mRNA was highly expressed in all CAF lines (Supplementary Fig. S1b).

All graphs show mean ± SEM and p values were represented by ANOVA analysis. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. Full size image

We then cultured the GFs with either GIST-T1 or CAF conditioned media (CM). Both CM increased mRNA expression of PDGFC in GFs (Fig. 1c). In addition we compared mRNA expression of CAF-mediated genes (CCL2 RAB3B and TNC) in GFs and CAFs. CCL2 RAB3B and TNC have known CAF markers in gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA; MISHRA_CAF_UP)19. The expression levels of CCL2 RAB3B and TNC were also increased in CAFs compared to GFs (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. S1c). CM from GIST-T1 cells and CAFs resulted in increased mRNA expression of CCL2 RAB3B and TNC in GFs (Fig. 1e) suggesting that CM of GIST and CAFs can promote a GF-to-CAF transition.

To further investigate the functional role of PDGFC secreted from CAFs in GIST a phosphokinase array was probed to compare CM from CAFscramble (scr) CAFshPDGFC #1 and CAFshPDGFC #2 in GIST-T1. Notably CAFscr CM significantly activated several phosphokinase proteins including JNK1/2/3 AKT FAK PRAS40 c-Jun and STAT3 while these effects were abrogated by loss of PDGFC (Fig. 1f g). In addition as shown in supplementary Fig. S1d CAFs markedly induced phosphorylation of PDGFRA and PDGFRB while this effect was decreased by the loss of PDGFC. Because PDGFC is not known to activate PDGFR-β/β these results suggested that CAF-mediated PDGFC secretion affects both PDGFR-α/α homo-dimerization and PDGFR-α/β hetero-dimerization supporting our previous finding that CAF-mediated PDGFC secretion enhances GIST progression and metastasis. Together these data demonstrated that PDGFC could be a CAF marker that modulates an aggressive phenotype of GIST cells.

FGFs are overexpressed in CAFs

Next we performed RNA sequencing analyses (RNA-seq) using GIST-T1 cells and CAFs to characterize the CAFs (GSE143547). Interestingly RNA-seq revealed that genes encoding various fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) were overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2a). These genes are known to be upregulated in many cancers including prostate breast and colon cancer as well as are associated with poor survival by promoting tumor growth metastasis and angiogenesis202122. Thus we next evaluated the expression of these FGF genes by qPCR. Among them CAFs expressed more FGF1 FGF5 and FGF9 expression than GFs (Fig. 2b). In addition these FGF-encoding genes were significantly increased in GFs with the application of CM from either GIST-T1 cells or CAFs (Fig. 2c) indicating that the expression of these genes might influence the GIST phenotype.

TGF-β1 is highly expressed in GISTs and CAFs

TGF-β signaling contributes to various biological processes that promote tumorigenesis and metastasis1617. In pancreatic cancer stroma for example normal fibroblasts convert into CAFs via TGF-β signaling and this process is associated with tumor growth and invasion13. Our RNA-seq data also revealed that TGFB1 was expressed in both GIST-T1 (transcripts per kilobase million; TPM 724) and CAFs (TPM 4548). Given this observation we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescent (IF) staining using human GIST frozen sections with an anti-TGF-β1 antibody. Both staining procedures demonstrated that TGF-β1 was highly expressed in resected human GIST (Fig. 3a b; Supplementary Fig. S2a b). Next to determine the levels of TGFB1 mRNA and TGF-β1 secretion we performed qPCR and ELISA in GFs CAFs and GISTs. These data showed that both mRNA and protein levels of TGF-β1 were overexpressed in GIST cultures and CAFs compared to GFs (Fig. 3c d). In addition to test whether TKI treatment influences the secretion of TGF-β1 we performed qPCR of TGFB1 in GIST-T1 treated with imatinib and sunitinib. Neither imatinib nor sunitinib treatment influenced TGFB1 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S2c) suggesting that tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling in GIST cells did not affect TGF-β1 expression.

All graphs show mean ± SEM and p values were represented by ANOVA analysis. **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.001. Full size image

TGF-β1 promotes a GF-to-CAF transition which increases GIST migration

We next explored whether TGF-β1 is sufficient for the transition of resident GFs to CAFs. Given that both GIST-T1 and CAFs overexpressed TGF-β1 we investigated the effects of this growth factor on GFs. Human recombinant TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) treatment of GFs was associated with the development of a more stellate morphology and increased mRNA expression of CCL2 RAB3B and TNC (Fig. 4a b). TGF-β1 treatment also increased mRNA expression of PDGFC FGF1 FGF5 and FGF9. However the elevated expression of these TGF-β1-mediated FGF genes and PDGFC was abrogated by an anti-TGF-β1 blocking antibody (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. S3a b). Interestingly GFs stimulated by TGF-β1 significantly increased mRNA expression of TGFB1 in GFs (Supplementary Fig. S3c) supporting the notion of autocrine and paracrine signaling leading to transdifferentiation from GFs to CAFs. Moreover Transwell migration assays showed that GFs treated with human recombinant TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) strongly enhanced migration of GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells while this effect was significantly decreased by an anti-TGF-β1 blocking antibody (Fig. 4d–g). To test whether an isotype control for the TGF-β1 blocking antibody influences GIST migration we performed Transwell migration assays with an isotype control antibody (mouse IgG) in GIST cells. This did not affect tumor cell migration (Supplementary Fig. S3d). Together these data indicated that TGF-β1 is involved in GF-to-CAF transition which leads to increased GIST migration.

Fig. 4: TGF-β1 is associated with a GF-to-CAF transition which increases GIST migration. a Photographic images of GFs treated with human recombinant TGF-β1. Scale bars 50 µm.

TGF-β1 secretion from GIST cells or CAFs enhances cell migration

To investigate the effect of TGF-β1 secreted from GIST cells or CAFs we performed Transwell migration assays with CAF CM GIST CM and anti-TGF-β1 blocking antibody (Fig. 5a). The migration assays showed that GFs with CM from CAFs strongly enhanced GIST-T1 cell migration compared to GF only while the effect was markedly decreased by anti-TGF-β1 blocking antibody (Fig. 5b c). Moreover given that TGF-β1 was highly expressed in GIST lines we performed Transwell migration assays with CM of GIST cell lines. The assays showed that CM of GISTs (GIST-T1 GIST882 and GIST430) in GFs increased GIST-T1 migration while this effect was abrogated by anti-TGF-β1 antibody (Fig. 5d e). These data suggested that TGF-β1 secreted from CAFs and various GIST lines with different KIT mutations can enhance a resident GF-to-CAF transition which leads to increased GIST cell migration.

The TGF-β1-mediated transition of GF to CAF promotes GIST metastasis in vivo

We next examined the metastatic effect of TGF-β1-mediated transition from GF to CAF using our murine spleen-to-liver metastasis model. The spleens of nude mice (n = 5 per group) were injected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled GIST-T1 GFP-labeled T1 + GFs and GFP-labeled T1 + GFs pretreated with TGF-β1. The mixture of GIST-T1 cells with GFs pre-treated with TGF-β1 increased tumor formation at the injection site and liver metastases (Fig. 6a–d; Supplementary Fig. S4a b). H&E staining and IHC with anti-KIT antibody using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver sections from each group also supported that TGF-β1-mediated GF to CAF transdifferentiation increased GIST liver metastases (Fig. 6e; Supplementary Fig. S4c). IHC analysis in the same sections did not reveal FSP-1-positive cells in the liver suggesting that only GIST cells stimulated (i.e. preconditioned) by CAFs (or stimulated GFs) metastasized to the liver (data are now shown). Together these data demonstrated that TGF-β1 secretion from CAFs and GISTs enhances a GF-to-CAF transition which promotes GIST migration and metastasis via paracrine signaling (Fig. 6f).",,,,,,,,,,,,

At least three feature films could come out of the story in which retail traders mostly operating on the WallStreetBets subreddit bought and held massive amounts of GameStop stock in an attempted “short squeeze” — a play that would’ve forced financial institutions that had bet against GameStop to buy back shares at outrageously inflated prices. While the stock price of the video games retailer rose over $400 last week the squeeze (in meme parlance) was never quite squoze and the price has since plummeted to about $60.

The tale quickly took on the tenor of a righteous class war: Everyday investors vs. billionaire hedge funds the underdogs using tactics not dissimilar to those on Wall Street to get a little payback for the 2008 financial collapse. (Never mind the fact that while one hedge fund that had shorted GameStop did need to be bailed out by another firm the biggest winner was probably the financial behemoth BlackRock.) Still the contours of the story were ripe for content and several Hollywood studios were quick to act.

On January 31st MGM acquired the rights to a book proposal for The Antisocial Network by bestselling author Ben Mezrich (the actual book deal was finalized a few days later with Grand Central Publishing). Based on reports The Antisocial Network will broadly center around the WallStreetBets subreddit chronicling its rise and last week’s mayhem though the specifics remain unclear. The book is expected to arrive later this fall though there is no timeline for the movie. Mezrich’s book about M.I.T. card counters Bringing Down the House was previously turned into the film 21 while The Accidental Billionaires served as the basis for David Fincher’s Facebook flick The Social Network.

It was also reported that Netflix was in talks with Zero Dark Thirty screenwriter Mark Boal for a film that would star Noah Centineo. And Thursday The Wall Street Journal reported that the founder of WallStreetBets Jaime Rogozinski had sold his life rights to Brett Ratner’s RatPac Entertainment (Ratner it should be noted has been accused sexual harassment and assault by multiple women; Ratner has denied the claims). RatPac reportedly paid Rogozinski a fee in the low six figures and the studio plans to dramatize the story of his role in the GameStop saga.

Editor’s picks

Capping it all off Variety reported that the documentary film and TV studio XTR has linked up with the production company Optimist for a documentary project on WallStreetBets. Chris Temple is attached to direct with Zach Ingrasci and they’ve already launched a Kickstarter fundraiser and started conducting interviews. On Friday yet another GameStop project was announced with HBO teaming with producers Andrew Ross Sorkin and BlumHouse’s Jason Blum on a film Variety reports.)

'I Love You Paul!': Family Believes Their Mom Is 'Adrienne From Brooklyn' From Viral Beatles Clip

This flurry of deals however soon led to tension among WallStreetBets moderators. As The New York Times reported screen grabs from private chats among some moderators were leaked last week showing conversations about how to best capitalize on the attention. Some users soured at the idea of some profiting off the forum’s notoriety while Mashable also reported an attempted “coup” by some old mods who came out of the woodwork to try to wrest control of the subreddit.

Ultimately Reddit was forced to step in with an employee using the name sodypop telling the moderators in a message Friday “After reviewing this situation based on input from both current and past moderators we have decided to remove several moderators at the top of the list that were creating instability in the community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmlzaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9saWZlLWFuZC1zdHlsZS9mb29kLWFuZC1kcmluay90aGUtbWFrZXItb2YtZHVibGluLXMtYmVzdC1waXp6YS1oYXMtYS10YXN0eS1uZXctc291dGhzaWRlLW91dGxldC0xLjQ0NjgyNjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The maker of 'Dublin's best pizza' has a tasty new southside outlet,"The last family holiday we took abroad was in Italy in summer 2019 which as we all know feels like a century ago. After landing in Naples battling our way through the streets to find our Airbnb we were just about in time to make lunch so bailed across the street to the nearest trattoria which of course served pizza. Yes I know pizza in Naples its spiritual home. It was near impossible to order anything else for the rest of the time we were there. It was that good.

Unlike the Romano which has a thin crusty base the Neapolitan which is cooked more quickly is softer and has a thicker raised crust. This style seems to be getting all the love these days bolstered to a huge degree by Pi which opened in Georges Street in Dublin in 2018 and was described by The Irish Times at the time as the best pizza restaurant in Dublin.

Reggie White the chef behind the pizza there was king of the dough wars. He has since moved on and is now heading up the kitchen at John and Sandy Wyer's recently opened Little Forest restaurant in Blackrock Co Dublin. It's a two-chef operation and Shane Windrim who had worked with him in Pi is the other member of the kitchen team.

White has changed his style slightly from his Pi days. He now uses a 48-hour fermented leavened dough for his pizza base made with a sourdough starter he got from his mate Shane Palmer of Scéal Bakery. He trialled more than 30 different variables.

Searing heat

As we drive home with our order with four click and collect pizzas piled up in cardboard boxes on my lap I know that I am duty bound to eat at least one slice while the pizza is at its just-out-of-the oven best. The nduja and buffalo (€16) is the first pizza to hand. The base is blistered from the searing heat of the wood burning oven with the black spots that pizza nerds call “leoparding” (this is a good thing it adds to the flavour); and the dough which manages to be pillowy and chewy at the same time is not too thick but thankfully manages to support the toppings. The spicy hit of chilli from the nduja melds with the buffalo mozzarella and the crushed tomato is sweet yet has a refreshing touch of acidity.

The spicy hit of chilli from the nduja melds with the buffalo mozzarella on the nduja and buffalo mozzarella pizza

Nutty roast cauliflower speckled with brown butter works surprisingly well on the roast cauliflower pizza

The salsiccia picante from Little Forest is dutifully piquant

I am once again taken by the flavour of the tomatoes when I try the marinara (€12). This is a pizza that has nowhere to go it is all about the quality of the dough the cooking and the few ingredients on top. A few laser thin slivers of garlic some fresh basil oregano and extra virgin olive oil support the tomatoes which I later discover are from Sicily and double the price of any that White has used before.

The roast cauliflower pizza (€16) is what is known as a bianca there is no tomato on it so the delightful gooey mess that is Taleggio spreads across the base with some Grana Padano. Nutty roast cauliflower speckled with brown butter works surprisingly well and there are unexpected bursts of sweetness from a few small pieces of grape.

Our fourth pizza the salsiccia picante (€16) is dutifully piquant. There are kicks of heat from thin slices of the cured sausage and a sour and spicy kick from pickled jalapeños against a background of smoky scamorza.

The only thing we are lacking as we devour our pizzas is a dip for the crusts. There is now a choice of two dips included on the menu (I’m not the only one to ask) along with some antipasti options including olives burrata and coppa.

For now Little Forest is operating as a takeaway with just a handful of seriously good pizzas. As our world improves it will open as a restaurant with pasta and a number of other dishes on the menu. This most definitely is something to look forward to.

Special to The Desert Sun

In a celebratory booklet printed in 1965 for the solemn dedication of the First Baptist Church in Palm Springs George Hearst the son of one of the wealthiest men in the country and resident of Palm Springs submitted a donation. As with many such efforts businesses churches and well-wishers contributed to the cause and printed a little message in the publication. There were inspirational notes from Baptist churches all over the country. Every type of business in town sent their regards and support. George Hearst wrote simply “My most sincere congratulations on your distinguished achievement.”

The booklet was titled “A Dream Realized.” Two decades before Martin Luther King Jr. poignantly spoke on the mall in Washington D.C. First Baptist Church in Palm Springs had its own dream diligently pursued.

The booklet would mark its fulfillment. First Baptist Church persists today and is integral to the life of the community.

Pastor Rodney Croom leads the church these days and recalled its history “The original congregation in the 1940's were a group… who migrated from Texas. Upon arrival they settled on what is known as ‘Section 14.’” The group first held services in a borrowed hall and then in a tent but they dreamt of building their own church and doing good work.

Croom continues “In the 1960's when the Cahuilla tribe their sovereignty and asked the residents of Section 14 to re-locate they packed up and landed at their current location in Palm Springs. Right away the congregation began efforts to create a sophisticated childcare program for the communities of Palm Springs. Under the leadership of Cora Crawford the program grew… (and) effectively supported several church ministries and outreach and eventually became a model for other programs….”

It anticipated the Head Start program inaugurated in the country in 1969 by President Lyndon Johnson to “meet the emotional social health nutritional and psychological needs of preschool-aged children from low-income families.” Today First Baptist Church of Palm Springs is rightly proud of its ingenious childcare program initiated by Mrs. Crawford and the foresight of the congregation to serve all children.

First Baptist Church is located in Palm Springs at 588 Rosa Parks Road and was designed by Howard Lapham in the mid-century style then blossoming in town. The congregation purchased four lots in the Desert Highland Neighborhood in 1959 and another in 1962 for a parsonage.

A groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 1 1963. The event was photographed and later published for the booklet memorializing its completion. The caption read “the long-awaited historic day when action really began on the building for First Baptist Church…participating in the event as Pastor Rollins turns the initial shovelful of dirt are …Elder L.K. Griggs Mayor F. Bogert and Dr. James H. Blackstone Jr…. An enthusiastic and thankful crowd of members and well-wishers was on hand for the event.”

Varied building materials accumulated on the construction site after the ground-breaking to the delight of the neighborhood. A rendering by Howard Lapham appeared in The Desert Sun causing great anticipation. The newspaper reported on the building’s progress.

Less than a year after the start of construction the first service in the new building was conducted on July 5 1964. That same year under the leadership of Pastor Jeff Rollins caring for the community’s children was prioritized as a church offering. The program grew and needed its own space. Breaking ground in 1967 and completed in 1968 the congregation built a home for the Palm Springs Child Care and Development Center. (Melba Bennett founder of the Palm Springs Historical Society was a major benefactor.)

The booklet expounded on the efforts of the entire community to create the building and the services it offered. “Dedicated—that is the word that best describes the courageous profound leader of First Baptist Church. Long ago against great odds and with rare determination which is one of his outstanding character traits Rev. Rollins vowed to dedicate himself and anything with which he was associated to the upgrading of people—spiritually morally and economically.”

Indeed the church was uplifting for the entire neighborhood. There was a Sunday school Deacon board Baptist Training Union “The Brotherhood” men’s group the “The Mission Society” ladies’ group and most importantly the Gospel Choir.

The Gospel Choir was nothing short of miraculous. Mrs. Billie Woods was a self-described “songstress” at First Baptist starting 1955. She had given concerts in notable churches in Los Angeles. She sang with the national gospel singer B.F. Gipson and was encouraged as a soloist by Rubia Haynes but a highlight of her career occurred in 1957 when she had the privilege of meeting renowned gospel singer Mahalia Jackson upon her appearance at the Plaza Theater.

George Hearst summed it up perfectly. First Baptist Church was indeed a distinguished accomplishment.

Lacey Kendall and her students at California State University San Bernardino in Palm Desert began working with Pastor Croom and First Baptist this past summer. Kendall says helping the church “appealed to our team because they do and have offered so many services to their communities (free food counseling senior assistance grief counseling mentoring and ministry to anyone of any color faith or lack of faith). This year they have endured more than most.” The pandemic has deeply affected the community served by First Baptist Church.

Whatever the challenge First Baptist Church continues to uplift dedicated to service. Croom and Kendall are part of a new initiative to support historic houses of worship. The Black Church Media Project aims to provide streaming services and therefore connection to community during these precarious times. Kendall says “This project is so dear to our team of students administrators and teachers. It means everything to us to see this project to completion.” Those interested in learning more may contact her at lacey@csusb.edu.

The newly formed youth organization says they want to implement “social change locally and beyond.”

Late last year members went to Tulare City Council to get approval to paint the mural in front of City Hall but were turned down. After the denial more than half the group stopped showing up to meetings at the locally owned marketing agency Roox in Downtown Tulare.

""Without three (city council) votes it wasn't going to happen"" adviser Carlton Jones said. ""I told them if it's your goal you're going to be here until the end.""

On Saturday six people stood in front of a Black Lives Matter mural in the Blackstone Market parking lot and smiled behind face masks while their photo was taken.

On the opposite wall of the mural is a wheat paste poster of Martin Luther King Jr. with his arms folded. It appeared King was watching the gathering located on the street with his namesake.

Inside the letters that make up the word ""Black"" are flags from around the world — America Mexico Portugal Africa.

""It's very exciting"" Chay Goree said. ""It includes everyone. We didn't want to leave anyone out.""

Jones said he knew there would be questions surrounding the Black Lives Matter mural and told the teenagers they needed to be ready to answer those questions.

""Great art sparks conversation"" he said.

Tulare 180 President Dejalysse Eason said the group wanted to paint a mural for the entire city.

""It feels good"" she said. ""I didn't think we would be able to do this. It's for everyone and I think this is a good thing we did for the community.""

The turnaround

Tulare 180 was formed in November.

After the killing of George Floyd and the civil unrest that preceded his death many in the community wanted to place to discuss social injustices.

Advisor Fernando Gonzalez was invited by Jones to participate in a mural project in Fresno. Gonzalez said before joining Tulare 180 he was feeling disheartened by the lack of activism in his city.

""After the death of George Floyd I was questioning Tulare's efforts"" he said.

With the help of a few parents — including Janeen Goree — Jones invited local youth to an informal meeting at Roox. Out of the meetings came the idea to create a mural that would spark discussion and teach the young adults how to fundraise and advocate for a community-based project.

Jones is a former city council member and was on council when the group proposed the mural at city hall. When the group learned they wouldn't be able to paint Tulare City Hall Jones encouraged them to reach out to local business owners.

""I wanted it to remain their idea"" he said. ""I just used the relationships I had in the city to teach the kids how to get sponsors.""

Roox sponsored and created a moveable mural for the organization. Tulare 180 members then took the mural to city council meetings and different businesses to gain support.

Ultimately it was Eason who secured the mural's location.

The 18-year-old Tulare woman grew up on the eastside and would often walk to Blackstone Market to pick up snacks like many children in the neighborhood.

Maninder Maltani listened to Tulare 180's pitch saw the design and agreed to let them paint the mural along two walls on his property.

""I wasn't expecting this"" he said while looking at the mural on Saturday. ""They really blew my mind.""

Tulare 180 cleaned up Blackstone Market's parking lot added bark around vegetation on the property repainted portions of the business and added lights to the wall where the mural is located.

""The wall had graffiti on it before"" mural artist Brandon Contreras said. ""It took us two or three weeks to clean up and put down the bark. We wanted the store owner to benefit from the project.""

Once the mural was outlined on the all it took seven days to complete. During that time community members stopped by to talk with Tulare 180 members. Many of the responses were positive members said.

""Everyone has had a positive reaction to it"" Eason said. ""We really went above and beyond.""

Moving forward Tulare 180 hopes to welcome more civic-minded members into the organization.

""You get to hear everyone's ideas and collaborate"" Gonzalez said. ""We want to get young people more involved in the community.""

Aircraft need to be tested to examine how extreme cold affects various parts of the aircraft.

READ: Qatar Airways is the world’s favorite airline.

For instance metals contract at different rates while lubricants may lose their viscosity creating wear issues for moving parts.

Also plastic and rubber parts could become brittle.

One of the tests is to shut down the aircraft for 24 hours and then do a cold start.

The scope of the trials include: Engine and APU start after the cold soak; thrust-reverser tests with snow; verification of systems behaviors at extreme temperatures; and rejected take-offs.

Last week Boeing announced a slowing of the 777X program to accommodate certification changes and customer requests for delayed deliveries due to COVID.

The company also advised that there would be a cutback in orders of up to 40 percent to just 191 jets in a 10-K filing.

The company’s website lists 309 firm sales but the latest delay to the jet’s debut now set for late 2023 has given some airlines the option of exiting the program and over 100 orders are at risk.

In late January when Boeing announced its US$11.94b record loss and massive US$6.5B charge for the 777X it warned that cancellations production cuts and flight-testing risks could cause additional losses.

The latest delay makes the program three years late.

The COVID pandemic has wiped out demand for larger twin-aisle aircraft with demand not expected to return till late 2023 or 2024.

According to Seeking Alpha the filing says: “Delays for the 777X have resulted in and may continue to result in customers having the right to terminate orders and or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.”

However Seeking Alpha says a new Morgan Stanley report says Boeing is ready for lift-off after its Q4 write-off described as a “kitchen sink” event that de-risks earnings estimates and provides “a clear runway for Boeing for further upside.”

The Boeing 777X once described by Emirates President Tim Clark as a peach has a rosy future.

It has been ordered by blue-chip airlines such as Emirates Qatar Airways Etihad Airways Lufthansa Singapore Airlines Cathay Pacific Airways British Airways and All Nippon Airlines.

It was launched at the 2013 Dubai Air Show with 259 orders and commitments for US$95 billion. The launch was the largest commercial aircraft launch by dollar value and Emirates led the way with orders for 150 with Qatar Airways for 50 and Etihad Airways for 25. Earlier Lufthansa committed to 34 aircraft.

Total orders are now put at 309 after Emirates decreased its order by 35 replacing them with 787s but the Boeing filing indicates a loss of a further 100 aircraft orders.

It is rumored that Emirates will swap more 777Xs for 787s.

The current backlog is listed as ANA 20 British Airways 18 Cathay 21 Emirates 115 Etihad 25 Lufthansa 20 Qatar Airways 60 Singapore Airlines 20 and Unidentified 10.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZi0xNWV4LWZpZ2h0ZXItamV0LXBhc3Nlcy05MC1taW51dGUtdGVzdC13aXRoLWZseWluZy1jb2xvcnMtcmVhZHktZm9yLWR1dHktMTU1NzEzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F-15EX Fighter Jet Passes 90-Minute Test with Flying Colors Ready for Duty,"Not that long ago Boeing was asked to create of an improved version of the F-15 strike fighter. Last week the new version of the aircraft dubbed F-15EX completed its first successful test flight at the Lambert International Airport in St. Louis Missouri.

The new variant of the F-15 is according to Boeing the most advanced to date being equipped with the Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System. It can carry up to 22 air-to-air missiles and a host of searching and tracking technologies.The first test flight for the aircraft with Boeing F-15 Chief Test Pilot Matt Giese at the helm for the duration was meant to highlight how the plane’s avionics and software are performing during a flight that included among other things a vertical departure. According to the ones monitoring the test all went as expected and the airplane proved to be operating as it should.“Today’s successful flight proves the jet’s safety and readiness to join our nation’s fighter fleet” said in a statement on February 2 Prat Kumar Boeing vice president and F-15 program manager.“Our workforce is excited to build a modern fighter aircraft for the U.S. Air Force.

Here's everything we know so far about SIA's Boeing 737-800s.

Last week Singapore Airlines revealed that its first Boeing 737-800 aircraft transferred from SilkAir would be joining the mainline operation in the coming weeks with services to Phuket and Brunei kicking off from March 2021.

This new era for the airline will see it operate narrow-body passenger aircraft for the first time in over 30 years as it folds its ‘regional wing’ into full SIA operations.

With initial schedules and seat maps now revealed here’s all you need to know about this latest addition to the SIA fleet next time you’re booking and see the following in the search results:

Which aircraft?

In total nine ex-SilkAir Boeing 737-800s will be joining the Singapore Airlines fleet over the coming weeks and months.

While SIA has not stated which specific nine (out of 17) Boeing 737-800 aircraft are moving across we already know that six of them have now been repainted in SIA colours and will definitely be part of the new fleet.

We have also listed below the additional two three rumoured to be joining them for a total of nine though this remains subject to confirmation.

Edit: Thanks to the SQTalk gurus there are now seven confirmed repaints completed (9V-MGD added).

Nine of SilkAir’s Boeing 737-800s are on operating leases though we don’t know exactly how this relates to those being transferred to SIA or disposed of. It’s likely that SIA’s fleet will be a mixture of owned and leased aircraft.

All current SilkAir routes will eventually shift across to Singapore Airlines Boeing 737 operation so in addition to Phuket we can expect the following:

Kuala Lumpur

Malé

Medan

Singapore Airlines has also confirmed that we’ll be seeing these nine Boeing 737-800s operating not only former SilkAir routes but also to and from points on its own current network.

(Source: SIA February 2021 Business Update)

With a range of around 6 hours that includes options across much of the airline’s current Asia-Pacific network potentially as far afield as Perth and Shanghai.

Deploying these narrow-body aircraft on many cargo-light routes while passenger demand remains low as opposed to using Airbus A350s or Boeing 787s for example will help the airline better manage costs potentially for years to come as demand gradually returns post-COVID.

Customers will benefit from a step up to the Singapore Airlines inflight experience as we transition the SilkAir narrow-body operations to SIA starting with the 737-800 aircraft in Q4 FY20/21. The integration of SilkAir into SIA will also deliver greater economies of scale for the Group and allow it to deploy the right aircraft to meet the demand for air travel as it returns. Singapore Airlines

This wasn’t supposed to be happening

Singapore Airlines only intended to bring SilkAir’s brand new Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft into its own operation as part of the merger between the two carriers.

That proposal ensured a more seamless cabin standard across the board with brand new flat-bed seats in Business Class Wi-Fi connectivity and seat-back in-flight entertainment from tip-to-tail.

Thompson Vantage Business Class seats like these will make their way to SIA’s Boeing 737 MAX aircraft but it made little sense to put them on Boeing 737-800s temporarily. (Photo: flydubai)

Unfortunately the grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft globally put a huge spanner in the works with five of six SilkAir MAX aircraft still in desert storage to this day as a result.

In order to proceed with the SilkAir integration to the proposed timescale SIA has been forced to instead take these older Boeing 737-800s though with the MAX variant being gradually approved to return to the skies this situation is set to be a temporary one.

Seat numbering on the 737-800

Singapore Airlines follows a standard seat row numbering system on all its aircraft so both the seat row number and letter assignment has been changed from the old SilkAir system on these 737-800 jets.

In common with other Singapore Airlines aircraft Business Class starts at Row 11 with Economy Class starting at Row 41.

To match aisle and window seat letter assignments with the wide-body fleet seats on the right hand side of the aircraft will change from D/F or D/E/F under the SilkAir system to H/K or H/J/K.

There aren’t many narrow-body operators operating this system so don’t let a seat assignment fool you. If you’re checked in for an SIA flight in seat 65K and think to yourself “well that can’t be a 737…” actually it can!

Business Class

Singapore Airlines has retained the original 12 SilkAir Boeing 737-800 recliner Business Class seats in a 2-2 configuration across three rows.

Newly upholstered seats are promised though no internal photos have been shared at this stage. Here’s how the seats looked in the SilkAir fit.

Business Class seats are identical to those installed on SilkAir’s Boeing 737-800s. (Photo: MainlyMiles)

In common with other Singapore Airlines aircraft (but not Scoot aircraft) row 13 is skipped.

(click to enlarge)

You’ll get more legroom choosing a seat in Row 11 also allowing easier access to the aisle for solo travellers who prefer a window seat (A or K in this case).

A power socket is available at each seat.

Seat controls while basic and ‘mechanical’ allow you to adjust the recline leg/foot rest and lumbar support.

At some stage it’s inevitable that Singapore Airlines will be operating these Boeing 737-800 aircraft on routes alongside wide-body jets like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787.

It will then be essential to be careful which aircraft type you book or redeem on for routes with both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft in use especially in the Business Class cabin.

For example between Singapore and Bali it always cost 19000 KrisFlyer miles for a saver Business Class award whether you flew on a SilkAir Boeing 737 or a Singapore Airlines Boeing 787 though the difference in cabin product plus the food and beverage selection was significant.

Same redemption rate from Singapore to Bali… seriously! (Photos: MainlyMiles)

In these cases the Boeing 737-800 will clearly be one to avoid.

Economy Class

The Economy Class cabin continues to feature 150 of the former SilkAir seats in a 3-3 layout though again SIA has reupholstered these seats to better match its own aircraft.

(click to enlarge)

In-flight entertainment will be “via a web-based platform” according to SIA with the carrier confirming that it is using a wireless streaming setup to your personal device.

To enjoy KrisWorld entertainment on board the Boeing 737-800 you should bring along your personal mobile or tablet device. Singapore Airlines

That’s the same setup SilkAir was previously using to offer the service on board its aircraft as ‘SilkAir Studio’.

The former SilkAir studio system seems likely to be used for in-flight entertainment to your personal device on these Boeing 737-800 aircraft. (Photo: SilkAir)

Previously tablets were provided for Business Class passengers on SilkAir however it’s not clear if this will still be the case as the aircraft operate under the SIA banner.

Unfortunately the Boeing 737-800s will not be Wi-Fi enabled.

Windowless seats

If you’re not a fan of arriving at your ‘window seat’ to find there’s no window at all there are a few seats in Economy Class to avoid on the Singapore Airlines Boeing 737-800 aircraft:

You can see from an external photo where the windows are missing on this side of the aircraft.

Airlines don’t deliberately exclude windows to annoy us air conditioning ducts run in these areas behind the cabin wall – so a window cannot be placed there.

Forward Zone seats

SIA’s ‘Forward Zone’ seats in Economy Class promise a quicker boarding and disembarkation experience and also benefit from being in front of the wing ahead of the engines which makes them quieter.

On the Singapore Airlines Boeing 737-800s this section spans five rows (30 seats) from Row 41 to Row 45 inclusive.

There are no charges for selecting a Forward Zone seat if you’re booked on an Economy Flexi fare or an Economy Advantage Award ticket otherwise applicable costs per sector in USD are as follows based on your frequent flyer status.

Charges for Forward Zone Seats

Economy Class

(US$ per sector) Band 1 Band 2 Non-KF $8.00 $15.00 KF Basic $7.60 $14.25 KF Elite Silver $7.20 $13.50 KF Elite Gold Free Free PPS Club Free Free

Band 2: SIN to/from Australia Bangladesh China Hong Kong India Japan Korea Maldives Nepal Sri Lanka Taiwan U.A.E.

Bands 3/4: Not applicable for the Boeing 737-800

Extra Legroom seats

There are six seats on SIA’s Boeing 737-800 sold as ‘Extra Legroom’:

50 A/B/C

50 H/J/K

These benefit from the mandatory additional space airlines must provide between the seat rows for access to and from the over-wing emergency exits.

One downside is that all your personal belongings must be stored in the overhead compartment for takeoff and landing when sat in these seats to ensure unobstructed access to these exits.

Here’s how much you’ll pay per sector in USD to select one of these extra legroom seats based on your KrisFlyer or PPS Club status tier.

Charges for Extra Legroom Seats

Band 2: SIN to/from Australia Bangladesh China Hong Kong India Japan Korea Maldives Nepal Sri Lanka Taiwan U.A.E.

Bands 3/4: Not applicable for the Boeing 737-800

Non-reclining seats

Non-reclining seats are not a concern on any of Singapore Airlines’ current fleet of wide-body aircraft but they are an issue on many smaller planes like this fitted with over-wing emergency exits.

In order to ensure the exit path is not obstructed in an emergency evacuation seats in rows immediately in front of these exits do not recline.

ADVERTISEMENT

For the Singapore Airlines Boeing 737-800 that’s all seats in the following rows:

Row 48 (seats A B C H J K)

(seats A B C H J K) Row 49 (seats A B C H J K)

This is why Singapore Airlines (and SilkAir before it) does not sell seats in Row 49 as extra legroom even though they share the same additional legroom as Row 50. Since the seats do not recline they do not want passengers to be disappointed having paid extra for them.

If you want ‘free’ extra legroom and are happy with a seat that doesn’t recline you should therefore opt for a seat in Row 49.

Fun fact: There’s no such consideration when flying low-cost airlines like Scoot AirAsia or Jetstar. These carriers sell both their over-wing emergency exit rows as extra legroom even though the forward row (Row 12 on all these carriers’ Airbus A320s) does not recline.



Pick Row 13 on Scoot or Jetstar and Row 14 on AirAsia when paying for extra legroom on an A320 to also have a seat that reclines!

Cabin crew will don the Kebaya

For a seamless experience when it comes to cabin crew you’ll be welcomed on board these Singapore Airlines Boeing 737-800s by those in full SIA uniform though in all likelihood the crew will be former SilkAir!

Mainly Miles understands the Boeing 737-800 flights will be staffed by:

One Leading Steward / Stewardess in a green kebaya / tie (for former SilkAir senior crew members)

Three Flight Stewards / Stewardesses in a blue kebaya / tie (for former SilkAir cabin crew)

Cabin crew will be wearing the regular Singapore Airlines uniform. (Photo: Singapore Airlines)

Food and beverages

In Business Class SIA’s ‘Book the Cook’ option will be offered for advance selection plus you can look forward to the airline’s premium wine selection on board including Champagne.

Singapore Airlines is currently serving Laurent-Perrier Champagne in Business Class. (Photo: MainlyMiles)

That will be a refreshing change from SilkAir’s miniature wine bottles.

Boeing 737-800 flights of over 3.5 hours duration will also feature fruits and cheese after the main meal service while on flights of more than 5 hours you’ll get the airline’s signature satay canapé during the lunch and dinner service.

Satay service will be included in Business Class on Boeing 737-800 flights of over 5 hours. (Photo: MainlyMiles)

Down the back Singapore Airlines has confirmed that its new Economy Class meal concept revealed in November 2020 will be rolled out on these Boeing 737-800 flights of up to 3.5 hours duration.

That means meals on these shorter flights “in an all new sustainable paper box that is deep enough for gravy dishes and comforting congee”.

Longer flights will receive a regular Singapore Airlines Economy Class meal.

Summary

It will feel strange to have a fleet of narrow-body aircraft in the Singapore Airlines fleet which hasn’t featured anything but twin-aisle jets since 1990.

While these ex-SilkAir Boeing 737-800s are getting only a minor cabin spruce up there are other ways the airline is making the experience as closely aligned as possible with wide-body operations.

ADVERTISEMENT

It’s good to see the food and beverage service will be brought up to par with the usual Singapore Airlines experience including Champagne in Business Class but for many of the other “consistency” enhancements like flat-bed seats and seat-back IFE systems we’ll have to wait for the Boeing 737 MAX to take over from these older planes.

Singapore Airlines has provided further details of the SilkAir – SIA merger and its narrow-body operations at this dedicated page on its website.

Though she had recently been granted tenure and was a happily married mother of two she was weighed down by a surprising surge in anxiety. To get some relief from her distress she decided to enter psychotherapy.

When she mentioned in an early session how much she was dreading the prospect of seeing her parents during the upcoming Christmas vacation her therapist asked if she had ever been abused. “I said ‘No’ but later that day I began experiencing disturbing flashbacks. Over the next few weeks I remembered that my father had molested me when I was a young child” said Jennifer Freyd a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon in a phone interview. “When my parents arrived for their visit I couldn’t handle being with them and my husband blurted out the reason. They ended up leaving earlier than planned.”

Over the next couple of years Jennifer and her parents—Peter Freyd a professor of mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania and Pamela Freyd then a research associate at the university’s Institute of Research in Cognitive Science—corresponded about this conflict. But as it became apparent that there was no way to resolve the family’s differences these communications stopped. Jennifer has not been in touch with either parent since then.

While Peter Freyd has denied that any sexual abuse ever occurred he has confessed to some inappropriate behavior around his daughter during her childhood. “I’m quite prepared to say” he told The Baltimore Sun in 1994 “the attitude I thought was appropriate of being open about things of a sexual nature – in retrospect may have been wrong.” He has also publicly acknowledged that he himself was sexually abused by a much older man when he was a teenager and that he has struggled with alcoholism—a condition for which he received in-patient treatment at a substance abuse rehab facility in the early 1980s.

Soon after Jennifer made the allegation of abuse Peter and Pamela Freyd coined a term the false memory syndrome to describe what they believe alienated their daughter from them. This concept was later defined by Paul McHugh the head of the psychiatry department at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School from 1975 to 2001 as “a condition in which a person’s identity and interpersonal relationships are centered around a memory of traumatic experience which is objectively false but in which the person strongly believes.”

According to McHugh the false memory in question is typically a delayed memory that emerges during the course of psychotherapy. Thus originated recovered memory therapy a second neologism that is often paired with the false memory syndrome. Recovered memories of abuse stresses McHugh are rarely—if ever—credible.

Over the past 30 years Peter and Pamela Freyd’s view of the nature of memory has been widely accepted. Numerous mainstream media outlets have reported on how an epidemic of “repressed memories” has wreaked havoc on parents like the Freyds who are regularly portrayed as upstanding members of their communities. Likewise psychologists and psychiatrists in training are routinely taught to be skeptical of all delayed memories of childhood trauma.

Yet upon closer examination questions abound. Do laboratory studies on false memory back up the claim by Peter and Pamela Freyd that their daughter—with the assistance of her therapist—conjured up a memory of sexual abuse out of whole cloth? How did the false memory syndrome—an idea formulated by the Freyds in the heat of a deep-seated family conflict—become accepted as established science?

The false memory syndrome stands in direct scientific opposition to the wealth of evidence supporting dissociative amnesia—a psychological defense mechanism which according to trauma therapists enables people to split off painful events from conscious awareness for years. Are these empirical studies which date back to the late 19th century in fact flimsy as the proponents of the false memory syndrome maintain?

The stakes of this controversy are profound particularly for people who turn to the health care system for help in treating their emotional distress. The vast majority of contemporary mental health professionals—and most psychiatrists —have taken their cue from McHugh and believe that so-called recovered memory therapy harms patients by turning their attention away from genuine psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder which require years of treatment with powerful psychoactive drugs. In contrast therapists who specialize in treating trauma survivors argue that dissociated memories of early sexual or physical abuse can cause acute symptoms—say self-cutting—and that integrating these painful experiences can often be critical to a patient’s long-term recovery.

Moreover the broad acceptance of the false memory syndrome in the cultural ecosystem can end up silencing or even shaming people like Jennifer Freyd who believe that they have stumbled upon painful experiences in their childhood and seek to understand the truth about their own past and its connection to their current feelings. In addition in the courtroom the Freyds’ view of memory can serve as a protective shield for those who have in fact sexually abused children.

This investigation into the scientific evidence behind the false memory syndrome comes at a time when our society is finally grappling with the reality that various trusted institutions most notably the Catholic church and the Boy Scouts long covered up the widespread abuse of the children entrusted to their care. We have seen the same pattern with some athletic coaches.

Given that we now know that American society long ignored this reality it seems timely to re-evaluate the widespread belief that individuals rarely—if ever—dissociate traumatic events in their own lives.

The False Memory Syndrome Foundation

In March of 1992 with the help of about 20 prominent mental health professionals such as McHugh and Elizabeth Loftus then a psychology professor at the University of Washington Peter and Pamela co-founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF). While the Freyds were never sued by Jennifer many of the early FMSF members did face lawsuits from their adult children. That’s because by the early 1990s anti-violence advocates had managed to extend the rights of victims of sexual abuse.

In 1989 Washington became the first state to pass a law that enabled people to sue for damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse within three years of the time that they remembered the incidents. By the end of 1992 18 other states had passed similar laws. And media coverage was initially sympathetic to those who remembered being abused as children. The accused were looking for a defense and Loftus’s work provided them with that.

As Pamela Freyd admitted in a 1999 FMSF newsletter these legal changes were the raison d’etre for her nonprofit advocacy group: “The Foundation came into existence because of the many lawsuits that were being brought against families based on no other evidence than a claim of recovered repressed memories.”

In the fall of 1990 Loftus who by that time had written a series of influential academic publications on memory including the book Eyewitness Testimony (1979) received national media attention when she testified as an expert witness for the defense in a closely watched trial. The case concerned George Franklin a California man who had been accused of murdering an eight-year-old girl in 1969. The prosecution’s main witness was Franklin’s own daughter Eileen who testified that she had recovered her memory of the crime after about 20 years. Franklin was convicted and sent to prison but he was released in 1995 upon appeal.

While it has often been reported that the guilty verdict was overturned because Eileen Franklin had recovered the memory under hypnosis that claim was never proven. The actual reason revolved around two legal technicalities: that Franklin had been deprived of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

“I was happy when the FMSF started because right after the Franklin case I was a one-person switchboard who was trying to help desperate family members all by myself” said Elizabeth Loftus now a professor of psychology at the University of California at Irvine in a phone interview. “I had a list of good therapists and lawyers in my office but I didn’t have the resources to do this.”

At the time most mental health professionals for diverse reasons did not yet give much thought or credence to the idea that childhood trauma played a role in the formation of adult psychiatric symptoms. Given the turn toward biology after the 1980 publication of the American Psychiatric Association’s revised diagnostic manual DSM III psychiatrists typically viewed depression and bipolar disorder as brain illnesses with a genetic component for which the first-line treatment was psychiatric drugs. Meanwhile the reigning paradigm in psychoanalysis still assumed that Freud had been correct to abandon his “seduction theory” in 1897 when he concluded that the reports of childhood sexual abuse by patients were actually wished-for fantasies. Similarly practitioners of cognitive therapy claimed that faulty thinking patterns caused most common psychiatric disorders. In fact psychiatrist Aaron Beck the founder of cognitive therapy was an early member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the FMSF.

Given the state of the mental health field in the early 1990s the FMSF strategy consisted of a three-pronged approach: convincing the public that recovered memories of abuse were invariably false recruiting prominent academics to serve as its public relations representatives and punishing the relatively small cadre of therapists and academics who treated or studied trauma survivors. To intimidate so-called recovered memory therapists the FMSF helped initiate a series of lawsuits against well-known figures for malpractice. For example psychiatrist Bennet Braun who practiced at the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital in Chicago was targeted with a bunch of lawsuits. In one notable case settled in 1997 a former patient of Braun’s Patricia Burgus received a $10.5 million settlement.

“These lawsuits by the FMSF had a chilling effect” said psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk author of The New York Times bestseller The Body Keeps the Score: Brain Mind Body in the Healing of Trauma (2015) in a phone interview. “While not all trauma therapists were sued many of us suddenly felt under attack. In fact the Trauma Center the treatment facility which I had established at Harvard’s Massachusetts General Hospital [MGH] in 1984 was forced to close. After I testified as an expert witness for the prosecution in several cases involving delayed memories of abuse by priests the late psychiatrist Edwin Kassem a Jesuit priest who then served as the chief of MGH’s psychiatry department wanted me out. After all he was an advisor to Cardinal Bernard Law then the archbishop of Boston who was forced to resign a decade later when The Boston Globe published a series of stories showing that Law had protected abusive priests.”

A Marketing Success

According to the FMSF’s tax returns this 501(c)(3) nonprofit received a total of nearly $8 million in donations before it was dissolved in late 2019. These contributions from thousands of members many of whom were adults accused of child abuse were plowed into an aggressive PR campaign that resulted in favorable press coverage in several leading newspapers including The Philadelphia Inquirer and The New York Times by the middle of 1992. Between 1992 and 1997 the FMSF spent nearly $300000 just in postage to send out its 35-page packet of news articles to thousands of movers and shakers in the media and in departments of psychology and psychiatry.

One example of the influence of the FMSF on the mainstream press can be seen in the writings of Frederick Crews who weighed in on this controversy in The New York Review of Books. An eloquent literary critic Crews now 89 started his career by writing psychoanalytic studies of canonical authors including The Pooh Perplex (1962) a tongue-in-cheek bestseller on A. A. Milne’s beloved children’s book.

“In the early 1960s like Robert Silvers [the founder and longtime editor of The New York Review of Books who died in 2017] and many New York intellectuals of that era I believed that Freud was a key influencer” Crews said in a phone interview.

But in the late 1970s he turned against Freudian scholarship. A decade or so later Crews convinced Silvers for whom he had been writing since 1964 to reverse course as well. Crews then began publishing a series of harsh critiques of psychoanalysis in The New York Review.

In the fall of 1994 as part of his anti-Freud campaign Crews wrote “The Revenge of the Repressed” a two-part review of several new books on memory and psychotherapy including The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegations of Sexual Abuse by Loftus (co-authored by science writer Katherine Ketcham). Lauding Loftus as an exemplary experimental scientist he embraced her main conclusion. “All in all” Crews wrote “Loftus finds no basis for thinking that repression as opposed to a gradual avoidance and atrophy of painful recollections has figured in a single molestation case to date.”

In his review Crews also praised the public relations efforts of Peter and Pamela Freyd adding “Above all steady progress in public enlightenment has been forged over the past two-and-a-half years by the False Memory Syndrome Foundation most of whose members are themselves slandered relatives of ‘survivors.’”

The Freyds were pleased. “After that piece came out” Crews said to me “I got a call from Pamela Freyd who asked me to join the Scientific Advisory Board of the FMSF. I told her ‘Never mind. I’m not a scientist.’ But she persisted saying ‘You could be useful to us. You could help us reach a liberal educated audience.’ So I agreed to sign up.”

Pamela Freyd’s words proved prophetic. A year later The New York Review published a volume The Memory Wars consisting of several of the recent anti-Freud essays by Crews including “The Revenge of the Repressed” plus numerous letters to the editor. This book received mostly glowing reviews in the mainstream press. However a notable dissent came from Kirkus Reviews which observed that Crews “apparently is so obsessed with refuting his adversaries’ views that he sometimes barely listens to much less engages them.”

Throughout the 1990s major media outlets typically dismissed or ignored the academic research suggesting that survivors of trauma do sometimes forget about their painful experiences for many years. In 1995 the PBS investigative series Frontline ran a documentary directed by Ofra Bikel titled “Divided Memories.”

“Though this film purported to present a balanced view of ‘the memory wars’ it largely sided with the FMSF” said Ross Cheit a professor of political science at Brown in a phone interview. “I wrote Bikel to complain that she didn’t cover accurately the phenomenon of dissociative amnesia. And I was shocked when she responded that there are no documented cases.”

Numerous prominent academics did in fact jump on the FMSF bandwagon. In 2005 Richard McNally a professor of psychology at Harvard published a blistering critique of so-called recovered memory therapy Remembering Trauma. This Harvard University Press book received a glowing review in Science which stated that his “synthesis of research from clinical psychology cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychology provides the most comprehensive and even-handed work on this topic.” Likewise Scientific American wrote that “the overwhelming evidence leads [McNally] to conclude that people do not forget experiences that were truly traumatic.”

In a recent phone interview McNally stood by the key arguments in his book. “Dissociative amnesia is an empty bucket” he said. “I don’t think there is any good evidence for it. Traumatized children actually find it hard not to think about the terrifying events; they typically have lots of nightmares and flashbacks. In contrast recovered memories of trauma can often be traced back to suggestive therapy techniques—such as journaling dream interpretation and hypnosis.”

A few years later the FMSF paid psychiatrist Paul McHugh of Johns Hopkins roughly $110000 to write Try to Remember: Psychiatry’s Clash over Meaning Memory and Mind (2008). This FMSF-commissioned treatise was also widely praised in the national media and by prominent scholars. For example neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga now a professor of psychology at UC Santa Barbara declared that with this book “America’s premier pioneering biological psychiatrist… blows the whistle on sloppy and trendy thinking in psychiatry.”

Meanwhile the mainstream press kept publishing sympathetic profiles of the academics who sided with the FMSF. For example in an eight-part feature published by Slate in 2010 titled “The Memory Doctor” William Saletan praised Loftus as the world’s foremost authority on the reliability of memories of sexual abuse echoing her belief that adults accused of molesting children have long been treated unfairly. Saletan who described the fact that “repressed memories were surfacing everywhere” in the 1990s as a “nightmare” received a national journalism award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for the series.

With academics such as Loftus McNally and McHugh endorsing the false memory syndrome it has emerged as established science. Today psychology students are typically taught that recovered memories are almost always false. As Bethany Brand a professor of psychology at Towson University who has written a few academic papers on the contents of psychology textbooks said in a phone interview “There is definitely a huge bias toward the false memory position. After all the late Henry Gleitman who taught psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and wrote the most influential undergraduate psychology textbook in the last half century served as a scientific advisor to the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. And while all abnormal psychology textbooks cover the major laboratory studies conducted by false memory researchers none cite the studies showing that patients who report delayed memories of sexual abuse actually tend to score lower on suggestibility scales than other patients.”

The influence of the FMSF now also extends to academic and media circles outside of America. It is familiar to many people across the globe as various affiliated false memory societies have popped up in numerous countries including Britain Germany France Australia and New Zealand.

The FMSF’s Scientific Pillar: The Lost in the Mall Study

After the prosecution lost the Franklin case Loftus began searching for scientific evidence to back up her position that the dissociative amnesia often reported by psychotherapists occurred rarely—if at all. As she noted in her widely praised popular book The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegations of Sexual Abuse (1994) “Through careful experimental design and controlled studies perhaps I could provide a theoretical framework for the creation of false memories show that it possible to create an entire memory for a traumatic event that never happened.”

Loftus’s quest resulted in the now-famous “lost in the mall experiment” which her undergraduate student James Coan submitted as his senior thesis in 1993. Two years later Loftus and Jacqueline Pickrell then also an undergraduate student at the University of Washington would publish an expanded version of this study called “The Formation of False Memories” which has emerged as perhaps the central piece of empirical evidence for the false memory syndrome and one of the most influential papers in contemporary psychology. It’s the basis of Loftus’s 2013 TED Talk on false memories which has seen by about six million viewers around the world; its transcript has been translated into 34 languages.

The 1995 study published in Psychiatric Annals involved 24 subjects aged 18 to 53 each of whom were paired with one relative—either a parent or an older sibling. The experiment was designed to prove that an older relative could induce an adult to believe that a distressing childhood event that had never happened—being lost in a shopping mall—actually did happen. Loftus reported that six of the subjects did believe that they had once been lost in a mall and even recalled specific details about that experience. “We are providing” she concluded “an existence proof for the formation of false memories.”

According to Loftus her study proved how therapists—say the one whom Jennifer Freyd saw in the winter of 1990—could implant traumatic memories of sexual abuse in their patients. But as critics of the study have noted this conclusion isn’t supported by the experiment.

The study indicates that older family members who could be expected to have an actual memory of an event can convince a relative to create a false childhood memory or at least a vague sense of that memory. In Loftus’s experiment the “younger relative” had reason to trust the reliability of the memories of family members as it is natural for family members to want to “share” in memories. But a person has quite a different relationship with a therapist as there is no shared experience to be remembered. As a result the study can hardly be said to prove that a therapist can convince a person to create a false childhood memory.

Another problematic flaw with the mall study is its laboratory setting. “Loftus is not a clinician and never studied how people process traumatic experiences” said psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk. “Trauma often overwhelms the central nervous system so the brain may not be able to register it fully when it happens. That’s why delayed memories of abuse are not uncommon.”

Finally critics have pointed out that the study is riddled with methodological flaws and lapses in its reporting of results. For example in “Lost in the Mall: False Memory or False Defense” published in 2019 in The Journal of Child Custody psychologists Ruth Blizzard and Morgan Shaw reported that Loftus tossed out six subjects who were in her original 1993 study—a move which constitutes a major ethical lapse for an experimental researcher. “The mall study” they concluded “has received a minimal amount of critical analysis regardless of the vague and contradictory reporting of results failure to report negative results lack of definition of false memory and conflation of informal observations with formal research.”

Indeed 20 years after her lost in the mall study was published Loftus acknowledged that the study results applied only to the 24 subjects and couldn’t be applied to other populations.

Yet in her interview for this piece Loftus expressed fierce pride in the mall study which she considers a paradigm-busting achievement. Asked to respond to the various criticisms of her work she pointed to a “mega-analysis” of false memory research published by Alan Scoboria a psychology professor at the University of Windsor in Canada in the journal Memory in 2017. “In his summary of the false memory literature” Loftus said “Scoboria reported that suggestive interviewers can cause 30% of people to develop full false memories of events that never happened.”

The Mega-Analysis: More of the Same

In the research world a review of the research on an issue is regularly touted as providing evidence of the truth of a matter that a single study never can. Loftus was citing Scoboria’s paper as evidence that subsequent research on false memories supported her findings and claims.

However as can be easily seen the eight false memory studies reviewed by Scoboria were all flawed for the same reason as the lost in the mall study. None of these laboratory experiments directly assess whether a recovered memory of sexual abuse can be implanted by a therapist.

Here is how Scoboria and colleagues described the methodology of the “false memory implantation studies” they reviewed:

“These studies typically merge suggestive techniques with social pressure to lead participants to report believing and remembering that a suggested pseudoevent had actually occurred . . . the participants are presented with descriptions of a set of childhood events that were ostensibly provided by trustworthy family members (such as parents or siblings). Amongst these events is one false event created by the researchers (familial informants usually verify that to their knowledge the participant never experienced this event in childhood.) Over two or three sessions—typically over the course of a week—participants are encouraged to recall the childhood events using various memory recovery techniques employed in trauma-memory-oriented therapy (e.g. guided visualization).”

In the eight studies the false events were as follow: “trouble with a teacher” hot air balloon ride and “spilled punch bowl on the parents of a bride.”

All of these studies rely on the implanting of a false memory that has supposedly been recalled by a member of the family. To prime that implantation three true events remembered by the family member are also told to the participant. The person has reason to believe that all four events are true and once details of the false event are described he or she has been primed to fill in the details. Moreover none of these false events are traumatic.

That laboratory setting doesn’t replicate in any substantial way the environment in which adults tell of recovering memories of child abuse to a therapist. The therapist isn’t a family member with a “shared” history; the therapist doesn’t provide details of a memory (such as the false event described in these experiments); and the memory of childhood abuse is of course a traumatic memory.

The False Memory Syndrome in the Courtroom

In spite of the flaws in the major false memory studies conducted over the last 25 years Loftus has cited this research while appearing as a defense witness in more than 300 trials of people accused of sexual abuse. In fact Loftus who has never testified on behalf of a plaintiff in these cases has even helped defend men who few doubt are serial predators.

For instance Loftus was the sole defense witness called in the February 2005 trial of the late Paul Shanley the so-called “Boston street priest” who had admitted on several occasions since the late 1970s—to both journalists and to church authorities—that he had abused numerous boys. The 2005 case concerned a Boston area firefighter who claimed that Shanley had raped him on numerous occasions when he was between six and nine years old. The accuser who was 27 at the time of the trial testified that he had forgotten about the years of abuse for about 15 years. Loftus testified that there was little reason to believe this was so. ”I don’t believe there is any credible scientific evidence that years of brutalization can be massively repressed” she told the court.

The jury was not convinced and Shanley who died late last year was convicted and sent to prison. As Martha Coakley then the Middlesex County District Attorney told The Orange County Weekly her team pored over Loftus’s studies and experiments on the inconsistencies of memory before dismissing them all as “fairly trivial kinds of manipulation with memories.” Her studies added Coakley “just weren’t applicable to [the] facts [in the case].”

Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman author of books such as Father-Daughter Incest (1981) and Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence—From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror (1992) argues that Loftus’s standard attack on dissociative amnesia may well have fallen flat in the priest abuse cases because the victims were mostly men. “There has long been a stereotype of women that are easily swayed suggestible and overly emotional” she said in a phone interview. “The false memory syndrome is a fresh appeal to prejudice—that women and children are prone to lie.”

When asked recently about her decision to testify in controversial cases such as the one involving Shanley Loftus said that “every person deserves a fair defense.” She also cited her concern about what she termed “piling on” and about the way the pendulum has shifted too far in the wrong direction in the #MeToo era. “Just because someone committed crimes A B and C” she said “that does not mean that he also committed D. We don’t want a situation where everyone is automatically believed.”

Like Loftus Frederick Crews also believes that courts often victimize men accused of sexual abuse—even those widely assumed to be notorious pedophiles. In the last couple of years he took up the cause of Jerry Sandusky the former Penn State football coach who was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts involving the sexual abuse of children. Crews recently wrote a favorable review of The Most Hated Man in America: Jerry Sandusky and the Rush to Judgment (2017) by Mark Pendergrast which argues that Sandusky was unfairly imprisoned due in large part to testimony based on recovered memories. Loftus also provided a favorable blurb for this book.

When writing to me about Sandusky in a recent email Crews put the term “child molester” in scare quotes. He is frustrated that he has yet to find a home for his piece on the widely scorned former Penn State coach in a mainstream news outlet. “If Bob Silvers were still alive he would have published it without blinking” he said.

The Scientific Evidence for Dissociative Amnesia

The flip side to the false memory studies is a large body of research conducted over the last century that provides evidence that dissociative amnesia is in fact a common reaction to trauma. However this research has often been ignored in news articles and textbooks that discuss the false memory syndrome.

“There are now hundreds of studies in lots of different populations showing that people forget trauma” said psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk. “We see it in victims of sexual abuse natural disaster torture rape war and kidnapping. And research also shows that delayed memories of abuse are as reliable as continuous memories.”

One of the psychologists who has synthesized much of this research on dissociative amnesia has been Jennifer Freyd herself. “I am a memory psychologist so I needed to make sense of what had happened to me” she said. In 1996 she published Betrayal Trauma: The Logic of Forgetting Childhood Abuse (1996)—a book published by Harvard University Press which describes what she has called betrayal trauma theory. “Memory of trauma can be dangerous to children” she stated summing up the central argument of her book. “They may need to forget in order to function in important relationships.”

Jennifer Freyd has also published a number of academic articles on betrayal trauma theory. Over the past decade she has expanded her work to include the plight of victims abused not only by their families but also by institutions on which they often depend for support and emotional sustenance such as the Catholic Church or the Boy Scouts. She recently founded her own non-profit The Center for Institutional Courage. But to this day betrayal trauma theory remains confined to academic circles; it’s typically discussed only in scholarly publications—say The Journal of Trauma and Dissociation which Freyd now edits.

In her book she argued that false memory syndrome proponents such as Loftus and Crews typically confuse the terms repression and dissociation which constitute two completely different defense mechanisms. Repression as understood by Freud after he officially developed psychoanalysis in 1897 involves the banishing from consciousness of certain feelings—say the desire to have sex with someone or to murder someone. In contrast dissociation involves the splitting off from conscious awareness of a painful event—say a sexual or physical assault.

In his pre-psychoanalytic work Freud highlighted the phenomenon of dissociative amnesia. For example in his 1896 paper “Heredity and the Aetiology of Neuroses” Freud connected adult psychiatric symptoms—say depression and anxiety—to incidents of sexual abuse in childhood. In his first book Studies on Hysteria (1895) co-written with Josef Breuer Freud provided a few case studies of women suffering from disabling symptoms who had forgotten about the abuse that they had endured in childhood.

“There is a deep conceptual problem here” Jennifer Freyd wrote about Crews’s influential 1994 New York Review article. “Freudian assumptions about repression…constitute a theory of a particular mental mechanism rather than an observable phenomenon.” In other words Freud’s idea of repression is just a theory that can’t really be proved; in contrast dissociative amnesia is a phenomenon that can be shown to be true by means of empirical studies.

In 1994 sociologist Linda Mayer Williams then a professor at the University of New Hampshire supplied a key piece of such evidence in her paper “Recall of Childhood Trauma: A Prospective Study of Women’s Memories of Child Sexual Abuse” published in The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. The study focused on 129 girls—aged 10 months to 12 years—who were examined in a hospital ER between 1973 and 1975 after reports of sexual abuse. When Williams interviewed the subjects again in 1990 and 1991—they were then between 18 and 31—38% did not tell her about the abuse that had led to the ER visit. “This study” wrote Freyd “suggests that for victims of childhood sexual abuse forgetting the abuse is not unusual (italics in original).”

When asked about these findings Loftus and other false-memory syndrome proponents typically come up with a series of reasons that they believe can whittle the figure for dissociative amnesia from 38% down to 0%.

“Some of the women in the Williams study were just two or three when the abuse happened so childhood amnesia was probably at work for them” Loftus said.” Others may not have felt like telling the interviewer about the abuse. And for others the incident may have been minor—say fondling.”

Evidence for dissociative amnesia has also been gathered by Brown University political scientist Ross Cheit who reports that he forgot his own sexual abuse at the age of 12 by a camp counselor for decades. In the mid-1990s he launched the Recovered Memory Project and he has now gathered 110 corroborated cases of recovered memory. He also has compiled a long list of citations to scholarly articles on dissociative amnesia in various populations such as child abuse victims and Holocaust survivors.

Cheit spent a decade writing a book The Witch-Hunt Narrative: Politics Psychology and the Sexual Abuse of Children (2014) in which he reviewed the major child abuse cases over the previous 30 years—from the McMartin Preschool case of the 1980s through the priest abuse cases and the Jerry Sandusky case. In it he documents how there has been a bias in the media against recognizing dissociative amnesia even though in the clinical world it is well known that “sexual abuse disclosures are often delayed and then disclosed in bits and pieces.”

Therapy for Trauma Survivors

Judith Herman who formulated today’s most widely used paradigm for trauma therapy in Trauma and Recovery (1992) dismisses the term recovered memory therapy as “a caricature.”

“The false memory movement has blamed therapists as exploiters of patients who are eager to implant false memories of abuse” she said. “But I don’t think therapists have that much power. In contrast some parents do try both to take away memories of abuse and to convince their children that they had happy childhoods.”

As a feminist Herman sees therapy as a collaborative process. She realizes that the therapist can’t possibly know for sure exactly what happened in some interaction between an adult patient and her father decades ago.

For Herman the therapist should serve as an enlightened witness who listens carefully to whatever the patient has to say but is not an ultimate arbiter of truth. Her model of psychodynamic psychotherapy which has its roots in some core Freudian principles such as transference (the notion that patients unconsciously transfer feelings about their parents to other people in their lives including the therapist) involves helping patients explore how childhood experiences may play a role in their presenting symptoms—say depression anxiety or relationship problems. Some patients come into therapy with clear memories of abuse. While other patients may eventually disclose long-forgotten scenes of sexual or physical abuse during the course of treatment that is not something that the therapist should ever insist on. Such an assertion is considered unethical as it would constitute a clear violation of the patient’s boundaries.

The Harvard psychiatrist does acknowledge that some psychotherapists may not be skilled in helping patients process trauma. “They may for example rush patients into talking about trauma before they have established a safe relationship. But the FMSF never had any interest in defining what good therapy is” she stated.

Herman notes that the epidemiological data gathered over the past few decades have consistently chipped away at the FMSF tenet that delayed memories of abuse are almost always false. “We know that about a quarter of women are abused as children and perhaps as many as 40% of women who seek therapy have an abuse history.”

Like Judith Herman David Calof a psychodynamic psychotherapist based in Seattle who has treated trauma survivors for about 40 years notes that therapists can harm patients by asking leading—rather than open-ended—questions about possible childhood trauma. But he believes that for very distressed patients deeply buried traumas often play a key role in the presenting symptoms. In these cases it’s the job of the therapist he insists to let patients dictate when they are ready to try to piece together the various fragments of a particular trauma or set of traumas.

He recalled the case of a 30-year-old man who came into treatment after attempting suicide. “I asked him about his family and he told me his father had been convicted of incest. The patient initially denied that he himself had been abused. After a few years of therapy he started to talk about various scenes of abuse but his memory was sketchy. Around that time his father who had received some good counseling in prison was released after serving an 18-year sentence. And then his father began attending some of our sessions and he managed to help his son integrate his memories saying things like ‘Do you remember the incident near the fireplace?’ It was very moving.”

In the mid-1990s Calof edited Treating Abuse Today a magazine that was widely read by trauma therapists and abuse survivors. As he reported in a 1998 paper published in Ethics and Behavior “Notes from a practice under siege: Harassment defamation and intimidation in the name of science” for about three years supporters of the FMSF made a concerted effort to drive him out of business. “My house was broken into and a staff member of mine was assaulted” Calof said in a phone interview. Calof reports that the PR campaign against him died down about 20 years ago and he has not experienced any problems since then.

Psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk who now instructs about 60000 people—mostly psychologists social workers schoolteachers and occupational therapists—per year in his Zoom lectures also notes that trauma therapists no longer experience any harassment. And he is optimistic about the future of mental health treatment for trauma survivors because as a group contemporary mental health clinicians are much better informed about the nature of traumatic memory than they were a generation ago. “But even today few psychiatrists are interested in learning about childhood trauma as that field has sold its soul to the pharmaceutical industry. And that is unfortunate as psychiatrists often misdiagnose adult survivors with conditions like bipolar disorder and then overmedicate them.”

The Science of Recovered Memories

For too long society turned a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children. It was a taboo subject kept quiet within families and covered up by institutions. Soon after states finally began providing adults who remembered such childhood abuse with the legal standing to sue the FMSF began waging a vigorous public relations campaign that discredited their memories—in both courtrooms and to a large degree in the public mind.

Indeed the false memory syndrome which was said to be grounded in cutting-edge science regularly produced a legal—and one might say an epistemological—stalemate: It was the delayed memory of the accuser against the denial of the accused and without any corroborating evidence of the abuse it was impossible for a jury or a judge to know what had really happened.

In addition the false memory syndrome turned those accused of abuse into “victims.” These cases were no longer simply “he said/she said” cases but rather “he said/she was tricked into creating false memories” cases.

However public understanding of this dynamic has perhaps entered a new phase. There is now increasing public awareness that the sexual abuse of children is all too common. And as society assesses the claims of adults who recall memories of child abuse it should know this about the relevant science: The false memory research provides little evidence that memories of sexual abuse are often implanted by therapists. But there is a large body of research providing evidence that dissociative amnesia is a common response to childhood trauma.

*****

Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this article mistakenly reported that Dr. Jennifer Freyd was pregnant with her third child in December 1990; she was not. It also referred to “the late” Dr. Aaron Beck; Beck is still alive. We regret the errors which have been corrected.

Update March 11: Pamela Freyd wrote Mad in America to dispute several statements that were attributed to her and her husband Peter and to state that a number of “statements of fact” about the False Memory Syndrome Foundation were in error. After reviewing her letter and criticisms Mad in America notes the following:

1) The article states that Peter Freyd was sexually abused as a teenager. “This is wrong” Pamela Freyd writes. “Peter was abused by a pedophile at age 7 and ending at age 11.”

2) The definition of the false memory syndrome as cited in the article was authored by John Kihlstrom not Paul McHugh.

3) The article states that Peter and Pamela Freyd “coined a term the false memory syndrome to describe what they believe alienated their daughter from them.”

Pamela Freyd writes: “This is not true. The Foundation’s name emerged from many professionals and families that had come together. Families had in common the fact that they had been told their children suffered from ‘repressed memory syndrome’ i.e. they had symptoms that some therapists said showed that abuse had occurred even if patients had no memory . . . . False memory syndrome was a response to ‘repressed memory syndrome’ not as a term the Freyds ‘coined’ to describe what happened to their own family.”

4) The article states that “Freyd’s view of memory can serve as a protective shield for those who have in fact sexually abused children.” Pamela Freyd notes that their personal view of memory was not set forth in the article and thus this can’t be attributed to them.

MIA’s clarification: The article should have stated that it was the FMSF’s position on memory that could serve as a protective shield not Freyd’s view.

5) The article states that “to intimidate so-called recovered memory therapists the FMSF helped initiate a series of lawsuits against well-known figures for malpractice.” Pamela Freyd writes that the Foundation did not help “initiate” lawsuits but rather “reported” on them.

6) The article states that the FMSF spent nearly $300000 in postage to “send out a 35-page packet of news articles to thousands of movers and shakers in the media.” Pamela Freyd writes that this money paid for mailings to people who requested information about the Foundation and not just for mailings to the media.

7) The article states that the FMSF paid Paul McHugh roughly $110000 to write: “Try to Remember: Psychiatry’s Clash over Meaning Memory and Mind. “ Pamela Freyd writes that the FMSF “made no payments to Paul McHugh. Some donations helped to fund fact-checking and other assistance for information directly related to the FMSF history in McHugh’s book.”

Kendall replies: The funding according to a source “apparently went to McHugh’s son-in-law then an editor at The Wall Street Journal for his ghost-writing services.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzE4MDQ3OTEvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Major global brands endorse Riyadh's new business hub strategy,"DUBAI: Major international companies who have agreed to set up their regional headquarters in Riyadh have endorsed the Saudi capital’s ambitions to become one of the top business cities in the world.

The Royal Commission for Riyadh City has set a target to attract up to 500 foreign companies to set up their regional headquarters in the Saudi capital over the next 10 years according to a report by Al Arabiya.

Twenty-four international companies on Wednesday officially signed agreements to establish their regional offices in Riyadh part of the government’s wider plan to create 35000 new jobs for Saudi nationals and boost the national economy by up to SR70 billion ($18.67 billion) by 2030.

The official ceremony followed an announcement on Thursday by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to double Riyadh’s population and transform it into one of the 10 richest cities in the world.

“All of Riyadh’s features set the groundwork for job creation economic growth investment and many more opportunities’’ the crown prince said at the Future Investment Initiative gathering in the capital.

“We are therefore aiming to make Riyadh one of the 10 largest city economies in the world. Today it stands at number 40 the 40th largest city economy worldwide. We also aim to increase its residents from 7.5 million today to around 15 to 20 million in 2030’’ he added.

The first of the hundreds of companies set to make Riyadh their regional hub over the next decade have written testimonials to the Kingdom’s plans.

Eugene Willemsen PepsiCo’s CEO for Africa Middle East South Asia said: “We’ve been active in Saudi Arabia for around 60 years and are one of the largest food and beverage companies in the Kingdom. We very much look forward to continuing to be part of the future of Saudi Arabia and support the realization of the ambition of Vision 2030. We’re proud to sign the commitment today and be one of the early-adopters of the vision for Riyadh.”

Chief Executive of Deloitte in the Middle East Mutasem Dajani said: “Riyadh is undergoing a remarkable transformation to reinforce its position as one of the world’s major global centres for business tourism and quality of life. Deloitte is honoured to be a strategic partner for the city on its journey to achieve its ambition under Vision 2030.”

Robert Kruidenier vice president of growth emerging markets at Boston Scientific said: “Saudi Arabia is the most strategic market in the region and we are certain that by establishing our regional hub in Riyadh we will expand our regional footprint and create high skilled employment in the Kingdom and develop solutions that matter most to clinicians hospitals and with the ultimate goal of positively impacting patients’ lives.”

Riyadh Al-Najjar Saudi Arabia country leader at PwC said: “We are proud of our trusted relationship with the Saudi government and supporting the Kingdom’s transformation from our regional consulting headquarters in Riyadh. With a large number of mega cross-sector projects Riyadh is quickly becoming a global destination.”

Bechtel’s president of regions and corporate relations Stuart Jones said: “We are inspired by the changes and reforms in Saudi Arabia. We aspire to be a good partner to help realize the ambition of Vision 2030 and establishing our regional headquarters in Riyadh brings us one step closer to that partnership.”

Olivier Le Peuch chief executive officer Schlumberger said: “Riyadh is transforming to become a world class economic capital. This memorandum is aligned with our vision for the Kingdom and to our commitment to the success of Saudi Aramco. We pride ourselves in being associated with the future of Riyadh and look forward to enabling an ambitious and exciting new future in this city for our industry and for the world.”

Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm 500Startups chief operating officer Courtney Powell said: “We’re excited about the acceleration in the tech ecosystem the youth and the startups we’ve seen firsthand in Riyadh across Saudi Arabia and the wider region since we started investing here more than five years ago.”

Neeraj Teckchandani director at Tim Hortons Middle East said: “We are very excited about the transformation and innovation that we have seen in the Kingdom and we are honoured and privileged for the opportunity that you have given us to be part of this journey. We have big plans and ambitions for our growth in the Kingdom and the wider Middle East.”

James Kirby head of EMEA at CSG International said: “The digital transformation occurring today in Riyadh is fueling exponential growth and economic activity. Riyadh is a prime environment for CSG to accelerate its Middle East business strategy. We look forward to building upon the large contract we signed here this week and using it as a catalyst for continued economic development and investment in the city.”

Jan Demey HICT president of the board said: “Today we are in Riyadh with our team to work on several healthcare projects with the ministry of health and other organisations. For 12 years we have been working as expert consultants active in the Kingdom and now have decided to establish a regional headquarters in Riyadh to support the realization of the healthcare chapter of the 2030 Vision and to serve the entire Middle East.”

Bill Furman Greenbrier chief executive and chairman said: “Greenbrier is honored to play a role in the diversification of Saudi Arabia’s economy under the leadership of King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. As specialists in freight rail equipment engineering manufacturing repair management services and financing our regional goals are aligned with Vision 2030’s emphasis on investment localization and logistics. We are grateful to the Ministry of Investment for launching this initiative and we look forward to collaborating with the Saudi government and private sector from our regional headquarters in Riyadh.”

Ghassan Mirdad chief executive officer for the GCC at Katerra said: “As a fast-growing construction technology startup we believe Riyadh is the ideal destination for our regional headquarters. Progressive policy decisions and forward-thinking legal and regulatory frameworks have made it seamless for fast-growing startups like Katerra to establish and grow in the region.”",,,,,,

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MTExNTgyMC90aGUtYmVhdXR5LWluZHVzdHJ5LWlzLW9ic2Vzc2VkLXdpdGgtYW50aS1hZ2luZy1ib2JiaS1icm93bi1qb25lcy1yb2FkLWlzbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bobbi Brown's Jones Road is is anti anti-aging,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/91115820/the-beauty-industry-is-obsessed-with-anti-aging-bobbi-brown-jones-road-isnt on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MTExNTgyMC90aGUtYmVhdXR5LWluZHVzdHJ5LWlzLW9ic2Vzc2VkLXdpdGgtYW50aS1hZ2luZy1ib2JiaS1icm93bi1qb25lcy1yb2FkLWlzbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtxZWQub3JnL21pbmRzaGlmdC82MzY5Mi81LXRha2Vhd2F5cy1vbi1zY2hvb2wtc2VncmVnYXRpb24tNzAteWVhcnMtYWZ0ZXItYnJvd24tdi1ib2FyZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Takeaways on School Segregation 70 Years After Brown v. Board,"This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenberg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90% of his peers were white and only 10% were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76% of his peers were Black and 24% were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90% white classmates while Black students had 24% white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76% Black classmates while white students had 10% Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69% white and 31% Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34% Black and 66% white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25% between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25% increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64% from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

2. School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

3. It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches30% and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent85% of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55% Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80% Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35% students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70% students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40% Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90% or more Black fell from 23% in 2000 to 10% in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90% or more white fell from 44% to 14% during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90% of students are not white grew from 37% in 2000 to 40% in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

4. Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60% of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: People live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40% of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

5. Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vbmV3cy82MDk1MjYvYnJvd24tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20tcHJvdGVzdHMtZW5jYW1wbWVudC_SAVhodHRwczovL2ZvcndhcmQuY29tL25ld3MvNjA5NTI2L2Jyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLXByb3Rlc3RzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Everyone gets to be uncomfortable’: How Jewish students at Brown kept antisemitism at bay,"By Mira Fox May 3 2024

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L3Nwb3J0cy9qYXlsZW4tYnJvd24tZnJlZS10aHJvd3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 NBA playoffs: Jaylen Brown's free throw shooting could be an issue for Celtics,"In the first round against the Heat he struggled mightily at the line going just 9 for 20 (45 percent). The Celtics seem aware of the potential pothole. After Saturday’s practice the team pumped in artificial sounds of booing fans while Brown attempted free throws raising the volume just before his release. While Brown stood at the line an assistant coach stood under the basket waving large foam pads. We’ll see if the extra work makes a difference.

▪ Aside from center Kristaps Porzingis’s calf injury that will likely sideline him against Cleveland the Celtics do not have many concerns during these playoffs. But Jaylen Brown’s free throw shooting probably deserves to be on the list. The forward made 70.3 percent of his attempts during the regular season his lowest mark since 2018-19. He connected on 65 percent of his fourth-quarter tries overall and 63.9 percent on the road.

▪ There was a narrative that it would be good for the Celtics if the Cavaliers/Magic first-round series extended to seven games because it would give Porzingis more time to recover. But this result made no difference. Game 3 of the semifinals was going to be played Saturday regardless and Porzingis will not be back by then. Perhaps the extra two days of rest will be more helpful for 37-year-old forward Al Horford however.

▪ Last month we published a story about how the Celtics identified and pursued Sam Hauser as an undrafted free agent target in 2021. That process was important but Boston’s executives stressed that Hauser’s development has been more important than their discovery.

They said his stint with the team’s G League affiliate in Maine as a rookie was particularly essential. Coaches there helped Hauser become more comfortable keeping the ball above his shoulders before firing away quickly a style perfected by Warriors star Klay Thompson. Hauser also became more adept at shooting on the move and after peeling off screens.

“He’d shown us enough over the first half of his G League season that we weren’t sitting there going ‘Oh if we throw him in we hope we does OK’ ” Celtics assistant general manager Dave Lewin said. “We knew he was a player. Anyone who watched the G League closely knew Sam could contribute.”

Hauser made 197 3-pointers for the Celtics this season.

▪ Boston’s semifinal matchup against the Cavaliers is not all that spicy but it should be more competitive than its first-round win over the extremely undermanned Heat. Porzingis’s injury levels the playing field a bit but Cleveland center Jarrett Allen has missed the last three games because of a rib injury and his status for Game 1 on Tuesday is unclear.

Allen averaged 16.5 points and 10.5 rebounds per game this season and is an excellent rim protector. With the absence of Porzingis a long-range threat Allen would be able to patrol the paint more freely.

The Celtics went 2-1 against Cleveland during the regular season with the home team winning all three games and each decided by single digits. Also the Cavaliers had a similar core last season when they went 3-1 against Boston. This will be the first playoff matchup between these teams since the 2018 conference finals when Jayson Tatum was a rookie and LeBron James still played for Cleveland.

▪ Potentially awkward timing: Tom Brady’s Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held on June 12 from 7-9:30 p.m. That is the same night as Game 3 of the NBA Finals.

▪ Tales from South Beach: It was a beautiful morning in Miami before Game 4 of the Celtics’ first-round series against the Heat last Monday so I took a walk on a paved path near the waterfront. I reached the end and made a right turn toward Biscayne Bay when I noticed some people pointing their cellphone cameras up at a leafy tree.

There dancing from branch to branch and munching on something the tree had grown was a small monkey. I’ve been to Miami countless times thanks to the Celtics’ tendency to face the Heat in the playoffs and I had never seen a monkey in a tree there. I felt somewhat uneducated about the area’s wildlife and I wondered if children nearby were getting a bit too close to this seemingly wild animal.

Then I looked over and saw a man on a bike directly beneath the tree holding food in the air. He seemed surprisingly comfortable. Then I noticed the monkey was wearing a diaper. Yes it was the man’s pet. He had taken his monkey out for a walk and a tree climb. None of this is legal in Massachusetts but in Florida all it takes is a permit.

Luxury shopping desert adventures fine cuisine and the latest in architecture and innovation it’s not short of a five-star hotel or two either. However those with a penchant for luxury will be in their element at Caesars Palace Bluewaters Dubai.

That said when reminiscing about my stay the first thing that comes to mind is service. While the city of lights is well known for its spectacular hospitality the first venture of the legendary Caesars brand in the Middle East blows all others out the water. Not only are staff extremely attentive friendly and more than happy to offer recommendations for your stay everything is done with a smile and no request is too big.

Hotel

The hotel is located on one of Dubai’s newest luxury seafront developments

Less flashy than its Vegas sibling and with no gambling allowed Caesars Palace Bluewaters Dubai maintains the brand’s five-star charm positioning itself among the Mandarin Orientals and One and Onlys of the world. And it sure doesn’t disappoint.

From the cascade water feature at the entrance to the huge floor-to-ceiling windows that fill the lobby with light immediately treating us to a glimpse of spectacular views of the hotel’s pool and private beach first impressions more than set the scene for a spectacular stay.

Characterised by a slick contemporary style with lots of marble and neutral tones elsewhere references to the Roman empire can be found dotted all around the hotel in the form of giant horse and foot sculptures murals artwork and statues of emperors making for a truly palatial first impression.

Rooms

Caesars Palace Bluewaters Dubai has 194 luxury rooms and suites

There are 194 rooms and suites to choose from at Caesars Bluewater and we were promptly escorted to our spacious one bedroom ocean suite which comes complete with expansive balcony offering sprawling views of the Arabian Gulf – the perfect spot to enjoy a sundowner or two. Expect Romanesque details like horse head cushions and Roman coin artworks while the chariot-esque high-backed bathtubs are equally as attention-grabbing.

The rooms are also home to lots of thoughtful little touches – think a folding full-length mirror hidden next to the wardrobe a ‘Scent to Sleep’ collection – pillow mist body oil and hand lotion – provided to help ensure a solid 40 winks iPads to order room service plus Nespresso machines down bedding Frette linen and luxe toiletries. There is also butler service for guests staying in suites which is a delicious added extra.

Facilities

When it comes to poolside lounging it doesn’t get much better than this. Not one but three infinity pools line the resort with private cabanas available both poolside and on the hotel’s private stretch of pristine sand. Free of construction it offers one of the least adulterated water views in town plus there’s the likes of volleyball and various water sports set out on the beach for a little afternoon entertainment.

Dining and entertainment

The star dining experience at the hotel has to be Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen

There are six restaurants bars and lounges on site at the hotel however the star dining experience has to be Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen – the multi-Michelin starred chef’s second immersive restaurant after Las Vegas. The atmosphere is more fun than fine and just like in the TV show the red and blue teams serve up British favourites including Ramsay’s signature Beef Wellington and Eggs in Purgatory plus the sticky toffee pudding which is the perfect way to end your meal.

Breakfast is also served here which due to Covid is currently a la carte and includes everything from smashed avocado on toast waffles and pancakes to your choice of omelette with all the trimmings.

Other dining options include the casual poolside Neptune for cocktails and light bites such as pizza and salads Chinese and authentic pan-Asian fare at Zhen Wei and the Roman Lounge for afternoon tea which is a surprisingly popular affair in Dubai. Those looking for a party can head to Havana Social Club for an evening of Latin beats Cuban-inspired distilled sugarcane drinks and an enviable selection of cigars while Cove Beach is just a minute’s walk away and offers complimentary access to Caesar’s guests. The rosé might be overpriced but the beach club itself is one of the most blissful places to while away your day in the city.

Spa

Qua Spa is an award-winning wellness concept that fuses Western wellness practices with Japanese technologies

If all that eating drinking and tanning wasn’t quite enough relaxation for one trip Caesars Bluewater has also imported Qua Spa from Las Vegas the award-winning wellness concept that fuses Western wellness practices with Japanese technologies. Home to an aroma steam rock sauna experience shower and ice fountain my guest and I opted to experience one of the spa’s most unique elements the Iyashi Dome.

Said to burn up to 600 calories per session it was inspired by the old Japanese practice Suna Ryoho where people bury themselves in the sand near certain natural hot springs. This therapy is said to eliminate toxic build-up through sweat and the dome was created to simulate this same effect independent of location.

After spending 45-minutes sweating in the dome we were treated to a scrub with Himalayan salts a thermal clay mask and then a massage with two showers in between leaving our skin feeling insanely soft and completely renewed.

In a nutshell

An easy 30-minute drive from Dubai International Airport on one of Dubai’s newest seafront developments Bluewaters locations don’t come much better. Close by you’ll find the world’s largest observation wheel Ain Dubai plus a pedestrian bridge that leads directly to the beach at JBR which is jam-packed with restaurants cafes and Dubai’s latest beach club Bla Bla. Our only gripe is that we couldn’t stay longer so until next time.

(Steven M. Falk/The Philadelphia Inquirer/TNS) Read more

The two men spent decades tracing the same path to riches and power -- from Wharton to Michael Milken and finally to Leon Black one of the most feared dealmakers in the business.

But now the path has diverged for Marc Rowan and Joshua Harris with only one of them emerging as Black's anointed heir at the mighty Apollo Global Management Inc.

Advertisement

The winner: Rowan the quiet strategist behind some of the private-equity giant’s most lucrative plays. Harris his extroverted younger cofounder and co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team has been passed over.

Rowan 58 made his formal debut as Apollo's chief executive-designate this week after Black promised to step aside following the controversy over his dealings with the late Jeffrey Epstein the convicted sex offender and self-styled ""financial doctor"" to the rich.

""Leon Josh and I have been together and been partners for more than 30 years"" Rowan said on a call with analysts Wednesday. ""We have been through all kinds of market cycles and all kinds of events and I expect our partnership to endure for a very long time.""

Time indeed will tell. Harris 56 has in the past shown an interest in potentially taking over as CEO. Following an outside review Harris expressed concerns that the extent and scale of Black's financial relationship with Epstein could further hurt Apollo's reputation. The Epstein controversy has dragged on Apollo's stock price which has lagged behind peers and has gained 6.3% in the last 12 months.

Harris advocated that Black should give up his chairman and CEO posts making the case directly to Black and Rowan and at least one board member. In the end Black and his board picked Rowan a choice that Harris ultimately backed. Black remains chairman -- and for the time being the ultimate power inside Apollo.

Until now Rowan has largely avoided the spotlight which has been trained squarely on Black for decades. The coming year will present a new -- and very public -- set of challenges.

""If you put a television camera in front of Marc he would want to get away from the television camera"" said Adam Aron the CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings the world's largest multiplex chain who has worked with Apollo over the years.

The shifting power dynamics inside Apollo could present challenges of their own. Rowan and Harris have labored in each other’s shadows for their entire careers. Rowan graduated from the Wharton School two years ahead of Harris and before long the two ended up working with Black at Milken’s junk-bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert. In 1990 the trio formed Apollo with Black firmly in charge.

Now after revelations that Black paid $158 million to Epstein for various financial services the crown will pass to Rowan no later than July.

People who know the pair say Rowan and Harris cut starkly different figures. A competitive wrestler in college Harris is known for logging long intense hours. Pre-pandemic he often kept a line of people waiting outside his 43rd-floor office. In addition to the 76ers he is an owner of the New Jersey Devils hockey team and Crystal Palace the English Premier League soccer club.

Rowan by contrast is more reserved. He prefers golf and long bike rides. Rather than sports teams he owns two restaurants out in the Hamptons Lulu Kitchen & Bar and Duryea's. His emails and texts are notoriously terse. His usual signoff -- the ""Mark of Zorro"" as one friend puts it -- is ""TXMR.""

Harris has been fabulously successful as a dealmaker and investor. But Rowan is widely regarded the better strategist as well as the financial engineer who has helped vault Apollo to the pinnacle of its industry.

Aron recalled how Rowan once approached an investment in Vail Resorts Inc. the Colorado ski outing business. Having noticed that snowfall was unusually light one season he found special business insurance via Lloyds of London that eventually paid out handsomely.

""Only Marc Rowan would have thought of finding snow insurance"" said Aron.

Rowan’s greatest triumph has been Athene Holding Ltd. Apollo’s money machine. Taking a page from Warren Buffett’s playbook Rowan devised the insurance company to throw off vast sums that Apollo could then use for investments. Athene is one reason that Apollo today is the envy of the private-equity business.

""He is usually thinking three steps ahead"" Eric Zinterhofer a former member of Apollo's private-equity team said of Rowan.

Apollo's strategist has stirred controversy along the way. The investment firm's relationship with Athene for instance has prompted scrutiny over fees and potential conflicts of interests.

During the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. meantime a court-appointed examiner found that Apollo and Rowan had crossed the line by shifting assets away from lenders (Apollo and Rowan denied any wrongdoing).

Apollo investors don't seem to mind. Several years ago Rowan told a nonprofit group that people keep pouring money into Apollo because it delivers good returns.

""Notwithstanding the fact they might not like what we are doing strategy-wise"" Rowan added.

On Wednesday's call with analysts Rowan vowed that Apollo would be more transparent after all the headlines over Black's dealings with Epstein. An internal investigation found Epstein never did business with Apollo itself.

“Proper governance and transparency are going to be essential to play the role that we are supposed to play in this marketplace” said Rowan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbG92aW4uY28vZHViYWkvZW4vc3BvbnNvcmVkL3ZhbGVudGluZXMtZGF5LWR1YmFpLWNhZXNhcnMtcGFsYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Starlit Private Beach Dinner Is THE Most Romanic Valentine's In Dubai,"Picture this.

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Burton’s employs approximately 2000 people across six manufacturing locations in the United Kingdom and generated sales of more than £275 million during the last 12 months. The company’s brands include Maryland Cookies Jammie Dodgers Wagon Wheels Paterson’s and Thomas Fudge’s.

As part of the transaction CTH said it will take over Burton’s six production facilities in the United Kingdom which are based in Blackpool Dorset Edinburgh Livingston Llantarnam and Isle of Arran. Ontario Teachers’ has owned Burton’s since 2013 and over the past eight years has grown the business through continued investment across the branded retailer brand and third-party global brand portfolios in addition to organic initiatives and bolt-on acquisitions.

Ferrero Group is the world’s third largest chocolate and confectionery business and the company recently has diversified into new sectors as it expands its global portfolio. The company in 2019 acquired the cookie fruit and fruit-flavored snack ice cream cone and pie crust businesses from Kellogg Co. The purchase of Fox’s will be the third European biscuit acquisition within the past two years by a Ferrero-related company. In 2019 CTH acquired the Kelsen Group from the Campbell Soup Co. for $300 million. The Kelsen Group is a manufacturer of baked snacks sold under such brands as Kjeldsens and Royal Dansk. In October 2020 CTH acquired part of the Fox’s Biscuits business from 2 Sisters Food Group which is part of Boparan Holdings Ltd. Fox’s Biscuits primarily produces biscuits sold under the Fox’s brand at the Batley and Kirkham plants while the Uttoxeter plant primarily makes own-label biscuits for major retailers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHA6Ly9yZWRncmVlbmFuZGJsdWUub3JnLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvbG9naWNhbC1lbmQtdHJ1bXBzLWRlcmVndWxhdGlvbi10b3hpYy1sZWFkLWNhZG1pdW0tYXJzZW5pYy1iYWJ5LWZvb2Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The logical end of Trump's deregulation: There is toxic lead cadmium and arsenic in our baby food,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: http://redgreenandblue.org/2021/02/06/logical-end-trumps-deregulation-toxic-lead-cadmium-arsenic-baby-food/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHA6Ly9yZWRncmVlbmFuZGJsdWUub3JnLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvbG9naWNhbC1lbmQtdHJ1bXBzLWRlcmVndWxhdGlvbi10b3hpYy1sZWFkLWNhZG1pdW0tYXJzZW5pYy1iYWJ5LWZvb2Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbW9udHJlYWwuY2l0eW5ld3MuY2EvMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9oZWFsdGgtY2FuYWRhLXNheXMtYmFieS1mb29kcy1zYWZlLWFmdGVyLXUtcy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMtbGV2ZWxzLW9mLXRveGljLW1ldGFscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health Canada says baby foods safe after U.S. investigates levels of toxic metals,"OTTAWA — Health Canada is reassuring parents that baby foods sold in the country are safe after reviewing the results of a U.S. investigation into levels of toxic metals in products from several major manufacturers.

The department says in an emailed statement that it works with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to regularly monitor for trace elements including arsenic cadmium lead and mercury.

It says the levels in Canada are “low and not expected to pose a safety concern” based on the available surveillance data.

The U.S. report released Thursday says the House of Representatives subcommittee on economic and consumer policy requested test results from seven of America’s largest baby food manufacturers and received information from four while three refused to comply.

It says arsenic lead and cadmium were present in baby foods made by the four responding companies at levels higher than the maximum amounts allowed in other products such as drinking water.

Health Canada meanwhile says yearly national surveys test a range of baby foods and brands such as infant formula purees and cereals and immediate action would be taken to protect Canadians from contaminants if levels were found to pose health risks.

The testing results are assessed “to verify compliance to Canadian standards limits and guidelines and to ensure that the levels found do not pose a risk to consumers” the department says.

It notes the U.S. report is not a scientific risk assessment.

The subcommittee is recommending mandatory testing labelling and a voluntary phase-out of toxic ingredients by manufacturers as well as new U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards that set maximum levels of toxic heavy metals in baby foods.

Health Canada says it’s working to establish a maximum level of 100 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in rice-based foods for babies and children and to lower maximum levels in fruit juices.

It says new maximum levels for inorganic arsenic in rice came into force last summer as did maximum levels for lead in baby formula.

The department notes the Canadian Food Inspection Agency publishes the results of its surveillance programs online.

The companies that complied with the U.S. subcommittee’s request were Nurture Beech-Nut Nutrition Company Hain Celestial Group and Gerber while the report says Campbell Soup Company Walmart and Sprout Foods refused to co-operate with the investigation.

The U.S. report says internal company standards permit “dangerously high levels of toxic heavy metals” and the subcommittee is concerned the lack of co-operation from some companies could “obscure the presence of even higher levels of toxic heavy metals.”

This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 6 2021.

The terms on all of these are pretty general so it isn’t entirely clear what would or would not qualify. If you have a Capital One card it may be worth taking a look as there are some other stores with rates beating other current portal offers (e.g. 10% back at Brooks Brothers) that may be of interest depending on your circumstances. Keep in mind that Capital One’s terms limit you to $1000 in cash back from these offers every 3 billing cycles and they are slow slow slow to post. I tried both going Capital One Offers and using a non-Capital One card and going through and using a Capital One card and neither purchase has resulted in any cash back nearly a month later so YMMV on posting times (there is no indication as to whether my purchases have tracked). In short use Capital One offers at your own risk

Keep in mind that these offers exist only on some cardholder accounts and are a separate thing from Capital One shopping).

Cretella and his wife came to Jersey City after running a publicly traded hospitality company in New York City.

JCT: What is your connection to Jersey City and why do you think Jersey City should have another hotel?

Cretella: I got invited to a concert in Liberty State Park by a friend of mine who did all the staging for the [Andrea] Bocelli concert. I went there and I saw Liberty House and it was kind of a rebirth. [Cretella now operates Liberty House.] We put all our eggs in Jersey City; Jersey City really embraced us. And we grew quickly in Jersey City. And it was like the second time around for us. It just treated us so well between the neighborhoods we did business in the politicians. We’ve got a special love for Jersey City.

JCT: What kind of projects did you build when you got to Jersey City?

Cretella: When I was in New York I was basically an operator. We didn’t own any of the hospitality properties that we were in. I did however own a portfolio of real estate non-hospitality. So I was familiar with real estate. I’m familiar with construction. These are the things that we did in New York. When we came to Jersey we really wanted to stick to hospitality but own the real estate. So we did Liberty House which we don’t own but that was our first project. We built our corporate offices in Jersey City. We purchased an old warehouse and converted it. We built a senior daycare center in Jersey City. And we did some real estate investment down in the Morris Canal.

JCT: What year did you arrive in Jersey City?

Cretella: I’m going to say 22 years ago.

JCT: Now you decide to build a hotel. Is this your first hotel or have you operated hotels before?

Cretella: No we have other hotels that we own. I’m right now in the Mansion Inn in New Hope Pennsylvania. This property is being expanded to 34 rooms. Next to it is the Logan Inn [which Cretella operates] which has been an inn since 1727. That’s got a big expansion down the block. So in New Hope we’re operating about 130 rooms. We’re not big hotel operators. Our properties tend to be on the smaller side.

We are building 120 rooms more of a resort on an old convent property in Philadelphia. That’s under construction. So Jersey City is going to be the largest for us but we’re very confident. There’s nothing harder than being in the restaurant business. There’s also nothing more rewarding. It’s all about hospitality. We’re very confident that we’re going to build a place that people are going to come back to in Jersey City because of that personal bond that we want to create.

JCT: What is your business model? What kind of prices are we going to be looking at for a room at this hotel you’re building? Is it a super-luxury type hotel or is it something more affordable?

Cretella: We’re really developing the Albion brand. It’s about the colorful side of luxury. We’re building…I would call it a luxury hotel although maybe the Ritz Carlton wouldn’t consider it a luxury hotel because we’re more about experiences. We do a four o’clock tea program where you can come back to the hotel and we may teach you how to roll sushi. We may have a cocktail class. We may have a concert in the penthouse on the roof. So we are trying to create experiences. We feel that’s the real luxury in life creating and having memories. Of course we’re going to have the fresh linen and great pillows and great mattresses. We’re not going to have luxury case goods [furniture such as bureaus or bookcases that provides interior storage space] where every room has the same case goods in them. We select and refurbish old furniture. We have a shop. We make all our furniture. It’s more artisanal and tactile. It takes us longer to do because it’s not that we call up one vendor and say give me a 200 side chairs. But it’s more enjoyable for us. I think it’s a luxury. It’s a luxury that larger groups can’t handle because they can’t go out and pick out a hundred different chairs for their rooms.

JCT: Do you have any sense yet of what the pricing will be? I know people are always thinking about how much things cost because we’re not Williamsburg Brooklyn we’re not Tribeca.

Cretella: Who knows how it’s going to shake out but Pre-COVID we wanted to run in line with the same kind of RevPAR as the other hotels that are based down on the water which is about a RevPAR of $200.

JCT: Can you explain what RevPAR means?

Cretella: So that’s revenue per available room. In other words you take your sales for the year in rooms and you divide by the number of rooms and then you divide that by 365. That’s the average you make on that room per day okay. It’s more of a hotel metric. Most people want to know what’s your average daily rate.

JCT: I think to answer the question though you’d say you’re going to be in the same range as the Hyatt which is down at Exchange Place?

Cretella: Absolutely. Yet you’re going to get a much more tactile visual and personalized experience. It’s a totally different experience for the same money.

JCT: Now talk to me about the food. I see you have a restaurant that’s going into the space. Who are you bringing in to be your chef or to design your menu and what’s the concept for the restaurant?

Cretella: Anthony Bucco is a chef-partner in Felina restaurant that we have in Ridgewood. It’s is highly rated. He’s a great guy he’s a friend. He’s been with us for a long time and he’s been around me for a long time. So I have great confidence in him. He proved it in Ridgewood.

JCT: What will the cuisine be?

Cretella: I call it “fresh made-on-site approachable Italian.” Very bold flavors with wood-fired components in the menu. We design everything with open kitchens so there’s that bond between the kitchen staff and the front of the house. Felina in Ridgewood is also in a bank building. The décor in Ridgewood is off the charts it’s beautiful.

JCT: Can you talk a little bit about what approvals you have at this point for the building and what you need to still get?

Cretella: Our first approach was to go to zoning before we owned the property and then we spoke to the local councilman and the mayor. We got great responses from them. And then we went to the local community. We’ve made numerous changes to our plan based on these boards that we went to. A lot of them tend to be architects which is great because we ended up with a better product. The bank building stands out more the historic part of the building. The design overall is much much better. So now we’re going for formal approvals.

JCT: What is the timeline at this point?

Cretella: We’re hoping to have all of our approvals in three months. I have six months of construction documents and value engineering. And then I have 18 months of construction so it’s multiple years away.

JCT: So we’re looking at some point in 2022?

Cretella: Probably closer to spring of ’23. The process for us tends to be longer because we are employing craftsmen to make stuff. We’re sourcing product that is not off the shelf so the process takes longer. You know Soho house? Their designs feel lived in warm and inviting. You don’t get that by just going out and buying stock anything you know?

JCT: Is there anything that I didn’t touch on that you might want to add?

Cretella: The hospitality industry has really been great for us. We started a foundation pre-COVID and we built a school for hospitality. Obviously things are a challenge for that now but we’ve used the foundation to help others in the hospitality industry during COVID.

This hotel is going to operate as a training ground for staff and it’s also is going to be on the cutting edge of technology. For instance we’re going to use technology to empower our housekeeping staff. Historically housekeeping has always been just a necessity not a full partner in hotel operations. Through technology we’re going to empower housekeeping to be their own boss and to do more.

JCT: This foundation is going to be offering training to local people who are interested in getting into the hospitality business. Is that going be free of charge?

Cretella: So far we’ve only accomplished two classes and both those classes were free of charge. We had a hundred percent graduation which is great but those classes were small. I think 12 people each.

JCT: That was in which geographic area?

Cretella: The school is in Plainfield New Jersey but we handle transportation from Hudson County. The idea is to use it not only for job training but also for teaching personal skills like how to balance a checkbook: everything to just to bring people in and give them a good head start getting employment. And because our company is growing we’re able to not only train you mentor you at the location like 201 Newark but be there for your advancement.

We guarantee a hundred percent employment but you just can’t get into the school. There’s a vetting process. We’ve been in this business 40 years so we know who has a hospitality heart so we’ll train you but you’ve got to meet that metric.

JCT: So it’s really a feeder for your business a training program?

Cretella: You know we’re not doing it for that. I mean luckily as a company we rate high when it comes to employment. We treat our people well. So we don’t have a problem getting employees. We’re doing this more as a give-back to hospitality.

JCT: So they could stay or they could go on to work for somebody else after attending your school?

Cretella: Absolutely. Also my wife is involved heavily with the local restaurant association. She’s on the board. Anthony [Bucco] now is on the board. My wife is also on the board of the National Restaurant Association. So we have a lot of people that respect us as operators. If we say hey we just trained these 10 people does anybody need any staff the fact that we trained them means a lot to our contemporaries which is a great position to be in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9jYXBpdGFscy1sb3NlLXRvLWZseWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Ovechkin's gutsy effort isn't enough and the shorthanded Capitals fall to the Flyers,Alex Ovechkin did nearly everything he could Sunday afternoon as he continues to make up for lost time.

Here's a guide to help you understand who's eligible for a shot now and the different ways to sign up to get one.

Just keep in mind that supplies are very limited and it could be weeks or even months before people who are eligible right now can all get vaccinated.

Who is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine in Michigan?

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created priority groups to help states determine who should get the first injections.

It defines Phase 1A priority group as health care personnel and people living and working in long-term care facilities. Group 1B includes front-line essential workers such as paramedics and first responders as well as people age 75 years and older.

But each state has the authority to tailor vaccine prioritization in a way that best meets its needs. Michigan has now opened up vaccine eligibility to:

Phase 1A: Long-term care facility staff and residents as well as health care workers.

Long-term care facility staff and residents as well as health care workers. Phase 1B: People ages 75 and older; front-line state and federal workers; teachers and school staff; child care workers law enforcement officers including jail and prison employees.

People ages 75 and older; front-line state and federal workers; teachers and school staff; child care workers law enforcement officers including jail and prison employees. Some people in Phase 1C: People ages 65-74.

Here is a full list of how Michigan prioritizes its residents: https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/MI_COVID-19_Vaccination_Prioritization_Guidance_710349_7.pdf

Where can I go to get a shot?

It depends on what priority group you're in and where you live.

SENIORS: If you are 65 or older and you get care from a hospital or health system you can register through that hospital for a vaccine. In addition some Meijer pharmacies are offering vaccinations to seniors. Also some Rite Aid stores expect to get shipments of COVID-19 vaccines to begin offering shots starting Feb. 11.

Some local health departments also are vaccinating some people age 65 and older though it depends on the location. (See below for more details about how to sign up through local hospitals or health departments.)

HEALTH CARE WORKERS: If your workplace is affiliated with a hospital or health system that hospital or health system will schedule your vaccination.

If you are an independent health care provider vaccinations can be scheduled through your local health department. Some hospitals are also vaccinating independent health care workers. Check with your employer hospital or county health department to see how you can get a shot.

FIRST RESPONDERS/LAW ENFORCEMENT: Local health departments are scheduling these appointments. It's best to check with your employer or local health department about how you can get a vaccine.

TEACHERS AND CHILD CARE WORKERS: Public school districts and intermediate school districts are mostly working through local health departments to schedule vaccinations. If you work for a charter school or private school contact your employer or check the website of the local health department where you live or work to see when you can make an appointment. Some hospital systems also have agreements with school districts to provide COVID-19 vaccines to educators. If you are a child care worker check with your local health department or employer about scheduling a vaccine.

LONG-TERM CARE RESIDENTS/WORKERS: Vaccinations are being handled by federal pharmacy partners Walgreens and CVS as Managed Health Care Associates Inc. which has a network of independent pharmacies that already work with long-term care facilities in the state. Among the pharmacies working in the network are Pharmacy Care Advocates (PCA) Genoa Guardian and Hometown. Contact the long-term care facility you or your loved one lives in or works in for details.

OTHERS ELIGIBLE NOW: The state health department has links to local health departments on this website: www.michigan.gov/covidvaccine where you can get more information.

How can I get a COVID-19 vaccine through my hospital?

Many hospitals and health care systems have begun offering vaccines to their patients age 65 and older as well as health care workers.

Some are registering patients by invitation only as vaccines become available according to those who are most vulnerable. Others are using a random system. Some are registering patients for vaccines through the electronic patient portal such as MyChart. Still others have not begun vaccinating any patients 65 and older yet.

Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine in a county where I don't live?

Yes. If you work in another county you may be eligible for a vaccine there.

Where are drive-up vaccine sites?

It depends on the local health department. Some have drive-up sites others have indoor clinics. But you can't just show up at any vaccination site expecting to get a shot. They are by appointment only.

I registered for a vaccine now what?

Wait. Be patient. You will be contacted when a vaccine is available for you.

Local health departments say they are overwhelmed with requests and don't have enough supply to meet the demand. It could be weeks or months before it's your turn.

I need more help. Who should I ask?

You can call 211 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and speak to a specialist who can help you with COVID-19 vaccine questions and in some cases schedule you for a shot or put you on a waiting list.

""211's role in this effort was intended to support scheduling assistance for Michiganders who don't have access to the internet and/or aren't comfortable using a computer"" said Hassan Hammoud Michigan 211 executive director.

Callers will be provided information on COVID-19 vaccine scheduling for the county where they live.

""Some health departments and/or counties are offering online scheduling to the public and for those counties our specialists will complete the online forms for callers"" Hammoud said.

""Some have online registration forms for a callback/waitlist. We are completing those forms for callers as well. Other counties are instructing people to call their health department to schedule an appointment or provide a variety of other types of vaccine-related information which we are sharing with callers.

""If the option to schedule an appointment or pre-register for a vaccine is available we are definitely helping with that but not all counties or health departments have systems in place to accommodate online scheduling.""

Construction is set to begin this summer for a Joliet CarMax dealership on Route 59 near Theodore Street. (Image via Google Maps )

JOLIET IL — April marks two years since the Joliet City Council approved several million dollars in sales tax incentives to attract the national used car company CarMax to expand to Joliet. Construction on the project hasn't started yet but that's no reason for alarm.

CarMax informed Joliet back in 2019 that it didn't plan to begin construction until June 2021 with the expectation that the CarMax business would be open in 2022 at the latest. The sales tax incentives are for CarMax to build a dealership along Route 59 near Theodore Street. The CarMax will go across the street from LA Fitness center.

The nearest CarMax stores to the proposed site in Joliet at Route 59 and Theodore Street are in Naperville and Tinley Park respectively.

Last week Joliet's Economic Development Director Derek Conley told Patch there was reason for optimism regarding the CarMax construction project.

He said he spoke with CarMax in January to get a project update. ""They still plan on moving forward with the project"" Conley said. ""I think it's going to spur development around it other commercial uses.""

In 2019 Joliet Patch reported that CarMax would occupy about 5 acres of a 40-acre tract. During the past couple years Joliet has had a number of high-profile Joliet car dealerships embark on major relocations or expansions.

In November Terry D'Arcy received approval from the Joliet City Council to rezone 16.3 acres along Essington Road to expand his D'Arcy Motors in the 2000 block of Essington Road. D'Arcy intends to move his D'Arcy Hyundai from West Jefferson Street to Essington. In late 2019 Hawk opened its new Subaru dealership and its new Mazda dealership showroom at Route 59 and Caton Farm Road. As part of the real estate transaction the Joliet Park District redesigned a portion of its 18-hole Wedgewood Golf Course to accommodate Hawk as its new neighbor. Like what you're reading?

Here are the main moves that took place for the Miami-based cruise line since the pandemic started:

Fantasy and Inspiration Scrapped

In July Carnival sold two of the older ships the Carnival Fantasy and the Carnival Inspiration. While a buyer was not initially named the two vessels ended up being scrapped a few weeks later.

At the same time the cruise line moved two other ships the Carnival Imagination and the Carnival Fascination to a long-term lay up status.

Both moves also meant several deployment changes with homeport adjustments and more. The most rmajor change saw the cruise line dropping its itineraries from San Juan and Barbados in favor of focusing on mainland drive markets in the U.S.

Radiance Delayed

Scheduled for March 2020 the Carnivals Victory’s $200 million drydock was impacted by the pandemic. The major refit which included renaming the vessel the Carnival Radiance was originally set to take place in Spain and last 38 days.

At the time the worsening conditions in Europe led the work to a full suspension. After pushing back the refit a few times Carnival currently plans to finish it in September. Starting in November 2021 the Radiance will replace the Carnival Inspiration and the Carnival Imagination on the West Coast.

Imagination Scrapped and Fascination Sold

After being moved to a long-term lay up status both the Carnival Imagination and Carnival Fascination ended up being sold.

The Imagination was the first to go leaving the fleet in September. The 1995-built vessel went directly to Aliaga Turkey where it is currently being demolished.

The Fascination was sold for further service. The vessel left the fleet in October headed to an Asian start up.

Mardi Gras Delivered

In December Carnival received the new Mardi Gras from the Meyer Turku shipyard. The LNG-powered vessel joined the brand’s fleet in Finland ahead of a U.S. debut.

After being pushed back a few times the Mardi Gras’ inaugural cruise is currently scheduled for May 29 from Port Canaveral.

Return to Service Plans and Drydocks

Currently Carnival is planning a service resumption on May 1 2021. Some of the vessels however will remain out of service due to delayed drydocks.

The additional cancellations impact cruises from Norfolk Tampa and New Orleans with the Carnival Magic the Carnival Valor and the Carnival Paradise until October 31 2021.

The Carnival Splendor Carnival Spirit Carnival Legend and Carnival Radiance also have different return schedules related to different reasons.

Carnival Underway with Games Galore

The first of two Drive-through Pickups took place Saturday for Carnival 2021 with Punahou families picking up everything from malasadas to Portuguese bean soup to mango chutney and hulihuli chicken. Along with Carnival food drivers made their way through the various pickup stations to retrieve plants and other goods from White Elephant O-Men and Pa‘ani that were pre-purchased online. The second Drive-through Pickup takes place on Monday.

To adhere to State and School health and safety measures student leaders from the Class of 2022 had to reimagine this year’s Carnival. Although the traditional two-day event wasn’t possible this year the students still found a way for the Punahou community to enjoy some of the same favorites of Carnival.

“You guys really rose to the occasion” President Mike Latham ’86 told the Carnival leaders early Saturday before the event. “You were creative. You were innovative and you invented something totally new – and that’s really impressive … This is a historic moment. Punahou has not had this degree of disruption probably since World War II. And just as we remember those students who went through that challenging time and rose to the occasion people are going to remember you guys – what you did this weekend what you did today what you did for your Class and what you did for the School. And that’s something you should be really proud of.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlLmJsb2cvMjAyMS8wMi9jYXJuaXZhbC1wdWxscy1kb3duLW5ldy1oZWFsdGgtcHJvdG9jb2xzLWl0cy13ZWJzaXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival pulls down new health protocols from its website,"Carnival removed its new health protocols from its website a day after posting them.

The new rules were inexplicably removed from the website and replaced with a general statement from the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC).

Carnival posted on Friday comprehensive new rules that included wearing masks social distancing and limited shore excursion options.

About a day later the webpage with the new rules on Carnival's site has been changed back to show just generic recommendations.

Cruise Radio reports the cruise line said the new protocols were removed because they were ""not finalized"" yet.

""As we have said previously guests should expect [mask-wearing] testing distancing and other protocols. We intend to provide more details over the coming weeks as we work to resume operations.""

While they were online the new protocols covered a variety of pre-cruise onboard and shore excursion topics.

Carnival's rules were not terribly surprising with requirements to wear masks limited shore excursions to only ones offered by the cruise line extensive testing and more.

Perhaps the most surprising rule was a clause that said the cruise line could implement a reservation system for venues such as pools gyms casinos restaurants bars and entertainment productions.

Cruise industry blogger Gary Bembridge thought the rules were inline with other cruise lines that had restart limited operations but was surprised by the backlash from primarily American cruisers.

With Carnival removing the protocols none of the top three cruise lines have announced their health protocols for North America cruises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL3dlZWtseS1jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy1mZWJydWFyeS02LTIwMjEvNDY4MTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekly Cruise News: February 6 2021,"Here we are once again with a significant cruise news update as the industry continues to be suspended and we see even more cruise ships now being scrapped.

We’ve really had a crazy couple of days this week with Canada’s government deciding to ban cruise ships an entire year we’ll get more into that and the reaction from the cruise lines later in the video.

We’ve got more sad news with cruise ships being beached and scrapped new health policies from Carnival Cruise Line lots of complications with the CDC requirements on resuming cruises and more. So let’s get started!

Cruise Lines Have Toilsome Task on Resuming Cruises

We start with the onerous task cruise lines have to resume cruises. A Senate Transportation Committee meeting which took place this week it was made painfully clear what the current state of the cruise industry in Florida is facing. It’s proving to be toilsome and there is a long road ahead before sailings can effectively resume.

Michael Rubin the Florida Ports Council government representative told members of the Senate committee that it could be months before a resumption will happen. It could also be 2022 or later before we see cruises on any significant level let alone the same levels as pre-pandemic.

According to Rubin cruise lines and ports are working through an “onerous” list of requirements from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and hope to have at least some vessels operating at half capacity this summer.

He went on to say that some of the smaller luxury cruise lines may not be able to operate until vaccines are available globally. He said that although the pandemic’s impact varies by port combined the financial impact could reach $22 billion. A port like Panama City (FL) is handling more cargo while Port Canaveral’s operations traditionally involve cruise operations 70% of the time.

We’ve got further details in our full article on cruisehive.com along with the difficulties the cruise industry is dealing with in the U.S. at the moment.

Six Former Carnival Cruise Ships Being Scrapped

There are currently six former Carnival cruise ships that are now being scrapped. It also ends the once-popular Holiday-class a class that helped grow the Miami-based cruise line into what it is today.

So the Tropicale which was finally named Ocean Dream for Peace Boat Celebration which was finally named Grand Celebration for Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line and Holiday finally named Magellan for Cruise & Maritime Voyages are now all at the shipbreaking facility in Alang India.

At the Aliaga shipbreaking facility in Turkey there are another three former Carnival cruise ships being scrapped. Carnival Fantasy is almost completely gone and what’s left of her is alongside sister ships Carnival Imagination and Carnival Inspiration. It really is a sad ending for these once popular vessels and with so many memories.

Costa Cruise Ship Beached for Scrapping

While we’re on the topic of ships being scrapped. The Costa Victoria which was formerly operated by Carnival-owned Costa Cruises was beached in Aliaga Turkey recently.

It wasn’t a simple beaching as the ship had some propulsion issues. Cruise Hive reported in January 2021 that the ship would be towed to the scrapyard by a tug boat from Italy. She can now be seen beached in an awkward position which is likely due to being towed.

The ship was sold by Carnival Corp back in summer 2020. It was hoped Costa Victoria would be used to accommodate shipyard workers but unfortunately that plan fell through. She first entered service for Costa Cruises in 1996 and has sailed for Costa until the pandemic hit.

Carnival Cruise Line New COVID Health Policies

Carnival Cruise Line has released new COVID health policies and procedures to make sure guests remain safe during a cruise vacation. Maybe after reading through everything it might not feel like a cruise vacation.

The cruise line has developed the new policies with guidance from authorities around the world including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. A lot of the new protocols are expected such as mask-wearing around the ship social distancing and checks before embarkation.

The cruise line could bring in new wearable tech and use videos for contact trancing and guests will have to have temperature checks done daily. We got some first details of what the impact on port of calls would be.

Carnival could limit port visits and guests may not be allowed to leave the initial port area. Guests won’t be able to go off on their own and explore and only be able to book tours that have been vetted by the cruise line.

The biggest take from this is that Carnival is going to really take these measures seriously. Guests will have to follow the new policies put in place and the policy details could change even further as the situation remains very fluid.

Canada Bans Cruise Ships For One Year

Well we come to the biggest news of the week or should I say the biggest shock of the year so far for the cruise industry. Canada has made a huge decision to ban cruise ships for an entire year. The ban will now remain in place until February 28 2022. This impacts all cruise ships which can carry over 100 passengers.

The announcement was made by the Minister of Transport on Thursday. The reason for the ban is due to the evolving pandemic and keeping workers in the transportation sector safe and healthy. The government has stated that cruise vessels in Canadian waters pose a risk to its health care systems.

There is some hope though if the situation improves such as the vaccines starting to make an impact then the Minister of Transport has the ability to rescind the Interim Orders.

Cruise Lines Surprised by Canada’s Decision

So how do the cruise lines feel about all this was it expected? It definitely wasn’t! in fact multiple cruise lines released statements within hours of the Canadian government’s announcement. Within minutes of the news coming out cruise lines responded on social media saying they also just found out about this and were surprised.

All the major cruise lines had cruises scheduled for Alaska this season and it’s looking likely these will now be canceled unless something magically is announced allowing cruises to sail.

This is all due to the Passenger Vessel Services Act where cruise ships departing from a U.S. port must visit a foreign port. Some cruise lines that are registered in the U.S. will still be able to sail but you can forget about any of the larger cruise lines such as Holland America Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean.

The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) did release a statement in reaction to the year-long ban. Charlie Ball who is the Chair of CLIA in North West & Canada said that its members were very surprised at the length of the ban and hoped that there would be an opportunity to revisit the timeline.

He went on to state how important the cruise industry is to the Canadian economy and two years without cruising could have irreversible consequences for families throughout the country.

Last year reports circulated suggesting Kia would drop the Sedona name for its US-spec minivan in favor of the Carnival moniker used around the world. Now it's pretty much official according to a listing on the EPA's fuel economy website that Motor Trend first spotted on Thursday.

The Kia Carnival minivan is listed as a 2022 model and has fuel economy ratings of 19 miles per gallon city 26 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined. The EPA listing also confirms the use of a 3.5-liter V6 engine as well as an eight-speed automatic transmission. For comparison the 2021 Sedona has an older 3.3-liter V6 and returns 18 mpg city 24 mpg highway and 21 mpg combined.

Kia first debuted the Korean-spec Carnival minivan last summer with sharper more SUV-like styling. To our eyes the van looks awesome and we're stoked to see its arrival in the US later this year where it'll face stiff competition from the Chrysler Pacifica  Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna  all of which were recently overhauled.

The switch from Sedona to Carnival makes sense to us; we prefer the latter honestly. It also won't be the first time Kia's changed the name of a US product for an all-new version. Last year Kia dropped the Optima name from its midsize sedan which is now called the K5.

Kia did not immediately return our request for comment but given that the Carnival name appears on the official US EPA website we can't imagine this is a fluke. Look for the redesigned minivan to go on sale later this year."

The OS-X6B suborbital rocket developed and made by OneSpace Technology blasted off from a launch site in China's northwest at 17:05:05 on Friday.

With a length of 9.4 meters the rocket Chongqing Liangjiang Star flew about 580 seconds and traveled 300 kilometers above the earth.

The test load was successfully separated and the entire flight was normal. This launch successfully completed a number of key technology verification achieved the greatest possible intelligent measurement launch and flight and obtained a large amount of real flight environment data. The test was a complete success the company said.

It was the fourth launch of OneSpace a private rocket company in China. It is the first private company in China to design built and launch a carrier rocket in 2018.

The company adopted vehicle-mounted launch technology to launch the OS-X6B rocket and independently built ground mobile telemetry stations and measuring stations.

It was the first time for China's private rocket companies to complete a rocket launch mission with just a launch vehicle a ground station a drone and a PAD within 10 minutes.

As part of a government effort to foster the commercial space sector and encourage participation by private enterprise OneSpace has become a rising star in the country's space arena.

In 2017 OneSpace Technology signed an agreement with Chongqing Liangjiang Aviation Industry Investment Group to build its research and manufacturing base in Chongqing.

But in early 2020 the tourism industry – a key sector in the Mauritian economy – was hit hard due to the outbreak of COVID-19 hurting the livelihoods of a large part of the local population. And what happened several months later completely devastated the island nation.

On July 25 the Japanese vessel MV Wakashio transiting too close to Mauritius crashed into one of its most fragile coral reefs. On August 6 it began leaking fuel which turned out to be a new type of highly toxic heavy oil. Before the leak was stopped about 1000 tonnes of oil had seeped into the Indian Ocean severely contaminating Mauritius’s shoreline and lagoons in what would become the worst environmental disaster that the country had ever known.

Tens of thousands of people who volunteered for the clean-up including members of local fishing communities were exposed to the toxic components of the oil spill which damaged the island’s food system and degraded its attractiveness for tourism. Three sailors died and one went missing while towing a barge carrying oil from the wreck. More than 50 whales and dolphins washed up dead on the island’s shores; the government is yet to release the full details of the autopsies of the animals which would confirm whether their deaths were caused by the oil spill.

In the months since the tragedy struck Mauritius instead of ensuring full transparency over the fallout of the oil spill and taking urgent steps to ensure it does not repeat the government the Japanese corporation and international organisations that got involved have withheld crucial information from the public.

Today uncertainty about Mauritius recovery persists while no major action has been taken to protect the island’s waters from a future incident.

No comprehensive information has been made publicly available on why the Wakashio ran aground on the possible impact of the oil spill on people’s health and on nature or on why the front section of the vessel was sunk into a whale’s nursing ground. Questions have also remained about the completion of oil fingerprinting – an important process that would provide conservationists with important insight into the effect of the oil spill on marine life.

The government has also done little to make sure another oil spill does not happen. Mauritius’s coastline is vulnerable to damage by international maritime activities and it is a risk that must not be tolerated given their ecological socioeconomic and scientific significance.

One of the steps the government could take in that direction is to create a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) with the help of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). A PSSA would establish an area which ships would have to avoid. This would help the authorities preserve the biodiversity hotspots in Mauritius’s waters and ensure a safer route for the shipping industry.

Such PSSAs should be established not just in Mauritius but in other areas around the world to protect marine life and the livelihoods of local people. They should be an integral part of the strategy to protect 30 percent of the planet’s oceans and land by 2030 which will be negotiated at this year’s United Nations Biodiversity Conference to be held in Kunming China.

Greenpeace has already publicly called on Mauritius’s government to take action and create a PSSA. The same was suggested even by the IMO recognising the urgent need for greater protection. Yet the government remains silent about what has happened since the MV Wakashio ran aground and about its plans to ensure such an oil spill never happens again.

The companies involved in the incident have also been slow to take full responsibility for what happened and take appropriate action. The MV Wakashio was owned by Japanese company Okiyo Maritime Corp a subsidiary of Nagashiki Shipping and was operated by Mitsui OSK Lines (MoL) one of the world’s largest shipping companies.

After the oil spill MoL rushed to publish an apology letter but that did not curb the public outrage that ensued in Mauritius and Japan. Mauritius had some of the largest protests in its history demanding urgent action and compensation. In Japan tens of thousands signed petitions demanding MoL and Nagashiki Shipping take responsibility make funds available for the people of Mauritius and divest from fossil fuels. Greenpeace Japan continues to engage with the companies over these demands.

But corporate responsibility should go beyond MoL and Nagashiki Shipping. While shipped goods are an integral part of modern life and the global trade system the shipping sector which is a significant polluter and source of greenhouse gases remains entirely out of touch with contemporary political social and ecological priorities.

Unlike other branches of the global economy shipping has quietly excluded itself from the Paris Agreement. That is not because there are no solutions for a transition towards renewable energy within the sector but rather because the shipping industry has simply been let off the hook for too long. As Mauritian development economist Nishan Degnarain wrote in a recent article for Forbes: “shipping remains one of the most dangerous industries in the world – not because of the conditions of the ocean – but the conduct of the regulators and operators”.

The oil spill in Mauritius was not the only one in 2020. Venezuela’s Morrocoy National Park suffered from a massive leak from a nearby refinery which released about 3000 tonnes of oil. More than 20000 tonnes of diesel leaked from a collapsed fuel tank near the city of Norilsk in Russia’s Arctic north causing massive pollution of freshwater. In Canada roughly 140 tonnes of oil was spilled at Sumas Pump Station in Canada’s British Columbia province over fields covering the aquifer that the Sumas First Nation use for drinking water; that was the fourth time the pipeline has spilled near the reservation in the last 15 years.

Oil spills always attract international media’s attention for a few days at best and then are forgotten but people and nature in those affected areas take decades to heal. Some losses for Mauritius’s economy and biodiversity might never be recovered.

While an apology and compensation by MoL is welcome it cannot change what has happened. Neither would the resignation of any Mauritian politician as a result of the scandalous handling of the oil spill.

These would be empty gestures unless lessons are learned from what happened and the seas around Mauritius are protected. While taking action to prevent future oil spills corporations and governments must also accelerate their divestment from fossil fuels. A growing movement of citizens is rising up in Africa and across the world to demand action. Their voices must be heard.

He cites Richard Neutra’s Lovell House in L.A. Confidential John Lautner’s Chemosphere and others in Lethal Weapon 2 The Big Lebowski and Twilight; and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Ennis House in Rush Hour Black Rain The Replacement Killers—all inhabited by pimps gangsters pornographers and other miscreants and lowlifes. Although it was filmed during our current period of mayhem happily Malcolm & Marie takes a different tack. Shot during pandemic lockdown in June 2020 it is a Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?–inspired two-hander played by Zendaya and John David Washington that takes place in Feldman Architecture’s Caterpillar House in Carmel California. (Coincidentally Jonathan Feldman studied film before switching to architecture.)

Built in 2011 the low-slung horizontal 2800-square-foot present-day update of the California ranch houses of Cliff May and William Wurster emphasizes natural light warm colors rammed-earth walls and 270-degree views of the landscape. However it was used by the filmmakers in seeming counterpoint: it was shot entirely at night and in 35mm black-and-white film. Production designer Michael Grasley says ""We wanted to find a contemporary house and an architectural language that embraced the California open-plan midcentury mindset but that at the same time was new dialed-in and didn’t look like a house from the 1960s.""

The house is a cool secluded container for the heated arguments discussions and confessions of the couple—not unlike the isolation brought on by the pandemic. The textures abstraction geometry and severe contrast with deep blacks and harsh whites take precedence over the warm characteristics this house is noted for. Symmetry—characters often shot dead center flanked equally on both sides—along with reflected images in mirrors form a stage for this conflicted relationship rather than a design for living.

The house is revealed gradually so we come to know its layout over time with its own narrative structure. The film opens with the couple returning to the house rented by the studio (contributing to a sense of separation and impermanence) after the movie premiere of Malcolm’s breakout film. Marie is miffed that she was not thanked in his speech. And so the tribulations begin with highs and lows anger and reconciliation strength and vulnerability displayed throughout the night.

There is a strong relationship between the home’s interior and exterior which the characters freely traverse but whereas the real-life owner’s emphasis is on looking out from the inside the film’s focus is looking inward. Director Sam Levinson says ""You begin to feel like they’re two snakes trapped in a jar and we’re not going to take the lid off."" We follow movement with the camera tracking along the exterior to reveal the characters’ separate activities inside as we follow their moods and distinct worlds which the home’s layout permits. With a serpentine spine the viewer is led down and around the house’s spaces.

Shot in the thick of the first lockdown Malcolm & Marie became an early model of how to film during the pandemic using strict protocols. The home’s remote location helped as did the natural ventilation. Passive heating and cooling plus the residence’s intrinsic circulation meant that the air was continually refreshed and no noisy heating or cooling was required.

The Caterpillar House has LEED Platinum status—it’s the first house on California’s Central Coast so designated—with radiant-heated floors photovoltaics low-energy windows and recycled insulation. The production team installed horizontal blinds and vertical drapes for dramatic emphasis (and for hiding lights and cables) more than function.

At first I thought the filmmakers had made their lives more difficult by choosing to shoot in black-and-white rather than color and in film rather than video. But Levinson says it is in homage to film history: He cites the golden age of Hollywood and the work of Joseph Losey (The Servant) while the cinematographer and production designer reference John Cassavetes (Opening Night Gloria) and Michelangelo Antonioni (La Notte The Passenger). In the film Malcolm admires director William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives Roman Holiday). The production team say the medium emphasizes ""emotional realism rather than aesthetic realism."" Another update is featuring Black stars in black-and-white film—something unheard of back then.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphY2tzb252aWxsZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2hvbWUtZ2FyZGVuL2hvdy10by8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L2dhcmRlbi1xLWEtd2hhdHMtd2ludGVyLWJ1dHRlcmZsaWVzLzQzNTk1NzMwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garden Q&A: What's with the winter butterflies?,"Becky Wern

The black-and-pale- yellow-striped Zebra Longwing butterfly can be spotted at this time of the year although it seems to defy all the things we are taught about butterflies. They are insects so they are cold-blooded unable to heat themselves. So how do they defy the cold temperatures?

They do prefer warm temperatures. Their normal range is from Peru north through Mexico and Texas and most of them wander south during our cold months. A few migrate north before the warm weather is consistently back and those are the ones we see. They can huddle up in cracks in tree bark or in foliage or close to the ground at night where the temperatures stay warmer.

In the summer Zebras tend to cluster in groups at night making them safer from predators. One may be picked off by a predator but their food contains a bad-tasting poison so it is unlikely that more than one will be eaten. In the winter there are fewer predators.

Once the sun is up the Zebra Longwing can perch in the sun and “catch the rays.” The sun can be reflected back and warm the insect body up. There is always something in bloom here so there is always something to draw nectar from.

Most butterflies live only for a few days or a week as adults but Zebra Longwings developed an ability that other butterflies have not. They collect pollen grains in their mouths and their saliva dissolves the pollen. That provides them with protein. The protein enables them to live longer lives.

The butterflies you see now hatched last fall and are waiting to mate this spring before they die. Zebra Longwings are Florida's state butterfly. To attract them you just need to grow passionflower vines in your yard. That plant is the larval food for their caterpillars; that is it’s the only thing their caterpillars will eat. Although you will have caterpillars the plant is a very vigorous grower and caterpillars will not permanently daunt the plant. As a bonus fritillary butterflies also use that plant for their larvae so you will also attract them. You will need a support for the vine. And it needs some space or it can overtake surrounding plants. And the flowers are amazing.

My roses never stopped blooming this year. How do I know when to prune them back?

Now is a good time to give some attention to your roses. Annually they need some pruning to remove older branches to prepare them for the spring flush even if they have been doling out blooms all winter long.

If you have some designated old roses approach them with a very light hand. The old roses don’t like heavy pruning and some will do very poorly with serious pruning. For them you are only removing any damaged branches (which you should do any time you spot them) crossing branches and spent flowers. It’s good to have a somewhat open plant in our humidity but don’t go crazy.

Hybrid roses can handle a firmer pruning with an eye toward an open bush older stems removed and thinnest stems cut back. Crossing branches should be removed. Dieback (branches dying back from the tip) should always be removed on any plant. Make your cuts so that the new bud is on the outside of the stem so that the branch will grow outward. There are great instructional videos online for anyone who is uneasy about pruning roses.

Every cut should be followed by a dip for your pruners in a sanitizing solution. Isopropyl alcohol is the preferred solution now. A bottle of alcohol should be in your tool caddy for easy access. You will need to find a recycled bottle with a wide mouth you can dip into easily Treat your pruners afterward with a little oil to prevent rust.

When your pruning is finished clear away all the branches you have removed to make sure any disease and insect remnants are removed. Go ahead and apply fertilizer even if it seems like winter is still here. It will take a few weeks for the fertilizer to travel the journey from the roots up through the plant. Apply fresh mulch for the year to begin the new year. In a few weeks your roses will reward you with a flush of beautiful blooms.

However the critter also suggests he won’t stay like that for long as he aims to reach the meadow where he will transform into a beautiful Butterfly. If I’m being honest that’s the absolute minimum I expect from a game featuring an insect embarking on a coming of age adventure. Or maybe I am just thinking too much into it.

Anyway Butterfly is a no-frills platforming game where you have to collect all the flowers to complete each level. There are 40 to beat in total and all take place on just the one screen – there’s no scrolling here. Rather oddly you’ll earn all 1000G that are up for grabs after completing just the first ten levels which will only take minutes to do.

In Butterfly it all seems acutely familiar. Visually the game is very reminiscent of Super Mario Bros. 3 right down to the clouds pipes and “?” blocks. Butterfly is presented in a 4:3 ratio and not especially pretty to look at – the colours don’t quite click giving the game a bootleg feel. The music is funky enough but it looks more at home being played on your internet browser or mobile phone if I’m being brutally honest.

The difference here versus other platformers however is that your little caterpillar can’t jump. Instead you will need to carefully bounce off enemies and navigate tubes in order to clear all 40 levels. This is where the puzzle element creeps in and if you don’t plan your path through the level it’s easy enough to miss a flower and be unable to go back and collect it. In this instance you’ll need to restart the level by hitting the “Y” button.

You’ll mainly be using the enemy wasps to navigate through the levels by bouncing off the top of them. However if you don’t position yourself correctly it’s easy enough to get stung and killed. You don’t have lives in Butterfly; instead you’ll just be taken back to the start of level to try again.

To aid your platforming exploits your caterpillar handles with a very floaty feel as you travel through the air making it fairly easy to land where you need to. You use the left thumbstick to move around but rather oddly you cannot use the D-pad. As a result you’ll endlessly enter pipes without meaning to as the game thinks you are pushing up with the thumbstick. It’s not often a major issue however it does get very irritating.

Butterfly on balance is an easy game to play. The challenge lies in figuring out the order in which to play each level. Some will stump you momentarily however none will give you too much trouble after a short while when assessing the situation in front of you. There are a couple of levels that look like horrendous creations from Super Mario Maker but they look more difficult than they are.

Some of the later levels will change up the gameplay a little by introducing “!” blocks and blue birds who will pursue you around the level. The “!” blocks will become transparent when you defeat all the wasps on the level meaning you will have to again carefully plan your route so as to collect all the flowers. The blue birds cannot be killed and if they reach you they will instantly polish you off for dinner. Again these are minor developments to the gameplay however they remain common platforming elements; there’s nothing here that you won’t have seen before.

Therein lies the main issue with Butterfly. Its simplicity (by today’s standards) means it feels less like a tribute to games of the era and more like a lacklustre attempt to imitate them. This is highlighted by the numerous other games in the genre out there many of which feel much more polished as a whole.

Butterfly on Xbox is an average puzzle platformer that doesn’t do enough to catch your eye. It will only set you back a few quid but doesn’t do enough to stand out from the crowd.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvZmViLzA3L2EtcGljdHVyZS1vZi1kb21lc3RpYy1ibGlzcy13aHktd2V2ZS1mYWxsZW4taW4tbG92ZS13aXRoLXN0aWxsLWxpZmXSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDIxL2ZlYi8wNy9hLXBpY3R1cmUtb2YtZG9tZXN0aWMtYmxpc3Mtd2h5LXdldmUtZmFsbGVuLWluLWxvdmUtd2l0aC1zdGlsbC1saWZl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A picture of domestic bliss: why we've fallen in love with still life,"At a time when domesticity and what’s inside the home makes up the majority of what most people encounter in their daily lives the still life is having a resurgence on social media – from influencers sharing their own photographs of satsumas and candles to posting 18th-century paintings of shells and corals.

The still-life hashtag has more than six million Instagram posts. Lucy Williams an influencer with more than 490000 followers has been posting shots of lamps and lemons throughout lockdown. Fashion industry insider Ben Cobb recently shared an 18th-century still life by French painter Anne Vallayer-Coster on his feed while interior designer Luke Edward Hall has been posting shots of just-opening narcissi against books.

“One of our top-performing posts in the past 30 days is a still life painted by Rachel Ruysch” says Abigail Tavener social media manager at Sotheby’s London. Still lifes she says “can be counted among our best-performing content with a handful of examples garnering more than 10000 likes – double our average number of likes-per-post.”

A clutch of artists are also giving the still life contemporary currency on Instagram. Sydney-based painter Gabrielle Penfold came to still lifes in a very Instagram-first way after being struck by the craze for everyone documenting their food. She started painting similar scenes: “I would put it on Instagram and people would respond really well.”

For her this is what a still life is: “It’s something that resonates with people … nothing harsh to have hanging on your wall. It makes you feel happy – and especially in these times you want to feel good!”

Miriam Dema is another of the artists. “What I like the most about still-life paintings is that they are a reflection of a specific moment … and that they give value to everyday elements that would otherwise be lost in oblivion.”

Of course not everyone has the luxury of being able to stay at home but at a time when the domestic sphere makes up the majority of many people’s days it also feels apt that a medium elevating the everyday – the literal bread and butter or ephemera of daily life – is finding fans. Hall has always enjoyed photographing bits and pieces at home but “because I’ve been spending much more time at home I’ve naturally ended up taking more photographs in the house”.

Plus he says “maybe the pandemic has allowed us to look at existing things we have at home with fresh eyes? Perhaps people are rediscovering the joy of their homely objects of cooking and growing things and then photographing the results?” While authentic to the genre it also resonates that fruit vegetables seafood wine and coffee often star – for many people food has become more central than usual.

For a number of those composing or painting still lifes during the pandemic they are an expression of ebullience. “To me it represents the exaltation of beauty and the enjoyment of the senses” says interior designer Pino Bravo who recently posted lemons alongside a candle and a David Hume quote: “Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.”

The movement ties into the ongoing love of tablescaping a trend that means that shots of artfully laid tables are three-a-penny on Instagram feeding into the still-life aesthetic. It has also been bolstered by the pandemic craze for knick-knacks. In July last year former lifestyle site Repeller declared: We’ve Reached Peak Tchotchke referring to objects that are “decorative rather than strictly functional”. Pictures of ornaments have similarly been filtering on to Instagram making content out of shots of vases and kitsch busts.

Looking to art history the still life genre has often been linked to mortality and death – the vanitas for instance is a type of still life specifically designed to remind the viewer of their own mortality. But the current crop on social media scream of life.

Penfold describes her paintings of mackerel artichokes figs and cheese as “celebrations of life”. Hall also sees his shots of objects that way: “When I walk past a collection of favourite treasured objects I’m filled with joy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbW9wYXJpbnNpZGVycy5jb20vdGhlLWRpZXNlbC1wb3dlcmVkLTE5OTktZG9kZ2UtcG93ZXItd2Fnb24tY29uY2VwdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Diesel-Powered 1999 Dodge Power Wagon Concept:,"The name Power Wagon has earned itself the reputation of being the most capable off-road pickup on the market. With 2021 being the 75th anniversary of the original 1946 workhorse we figured we would take a look back at one of the most popular concept vehicles of the last three decades that wore the Power Wagon nameplate proudly.

At the turn of the century the then DaimlerChrysler design studio was turning out some of the most beautiful and desired concept vehicles in the automotive industry. Following a trend that was starting to become popular for American automakers at the time the then Dodge brand decided to revive the Power Wagon nameplate which had been absent from the brand’s lineup since 1980.

Drawing on the heritage and classic proportions of the original Power Wagon the 1999 Dodge Power Wagon added a modern and high-tech twist to the nameplate.

While most people complain the current 2021 Ram 2500 Power Wagon does not offer a diesel option the Power Wagon Concept did! Under the hood was a 7.2-liter direct-injection inline-six-cylinder turbodiesel however it wasn’t a Cummins. Instead it was a Caterpillar 3126 diesel which made about 300 horsepower and 780 lb.-ft. of torque which was paired to a 4-speed automatic transmission. At the time the 5.9-liter Cummins 24-valve inline-six-cylinder turbodiesel was rated at 235 horsepower and 460 lb.-ft. of torque which made the Caterpillar look even more like a powerhouse at the time.

The handsome exterior of the Power Wagon was created by Head of Jeep® Design Mark Allen. At the time Allen was Senior Designer for the Dodge Truck studio creating not only the Power Wagon Concept but vehicles like the 1997 Dodge Dakota Sidewinder and 2001 Dodge PowerBox Concept.

“Early in the design process we debated whether to do a basic work truck versus an upscale truck” Allen said back in 1999. “We chose to distance ourselves from the ultimate simplicity of the original truck. That’s why you don’t see the spare tire mounted on the side of the truck box or free-standing headlamps. I see this as a thrill-seeker’s truck for the gear-oriented sports enthusiast. It’s the vehicle to take you rock climbing or mountain biking.”

Using a cab that was similar in size to the 1999 Dodge Dakota Club Cab allowed the design to portray the classic proportions of the original truck. Like the Ram Quad Cab models of the time the Power Wagon Concept featured rear-hinged half doors to provide easier access to the rear storage area. Instead of adding extra seating the design team chose to expand the storage space with drawers built into the back of the cab – something that would inspire the interior storage of the upcoming 2002 Ram 1500 Regular Cab models.

“While working on the clay model we brought a red 1946 Power Wagon into the studio” said Allen. “From the pictures we thought it was humongous but it was dwarfed when placed next to the 1999 concept.”

Allen and his team didn’t go to futuristic with the concept. Separated bumpers fenders and running boards which highlighted the original truck’s design added returned to the modern concept. The gray raw steel bumpers of the Power Wagon contrast the Silver Metallic-painted body and aluminum details on the gas cap door handles hinges and wheels add to the truck’s more modern design. A power-actuated tailgate made loading and unloading even easier.

Upfront was the bold crosshair grille which only remains on the Ram 1500 Classic today. Just like today’s Power Wagon the concept vehicle featured a front-mounted power winch. Gas-discharged projector-beam headlamps are all but dead in today’s world thanks to the modernization of LEDs but the Power Wagon Concept was ahead of its time.

Many functional aspects of the vehicle are revealed. Angled slits in the sheet metal exposed the engine compartment. No attempt was made to cover the axles that show below the truck. Aluminum fasteners and bolts were also exposed throughout the vehicle an idea Allen borrowed from Miller race car engines.

Steve Sowinski who was responsible for the Power Wagon interior design had a goal to bring the same kind of finished detailed look to the interior as the exterior. European ash wood was used on the floor of the cab behind the seats also is featured in the box of the Power Wagon Concept. Stainless steel shift levers and door handles contrast with the distressed leather seats in keeping a more upscale theme of the concept.

“People will have to stretch their imaginations to find similarities between the interior of this Power Wagon and the 1946 original” Sowinski said. “Whereas the original was a study in raw steel we used a mix of new materials to get a clean high-tech look.”

Cognac-colored leather was the primary interior shade with granite-colored leather for the accents. Various-sized drawers as well as a netted pouch lined the back of the cab for convenient storage. The instrument panel gauges all resided within a single round steering cluster similar to a chronometer watch and created a clean and fresh design approach.

Unlike the production Power Wagon of today which is based on the 3/4-ton Ram 2500 the 1999 Dodge Power Wagon Concept was based on the Ram 1500 architecture. The concept truck featured link-coil suspension fore and aft with a Dana 44 front axle and 9.25-inch Chrysler rear and featuring a 3.90:1 final gear ratio. The Power Wagon wore 19-inch x 10-inch polished 5-spoke aluminum wheels wrapped in custom Goodyear 35-inch x 12-inch tires. Those wheels would later make production as a 17-inch unit on the 2002 Ram 1500 SLT Plus.

Stopping power was provided by vented disc brake rotors with four-piston calipers in the front and single-piston calipers in the rear from the Dodge Viper GTS Coupe.

While many of the design features of the 1999 Dodge Power Wagon Concept did make production in some form the concept was ultimately to showcase future diesel technology. It wouldn’t be until 2005 that the Dodge brand would bring back the Power Wagon nameplate once again to highlight a future off-road Ram 2500 model.

CBRE released a report this week ranking the development prospects in America’s 50 most popular metro areas and placed Denver sixth overall trailing only Atlanta Dallas Phoenix Orlando Fla. and Seattle.

The analysis ranked Denver among the top 20 metro areas in the four big commercial development segments. The city was ranked third for opportunities for future multifamily housing fourth for new retail 11th for industrial development and 16th for office space.

“Years of strong population and employment growth have triggered steady demand for additional capacity within nearly all facets of local real estate” Pete Schippits CBRE’s Denver-based president for the Mountain-Northwest division based said in a news release.

CBRE’s rankings were based on construction costs the strength of the market fundamentals underpinning the existing real estate supply performance during the last economic cycle and property forecasts.

The report singled out Denver’s multifamily market — that being apartments but also condos — for its strong performance during the metro area’s decade-long boom before the pandemic. The city ranked seventh in the nation for new units filled over the last 10 years and saw more rent growth than all but three other cities. That growth was painful for many renters but it’s bait on the hook for developers and investors

Earlier this week Charlotte N.C.-based Crescent Communities announced it was starting construction on a 483-unit luxury apartment building at 1300 40th St. in Denver’s Cole neighborhood. The $181 million project called Novel RiNo in reference to the River North Art District will also include retail space and an undisclosed number of affordable units according to a news release.

“Denver is a place we identified years ago for its long-term potential and we are excited to find an opportunity that matches our investment criteria” Jonathan Winson a senior vice president with Dart Interests the project’s equity partner said in a statement.

The city’s office market has taken a beating during the pandemic. Office space available for sublease shot up by 86% during the pandemic reaching 4.7 million square feet by the end of 2020 according to CBRE research.

The number of office jobs in Denver is expected to grow by 5.4% over the next three years — good for the 35th best rate out of the 50 markets analyzed — but slow growth doesn’t mean there won’t be opportunities for development. Changing needs and demands brought on by the pandemic are causing employers across the nation to reconsider their workspaces according to CBRE research.

“We expect to see a significant uptick in tenant fit-out projects in 2021 as employers redesign and reconfigure spaces to accommodate new standards in health wellness and safety” Jim Dobleske CBRE global president of project management said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE5NjkyOTEvY2FuLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy1zYXZlLXdld29ya9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can the pandemic save WeWork?,"In an S-1 filing ahead of its ill-fated IPO attempt WeWork included a recession among its risk factors. What it didn’t anticipate was a pandemic.

Over the past year offices have shuttered around the world. Downtown centers became ghost towns and revenue dropped sharply for coworking spaces as clients ditched short-term leases. In the second quarter of 2020 US flex office space leasing activity was down 45% year-over-year according to a report from CBRE. Just this week coworking space Knotel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

But it’s not all bad news. Over months of Zoom calls and Slack check-ins office workers have had plenty of time to mull what it would mean to go (back) to the office. And while demand for flexible space has fallen commercial real estate analysts say the future for coworking looks bright—in part because big companies are now joining solo entrepreneurs in prizing office-space flexibility. Before the pandemic commercial real estate firm JLL estimated that 30% of global offices would be on flexible terms by 2030. A year later its prediction hasn’t changed.

Flex office providers will need to cut costs and restructure to stay afloat while IRL life remains partially on hold according to Ben Munn head of global flex space operations at JLL. They will also need to prepare for increased competition: In-office perks like health and wellbeing sites could become more common and even hotels and retail sites are looking to expand into coworking.

And yet it was only 15 months ago that we witnessed the dramatic rise and fall of WeWork. Part of the class of post-2008 startups with a mission to change the world WeWork founder Adam Neumann told anyone who would listen that an office-sharing company complete with cold brew and standing phone booths could “elevate the world’s consciousness.” Investors bought it and WeWork’s valuation skyrocketed to $47 billion in 2019. But reports soon emerged of a reckless culture excessive spending un-CEO-like behavior and corporate misgovernance.

Since Neumann’s exit WeWork has kept a low profile. In one year CEO Sandeep Mathrani has reportedly cut the company’s burn rate by half; it now has at least $3 billion in cash on its balance sheet plus a $1 billion commitment from majority owner SoftBank. And thanks to a flurry of IPOs via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) this could even be the year WeWork finally goes public.

“All our common areas are completely de-densified with at least six feet of separation between people even on our couches. All the dedicated desks are separated at least six feet apart. We’ve enhanced the cleaning and sanitization. We’ve changed the entire filtration system in all buildings with HEPA filters.

Here’s a quick refresher on WeWork’s infamous founder:

Adam Neumann now 41 was born in Israel spent some of his childhood living in a kibbutz

In 2001 he moved to New York and studied business at Baruch College. Neumann would later tell Baruch’s graduating class of 2017 that he spent his early NYC days going to clubs figuring out how to get rich and “hitting on every girl in the city.”

Before WeWork Neumann’s entrepreneurial pursuits included a collapsible-high-heel shoe for women and baby clothes with built-in kneepads.

The word “Adam” appeared 169 times filed to go public

Adam is married to Rebekah Neumann who formerly served as WeWork’s chief brand officer and CEO of now-defunct WeGrow. They have five kids.

At least two TV series based on the Neumann saga are in the works

There is fierce competition among brokers including the likes of Charles Schwab and Fidelity for their business. This broke out into an all-out price war in 2019 when these firms cut stock-trading commissions to zero four years after Robinhood a startup promising commission-free trading came on the scene. Retail participation in stock trading is at a new high.

This happy picture is somewhat muddied by the practice of payment for order flow ( PFOF ). Instead of charging users for each trade brokers are paid by marketmakers to direct users’ trades—or “order flow”—through them. Marketmakers take small profits on the difference between the price that a broker’s user pays and that at which a share is offered for sale in the market. The mania around GameStop a seller of video games has put the practice and its practitioners in the spotlight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAyLTA2L3JvYmluaG9vZC1zLWNvbGxhdGVyYWwtY3J1bmNoLWV4cGxhbmF0aW9uLXB1enpsZXMtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robinhood's Collateral-Crunch Explanation Puzzles Wall Street,"Why did this happen?

A firm that was worth $200m in April last year was briefly valued at $30bn before falling back to Earth.

Look beyond the memes and the mania though and the story tells you something about the deep structural changes in financial markets.

""Prior to that no kind of communication from government whatsoever"" he said.

Birth alerts allowed social workers or hospitals to flag expectant parents they thought might put their newborns at risk. The province ended the practice last week.

Bernstein said he would have expected to be consulted if the government was considering such a change.

""I would have expected the phone call to come from the government looking at a significant change in policy that would impact upon the rights the interests and well-being of newborn high-risk infants"" he said.

Bernstein said something that has been absent from government communications is children's rights in this matter.

""Who's speaking for those infant children?

""There's no reference in any of these communications to the impact upon these children or the rights that children have under the convention or the rights that children have under the charter. They're not subordinate to adult rights. So I haven't seen any of that in the messaging. So that creates some concerns in my mind"" he said.

Bernstein said he has asked government for a full briefing on the matter. As of Saturday he had not received a response he said.

New office

He said that since this is a new office there might be a learning curve in how it's supposed to interact with government.

""I'm hoping that we can turn the corner and that this is just a blip and that we can restore good working relationships.""

In 2019 the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls described birth alerts with words like ""racist"" and ""discriminatory.""

Bernstein said he is unable to offer an opinion on birth alerts in P.E.I. because of the lack of consultation on the subject.

""I don't know what the data is"" he said. ""I don't know how many of these birth alerts have been issued.""

He said he recognizes that the move comes after stark criticism from the 2019 inquiry. But he said if he had been consulted it could have contributed to a more nuanced discussion based on the situation in P.E.I.

A statement from the province said that the practice of providing birth alerts to hospitals was a historical one that was not authorized by the Child Protection Act.

It also said that the act places the obligation on the child and youth advocate to request information from the government and no request was received in this case.

""Government acted in a manner consistent with the applicable legislation; however the Province recognizes that earlier communication with the Child and Youth Advocate on the topic of birth alerts may have offered that office an opportunity to provide an additional perspective in the decision making process"" the statement said.

For context always refer to the full article.

Chevron which is now Noble Midstream's largest customer says taking full ownership of the assets will help it streamline their governance

Chevron Corporation said on Friday February 5 it offered to buy shares in Noble Midstream Partners LP that it does not already own in a deal valuing the company at $1.13 billion months after the United States oil major bought the pipeline operator’s sponsor Noble Energy.

Chevron the second largest US oil producer in October closed a $4.1-billion all-stock purchase of smaller rival Noble Energy gaining a nearly 63% stake in Noble Midstream alongside large shale and international natural gas reserves.

The US oil giant said it had offered to buy the rest of Noble Midstream at $12.47 per common unit in line with its closing price on Thursday February 4.

Noble Midstream’s units rose more than 6% to $13.13 in early trade on Friday slightly above the offer price.

While this consolidation was the most likely outcome after Chevron’s Noble Energy takeover the market is likely to focus on previous similar deals that required premiums to get over the finish line Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. analysts wrote in a note.

Noble Midstream’s investors however should not expect a sweetened bid or a competitive offer because Chevron owns its parent said Ethan Bellamy managing director of midstream strategy at East Daley Capital Advisors.

“We expect the transaction to be consummated expeditiously without regulatory impediments” Bellamy said.

San Ramon California-based Chevron which is now Noble Midstream’s largest customer said taking full ownership of the assets will help it streamline their governance.

“The transaction’s biggest benefit to Chevron is to simplify its corporate entity” said Rob Thummel energy portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.

Infrastructure assets also give steadier more stable cash flows than oil drilling businesses Thummel said noting that midstream cash flow is based on the volume of products moved on Noble Midstream’s network.

The pipeline operator provides crude oil natural gas and water-related gathering processing and transportation services in the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Delaware Basin in Texas.

Any deal agreement is subject to talks and will need Noble Midstream board’s approval Chevron said. – Rappler.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vY2FyLWluc3VyYW5jZS9hMzU0Mzc1MzIvcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtYXV0by1pbnN1cmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Progressive Auto Insurance: Everything You Need to Know,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/car-insurance/a35437532/progressive-auto-insurance/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vY2FyLWluc3VyYW5jZS9hMzU0Mzc1MzIvcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtYXV0by1pbnN1cmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The commercial starts off with a young boy asking his sister if she thinks his burrito could change the world. When she tells him it can’t he begins imagining exactly how much impact a burrito could have on agriculture.

“It could change how we plant things and grow things” he narrates over footage of farmers. “And improve the dirt where we grow those things.”

He explains how a burrito could alter the process of watering picking and transporting food. “It could make us more responsible and sustainable” he says.

As he sits in the back of a pick up truck the boy concludes that by being more organic and more real a burrito can definitely be world-changing.

The woman said the man made small talk about the apartments across the street before demanding she give him her car keys the affidavit states.

The woman told officers she immediately started calling for help.

Brown began threatening to blow up the church and said he worked for the president before running away the affidavit states.

When officers arrived at the church on Cheyenne Blvd. they received a burglary call from the Nashville Korean Seventh-Day Adventist Church next door.

WEST COLUMBIA S.C. — Members of the Suburban Baptist Church in West Columbia are spreading a message of love after their building was vandalized on Friday.

Sunday's sermon from Suburban Baptist Church Associate Pastor Elijah Smalls was a message of forgiveness and love to the people who spray-painted parts of the church's exterior and ministry home across the street.

""The same way they spray-painted our door it'll be the same door that will open up to show them love"" he says.

The graffiti ranged from messages such as ""Save Gaza"" and ""Welcome to Hell"" to various obscene depictions. West Columbia District 5 Councilman Mickey Pringle said he was heartbroken to see this happen to a staple in the community.

""I was totally shocked because Suburban has been a part of this community forever and all of the good things they do; serving the people of this community. I was like 'Who would even do something like that"" he says.

Sunday was a different scene with the doors painted white and the church sign covered by a poster board. Pastor Tracy Mcgee said a member of the West Columbia Police Department came to their aid and provided the temporary fixes.

""He called and he said 'I got to get those doors with the pornography on them painted; you can't walk through church doors like that'"" McGee said. ""We're blessed; we have a professional crew coming out the early part of next week. We had an outside individual that really wanted to pay for that. The one that wanted to do that is a Palestinian-American.”

According to West Columbia Mayor Tem Miles who was sitting in a pew during Sunday’s service the city is working to find those responsible. He adds that the vandals also damaged other parts of the neighborhood.

“Some homes around here were vandalized; some public property street signs were vandalized” he said. ""We got folks who are working to figure out who it is within our community or outside of our community; came here and did these things. We're going to make sure they receive the attention they deserve.""

Mayor Miles said the city is still looking for the suspects and had no updates on their investigation.

During Sunday's sermon Pastor McGee spent nearly 30 minutes addressing the crime and reminding the church about grace but also consequences.

""God never said 'I'll take the circumstances away.' He simply said 'I will still love you and I can forgive you of your sins but He paid a price"" McGee said.

Pastor McGee said the community response has been overwhelming with calls from around the country.

""From Canada Texas all over the Carolinas - calling and pledging and wanting to do what they can do for the church"" he said. ""We're a very humble church a very small church so God has sat there and said 'I've got you; I've got you covered.""

Councilman Pringle said he hopes this will bring West Columbia together.

""Pastor Tracy he's been a part of this community for a long time and hopefully everybody will rally to their support and give them the support they need"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEwMTFub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDQvc291dGhlYXN0LWxpbmNvbG4tY2h1cmNoLXN1c3RhaW5zLTE1LW1pbGxpb24tZGFtYWdlLWZpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southeast Lincoln church sustains $1.5 million in damage from fire,"LINCOLN Neb. (KOLN) - Lincoln Fire and Rescue responded to a fire at New Covenant Community Church on Saturday.

According to LFR a call for smoke showing from the church came in just before 3 a.m. When crews arrived they reported fire into the roof.

LFR said a lightning strike is suspected but not confirmed to be the cause of the fire.

According to the fire inspector’s initial estimate the fire caused $1.5 million in damage to the building with a large amount of the damage up in-between the roof and the ceiling.

A spokesperson for the church said on social media that the church will hold a gathering on Sunday in the front parking lot at 10:30 a.m. for worship and prayer. Any additional service and programming has been cancelled. The spokesperson also asked that people avoid going inside the church for the time being due to multiple hazards.

Representatives of the church have already met with insurance and a crew is on site to begin clean-up and restoration.

This incident is still under investigation. Stay connected to 1011now.com for the latest updates.

(WIS) - The West Columbia community is now rallying around one local Church that was vandalized with graphic images and messages of “Save Gaza” and “Free Palestine” amid the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Since the Suburban Baptist Church was hit with vandalism late Thursday night the West Columbia Police Department has begun to help clean up the mess by replacing the front sign and painting the front doors at the church.

“I was very shocked” said Megan Hobbs a member of the congregation at the Suburban Baptist Church.

Hobbs and other members of the Suburban Baptist Church couldn’t believe what they woke up to on Friday morning as they found pro-Palestine messages and profanity spray painted on the front and side doors of the church building.

The Church’s Mission House across the street which houses their food pantry was also vandalized.

Senior Pastor Tracy McGee said he started getting phone calls around 4 a.m. on Friday morning that his church had been vandalized. He and Assistant Pastor Elijah Smalls were in disbelief to learn about and see what had happened.

“When I got here and saw all the spray paint on the doors I couldn’t believe it” Smalls said.

“That stuff happens in New York City; it doesn’t happen in West Columbia” McGee added.

McGee says the graphic nature of the spray paint was jarring. In his 17 years at the Church he’s never seen anything like this.

“(I’m in) disbelief that something like this would happen and how far the craziness in this world has come” McGee said.

Luckily efforts to divide the Church’s congregation and damper their faith were unsuccessful as they held Sunday Service as normal the same week of the incident.

On Saturday McGee says a West Columbia Police Sergeant came to personally repaint the doors of the Church building. On Sunday churchgoers walked through the doors without having to stare at the profanity.

“He was up here and the pornography and the ‘Save Gaza’ was taken off the doors so we didn’t have to walk through that this morning” Mcgee said “What a strong revelation.”

Since the incident McGee has gotten phone calls from pastors across the country reaching out from as far as Austin Texas with messages of solidarity.

West Columbia Mayor Tem Miles also came out to Sunday Service to show his support and help their faith triumph over the hate.

“At the end of the day we need to all figure out a way to be better to each other and take care of each other while we’re here” Miles said.

Tracy also says despite the vandalism this incident won’t stop the church’s efforts and they’ll be back for service again next Sunday.

As of May 5th 2024 West Columbia Police says they have not charged anyone with vandalizing the property but that the investigation is ongoing.

Saat itu Rofi dan kerabat lainnya pun tidak menyangka adik kandung kakeknya tersebut akan menyusul mendiang istrinya menghadap sang khaliq dalam waktu sekejap.

Selama membina rumah tangga pasangan Hj Ummi Munawaroh dan H Fathkan Sibyan belum dikaruniai keturunan tetapi keduanya merupakan pasangan setia dan romantis.

Kemana-mana selalu berdua

""Keduanya pergi kemana-mana selalu berdua termasuk setiap shalat berjamaah pun berangkatnya ke masjid bersama naik vespa"" ungkapnya.

Semasa hidupnya beliau berdua dikenal orang yang baik dengan siapa pun dan rajin beribadah sehingga kepergiannya meninggalkan duka yang mendalam bagi kerabat tetangga dan sejawat serta warga lainnya.

Selain itu pasutri yang membuka usaha toko konveksi Al Ihsan di jalan Gajah Mada Bojonegoro tersebut juga dikenal oleh masyarakat sekitar sebagai orang yang dermawan.

Mendirikan dua masjid dimakamkan satu liang lahat

Bahkan sebelum mereka dipanggil menghadap sang khaliq beberapa waktu lalu mereka telah mendirikan dua masjid di Desa Campurejo dan Ngunut yang diberi nama masjid Al Ichsan.

""Sebelum meninggal dunia Mbah Fathkan membangun masjid dan pondok mas semoga amal ibadah keduanya diterima Allah SWT dan keduanya ditempatkan di dalam surga. Amin"" ucapnya.

Sebagai penghormatan terakhir ratusan warga turut dalam mengantarkan pasutri sehidup-semati tersebut ke peristirahatan terakhir dan keduanya dimakamkan dalam satu liang lahat di makam Islam kelurahan setempat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2phYmFyLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvY2ludGEtdGVybGFyYW5nLXBhay1ndXJ1LWRhbi1zaXN3aS1zbXAtZGktYmxpdGFyLXN1ZGFoLWJlcmphbGFuLXRpZ2EtdGFodW4tdGVydW5na2FwLWdhcmEtZ2FyYS1pbmnSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9qYWJhci50cmlidW5uZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9jaW50YS10ZXJsYXJhbmctcGFrLWd1cnUtZGFuLXNpc3dpLXNtcC1kaS1ibGl0YXItc3VkYWgtYmVyamFsYW4tdGlnYS10YWh1bi10ZXJ1bmdrYXAtZ2FyYS1nYXJhLWluaQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CINTA TERLARANG Pak Guru dan Siswi SMP di Blitar Sudah Berjalan Tiga Tahun Terungkap Gara-gara Ini,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://jabar.tribunnews.com/2021/02/07/cinta-terlarang-pak-guru-dan-siswi-smp-di-blitar-sudah-berjalan-tiga-tahun-terungkap-gara-gara-ini on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2phYmFyLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvY2ludGEtdGVybGFyYW5nLXBhay1ndXJ1LWRhbi1zaXN3aS1zbXAtZGktYmxpdGFyLXN1ZGFoLWJlcmphbGFuLXRpZ2EtdGFodW4tdGVydW5na2FwLWdhcmEtZ2FyYS1pbmnSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9qYWJhci50cmlidW5uZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9jaW50YS10ZXJsYXJhbmctcGFrLWd1cnUtZGFuLXNpc3dpLXNtcC1kaS1ibGl0YXItc3VkYWgtYmVyamFsYW4tdGlnYS10YWh1bi10ZXJ1bmdrYXAtZ2FyYS1nYXJhLWluaQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vaG90LmRldGlrLmNvbS9jZWxlYi9kLTUzNjQ0OTUvaWthdGFuLWNpbnRhLWRpZGVuZGEtcnAtMjAtanV0YS1hbWFuZGEtbWFub3BvLXNlYnV0LWFkYS15YW5nLXNpcmlr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ikatan Cinta Didenda Rp 20 Juta Amanda Manopo Sebut Ada yang Sirik,"Beberapa waktu lalu sinetron Ikatan Cinta terkena masalah. Manajemen dari tayangan yang sedang mendapatkan rating tinggi itu didenda oleh Pemerintah Kabupaten Bogor.

Denda itu dijatuhkan karena proses syuting Ikatan Cinta disebut melanggar protokol kesehatan. Pemerintah Kabupaten Bogor kemudian mengganjar mereka dengan denda sebesar Rp 20 juta.

Sebagai salah satu bintang utamanya Amanda Manopo menduga ada pihak yang sirik dengan kesuksesan sinetronnya. Ia menyebut pihak itu mencoba untuk menjatuhkan Ikatan Cinta dengan beberapa cara.

Padahal menurutnya sebelum proses syuting dilakukan para pemain dan kru rutin menjalani tes swab untuk mendeteksi infeksi virus COVID-19. Mereka juga secara rutin disuntik vitamin untuk menjaga kesehatan.

""Aku mau kasih tahu kalau misalnya kita semua dari kru pemain supir siapapun itu sampai pihak hotel semuanya sudah dilakukan swab test. Satu minggu selalu didatengin dokter untuk suntik vitamin"" ujarnya melalui Instagram Live.

Amanda Manopo mengatakan pelanggaran protokol kesehatan yang disebutkan bukan dari internal manajemen Ikatan Cinta. Ia menyebut banyak orang yang datang ke lokasi syuting hanya untuk menyaksikan jalannya proses tersebut.

""Kesalahannya itu terjadi pada penonton atau fans-fans Ikatan Cinta yang datang tanpa permintaan atau tanpa persetujuan kita. Mereka hadir hanya ingin datang niatannya baik sebenarnya ingin bertemu tetapi dengan salahnya COVID yang terjadi saat ini"" katanya.

Bukan cuma itu wanita yang hubungannya dengan Billy Syahputra dikabarkan kandas itu menilai Ikatan Cinta menuai kesuksesan. Ia juga mengatakan ada pihak yang sirik dengan sinetronnya.

""Dari sinetron Ikatan Cinta ini kan banyak yang suka banyak yang nonton banyak yang mendukung. Jadi gimana pun caranya pasti ada aja orang yang sirik ada aja orang yang nggak suka"" duga Amanda Manopo.

""Pasti gimana caranya untuk menjatuhkannya lewat dengan berbagai cara mungkin lewat dari pemain gosip-gosip yang tersebar atau apa yang terjadi pada saat ini. Dengan jalan cerita yang dijatuhkan atau dengan cara apapun lah yang bisa menjatuhkan"" tutupnya.

This article was published 05/02/2021 (1185 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

With a bit of a cold snap fishing for many species has slowed down in this part of the word. One species that doesn’t get as much attention during the winter months is the mighty northern pike.

This year has been a good one for big fish the second year in a row. Much of this can be attributed to the extended period of stable mild weather. Fish activity level is affected by cold fronts or extreme changes in temperatures. We have been fortunate this year in that regard. It does look like the rest of February will get substantially colder though.

Big pike love this kind of stability roaming constantly in search of food. There have been two bodies of water of note one Lake of the Prairies and the other the north basin of Lake Winnipeg. Last year Phil Paczkowski of Roblin caught and released his personal best pike from Lake of the Prairies. It measured 119 centimetres (47 inches) and by using the weight conversion chart weighed approximately 15 kilograms (33 pounds).

Supplied Jeff Gustafson holding a Lake of the Woods pike caught on a tip-up.

Paczkowski is a pike catching machine with many fish over the 100 centimetre mark to his credit. He likes to set his tip-ups on a big sand flat next to the main river channel. This area is about three metres in depth. He prefers that area because when the fish are up on this flat he believes they are actively looking for food. Roger Gere and his wife Sue have also been catching some big pike on that reservoir. Roger has been targeting two to five metres for the pike and about six metres for large perch. Fishing on the reservoir has slowed a bit in the last week.

Dave Shymr has spent years fine tuning his approach to catching big pike through the ice. When he goes fishing he takes note of the barometric pressure and moon phase as two key pieces of the puzzle. In periods of low pressure he says pike tend to become inactive moving to deeper water and staying in one spot. He doesn’t pack his gear and go home though it simply means downsizing your baits and covering ground. He compares it to fishing for fussy spread out perch or walleye.

PEAK TIMES FOR TROPHY PIKE

Dave has his best success during the initial falling of pressure and a day after the rising of pressure from a normal state. When the pike are active he will upsize his bait which could be a 10-inch-long herring. He does carry a wide variety of dead bait and will change up often to see what is working. It helps to have two or three other anglers along so you can fine tune presentations a lot quicker.

MOON PHASE IMPORTANT

Moon phase is also a key factor in the pike fishing world but does vary with the body of water to some degree. Dave will document every day on the ice and he includes the following: moon phase barometric pressure temperature wind location depth presentation size and kind of bait and time of day.

One thing all hardcore pike fisherman agree on is that the use of tip-ups is the best way to catch them at this time of the year. Professional angler Jeff Gustafson (Gussy) loves to target them on his home waters of Lake of the Woods. He agrees that by far the best method is by using tip-ups and dead bait. He can’t believe more anglers don’t use them or even own one.

He prefers to use the Frabill Pro Thermal Round Tip-Up. While they have been around for years he says they are great because they cover the hole. While they do provide some insulation to keep the hole from icing over as fast they keep blowing snow and bright light from entering the hole which he is a big fan of. Gussy uses a heavy line usually 40-pound test designed for fishing on tip-ups. It’s strong and does not tangle and you can easily handle it with gloves on.

For bait frozen cisco is his favourite which he catches through the ice while fishing other species Gussy says cisco are aggressive and like to eat small panfish-sized spoons so if you find them they are easy to catch. When using dead bait he recommends a quick strike rig which has two treble hooks.

When rigging up the bait put one treble in the head of the bait and one in the back usually around the dorsal fin. Gussy lets the bait hit the bottom then lifts it up about one metre above bottom so it hangs horizontal. When a fish bites he lets it run briefly then sets the hook with a long sweep. With a quick strike setup and fairly quick hookset the fish will not swallow the bait too deeply allowing for a quick safe release.

Anglers Notes

Ice Fishing Derbies had been a huge part of Manitoba winters until the pandemic swept in. One enterprising company in the U.S developed an app that allows tournaments to proceed virtually. The Fish Donkey app has hosted over 4000 virtual tournaments and derbies during the last year.

When Todd Berga the manager of The Fishin’ Hole in Winnipeg was approached with the idea of holding a charitable event using this platform he jumped at the chance.

Called The Full Tilt Winter Walleye Tournament this charity event will be in support of The Children’s Hospital of Manitoba. Berga says his store will donate $1000 for the largest walleye caught by a male angler. Funk’s Toyota are sponsoring the female biggest walleye category and donated $1000.00 for that prize. The tournament will run for 16 days from Feb. 20 to March 7. Berga says there will be daily prizes as well during the length of the event and entries are pouring in.

All you need to do is download the Fishdonkey app on your phone then search for Full Tilt Winter Walleye. Adults can register for $50 and youth under the age of 16 for $25.

When using this app all you do is take a couple pictures of your catch and submit. If you are not sure how there is a great video on the app that details how to do this. With many charitable donations down because of the pandemic this is the future.

For those unaware of ClamAV you should know that this is an open source antivirus and multiplatform (It has versions for Windows GNU / Linux BSD Solaris Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems).

ClamAV provides a number of antivirus tools specifically designed for email scanning. ClamAV's architecture is scalable and flexible thanks to a multi-threaded process.

It has a powerful monitor integrated with the command line and tools to update the databases automatically.

The primary goal of ClamAV is the achievement of a set of tools that identify and block malware from email. One of the fundamental points in this type of software is the fast location and inclusion in the tool of new viruses found and scanned.

This is achieved thanks to the collaboration of the thousands of users who use ClamAv and sites like Virustotal.com that provide the scanned viruses.

ClamAV 0.103.1 Main New Features

In this new version of ClamAV 0.103.1 a new scan option has been added warning about transferring corrupted graphic files through which you can potentially try to exploit vulnerabilities in graphics libraries.

Format validation is implemented for JPEG TIFF PNG and GIF files and is enabled by the AlertBrokenMedia setting in clamd.conf or the command line option ""–alert-broken-media"" in clamscan.

New types CL_TYPE_TIFF and CL_TYPE_JPEG have been added to maintain consistency with the definition of GIF and PNG files. The BMP and JPEG 2000 types are still defined as CL_TYPE_GRAPHICS because they do not support format parsing.

Moreover for PNG se corrected analyzer logic errors that caused an excess of analysis errors and fixed a battery drain issue which affected some systems when scanning PNG files.

PNG file type detection was disabled by updating the signature database for ClamAV version 0.103.0 to mitigate the effects of these errors.

For the format TIFF support for dynamic configuration has been added (DCONF) which allows you to disable format verification through signature database. For JPEG PNG and GIF a similar option was added above.

In addition it is highlighted that fixed an issue where FreshClam database validation was not working properly when running in daemon mode on Linux / Unix.

Finally if you are interested in knowing more about it of the release of this new version you can check the details In the following link.

How to install ClamAV on Linux?

For those who are interested in being able to install this antivirus on their system they can do it in a fairly simple way and that is ClamAV is found within the repositories of most Linux distributions.

In the case of Ubuntu and its derivatives you can install it from the terminal or from the system software center.

To be able to install from the terminal they should only open one on their system (you can do it with the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T) and in it they only have to type the following command:

The Tokyo-based technology conglomerate said it would create the special purpose acquisition companies less than two months after it filed to create a $525 million blank-check company. SPACs look to merge with private companies letting them become publicly traded while avoiding some of the uncertainty of an initial public offering. The vehicles have become a popular way for venture-backed startups to list on the public markets. More than $35 billion has been raised by the 117 SPACs that have gone public on U.S. exchanges this year according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

SoftBank shares were up as much as 6.1% in Tokyo on Monday ahead of the company’s latest earnings report on top of a five-day streak of gains.

The new SoftBank vehicles SVF Investment Corp. 2 and 3 will target the same diverse areas of technology as the first including mobile communications and artificial intelligence according to filings Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because the SPACs are different sizes they can work with companies of different maturity.

SVF 2 has entered into a forward purchase agreement in which it has committed $100 million to $150 million of capital for when it combines with another company its prospectus shows. SVF 3 has entered into a forward purchase agreement in which it has committed $150 million to $200 million of capital for when it combines with another company its prospectus shows.

For both new vehicles each unit of the SPAC will consist of one share and one-fifth of a warrant. Citigroup Inc. UBS Deutsche Bank AG Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities are advising on the listings.

SVF 2’s management committee is led by Munish Varma a managing partner at SoftBank’s Vision Fund while SVF 3’s management committee is led by Ioannis Pipilis. SoftBank’s first SPAC is led by Vision Fund Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Misra. Vision Fund Chief Financial Officer Navneet Govil serves as CFO of all three SPACs. All are overseen by SoftBank Investment Advisers which also runs the company’s Vision Fund.

Having three SPACs launches SoftBank into a growing collection of companies with multiple blank-check vehicles including the Gores Group and investor Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Hedosophia.

Yonhap



By Lee Min-hyung



Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have reportedly abandoned their position as large short-selling holders of shares of Celltrion and HLB two Korean stocks most vulnerable to the trading practice amid an escalating fear that they could end up mired in a possible Korean version of the GameStop saga.



According to the Korea Exchange the two major investment banks were excluded from a list of ""large short-selling holders"" for Celltrion and HLB respectively as of Feb. 1.



Officials from Credit Suisse declined to comment on details over the issue saying that they were not authorized to speak on market issues.



Investors with the position refer to those whose short-selling balance exceeds 0.5 percent of outstanding shares of a listed firm here.



The move is seen as part of their movement to hedge risks amid concerns over the possibility of heavy losses as in the recent ""stock war"" between U.S. hedge funds and retail investors surrounding GameStop.



This is the first time since January 2018 that Goldman Sachs has been excluded from the list. It also marks the first time for Credit Suisse since April 2019.



For now only two companies ― Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley ― retain the status for Celltrion. Three global investment banks ― Merrill Lynch Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Global Market Securities ― also have more than 0.5 percent of shares for short-selling in HLB.



But with Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse abandoning the position the balance of short-selling for the two Korean biopharmaceutical firms has declined by a huge margin. As of Feb. 1 Celltrion's short-selling balance reached 4.92 million shares up 1 million from the previous trading day. The portion of the short-selling balance out of outstanding shares reached 3.65 percent. This is the first time in more than four years that the figure dropped to the 3-percent range.



The short-selling balance of HLB also came in at 2.77 million shares down by 520000 during the same period. The short-selling balance portion also dropped to 5.24 percent from the previous 6.22 percent. This is the lowest in more than two years since October 2018.



On the same day foreign investors engaged in a mass buying spree of Celltrion and HLB proving that the two investment banks launched a massive short-covering campaign to prevent them from being stuck with huge losses.



""Chances are that the investment banks' decision to reduce their short-selling balance of the two Korean companies was due to escalating worries of a Korean version of the GameStop saga"" an official from the investment industry said explaining why the two banks took preemptive measures.



""Retail investors are asked to remain thoughtful before purchasing bio shares vulnerable to short-selling disputes"" the source said.



In January Melvin Capital a hedge fund based in the U.S. is known to have lost around 53 percent of its total capital by betting against retail investors in GameStop. The estimated loss from for investors ― including Citron Research another big hedge fund along with Melvin ― betting GameSaga would fall is known to reach $5 billion.



A dispute surrounding short-selling is a major talking point here after the financial authorities decided to extend a ban on short-selling until May 2. This came in response to a growing call from retail investors that the resumption of the practice only favored foreign and institutional investors.

Dr Vishi Beharry plans to advocate for continuous education and patient outreach during his term as president of the TT Medical Association.

Dr Vishi Y Beharry the 2021 president of the TT Medical Association (T&TMA) has always wanted to help and serve the people of TT.

Born and raised in Enterprise he attended Couva Government Secondary School and went on to study medicine at UWI St Augustine.

In 2008 he met his wife Maryam Mohammed in medical school and together they helped to revamp the TT Medical Students Association in 2010. From there he made the connection with and eventually transitioned to the Medical Association.

He specialises in family and emergency medicine and practices in Chaguanas and south Trinidad. He is president of The Rotary Club of Felicity Charlieville vice president of SewaTT and a former president of The Movement for the Encouragement of Dharmic Services.

“Essentially I merge my social work with my work in the medical fraternity. I’m very much someone who is interested in doing a lot of social work and helping people on the ground level who have that need for support. A lot of the things I do and will be doing will have that as the foundation whether it be helping doctors within the medical fraternity through the Medical Association or helping people in the community through Rotary or Sewa.”

Beharry 36 was installed as president of the T&TMA on January 30 at the association’s virtual presidential inauguration and conferring of honours ceremony at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Cultural Co-operation in Chaguanas. His wife is the association's third vice president.

There after announcing that TT will get around 120000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca covid19 vaccine by March Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh called on the association to work with the government in the upcoming covid19 vaccination distribution process.

Beharry told Sunday Newsday the T&TMA is still working out the details and logistics of TT’s covid19 vaccination drive. However its members are willing and able to support the Health Ministry.

“When there comes a time when there is a lot more vaccines and we need to get them out to the general population we can provide the support of going into the communities to the patients who can not go to the health centres. Just as we did the outreach after the 2018 floods providing medical care to affected persons through simultaneous clinics in multiple areas we’re going to use that model and partner with the ministry.”

In the meantime he said T&TMA members will provide support by educating people about vaccines to combat vaccine hesitancy and have continuing medical education (CME) lectures for doctors on how to identify treat with and report side effects of the vaccine.

Beharry stressed that the T&TMA is separate from the Medical Board and the Medical Professionals Association of TT (MPATT). He explained that the board was a regulatory body that issued licences to practise medicine and the MPATT was a union although he did not believe it was operational at this time.

T&TMA is a professional association which advocates on behalf of doctors for patient rights and for matters such as proper screening standards guidelines and the running of the public health sector. It is also a stakeholder representative which voices concerns about medical issues.

About eight years ago the organisation was accredited and licensed to provide CME by the American Academy of Continuing Medical Education doing up to 189 CME lectures per year.

“Prior to two years ago we have been the only group conducting CME lectures and we have been advocating for it to become mandatory. TT is the only country in the Caribbean that has a medical act that does not make it mandatory for doctors to have updated CME to renew their licences.

“Medicine is an ever-changing world with new research evidence and evidence-based medicine. It is important for doctors to update themselves so they are giving patients the best care available.”

He said he believes the process was at an advanced stage at the Ministry of Health and hoped the government would make it so.

The association also encourages doctors to treat patients in terms of evidence-based medicine using best practices and the most updated research and arranges outreach clinics in rural communities.

Members mentor junior doctors to help mould them into better healthcare professionals. This is done by hosting training sessions to assist in managing their careers and lives as well as through one-on-one interactions that provide support to those who need assistance balancing and developing their careers.

Beharry will be the president for the next year and he intends to guide the organisation along its current path of teaching treating mentoring and advocating.

“Years ago we developed a strategic plan to make the association more far-reaching more visible and more operationally efficient. My plan is to continue to work with the association in context with the strategic plan. That requires me to listen to all the committee leads and our membership to figure out the issues they are facing now and then respond to that.”

Two issues that have been prominent are burnout by medical professionals due to covid19 and the decrease in blood donors. And this year the organisation’s advocacy will focus on mental health NCDs women’s health and paediatrics.

He has established a committee to help deal with mental health and burnout with the hopes that it could provide support avenues and strategies for medical professionals to deal with their stresses.

In addition he said the country needs about 60000 pints of blood annually but the blood bank usually gets about 20000 and that was reduced to under 10000 during the pandemic. The association will therefore support the Ministry of Health in getting 100 per cent voluntary blood donation by encouraging and educating people and having voluntary blood drives.",,,,,,,,,

With more than 100 million viewers tuning in some of the largest U.S. brands shell out millions of dollars every year for airtime during the Super Bowl. In years past the likes of Doritos and T-Mobile have paid for multiple ads to run during the NFL championship game in the hopes of creating a splash that will drive consumers to buy their products. But this year a number of brands known for their iconic Super Bowl commercials — Budweiser and Coca-Cola for example — are sitting out the big game. ""This is a higher-risk year for them in terms of striking the right chord with the consumers"" said Charles R. Taylor a marketing professor at Villanova University. ""When they're thinking about [return on investment] they're weighing the risk of not getting the message just right and potentially damaging brand equity."" Of the nine top advertisers of the last decade at least four aren't planning on running ads during Sunday's game. Their absence opens up airtime for newcomers particularly the companies who have seen their business soar during the coronavirus pandemic like DoorDash and Chipotle Mexican Grill . Here are the nine Super Bowl advertisers who have run the most in-game spots from 2010 to 2020 according to data from ad measurement firm iSpot.tv:

Bud Light

The Anheuser-Busch InBev beer has aired 26 commercials in the last 11 years during the big game. It typically airs at least two in-game commercials. Between 2016 and 2020 Bud Light has spent $61.4 million on Super Bowl airtime according to estimates from iSpot. In 2018 it unveiled the ""Bud Knight"" mascot and has since used the character in medieval-themed ""Dilly Dilly"" ads during the Super Bowl. In 2019 one of Bud Light's Super Bowl commercials featured the Bud Knight fighting the ""Game of Thrones"" character The Mountain.

Doritos

The PepsiCo brand aired 19 Super Bowl commercials between 2010 and 2020. ISpot estimates that it's spent about $24.4 million on airtime during the big game in the last five years. From 2006 to 2016 Doritos' Super Bowl ads came from the minds of consumers not advertising agencies. Its ""Crash the Super Bowl"" contest asked amateur filmmakers for their ideas and the winners would see their ad aired the big game.

Budweiser

Budweiser has aired 18 in-game commercials between 2010 and 2020 and spent $49.9 million on airtime in the last five years according to iSpot. The AB InBev brand's commercials are best known for its Clydesdale horses which made their debut in 1975. But this year snaps its 38-year streak of airing a Super Bowl ad. The marketing minds behind the beer have instead opted to funnel its dollars to raising awareness for the coronavirus vaccine.

T-Mobile Source: YouTube

Seventeen T-Mobile spots have aired during the big game in the last 11 years. The telecommunications provider topped iSpot's list of the biggest spenders in the last five years shelling out $85.3 million for Super Bowl airtime. Oftentimes T-Mobile's advertising has centered around its competition with rival Verizon . This year T-Mobile may get a bigger buzz from a spot it released Friday that it says was rejected from the game due to a protected rights deal with Verizon the NFL's official telco sponsor. It depicts a flashback scene where poor cell phone service prompts Tom Brady to ditch retirement plans and head to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with Rob Gronkowski. The Buccaneers will face off against Kansas City this weekend.

Coca-Cola Source: YouTube

In the last 11 years Coca-Cola has aired 16 Super Bowl ads. It's spent an estimated $24.8 million on its in-game ads over the last five years. Along with rival Pepsi Coke is sitting out this year's game. ""This difficult choice was made to ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times"" spokesperson Kate Hartman said.

Hyundai

Hyundai has aired 14 commercials during the Super Bowl from 2010 to 2020. According to iSpot it's spent $40.46 million on airtime during the last five games. It's also among the companies sitting out the game this year. The car maker cited marketing priorities and the timing of upcoming launches for the decision.

GoDaddy

Go Daddy Source: YouTube

GoDaddy aired 12 Super Bowl ads over the last 11 years but it didn't crack iSpot's list of the top spenders in the last five games. The internet domain registrar spread awareness for its services by sparking controversy over its sexually provocative ads. But under former CEO Blake Irving the company stopped airing commercials that relied on controversy to juice sales.

Kia

Kia which is owned by Hyundai has aired 12 ads during the last ten Super Bowls tying it with GoDaddy. The car brand has spent an estimated $54.5 million on airtime in the last five years. Like its parent company's namesake brand Kia plans on sitting out the big game this year.

Tide

The Procter & Gamble detergent has aired 11 commercials during the last decade. In the last five years it's spend about $47.2 million on Super Bowl airtime. Tide's spots usually feature celebrities like ""Stranger Things"" star David Harbour or Charlie Day best known for his role on ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.""

Why is that?

The answer sort of depends on what each of those companies and brands has said. In the case of Budweiser — per USA TODAY — the brand announced it won’t have an ad this year last month and it said “in a news release that instead of paying to air a Super Bowl ad it will instead be ‘reallocating the media investment’ to raise awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the year in partnership with the Ad Council.”

Coca-Cola announced (via Variety) “it would not run ads in CBS’ broadcast of Super Bowl LV citing a ‘difficult choice’ made to ‘ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times.'”

Pepsi is still the sponsor of the halftime show but there will be no ad as PepsiCo concentrates on that.

Other brands you won’t see include Hyundai Little Caesars and Olay.

What's a Super Bowl without the commercials? We won't find out in 2021 but major brands like Coca-Cola Ford and Budweiser will sit out this year's Big Game.

""With Super Bowl parties either scaled way down or just canceled it probably makes sense to sit this one out at this cost"" for certain marketing categories Brian Sheehan a professor of advertising at Syracuse University's SI Newhouse School of Public Communications told Variety.

A 30-second spot in Super Bowl LV costs advertisers $5.5 million and brands are rightly concerned about the optics of spending that much when the country is facing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and racial political and social unrest. CBS which will air the showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday February 7 had sold about 80% of its ad slots in early December according to AdAge. By contrast Fox sold out of ad spots before Thanksgiving when it aired the game in 2020.

Below see 10 big brands that have bowed out.

Avocados from Mexico

Avocados from Mexico was the first advertiser to pull out of the 2021 Super Bowl which it announced it would do in October of last year. It will end a six-year streak airing an ad during the Big Game but the company says it plans to be back in 2022.

Budweiser

Sorry no puppies and Clydesdales this year. Beverage giant Anheuser-Busch whose Super Bowl commercials are typically among the most popular won't air ads for its flagship product Budweiser this year. Instead according to Variety the company will direct the funds it would've spent on Budweiser ads to the Ad Council which is running public information campaigns urging Americans to get the coronavirus vaccine. Rest assured you'll still get your beer-commercial fix however. Anheuser-Busch is still planning to run more than four minutes of ads for its other products among them Bud Light Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade and Michelob Ultra.

Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola which has run an ad during or before the Super Bowl every year since 2006 will sit out this year. ""This difficult choice was made to ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times"" Coca-Cola said in a statement Friday.

Facebook

The social media giant will focus on the 2021 Grammys instead of Super Bowl LV a spokesperson told AdAge.

Ford

Super Bowl stalwart Ford will not air ads during this year's game. Instead it created a ""Super Bowl-worthy"" campaign for the new Bronco Sport with ads that started airing during playoff games in early January.

Hyundai

Hyundai announced in early January it will sit out Super Bowl LV. In an interview with AdAge Hyundai CMO Angela Zepeda said ""We've always been in firmly in [the Super Bowl]  but this is a different time in a different year."" A statement from the company expanded further saying the decision was made ""based on marketing priorities the timing of upcoming vehicle launches and where we felt it was best to allocate our marketing resources.""

Little Caesar's

The pizza chain which first aired an ad during the Super Bowl last year will not return in 2021 according to AdAge. ""I think you've got to have something really important to say"" Little Caesar's CMO Jeff Klein said in an interview on the Marketer Brief podcast. ""We're not a brand that has a problem with unaided awareness."" Instead it launched a campaign called ""Big Pizza"" in early January.

Olay

The P&G brand has run ads for the past two years but won't return in 2021 according to AdAge. Instead ""the company is committed to its messaging around women in STEM for the next decade and this year will lean more heavily into the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on Feb. 11"" reports AdAge.

PepsiCo.

The Super Bowl stalwart won't air ads for Pepsi during this year's Super Bowl. Instead it'll focus on the brand-building Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show which this year features The Weeknd. The company will still air ads for Mountain Dew and Frito-Lay according to the AP.

Sabra Hummus

Sabra which made a well-reviewed debut for its inclusive message when it advertised during the 2020 Super Bowl will not return in 2021.

Attrition for most Indian peers were in low double digits primarily due to the weak job market created by the pandemic.While overall attrition moved up just 1% compared to the previous quarter there was a big spike in voluntary attrition - employees leaving for better opportunities or education.This rose to 16% from 10%. In the last two years a whopping 1.2 lakh employees have left Cognizant that is unusually high in the IT sector even as the firm has backfilled many roles. The company had about 289500 employees in the December quarter up from 283100 in September.""The market for skilled digital talent is intensely competitive creating demand supply imbalances for certain skills. This coupled with other factors including our more rigorous approach to merit-based promotions and salary adjustments has led to meaningful sequential increases in voluntary attrition"" CEO Brian Humphries said in a conference call with analysts cautioning that the number may rise further.For TCS Infosys Wipro and HCL annualised voluntary attrition was 7.6% 10% 11% and 10.2% respectively. Humphries has been undertaking a major restructuring since he took charge in April 2019 with the objective of flattening the organisation and getting more digital deals rather than the go after traditional IT contracts.Last year Humphries had announced that the company would be parting with some 13000 employees in the following months including about 6000 from the content moderation business that Cognizant does for Facebook. Some 800 employees of healthcare company Trizetto which Cognizant acquired some four years back for $2.7 billion were let go off.Another factor contributing to exits is that under the previous leadership many of these individuals accumulated significant stock positions. ""As this stock vests employees feel free to move on and cash out of their stock. This combined with the moral issues created by the abrupt leadership changes is creating the conditions that competitors are taking advantage of by targeting Cognizant talent"" Peter Bendor-Samuel CEO of US-based IT advisory Everest Group said.What has also led to high attrition is the pace of change that Humphries has embarked on which has been disconcerting to the rank and file. ""Humphries has embarked on a wholesale leadership change that refocuses the global delivery model across its major client locations with less dependence on traditional Indian outsourcing delivery. This is a process that could take years but Cognizant is already ahead of its traditional competitors in addressing its post-pandemic IT services that are far more digital-centric than location-centric"" said Phil Fersht CEO of US-based HFS Research.James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group (SFG) said Cognizant is acquiring new skill sets and in the CEO's words trying to increase their “relevance.” “But it’s true they don’t seem to have big deals to show for it and don’t have clean and consistent disclosures on bookings.

However the decision to carry out the contentious event in March amid the COVID-19 pandemic was made by the NBA Paul said.

""Yeah I mean guys are entitled to their feelings decisions and everything. I think the job for the union has been to try to make sure our players are healthy and safe"" he told reporters after the Suns' 109-92 win over the Detroit Pistons courtesy of Duane Rankin of AZ Central.

""This is something that was a decision by the league and we are definitely day in and day out trying to figure it out but we got 450 players that we're always trying to get insight from and it's tough. So we're all trying to figure it out right now.""

The Association sent a memo to teams Thursday stating it was finalizing an agreement with the union to hold the event in Atlanta on March 7. Indianapolis was the initial intended host city but the league postponed its hosting duties until 2024 due to public health concerns surrounding the pandemic.

Some of the NBA's top names including LeBron James Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden have candidly criticized the decision within the last couple of days. James went as far as to call it a ""slap in the face"" to players who had been looking forward to spending time with their families.

Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard also chimed in late Friday opining that the league's attempt to hold an All-Star Game was ""putting money over health"" according to Andrew Greif of the LA Times.

""It's tough"" Paul said about trying to explain the situation to players around the league. ""You try to over-communicate as much as possible. I talked to Bron maybe a week or two ago talked to (Stephen Curry) a few guys. Our executive committee we get on calls we try to figure it out. There's different situations guys who've been playing a lot of games who haven't really had much of breaks.

""I'm sure I'm not the only guy in the league that lives without their family so guys look at that break as an opportunity to see their families. It's a lot of different things going on right now but you just hope that guys understand that decisions that are being made especially as far as the union is (concerned) it's always got the full body of players in mind.

Here's the Best Theory,"Home > Entertainment How the Aerospace Engineer May Introduce a 'Fantastic Four' Reboot in 'WandaVision' By Gina Vaynshteyn Mar. 8 2021 Updated 2:59 p.m. ET Source: Disney+

If you weren't on the WandaVision bandwagon you for sure are now. In Episode 4 we learned Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) is definitely the one starring in her Westview reality pulling real people into it to play the parts of friendly townspeople in her deranged sitcom. But while she may be starring in WandaVision is she the one directing it? By Episode 5 Wanda's world begins to crack as the SWORD team does more digging and Vision becomes more cognizant of the situation.

Plus Wanda's twins (Billy and Tommy) who grow from babies to 10-year-olds in a span of an episode seem to be uncontrollable. Unlike the rest of the town Wanda can't manipulate their reality. Case in point: After they ask why their dad is at work on a Saturday they don't accept Wanda's half-baked excuses for the continuity error. They also know that Wanda can bring the dead back to life (and want her to bring back Sparky after his abrupt death RIP Sparky).

What is going on and how is Wanda doing this? Dr. Darcy Lewis Jimmy Woo and Monica Rambeau are on it though and Monica mentioned that she knows an aerospace engineer who could help them crack the case of the ""Maximoff Anomaly.""

Who is the aerospace engineer in 'WandaVision'?

Monica texts her aerospace engineer contact but we don't get a name in Episode 5. The biggest theory people are going with right now is that it's Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) a scientist whose expertise is in aerospace and engineering. In fact there's already speculation that WandaVision has been weaving in the Fantastic Four considering there's a chance that Agnes Wanda's quirky neighbor is actually Agatha Harkness — who has ties to the Fantastic Four comics.

It's also interesting to note that the Fantastic Four's origin story has to do with four astronauts who gain supernatural powers after being exposed to cosmic radiation — most likely the same kind of radiation Wanda's alternate reality bubble is giving off. Are the Fantastic Four up in space right now on a mission gone awry because of the Blip (post Avengers: Endgame)? Have they developed their powers already?

With Even Peters' Quicksilver re-introduced as Wanda's brother (he plays a different version of Quicksilver in the X-Men franchise which finally got acquired by Disney — Wanda's brother Pietro actually got killed by Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron so it's really confusing right now) and several characters from Fantastic Four this could mean that WandaVision serves as a fuse between the various universes within Marvel.

We know that Wanda will be starring in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (out in spring 2022) and it's likely that WandaVision is setting up the groundwork for the film's plot. It's also likely that the aerospace engineer Monica brings to the team is going to play a huge role in the MCU moving forward especially if they help figure out what's actually going on with Wanda and how she is able to manipulate matter in such a colossal way."

Comcast and customer service occasionally have the same word association as White Castle and fine dining.

The company has worked hard to improve but it's just increased its cable and internet prices just as people are working from home.

That's not so human-friendly. And it's not as if other little customer service snafus don't still happen as I just discovered.

My wife and I became a touch mesmerized you see by The Flight Attendant. We get HBO Max as part of our Comcast (aka Xfinity) plan.

Once it was over and Kaley Cuoco was still alive we happened upon Industry which is about young people taking drugs and having sex while they're supposed to be at work.

Naturally we found it the perfect dinner-time viewing. But after the first episode the HBO Max app wouldn't let us in. It claimed it couldn't verify our Xfinity subscription.

It was first-world annoying. I could log in via Xfinity but no I wasn't allowed to watch any shows.

In a fit of naïveté I tried Xfinity's chat service. After an hour of being asked a lot of questions rebooting pauses more rebooting it was clear the chat person had no idea what the problem was or how to fix it.

The next day I remembered that the most effective customer service tool is Twitter. Comcast has a Twitter Direct Message service called winningly Comcast Cares.

So there I went to explain my predicament.

Comcast Cares. It's Really A Wonder.



Comcast Cares tries to be very user-friendly.

Why this DM conversation began with the Comcast rep offering: ""What do you like watching on HBO Max. My girlfriend and I just finished Wonder Woman this past weekend and it is awesome that we will be able to view new movies through there. You have reached the right place. I am more than happy to help you get access to the app.""

This was a Friday at 3:30pm. 30 minutes later no solution.

""I'm going to have to open up a ticket for this issue"" said Comcast. ""Our fantastic advanced repair team member will reach out to you about this matter. I'm glad it's only the one app that is giving you problems.""

You see how warm and human this was?

I was promised contact from the fantastic and advanced repair team within 24 to 72 hours.

Comcast Cares. But Maybe Not That Much.



The following morning at 10:01am a call from a 1-888 number. I tend not to answer those. It went through to voicemail. A seven seconds-long message said something about pressing 2 if the problem was fixed but it was half-garbled.

I DM'd Comcast Cares to wonder if they'd called. The response was as last time very friendly: ""Thank you for letting me know that the technician called. I completely understand about not picking up calls that come up as unknown. I don't pick those up either.""

You don't?

You're admitting your calls coming from an unknown number aren't worth answering? It was in its way a lovely human confession.

Sadly things drifted in a troubling direction. The rep offered: ""I wouldn't be able to guarantee that the technician will call back.""

At all? Ever? No more sex and drugs at work? So what am I supposed to do?

The rep tried to reassure: ""It could have been a pre-call to get information on if the issue is still present. We are still showing the ticket for the technical team is still open so they are still working on getting this resolved.""

This rep promised they'd follow up during the week to check everything was fine.

You'll turn into a purple banyan tree when I tell you that the annoying HBO Max thing wasn't resolved that day the next or even the one after that.

Comcast Cares. HBO Fixes.



So on that Monday night I had another idea. Perhaps HBO Max could do something about it. Perhaps it too had friendly customer service.

I chatted online with a friendly Max rep who tried to shoot the trouble yet everything he suggested I'd already tried. I could log in but I couldn't watch any shows.

Nevertheless he persisted.

He made one last effort. He suggested I use a different browser on my laptop to perform the TV login process. Lo met behold on this dark cold night and everything was instantly fine. The problem wasn't HBO Max or Comcast. It was apparently Firefox.

We were happy. More workplace drugs and sex over chicken with rosemary and fennel.

Comcast Really Cares. About Some Things.



The next day a Tuesday the faithful member of Comcast Cares DM'd me again.

""Good morning!"" they began. ""I hope your week is off to a good start! I wanted to check in to see if your HBO Max is working. I am showing the ticket that we issued has been resolved.""

Naturally I bordered on the charmed. I explained no Comcast engineer had contacted me fantastic or otherwise. I explained that HBO Max had fixed the problem.

The rep offered: ""I'm sorry to hear that was your experience. In some cases they fix the issue and send email confirmation the issue has been resolved.""

Then that practiced personal touch: ""I know it took me quite a bit to set up my HBO Max on my boxes even though I had the app on my phone already.""

That was delightful to know. Yet I couldn't help asking the one question that inevitably tortured my head: ""When in fact was the ticket marked as resolved?""

The answer came swiftly: ""I am showing the ticket was resolved Sunday morning.""

Which was a little odd as I'd only contacted HBO Max on Monday night. Comcast was offering a blatant falsehood. The personal touch was lovely but the factual nonsense was troubling.

The rep insisted: ""What I see is that the issue was resolved and added to your system to [give] you a call to let you know. I am sorry we did not connect when our service team reached out but happy to know you are now able to watch HBO Max.""

I hadn't time to offer a ""Please excuse me but what are you talking about?"" before I was awash in another personal touch: ""My family and I watched Wonder Woman the other night. It was fun to watch the stunts in this movie for us because we know one of the amazing stunt doubles in this movie.""

Amazing.

What can one therefore conclude?

Comcast was having a bad day or two? Its engineers may sometimes claim to have fixed an issue even though they didn't? Its Twitter customer service is delightfully human and caring if verging on somewhat inaccurate and powerless because they're all too busy watching Wonder Woman?

Perhaps it was all of the above.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NodWNrYnJvb2tzLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS10aHJlYXRzLXRoZS1kYXVudGluZy1jaGFsbGVuZ2Utb2Ytc2VjdXJpbmctdGhlLWludGVybmV0LW9mLXRoaW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cybersecurity Threats: The Daunting Challenge Of Securing The Internet Of Things,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2021/02/07/cybersecurity-threats-the-daunting-challenge-of-securing-the-internet-of-things/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NodWNrYnJvb2tzLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS10aHJlYXRzLXRoZS1kYXVudGluZy1jaGFsbGVuZ2Utb2Ytc2VjdXJpbmctdGhlLWludGVybmV0LW9mLXRoaW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcGhpbGx5eWltYnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvb25lLWxpYmVydHktcGxhY2UtY3Jvd24tbGlnaHRzLXJlc3RvcmVkLWluLWNlbnRlci1jaXR5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decorative Lighting Upgrade Complete Atop One Liberty Place in Center City,"One Liberty Place has been a centerpiece of the Philadelphia skyline since 1987 with a nighttime display that highlights the angled crown and spire. Designed by renowned architect Helmut Jahn and developed by Rouse and Associates the 945-foot-tall 61-story tower is part of a complex that includes the similarly-sized Two Liberty Place tower as well as a hotel and a shopping mall. Recently an upgrade has been completed on the building’s decorative lighting restoring its place on the night skyline.

The building was first proposed in 1984 boldly breaking the 548-foot “gentlemen’s agreement” height limit set by the turn-of-the-century City Hall tower. The tower broke ground in May of 1985 with a major ceremony. Steel erection began at the beginning of 1986 and the structure roses halfway up by August. The top floor topped out on December 13th and the spire topped out on May 27 1987. Later that year the bright white neon lights at the crown and spire were switched on for the first time becoming a new beacon for Philadelphia.

The lights had lost their luster over time and they were replaced with a new and modern system by the time the Comcast Center was under construction in the late 2000’s. However the restoration did not age well with many sections having been turned off or shining in a different color as well as being very dim compared to their original state. Thankfully the latest restoration which may have been prompted by the erection of another Comcast tower nearby (the Comcast Technology Center) that also features a bright nighttime display has restored the building to its former glory. Hopefully the current display will last for a long time.

Broadcasting rights are the main source of revenue for Serie A and are even more important with matches being played in empty stadiums due to COVID-19 restrictions and companies cutting advertising budgets.

Italy's top-flight soccer league held a round of talks with broadcasters who increased their initial offers but did not match the 1.15 billion euros ($1.38 billion) target.

DAZN is offering about 850 million euros per season to show all Serie A matches on its streaming app the sources said.

SKY a unit of U.S. Comcast has bid nearly 750 million euros to screen matches on different platforms they said.

Serie A clubs will discuss the bids at a meeting on Monday.

The size of the bid however might not be the only criteria for valuing the offers a senior club official said.

Both SKY and DAZN declined to comment.

Under a three-year contract expiring at the end of this season Serie A raised 973 million euros per year from the sale of domestic licenses to SKY which took the lion's share of games and DAZN which made its debut on the Italian market.

Serie A could raise slightly more than 900 million euros combining DAZN's bid and an offer by SKY to screen some matches on its streaming platform the sources said.

""We are not that far from the amount of the current agreements"" one of source said adding a variable part of the offers could help narrow the gap further.

($1 = 0.8304 euros)

LOUIS — Post Holdings Inc. has acquired the ready-to-eat cereal business of Oak Brook Ill.-based TreeHouse Foods Inc. for $85 million. The acquisition includes two facilities located in Lancaster Ohio and Sparks Nev. which feature a wide range of production capabilities across batch and extruded products a research and development facility located in Sauget Ill. as well as inventory valued at approximately $30 million.

Post first announced its intent to acquire the private label RTE cereal business of TreeHouse Foods in May 2019 but the deal was terminated on Jan. 13 2020 a decision that came a little less than a month after the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint challenging the companies’ proposed $110 million transaction. At the time Steven T. Oakland president and chief executive officer of TreeHouse Foods said the business risk necessary resources and extent of time required to challenge the FTC’s position “was not in the best interest of our constituencies.”

Following the completed deal on June 1 Mr. Oakland called the transaction “another important step in our strategic journey to create value for our customers and our shareholders.”

“Based on our thorough efforts to find alternative buyers for the business we believe this transaction is not only in the best interest of its employees and customers but also gives the business the opportunity to flourish as part of Post” he said. “I want to express my gratitude to the approximately 500 RTE team members for their ongoing commitment as we work closely with Post to facilitate a smooth transition for all stakeholders.”

TreeHouse Foods acquired the RTE cereal business from Conagra Brands as part of the Private Brands transaction in 2016.

The financial results of the acquired RTE cereal business are expected to be reported in the Post Consumer Brands segment and are expected to be modestly dilutive to Post’s adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2021 and accretive in fiscal year 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzE4NzcxLXdlc3Rvbi1mb29kcy1tYWtlcy1rZXktYXBwb2ludG1lbnRzLXRvLXNhbGVzLXRlYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weston Foods makes key appointments to sales team,"TORONTO — Weston Foods a division of George Weston Ltd. has announced several key appointments to its sales leadership team.

So in the spring he helped organize an appreciation parade.

""It was done because the community wants to let the essential workers [know] how valued and appreciated they are"" he told the Nassau Herald. ""There is no event in town when they don’t step forward. Amid the pandemic they are serving and deserve a tremendous amount of appreciation.""

It was one of many publicized and unpublicized deeds done by Sobol a community advocate in the Five Towns a neighborhood booster and a longtime owner of a local beverage distributor.

Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said she is submitting legislation to rename the building housing the Five Towns Community Center in Sobol’s memory in ""recognition of his service and impact on his community"" according to Curran’s county Facebook page.

He was also mourned by Nassau County Legis. Carrié Solages (D-Lawrence): ""The first-son of Inwood has passed this morning"" Solages wrote on Facebook. ""This man dedicated his heart to helping so many people in need and he did it in secret bc he didn't want recognition.""

The Galaxy Note Note 5 launched officially in Kenya a couple of hours ago and it is just a matter of days before it pops up in stores around you.

The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is one of if not the best Android smartphone available on the market. The smartphone features a fantastic all-metallic design concept and packs some extreme technical specifications that easily makes it the most powerful smartphone money can buy.

At a base price of Ksh. 84999 the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is the most expensive Samsung smartphone on the Kenyan market. The price might be exorbitant to most but I guess that’s what you have to pay for a premium smartphone from the world’s largest smartphone vendor.

Igor Teslenko is the President for Europe of Corteva Agriscience.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the importance of agriculture in the functioning of our societies into stark relief. Amid the upheaval of the foundations of our daily lives the need for a plentiful supply of nutritious food has remained ever-present.

And farmers have delivered throughout the crisis. With agriculture declared an essential industry the sector has been able to overcome challenges and secure an uninterrupted supply of food for consumers in Europe and beyond.

But if the rural exodus – the departure of people from the countryside to cities continues – they may struggle to do so in the future. As young people flock to cities rural areas are seeing increasing levels of depopulation. The emergence of demographic deserts and the ageing population of those who remain in rural areas is resulting in diminishing public resources a lack of education facilities and few work opportunities. And so the cycle continues. There is no time to waste in reversing this trend: we must all work together now to retain and attract young people to agriculture – this is crucial to the very survival of the sector.

We at Corteva Agriscience are committed to investing in future generations and an important part of this is enabling rural areas to thrive. Through Spain’s Puebla project we will sow the seeds of change and take a step closer to meeting our mission: To enrich the lives of those who produce and those who consume ensuring progress for generations to come.

Through the sales of Pioneer® sunflower seeds Puebla will support six projects focused on encouraging young people to take up and maintain careers in the countryside. An expert jury will choose the winning projects based on several key indicators including innovation the fight against depopulation environmental impact sustainability and digital transformation.

Not only does Puebla help regenerate rural areas it also facilitates opportunities for young Spaniards meaning they are not forced to abandon their roots due to a lack of career choices in the countryside. Innovative new projects implemented as part of Puebla will pave the way for new generations to meet their potential and play a full role in ensuring that the agriculture sector not only survives but thrives.

These projects will contribute to the generational renewal of the agricultural sector and help ensure we remain on track to meet our 2030 Sustainability Vision which includes a commitment to enabling youth.

Puebla is just one example of the practical steps Corteva is taking to engage young people in agriculture. As a company committed to future generations we have launched several initiatives across Europe to better understand the issues facing young people and how we can encourage them to consider careers in agriculture.

In Central and Eastern Europe for example we are working with popular social media personalities to raise awareness among young people of potential agrarian careers. The initiative now in its second year follows a survey of more than 6000 urban and rural residents from Ukraine Russia Romania Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic which found that only 1% of 14- to 18-year-olds were considering a career in agriculture.

The study sponsored by Corteva and carried out by the analytical agency Proinsight Lab revealed that youth are strongly influenced by social media when making career decisions with this rate particularly high in Ukraine Romania and Russia. So last year we began working with popular social media influencers to demonstrate the benefits of working in the industry.

As my colleague Monica Sorribas Corteva Agriscience Marketing Leader Europe writes on LinkedIn we are also using our involvement in the eSports arena to spark enthusiasm for the next generation of farming through our sponsorship of the Farming Simulator video game and associated tournament.

Much remains uncertain in the new era of COVID-19 but one thing is clear – consumers need a reliable and sustainable supply of food to sustain them in times of crisis and every other day. We at Corteva Agriscience will work tirelessly to innovate and regenerate rural areas engaging young people as the agents of change and advance the sustainable agriculture that is so crucial for the survival of our sector and the preservation of our planet.

Corteva is working on the Puebla project alongside the Spanish Alliance for a Sustainable Agriculture (ALAS). ALAS is made up of national professional agricultural organizations ASAJA and UPA as well as the Agro-Food Cooperatives of Spain FEPEX and the Spanish Association for Live Soil Conservation Agriculture (AEAC.SV).

A new Expo Line stop which makes it easier to rea ch the area from downtown or the Westside has also helped drive development.



But even with Culver City’s increasingly high profile space can still be had at a relative discount to areas like Beverly Hills and Santa Monica — a factor that contributes to its ongoing ability to attract new companies and residents.

5 Questions With … Lowe Exec Tom Wulf

One of the most ambitious current projects in Culver City is Ivy Station a $350 million development near the Culver City stop on the Expo Line.

The 500000-square-foot property which is being developed by Lowe AECOM-Canyon Partners and Rockwood Capital is expected to begin a phased opening soon.

The development will include the Upper Ivy apartments and the Shay hotel as well as retail and office space. The offices have been fully leased to WarnerMedia while a handful of retail tenants have been announced including Equator Coffees Los Angeles Ale Works Mamoun’s Falafel StretchLab and YogaSix.



The Business Journal spoke with Lowe Executive Vice President Tom Wulf about the project and Culver City’s evolution.

What made you interested in Culver City?

What really attracted us to it was a real central location and the fact that Culver City had done a great job of resurrecting its old downtown and creating a great walkable environment with great experiences. It was a large piece of property and on the transit line that was coming and had great access to the freeway and street system. We knew from a location standpoint and an experience standpoint it would be a great place to be.

How has the pandemic affected the project?

It’s definitely extended our construction schedule. We were expecting to be done by now so it’s taken a little while longer to get things completed. Although construction was and is an essential service we still weren’t getting the same level of construction crews on site particularly early in the pandemic. So things were taking longer and that pushed things out. … We even had to change some materials. We had some product that was coming from Europe and because of the pandemic they weren’t able to be shipped timely so we had to shift and find different materials. … We also bumped into issues like permitting and inspections. It took a little bit for the cities both L.A. and Culver City to get to a place to be able to handle remote inspections.

How does Ivy Station fit in with Culver City’s growth?

Culver City I’ve got to give credit to the city administration and the staff. They’ve done a very good job of resurrecting and repurposing the old downtown that really had fallen into disrepair 15 or 20 years ago. Now it’s a great walkable environment with great experiences. Where we fit in is creating a second hub to downtown Culver City right at the transit station. … We become the hub for the eastern side of downtown.

What role does the Expo Line play in Culver City?

Everyone’s always looking for alternatives and you look at how traffic pre-pandemic had gotten so bad — everyone looked for alternatives to traffic. I still think that will be the case when we come out of this. Being on transit and having immediate walkable access is going to be highly valued in the future.

Are you interested in doing other projects in Culver City?

Absolutely. We’ve built a good relationship with the community and with Culver City and the city of Los Angeles and we’d be happy to. It’s just been a challenge trying to find the right opportunities since it’s become a hotbed of activity and there’s an awful lot of interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,
COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvb3Bpbmlvbi9zdW5kYXkvY29zdGNvLWNoaWNrZW4tYW5pbWFsLXdlbGZhcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | The Ugly Secrets Behind the Costco Chicken (Published 2021),"Probably like many of you I think of Costco as an enlightened company exemplifying capitalism that works. One ranking listed it as the No. 1 company to work at in terms of pay and benefits — a prime example of a business that is both profitable and humane.

Unless it turns out you’re a chicken.

Rotisserie chickens selling for just $4.99 each are a Costco hallmark both delicious and cheap. They are so popular they have their own Facebook page and the company sells almost 100 million of them a year. But an animal rights group called Mercy for Animals recently sent an investigator under cover to work on a farm in Nebraska that produces millions of these chickens for Costco and customers might lose their appetite if they saw inside a chicken barn.

“It’s dimly lit with chicken poop all over” said the worker who also secretly shot video there. “It’s like a hot humid cloud of ammonia and poop mixed together.”

You may be thinking: Huh? People are dying in a pandemic. Donald Trump is facing a Senate impeachment trial. And we’re talking about chicken er poop?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29zdGNvLWNvcHljYXQtY2hpY2stZmlsLWEtZnJvemVuLWNoaWNrZW4tbnVnZ2V0cy1yZXZpZXctMjAyMS0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do Costco's Just Bare Frozen Chicken Nuggets Taste Like Chick-Fil-a?,"TikTokers say a brand of frozen nuggets available at Costco taste just like Chick-fil-A nuggets.

I tried the two side-by-side to test the theory.

The Just Bare nuggets were good but didn't taste quite like Chick-fil-A's.

There's something special about Chick-fil-A's chicken recipe. It just hits differently than any other breaded or fried chicken I've had.

And while I've tested numerous brands of frozen nuggets sold in supermarkets I hadn't yet tried Just Bare's lightly breaded chicken breast chunks from Costco which TikTok user @floridamomof3 says taste exactly like the beloved fast-food.

The video which had 2.3 million views at the time of writing shows @floridamomof3 and her daughter swooning over the Just Bare chicken (A 64-ounce bag retails for $17.40 at the wholesale club).

Many other TikTokers who tried the nuggets agreed posting taste-test videos under the hashtag #justbarechicken which has 3 million views at the time of writing.

So to test this claim I put on my most critical nugget-eating hat and pit the two against one another for a side-by-side comparison to see if the Costco chicken chunks could serve as an at-home replacement for Chick-fil-A which cost me $9.85 for a 12-piece order.

Read more: I tried 4 different frozen chicken nuggets and was surprised by how different they all were

Just Bare nuggets vary in size and texture more than Chick-fil-A nuggets

The two brands looked similar but not exactly like. Rachel Askinasi/Insider

Right off the bat I could see a clear difference: The Just Bare chicken piece sizes were all over the place.

Some of the Just Bare white meat pieces were crunchy and the size of a bottle cap and others were softer on the outside and the size of my palm. Though Chick-fil-A's nuggets aren't completely uniform in size and shape either they were mostly all within the same range about the size of a walnut.

While some of the Just Bare coatings were crunchy and held up over time others were softer and soggier and separated easily from the actual chicken inside. When I took a look at the Chick-fil-A coating I was able to see the consistency across chunks — crunchy bits held up but soft bits never became soggy.

Chick-fil-A has an outer layer that's more like breadcrumbs that have completely fused with the meat itself. On the other hand Just Bare was coated in what felt more like a flour-based breading which easily pulled away from the meat.

Related stories

For those reasons the smaller crunchier Just Bare chunks were most similar to Chick-fil-A's nuggets but the bigger ones were miles away in texture.

In terms of color the Chick-fil-A chunks were overall slightly less yellow in hue.

Inside both nuggets were extremely similar

The meat was the most similar component between the two. Rachel Askinasi/Insider

Each piece of poultry was white juicy and looked like a freshly cooked piece of chicken breast.

Breading aside the actual chicken meat looked identical. I can see why people would equate the chicken quality of the frozen bulk-buy brand with that of Chick-fil-A.

The only difference was that chewy fat pockets were more common in the Just Bare nuggets.

The difference in flavor was most noticeable

Even Chick-fil-A sauce couldn't make Just Bare taste exactly like Chick-fil-A. Rachel Askinasi/Insider

Chick-fil-A's bite-sized breaded chicken has a sweetness to it that I hadn't noticed until I pit it against nuggets made by another company. It's hard to put a finger on the quality but it reminded me of the underlying sweetness of a pie crust.

It's such a distinct flavor one I've never gotten from something savory outside of these little golden drops of chicken-y goodness. The flavor made me want to keep going back for more and more and more.

On the other hand the Just Bare nuggets were saltier and more directly savory. There was a little bit of a spicy white pepper kick but nothing major — there is no hint of heat in Chick-fil-A's nugget flavor profile. These Costco-stocked chicken nuggets made me think of the frozen popcorn chicken of my childhood which isn't a bad thing at all but it's no Chick-fil-A.

I even tried dipping both nuggets into Chick-fil-A sauce but tasting one after the other the difference was still unmistakable.

Overall I can see why someone would think Just Bare's lightly breaded chicken breast chunks taste like Chick-fil-A if they weren't doing a direct side-by-side comparison.

It's easy to miss the sweetness that comes from the fast-food nuggets and equate any small crispy white meat chicken bits to the cult-favorite.

But make no mistake there is no nugget out there that tastes exactly like Chick-fil-A's — or at least I haven't found it yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay90cnVtcC1xdWl0LWNvc3Rjby1sZXR0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Trump Quit Costco Membership in This Letter?,"Claim: An image showed former U.S. President Donald Trump canceled his Costco membership in a letter dated Feb. 4 2021. Rating: About this rating False

On Feb. 4 2021 a picture went viral on Twitter that appeared to show former U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to cancel his Costco membership in a formal letter. The image was subsequently shared in several other tweets that also received thousands of retweets and likes.

The supposed letter was addressed to ""Mr. Jelinek"" presumably Costco CEO Walter Craig Jelinek:

The Office of Donald J. Trump February 4th 2021 Mr. Jelinek I am writing to inform you that effective immediately I am terminating my membership with Costco. For the past fourteen years I have been a major supporter of your stores but that ends today. I have heard from many many people about your company's plan to boycott products that Americans love simply because they are great admirers of mine like Mike Lindell a great patriot. Let me tell you: this is un-American and probably illegal. Who are you to say what a business can or can't do? You know frankly I've never really used the membership anyway. Who needs an eight pound tub of coconut clusters? And the piles of clothing in the center of the store My God. Nobody wants Kirkland jeans. I have been a big supporter of business nobody loves business more than me I did the biggest tax cut we've ever seen a tax cut that helped you and helped your board and this is what I get in return? A boycott? I've never seen anything like this before. To be honest the membership wasn't even for me I bought it a lot of people bought it I let people use the card many of them got the hot dogs the chickens they returned the card I never even used it. If I had only known what was going on behind the scenes I would have canceled it earlier. You have done a huge amount of damage to this country worse than Wal-Mart and probably Trader Joes. It's not good and people are seeing it. Consider this my final interaction with your company. Regards

President Donald J. Trump

Some Twitter users said that they didn't know what to think of the letter.

""It really had me thinking it was real"" said one tweet with more than 700 likes. ""Wait... I really don't know... Is this real?"" tweeted another. @jimfish98 tweeted: ""The most fucked up part of this post is I can't tell if its satire or real because I would never put this past him."" Others had similar thoughts including @lelelom: ""I can't even tell the real letters from the fake letters anymore.""

However the letter addressed to Costco with Trump's letterhead appeared to be nothing more than a bit of comedy.

The author of the humorous and satirical note left several clues that it was not written by Trump. First Costco did not ""boycott"" MyPillow. As of Feb. 6 2021 the company's products were still for sale on the Costco website.

The ""eight-pound tub of coconut clusters"" was another hint as was the dig at Kirkland jeans.

The letter claimed the Trump tax cuts helped the Costco CEO and the board. This was also a bit of a poke at the fact that some critics claimed his tax cuts benefitted wealthy Americans.

Further Costco membership cards include a picture of the member. It would not be possible to loan a card to a number of people. They would likely be stopped at the door by a Costco employee who checks membership cards upon entry.

The joke Costco letter appeared to have been inspired by a real document sent by Trump earlier on the same day with the same letterhead. On Feb. 4 he sent a letter of resignation to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG):

SAG responded with its own statement:

Thank you.

Trump also posted a letter to the Gab social network regarding his second impeachment trial but he made no mention of Costco.

In sum Trump did not send the above-displayed letter to cancel his Costco membership. The humorous note looked to be inspired by a real notice that he sent earlier that week to resign from SAG.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVnd29ybGRtYWcuY29tL25ldy11bmRlcmNvdmVyLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tZXhwb3Nlcy1jcnVlbC1jb25kaXRpb25zLWZvci1jb3N0Y28tY2hpY2tlbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Undercover Investigation Exposes Cruel Conditions for Costco Chickens,"Mercy For Animals investigation of Costco chicken supplier reveals the hidden costs of cheap chicken

LOS ANGELES — On Saturday Mercy For Animals released a new investigation into a farm that supplies Costco with its famously cheap chicken.

A Mercy For Animals investigator captured disturbing footage at a Nebraska farm that supplies Lincoln Premium Poultry the company Costco set up and controls to supply itself with many of the 100 million rotisserie chickens it sells each year.

The footage reveals shocking cruelty:

Chickens bred to grow so large so fast they cannot support their weight and often die from organ failure

Hundreds of thousands of birds crammed in filthy sheds living for weeks in their own waste

Injured and ill chicks some with internal organs exposed and others unable to walk

Countless birds suffering from open wounds ammonia burns broken bones and twisted necks and beaks

Large piles of dead animals on facility grounds outside the barns housing live chickens

The cruel practices revealed in the footage stand in stark contrast to Costco’s claim that “animal welfare is a critical component that has been integrated into all aspects of the chicken supply chain from the hatchery to the grower barns to the processing facility.”

The investigation video is viewable at CostcoExposed.com .

“Costco members deserve to know the truth about where their chickens come from and how Costco is failing to live up to the animal welfare standards members expect and the company claims to support” said Mercy For Animals’ president Leah Garcés. “While we cannot change the outcome for the chickens suffering in this shameful footage Costco has control over millions of animals’ lives and can take immediate action by adopting the Better Chicken Commitment a set of higher welfare standards that would ban the cruel practices uncovered by this investigation.”

By adopting the Better Chicken Commitment Costco can establish meaningful welfare guidelines for its chicken farms and prevent horrific suffering caused by rapid growth filthy living conditions and unnatural environments. Since 2016 Mercy For Animals has assisted food companies in improving their broiler chicken welfare standards. More than 200 companies have already adopted Better Chicken Commitment standards including Whole Foods Market Popeyes Burger King and Subway.

The investigation video and petition calling on Costco to adopt the Better Chicken Commitment are available at CostcoExposed.com .

How will the stock do going forward? Varun Anand of Starlight Capital says while BCE is solid investors might want to look beyond the telecom providers to an infrastructure play like cell towers.

“We do like Telus Rogers and BCE” said Anand portfolio manager at Starlight Capital who spoke to BNN Bloomberg on Thursday. “But our preferred way to play the cellular tower space is through the tower companies.”

“Remember with Bell Rogers and Telus they own the network and they also have the towers but then they also have very price competitive consumer businesses like the cellphone plans home internet and whatnot” Anand said.

BCE reported a solid fourth quarter on Thursday to wrap up what it called an overall good year considering the challenges posed by COVID-19. The company saw revenues fall by 2.8 per cent year-over-year to $6.102 billion for the Q4 2020 while adjusted EBITDA dropped by 3.2 per cent to $2.404 billion. Earnings came in at $0.98 per share compared to $0.74 per share a year earlier while analysts had called for earnings of $0.74 per share on a topline of $6.16 billion.

For the year BCE’s revenue dropped 3.8 per cent to $22.883 billion and adjusted EBITDA fell 4.0 per cent to $9.607 billion.

“In every successive quarter since COVID-19 began Bell has delivered sequential quarterly improvement in our operating results underscoring the stability and resiliency of our company and the strength of our financial position” said CFO Glen LeBlanc in a press release.

Management spoke of the company’s resilience in the face of social and economic impacts of the pandemic but the focus in its commentary was on the future specifically its plans to add another $1-1.2 billion in capital spending over the next two years. BCE aims to step up its fibre-optic and fixed wireless network buildout and double its 5G wireless capacity during 2021 saying that shareholder value will be enhanced through the infrastructure layout.

“Bell plans to increase the number of new locations covered with fibre and WHI by as many as 900000 in 2021 – bringing the combined footprint to up to 6.9 million homes and businesses by the end of the year – while doubling the population coverage of Canada’s fastest 5G network” the company said in the Q4 press release.

“Funded by proceeds from the sale of Bell data centres in 2020 the investment acceleration is in addition to Bell’s typical capital expenditures over the last decade of approximately $4 billion a year (growing to $4.2 billion in 2020 due to added investment in network capacity and digital platforms in response to unprecedented usage demand during the COVID crisis)” BCE said.

The company even provided guidance for the year ahead a big of a rarity these days as companies grapple with a host of pandemic-related unknowns. BCE expects both revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow by between two and five per cent in 2021.

“Overall revenue is expected to reflect a gradual economic recovery in 2021 combined with subscriber revenue growth and strategic pricing on advertising sales. However revenue performance is expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on many sectors of the economy” the company said.

BCE’s share price has been flat to trending downward since last spring finishing 2020 down 9.5 per cent and so far trading up two per cent for 2021. By comparison Telus (Telus Stock Quote Chart News Analysts Financials TSX:T) ended the year at even while Rogers Communications (Rogers Communications Stock Quote Chart News Analysts Financials TSX:RCI.B) dropped almost eight per cent.

Anand says he leans towards cell tower holding companies some of whom had a mildly better year than the Canadian telcos. Of the bigger players in the US Crown Castle ended 2020 up 12 per cent American Tower lost three per cent and SBA Communications finished up 17 per cent. Not yet established in Canada where the big telco companies own their own towers these REITs (real estate investment trusts) in the US have done well over the past decade.

“We’d rather play that through tower companies that just own the towers and collect the contracted cash flows from the carriers because there’s more leverage in that business and it’s more stable and as a result you don’t have as much price competition” Anand said.

“So a company like American Tower or SBA Communications would be our preferred play rather than a telco incumbent like BCE” Anand said.

TV dramas such as The Crown and Bridgerton give stately homes new lease of life

The recent popularity of period dramas has given our stately homes a new lease of life.

From Bridgerton to The Crown Downton Abbey to Poldark British ­drama is now a lucrative business for the UK’s most historic houses.

The National Trust alone has earned almost £4million in the past two years thanks to bookings from productions such as Netflix ’s Rebecca.

The show starring Lily James and Armie Hammer used the Renaissance-style chateau Waddesdon Manor Bucks as a stand-in for the fictional Manderley estate.

Private estates across the country have also been in high demand – and one of those to be used as a set is Rhinefield House in the New Forest.

This beautiful property not only ­featured in the third series of The Crown but doubled up as a hotel for 19 members of the cast and crew including Helena Bonham-Carter and Olivia Colman.

With rooms costing £220 per night the luxury accommodation comes complete with 40 acres of ­landscaped gardens and several swimming pools.

It would have cost the programme makers nearly £13000 to book – which may help explain why it’s one of the priciest productions ever made.

Here we look at some of the other grand stately homes being showcased in big budget film and TV productions.

Somerley Estate Hampshire

The 18th century residence doubled up for Highgrove in the fourth series of The Crown and stood in as Somerset House in Netflix hit Bridgerton.

The 14-bedroom Georgian home which has its own golf club also starred in the 1983 adaptation of Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park and Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple mystery The Mirror Crack’d from Side to Side.

Somerley which was designed by architect Samuel Wyatt in 1750 is a private home that has been in the same family for six generations. Its current owner is James Shaun Christian Welbore Ellis Agar seventh Earl of Normanton.

Wilton House Wiltshire

Not many properties can stand in for Buckingham Palace – but 16th century Wilton House certainly can.

The Palladian mansion featured heavily in The Crown and was also where the 2019 Emma film starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Bill Nighy was set.

Emma was the third Jane Austen film adaptation to be shot at the 14000-acre estate following on from Sense and Sensibility in 1995 and Pride and Prejudice in 2005.

The house also doubled-up as the Duke of Hastings’ London mansion in Bridgerton. Owners William Herbert the 18th Earl of Pembroke and his wife Victoria now plan to hire out the estate for Bridgerton tours post-lockdown.

Hatfield House Hertfordshire

Hatfield House was used for lavish ball and party scenes in Bridgerton to help bring Regency London to life.

More than 30 film and TV shows have been recorded at the Jacobean house over the years including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider Batman Begins and 2005’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Today Hatfield House is the home of the 7th Marquess and Marchioness of Salisbury.

It was built in 1611 by Robert Cecil 1st Earl of Salisbury and sumptuously decorated for entertaining the Royal Court.

The house’s State Rooms are particularly impressive filled with paintings fine furniture and tapestries.

You can visit the historic house and gardens which have five miles of marked trails for £19 a ticket.

Hampton Court London

This Grade I-listed palace has played host to more than 35 films including 2014’s The Theory of Everything and 2011’s Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides starring Johnny Depp.

Most recently the kitchens the Cartoon Gallery and Fountain Court were all key filming locations in 2018 Oscar-winning movie The Favourite.

The Tudor palace which is surrounded by 750 acres of parkland and Britain’s oldest maze was originally the lavish home of King Henry VIII and all his six wives.

Queen Victoria opened the palace to the public in 1838. It is still owned by the Royal Family.

Wrotham Park Hertfordshire

This English country house surrounded by 2500 acres of gardens has hosted 35 top film and TV productions including Bridget Jones’s Diary Kingsman: The Secret Service and TV’s Jeeves and Wooster starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry.

It was also used for 2001 film Gosford Park starring Kristin Scott Thomas.

The Palladian mansion which is not open to the public was designed by Isaac Ware in 1754 and built by Admiral John Byng.

Robert Byng who currently lives in the house and has managed the estate since 1991 also welcomed Cheryl and Ashley Cole to the estate in 2006 to have their £1million wedding blessed after they married in nearby Wrotham Church.

Chatsworth House Derbyshire

Keira Knightley knows her way around Chatsworth House rather well – she visited for the 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice then came back for 2008 film The Duchess.

There have been 19 film and TV productions at the 105-acre estate just a few miles from the Yorkshire border.

These include the 2011 Jane Eyre film starring Michael Fassbender and less predictably 2009 horror The Wolfman.

Chatsworth House the seat of the Duke of Devonshire has been home to the Cavendish family since 1549.

Elizabeth Talbot – better known as Bess of Hardwick – bought the manor for £600 in 1549 and began to build the first house on the site three years later.

She was the second most powerful woman in Elizabethan England after the Queen. A £32million programme of restoration work was completed on the site in 2018.

Blenheim Palace Oxfordshire

Winston Churchill’s birthplace has appeared in 35 film and TV productions including Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Black Beauty.

Most recently the Baroque country house – which has more than 200 rooms and 1000 windows – was used as the backdrop for 2017’s Transformers: The Last Knight and James Bond blockbuster Spectre.

The palace was built in the early 18th century as a gift from Queen Anne to the 1st Duke of Marlborough John Churchill.

He was the military commander who led troops to victory in the Battle of Blenheim in 1704.

Since the house opened to the public in 1950 it has become one of the UK’s top tourist attractions and is now a World Heritage Site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qb2hub2dyb2F0LWpvdXJuYWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LXNlcmllcy10aGUtY3Jvd24tYnJpbmdzLWJhY2stbWVtb3JpZXMtb2YtcXVlZW4tbW90aGVyLXMtcGljbmljLW9uLXN0cm9tYS0yMjY4NDMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix series The Crown brings back memories of Queen Mother's picnic on Stroma,"Register for free to read more of the latest local news. It's easy and will only take a moment.

The Queen Mother sets out for Stroma along with all her picnic hampers on board the Primula from Harrow harbour just down from her home at the Castle of Mey. Pictured with the Queen Mother (from left) are Commander and Lady Vyner Thurso provost John Sinclair two security officers Malcolm Simpson Eric Shaw Billy (Borax) Mackay (back to camera) Alex Thompson and skipper Angus Macintosh on the quayside.

Almost 70 years on from the Queen Mother’s first visit to Caithness the county's links to the big-budget Netflix series have spurred local folk to dig out old photos relating to the royal family.

After buying the Castle of Mey in 1952 the Queen Mother enjoyed many picnics in the area and on one occasion she went to Stroma on board a fishing boat the Primula.

For one Thurso exile Barbara Osborne (née Mackay) who now lives in Wigan Greater Manchester it has helped her get through what she describes as a particularly hard year. “It has just been horrendous these last 12 months with isolation and my husband having cancer” she said.

Her daughter Susan had been watching The Crown and told her mum about the references to the Queen Mother’s visit to Caithness in June 1952 and her subsequent purchase of the Castle of Mey (known as Barrogill Castle at that point) a couple of months later.

“I said to Sue I have a photo upstairs of your grandad with the Queen Mother” Mrs Osborne said. “The whole family are thrilled to bits that their grandad was on a boat with the Queen Mother taking her on a picnic.”

This prompted her to search for the old photo of her father Billy Mackay known to everyone as Billy Borax who was among the crew of the boat that had taken the Queen Mother to Stroma for a picnic in August 1959.

Barbara (75) reminisced: “My father said she was really down-to-earth – just a really nice person. She called him Bill.”

After Barbara left Thurso she used to return home with her family for seven weeks in the summer. “When the Britannia came in my dad used to take us around in a little crab boat to see it"" she said. ""My son and daughter used to love it – they had a magical time.”

Her cousin Diana Simpson (née Maitland) who lives in Aberdeen also got in touch with her excited about The Crown. “When I sent her the photograph she said she could not believe it saying I am very proud of my Uncle Billy” Mrs Osborne said.

Mrs Simpson's dad used to have the paint shop down by the riverside in Thurso E Maitland & Sons. She still has three brothers living in the town.

The boat that took the Queen Mother to Stroma accompanied by her lady-in-waiting and Commander and Lady Doris Vyner was part-owned by Angus Macintosh and Thurso provost John Sinclair.

The Queen Mother's purchase of the local castle features in episode eight of the first series of The Crown before the production crew started to film in Caithness. In the programme she can be seen during a visit to Commander and Lady Vyner of the House of the Northern Gate at Dunnet Head when she first set eyes on her new home. This was in June 1952 and she purchased it two months later.

Barbara is working her way through the series whenever she gets a chance keen to see the episodes featuring Caithness.

The Mackay family originally lived near the harbour in Thurso in Shore Street and the Queen Mother who was keen on fishing could be seen often visiting the nearby ship chandlers.

Barbara recalled that Her Majesty would go fishing on the river with Dan Murray who owned the lemonade factory. ""We used to love going up the rickety steps in the lemonade factory to see his photos of the Queen Mother"" she said.

From left: Dan Wares an ex-Stroma man Alex Thompson Malcolm Simpson another former Stroma man Bennie Sinclair Thurso provost John Sinclair and joint owner of the boat skipper Angus MacIntosh Billy (Borax) Mackay and Donny Latimer deckhand.

Her family had a long connection with the Thurso lifeboat. Grandad Robert Mackay (Bobby Borax) was a member and she thinks he helped to build the first lifeboat station while her father also used to lend a hand and her brother Donnie a joiner was a member of the crew. Billy Borax also played in the local Salvation Army band. Donnie and Barbara's other brother Robert still live in the Thurso area.

Also able to shed some light on the picnic and provide photos was former Stroma man John Manson whose family were the last to live on the island. While sharing his memories he explained that he helped out on the day along with David Dunnett.

“We carried the bags of goodies up the hill” Mr Manson said. “We were at the sea that morning. When we came in the Queen Mother was actually in the harbour – photographers were there. We carried her picnic – it was just another day for us.

“We were not supposed to know she was coming but we got word from the lighthouse keepers. We were told not to breathe a word of it to anybody.""

And that's why they left a large wooden lobster box on the quayside at the harbour just to show they were not expecting royalty that day.

It was said to be a beautiful warm day and the Queen Mother enjoyed some sightseeing on the island before her picnic.

It was reported last month that The Crown – starring Olivia Colman as the Queen – had been watched by 73 million households worldwide since the series began in 2016. Series four released in November included scenes filmed at Dunbeath Keiss Lybster and Ackergill Tower.

Robert James Qucsai III was seen entering the park located about 9 miles northwest of Cookeville at around 1:30 p.m. on Feb. 3.

Qucsai failed to retrieve his car which was found in the parking lot with no sign of Qucsai nearby. Attempts to locate him have been unsuccessful according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation which announced its involvement in the search Saturday.

Qucsai is from Holly Michigan according to a Facebook profile with his name and likeness. An Instagram profile that appears to belong to Qucsai describes him as an ""adventurer"" and ""hiker."" The most recent picture posted on the account was taken in Center Grove Tennessee on Feb. 3.

Cummins Falls State Park falls within Jackson County which is just outside of a winter weather advisory from 6 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday. Jackson County is on the fringes of an area of the Upper Cumberland Plateau expected to see between 1 and 2 inches of snow overnight.

Thoughts and prayers at this point would be greatly appreciated.”

After a three-day search the park reopened Sunday to the public according to Eric Ward a spokesman for the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.

In the voting period from January 9 2020 to January 19 2021 Smith scored the most international runs of any Australian player across all three formats.

He scored 1098 runs at an average of 45.75 including four centuries.

The two centuries that stand out most in the mind are arguable his back-to-back blistering innings against India at the SCG in the ODI matches towards the end of 2020.

It is the third time that Smith has won the award having claimed the gong in both 2015 and 2018.

Smith played the most matches of any Australian player in the voting period which would have helped him pick up the award.

Smith joins David Warner as a three-time winner of the award.

They are both chasing Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke who both won the award four times.

Many tipped Australian Test vice-captain Pat Cummins to win his second Allan Border Medal after a standout year with the ball.

He took 41 wickets across the voting period in international cricket at an average of 27.60 the most wickets of any Australian bowler.

Surprisingly Aaron Finch came in third with 97 votes after his fantastic form with the bat across Australia's limited-overs matches.

He finished with 944 runs at an average of 47.20 across 21 matches.

Steve Smith also won the award for the Men's ODI Player of the Year.

Smith polled 28 votes and was closely followed by limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch on 23 votes and Adam Zampa on 19 votes.

Pat Cummins was a clear winner of the Test Player of the Year after a wonderful season in the baggy green.

He finished on 16 votes beating out Josh Hazlewood (9 votes) and Marnus Labuschagne (8 votes) in a year where not much Test cricket was played.

There was a surprise in the T20 award with Ashton Agar awarded the Men's T20I Player of the Year.

Agar polled 19 votes with Finch again coming in second on 14 votes and David Warner in third on 13 votes.

Reflecting on his award Smith admits he was shocked to receive the medal among such a talented field in the past 12 months.

""I was a bit surprised"" Smith told reporters after being awarded the medal.

""I didn't feel I probably had the biggest Test summer which normally holds the most votes.

""I think my one-day cricket was pretty good last year so got a lot of votes there.

""It's obviously an honour to win this for the third time so really excited.

""For the rest of the night I'll be at home hopefully watching the Sixers win another tournament.""

Steve Smith (28) also won the ODI player of the year award. His ODI haul of 568 runs at 63.11 from 10 innings was enough to pip Finch (23) who scored 673 runs at 56.08 from 13 innings. Earlier Smith had picked up the ICC accolade of Test Player of the Decade in December.

Cummins (16) who was named player of the series in the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy with 21 wickets won the Test player of the year award.

Beth Mooney bags maiden Belinda Clarke Award

Women’s cricketer Beth Mooney who won her first Belinda Clarke Award is just the ninth winner of the prestigious award. She also ended the monopoly of teammates Meg Lanning (2014 2015 & 2017) Ellyse Perry (2016 2018 & 2020) and Alyssa Healy (2019) to claim the award since 2013.

Overall Mooney dominated with the bat during the voting period with 555 runs from 17 knocks. She had also scored three big knocks during the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup including her unbeaten 78 in the final against India to help her side secure the trophy at the MCG on March 8.

Mooney finished ahead of skipper Meg Lanning who scored 442 runs in the same period while young-gun Georgia Wareham (50) sealed her first podium finish. Lanning also lost out to her deputy Rachael Haynes in the race for the ODI women’s player of the year.

The group had reportedly made vaccination appointments in Waterford online through the CVS application. The seniors were reportedly unhappy about the decision but left without incident though their families were disapointed.

According to reports the Department of Health was tipped off to the out-of-staters by the director of Ledge Light Health District.

“I appreciate Ledge Light Health District and the Department of Public Health for following through on our concern that people from out of state were attempting to receive vaccinations that were allocated for our residents” First Selectman Rob Brule said in a statement.

Out-of-state visitors in Connecticut are not permitted to receive the vaccine which is available to seniors over the age of 75. The Waterford CVS is one of the few to allow for scheduling COVID-19 vaccines online.

“We recognize the high demand for COVID-19 vaccines” CVS posted online. “As more supply becomes available and eligibility expands we look forward to increasing access to vaccinations in more stores and to more people.”

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont also addressed the situation during a COVID-19 briefing this week.

“You have to live here in Connecticut or work here in Connecticut"" he said. ""You have to identify yourself as such when you sign on to say that CVS site to make that appointment for your vaccination. You're going to have to show proof of where you're from and you're going to have to show proof that you're over the age of 75.""

That’s because the number of doses that she and her co-workers had prepared — per the protocol established by Katherine’s manager at CVS the pharmacy she works for — exceeded the number of people who showed up to be inoculated often significantly.

Katherine — who asked to be identified by her confirmation name because she is not authorized to discuss company matters — and her colleagues realized that if they prepared just one or two vials at a time instead of 20 or more as they had been doing they could avoid wasting most doses.

“If you did it one vial at a time as people arrived you’d never have more than five or six extra shots at the end of any clinic” Katherine explained to me. “That’s few enough that you could find eligible recipients quickly so you wouldn’t have to toss any.”

But when Katherine asked her manager at CVS if she and her colleagues could change their protocol she says he brushed her off. (A spokesman for CVS said that immunizers are instructed not to prepare large numbers of doses at once and that wait lists are being established at each vaccination site to make use of any extra doses though Katherine says she has yet to see such a list at the sessions she’s participated in. The spokesman declined to discuss anecdotal reports to the contrary.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nb3BoZXItcmVtb3RlLWNvbnRyb2wtYm9hdC13YXN0ZS0xODAwMzg4MDguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,So about that gopher in the remote control boat at Waste Management Phoenix Open,"So about that gopher in the remote control boat at Waste Management Phoenix Open

SCOTTSDALE Ariz. — You’ve probably seen the little guy cruising around on his remote control boat during the TV coverage of the Waste Management Phoenix.

His name is the Green Gopher. Sometimes he wears a headband. This year he’s donning a mask. On Super Bowl Sunday he’ll sport some sort of NFL gear although his official spokesman would divulge nothing further so as to not spoil the surprise. A mini TB12 jersey perhaps? Again no secrets could be revealed.

For viewers on TV or fans at the course he’s probably just a fun gimmick a slick way for Waste Management to get some airtime for its logo.

But in reality the Green Gopher officially the Waste Management Recycling Ambassador has an actual job: to buzz around the lake and scare the birds away from the giant floating WM on the 18th hole although Golfweek can confirm that the Green Gopher’s boat no longer shoots water at the birds.

So now you know the story behind the Caddyshack-inspired Waste Management Phoenix Open mascot.

Coffee mate has been a roll with coffee creamer flavors lately. Case in point: the M&M’s Glazed Donut and Oatmeal Crème Pie varieties. Despite the creativity that the brand pumps out they’ve been missing what some consider to be a common flavor: Caramel.

Yes believe it or not Coffee mate is just stepping into the caramel game. It has had Vanilla Caramel Powder Sugar Free Vanilla Caramel Powder Sugar Free Chocolate Caramel and Caramel Latte Powder but no plain liquid caramel creamer. Hey better late than never!

Coffee mate shared the news on Instagram on Feb. 5 and people swarmed to the comments asking one question: Will there be a sugar-free version too? Sadly there won’t be at this time. However there are plenty of sugar-free options with caramel (as listed above) so let us have this one sugar-free drinkers.

“Caramel gets added to a lot of delicious treats but we think that the caramel should be the start of your coffee. Warm pure caramelized sugar flavor that tastes as good as it smells. With Coffee mate non-dairy coffee creamer you can create your perfect dessert any time you want it!” the description says.

You can find at the new Coffee mate Caramel Liquid Coffee Creamer wherever the brand is sold including at grocery stores Walmart and Target. The 32-ounce bottles is expected to stick around so it just might be your new favorite variety.

Multifaceted elements of mixed martial arts were on full display for three rounds before Dariush (20-4-1 MMA 14-4-1 UFC) was declared the victor by split decision (28-29 29-28 29-28) in the lightweight main-card opener at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

The first round started off a grappling affair but quickly turned into a slugfest. Dariush landed the first major strike of the fight a body shot that temporarily crumpled Ferreira (17-2 MMA 8-2 UFC). Despite the adversity Ferreira survived to land some big shots in the final minute of Round 1.

Dariush controlled most of Round 2. Once again his grappling appeared to be a step ahead of Ferreira who threatened unsuccessful submission attempts off his back.

Round 3 mostly took place on the feet. As the round progressed Dariush’s gas tank seemingly reduced but he continued to push forward. At the direction of coach Sayif Saud Ferreira stayed aggressive but was ultimately taken down and held for most of the final minute of action.

Is Delta Air Lines Trolling Us?

It is one thing to raise prices during a time of inflation. It is quite another to raise prices during a deflationary period as we currently find ourselves in especially when partners are going in the opposite direction.

Earlier this week we booked a round-trip journey from Los Angeles to Rome via Amsterdam on KLM for 103000 Air France/KLM Flying Blue miles. Taxes/fees were just under $500.

Were I to book the same flights on the same dates via Delta the price would have been 240000 miles and about $125 in taxes/fees.

Do you think we made the right choice?

United raised prices too (and I condemned it) but Delta continues to raise prices on partner awards to levels that are so far out of the norm that you have to wonder if they are just trolling us. By that I mean Delta does this to intentionally upset its customers.

Back in the day Karen Zachary the Managing Director of SkyMiles seemed to gloat at raising prices. That’s the vibe I feel with these sort of devaluations.

Delta says:

Delta regularly evaluates Award Pricing which can result in the increase or decrease of the mileage amount you need to purchase an Award Ticket.

Certainly Delta wants to discourage these sorts of redemptions in favor of absurd redemptions on Delta’s own metal but the latest string of price increases feeling like mocking all those who have saved miles in hopes of aspirational travel.

Prices for partner awards keep rising and I simply do not see value in collecting SkyMiles any more when you can collect points in a flexible currency instead.

I’ve long warned that miles and points are depreciating assets meant to be spent not hoarded. Nothing changes in terms of that general advice. But there’s an implied contract of good faith and fair dealing here…if I entice you to collect miles and save up for an award it’s manifestly unreasonable to massively inflate the price without notice.

But that’s simply what Delta does. Over and over again. Delta has raised prices without warning for years.

Your Response

Here’s what I’d do if I were you: rip up your Delta American Express cards. Call up American Express to complain and cancel them. Use a flexible card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or American Express Gold instead.

Delta only does this because it can get away with it. But I can tell you the values are simply not there. There once was value in paying 85K and $5.60 in taxes for a last-minute New York to London ticket when Virgin Atlantic was charging 45K miles but $600 in taxes/fees for the same ticket.

Not anymore. If you think 195K miles and $24.50 is a better deal than 45K miles and $600 please just switch to a cash-back card.

CONCLUSION

While I understand Delta does what it can get away with I think it shows deliberate disdain for members when prices accelerate without notice in an era of empty flights. In fact I think it rises to trolling. It’s as if Delta is daring us to book away. We should do so…

Does Delta’s conduct concerning partner award pricing constitute trolling?

Yes in the middle of a pandemic and we’re talking about simply huge price increases.

For example across two devaluations in just a few months:

One-way partner business class awards between the US and Europe increased in cost from 75000 miles to 95000 miles to 120000 miles

One-way partner business awards between the US and North Asia increased in cost from 85000 miles to 102500 miles to 120000 miles

I figured it might be worth stepping back for a moment and talking about why Delta is making these devaluations because it’s not for the reason that many may assume.

The economics of partner award redemptions

How exactly does it work when you redeem Delta miles on Korean Air (or American miles on Cathay Pacific or United miles on All Nippon Airways)? While the exact arrangements differ I’ve written in the past about how airlines reimburse one another for partner award tickets.

Generally speaking:

Airlines reimburse one another at a fixed cost on a per-segment basis for saver level award seats; often there’s surprisingly little variance in reimbursement costs based on length of flight etc.

These fixed costs can vary based on specific bilateral agreements between airlines; in other words Avianca LifeMiles and United MileagePlus may pay different amounts for the same Lufthansa business class award seat

It doesn’t matter whether you book that award seat a day out or 11 months out and it doesn’t matter if you’re traveling on a peak date/time or an off-peak date/time

Airlines are getting excellent deals on these tickets and it’s a reason that the business of selling miles for the purposes of partner redemptions is so robust and why Alaska Mileage Plan Avianca LifeMiles etc. can make money doing this.

Partner airline award redemptions are typically inexpensive

To paint with a very broad brush I’d say airlines with attractive award costs are paying about a cent per mile redeemed on partner airlines:

To be clear the loyalty program with which you redeem miles sets mileage costs based on how much award tickets cost that program; mileage costs are not set by the airline you’re flying with

However I’d say roughly one cent per redeemed mile is a fair average when you add up all the miles redeemed on partners and how much programs are paying for those seats

American charges 60000 miles for business class between the US and Asia and I’d expect a JAL business class award seat costs American AAdvantage somewhere around $600 (again I’m really generalizing here)

For airlines partner redemptions are often much less costly than redemptions on that carrier’s own metal given that they don’t have to worry about whether that seat could have otherwise been sold and how much revenue would be lost.

Loyalty programs and revenue management are constantly at odds with one another when it comes to redemptions with the program’s own airline. Different airlines have different working relationships between departments but you can expect conversations like this happening at a lot of airlines:

Loyalty program: “When it becomes clear that premium cabin seats won’t be sold close to departure maybe we could make them available for awards?”

Revenue management: “But tickets are only more expensive close to departure and XYZ ticket would cost $7000 why would we give that away?”

Loyalty program: “Yeah but you’re not going to sell the seats so can’t we at least let people redeem some miles?”

Revenue management: “But miles are just a currency and we’ll potentially be cannibalizing sales. What if people redeem miles in lieu of booking a revenue ticket?”

Loyalty programs: “But the loyalty program is supposed to reward loyal members…”

Let me acknowledge that I’m totally generalizing here but I’m trying to strike a balance between being accurate and explaining something complex in a few hundred words.

Arguably redemptions on Delta are more costly for the airline

So what’s Delta SkyMiles’ motivation?

Delta SkyMiles is absolutely determined to make each mile worth one cent towards virtually any Delta purchase whether we’re talking about flights upgrades alcohol in SkyClubs or whatever else. Delta isn’t quite there yet but it’s clear that’s the goal.

There’s not another major global network that has tried to turn its mileage program into a cash equivalent currency quite in the way SkyMiles has. The way I view it:

This is probably good for your average consumer since it makes SkyMiles easy to redeem

At the same time it eliminates virtually any ability to get outsized value

Nonetheless at Delta it’s clear that the loyalty program and revenue management are on the same page about SkyMiles’ position.

I would speculate with a high level of confidence that Delta SkyMiles was coming out ahead with partner redemptions even pre-devaluation. In other words when you redeemed 75000 miles for partner business class to Europe I’d be willing to bet that would cost Delta less than $750.

If that’s the case what’s Delta’s motivation for increasing partner award costs then? I don’t even think it’s about increasing margins on these redemptions but rather I think it’s part of Delta’s continued effort to condition SkyMiles members to believe that each mile is worth a cent:

Most one-way international business class awards on Delta cost 300000+ SkyMiles because even for international premium cabin redemptions Delta is trying to peg each mile at one cent of value

It hurts Delta’s claims and confuses consumers when the airline is charging 300000+ miles for one-way business class awards on its own flights but a quarter as much for business class awards on partner airlines

Not exactly great one-way redemption rates eh?

Even before these latest devaluations it was evident that this was all about changing consumer perception of things:

Delta SkyMiles had long charged more miles for last minute international redemptions on its own flights to reflect that international tickets are typically more expensive last minute

A couple of years back we saw Delta SkyMiles start to charge more miles for last minute redemptions on partner flights even though I can say with near certainty that Delta SkyMiles wasn’t paying more for those redemptions

Delta SkyMiles has continued to devalue partner redemptions

It’s all about conditioning consumers. How is a consumer suppose to make sense of last minute redemptions being pricier on Delta flights but not on partner flights?

I truly believe the Delta SkyMiles devaluations have nothing to do with costs but have to do with consistency for SkyMiles members. Delta will continue to devalue SkyMiles until the program is consistent.

To give Delta SkyMiles some credit there are a few exceptions where you can get outsized value. For example Delta does occasionally have flash sales on award redemptions both domestically and internationally intended to keep members engaged and offer extra value.

Bottom line

Delta SkyMiles has devalued partner redemptions twice in just a few months in the middle of a pandemic. I believe this has nothing to do with Delta’s costs for these redemptions or with supply & demand.

Rather Delta’s partner devaluations come down to the airline continuing to try to make consumers believe that each mile in the program is worth a penny. That’s a hard narrative when the airline charges 650000 miles for a roundtrip business class award to Europe on its own flights while it charges less than a quarter as much on partner airlines.

The pandemic probably seemed to Delta like the perfect time to do this — not many people are looking at long haul partner flights so this is as good of a time as any to “align” costs. I suspect we’ll continue to see partner awards devalued until they match Delta’s pricing.

And in closing let me say that I think Delta SkyMiles has the wrong strategy. Delta is great in spite of SkyMiles and not because of it. With SkyMiles increasingly being worth about a cent each there’s not as much incentive to use SkyMiles credit cards for spending and it really disengages a not-insignificant portion of the customer base.

Do you agree with my take or what do you think Delta’s motivation is for SkyMiles partner devaluations?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS10ZWNob3BzLXRyZW50LTcwMDAtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Rolls Royce Trent 7000 Engine Visits Delta TechOps For Maintenance,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS10ZWNob3BzLXRyZW50LTcwMDAtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1bGtoZWFkLXdvcnN0LWFpcnBsYW5lLXNlYXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the bulkhead is my least favorite seat on the plane,"Everyone has a preferred seat on the plane. Some snag the aisle; others like me choose the window.

But another consideration that will make a substantial difference in the flight experience is where you sit in the cabin.

Personally the answer is never the bulkhead. Let me explain why.

No under-seat storage

When I first posed the question on my Instagram page (follow me there) the biggest drawback I noted about the bulkhead was the lack of under-seat storage.

Federal rules require that anyone seated in Row 1 or in another row with a fixed wall in front of them store all their belongings in the overhead compartment during taxi takeoff and landing.

You're allowed to keep your bags at your seat once cruising but there's no dedicated storage space so your belongings will cut into your (already limited) legroom.

I'm often working during flight so I value convenient access to my backpack. Plus finding overhead bin space can be challenging especially for me since I always try to board at the end.

No space to stretch your legs

Many proponents of sitting in the bulkhead cite the advantage that no one will recline into your space.

But the flipside to that argument is that there's less space to stretch your legs. Though some cabins including American's improved ""Kodiak"" first-class on the Airbus A321 have built footwell cutouts into the bulkhead walls most airlines don't offer such passenger-friendly features.

As such your leg space is limited by the immovable wall. Sure you can perch your legs on the wall but I find that uncomfortable (and some find that socially unacceptable).

Immovable armrests and misplaced in-flight entertainment

Two of the other inconveniences with the bulkhead include the placement of the tray tables and seat-back screens.

In most economy and domestic first-class seats the tray table folds down from the seat in front of you. In the bulkhead it folds out of the armrest.

As such the table has less support and is often more flimsy than normal. It's also placed more awkwardly — closer to the stomach and lower toward the legs.

The armrest is also immovable since it holds the tray table often limiting the seat width.

Additionally if your jet is outfitted with seat-back screens you'll either find that they flip out from the center console or are fixed to the wall in front of you. Both have awkward viewing angles compared to those in regular seats.

Overcrowding

During the pandemic I'm doing as much as I can to minimize my person-to-person interactions. Of course that's nearly impossible on a plane though the bulkhead is definitely one of the more crowded spaces throughout the cabin.

You'll often find the lavatories and/or galley situated right in front of the bulkhead row meaning that lines could form for the restrooms and crew could congregate during service — right next to your seat.

When faced with the choice I prefer to sit in the last row of the domestic first-class cabin far away from the lavatories and galley. In coach I'll give myself at least a three-row buffer from the front of the plane.

Of course some people swear by Row 1 since it offers faster deplaning but I prefer waiting a few minutes once we're on the ground in exchange for a more comfortable in-flight experience.

The one case where I might choose the bulkhead

While much of the above reasoning applies to nearly every domestic flight I take the opposite is true for long-haul jaunts in premium cabins.

When flying internationally in business or first-class the bulkhead is often one of the best seats for an improved sleeping experience.

For taller passengers and/or those with large feet the footwell cutout in the bulkhead is usually substantially larger than other pods.

Of course you'll need to consider the noise and light pollution that might come from the galley during a red-eye flight.

In JetBlue's overhauled Mint cabin the carrier will offer two ""Studios"" with substantially more living space in the front row. When flying the new product I'll do all that I can to snag one of the two above-average suites even though it's located in the bulkhead.

Bottom line

The bulkhead is my least favorite seat on the plane.

With limited under-seat storage and legroom I'll typically do all that I can to avoid sitting there. Your tray table and seat-back monitor are also placed inconveniently in the front row.

Others prefer the bulkhead since there's no one reclining into them but for me the cons far outweigh the (limited) advantages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvd2l0aC1qdXN0LTItc2VudGVuY2VzLWNlby1vZi11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtanVzdC10YXVnaHQtYS1ib2xkLWxlc3Nvbi1pbi1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Just 2 Sentences the CEO of United Airlines Just Taught a Bold Lesson in Leadership.

In the spot—the company’s first Super Bowl ad and certainly its highest-profile platform—pop star Nick Jonas endorses a product called the Dexcom G6. I’ve been using Dexcom products for five years.

Like Jonas I’m one of this country’s 1.6 million Type 1 diabetics. (Unlike Jonas I was diagnosed in adulthood.) People with this chronic condition are the most common users of a Dexcom. The disease causes a person’s immune system to attack their pancreas until it ultimately shuts down. That means we need to do the pancreas’s job for it by injecting synthetic insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. (Consistently high blood sugar can lead to complications like blindness kidney damage and premature death; low blood sugar can cause immediate complications like dropping dead.)



A few years ago we’d monitor our blood sugar levels by pricking a finger and running a drop of blood through a test strip a dozen times a day. Today thanks to the Dexcom device—the most current version is the G6—we get a continuous readout of our levels and the speed at which they’re rising or falling. This information is delivered through an app on our smartphones.

When I call a Dexcom “a lifesaver” I mean that literally. The most recent of the many times a Dexcom has saved my life happened just a couple of months ago. I was on a long bike ride in L.A.’s Griffith Park when a screech interrupted the music in my AirPods. It was a low blood sugar alert the two downward arrows on my phone screen indicated that my level was dropping quickly and the system estimated that if I didn’t act quickly I’d be in a life-threatening area within twenty minutes. These episodes happen and often I feel them in my body as they come on but other times like this one I’m living my life and not noticing. The advance warning allowed me to stop consume a glucose gel from my bag wait until I stabilized and go on about my ride. If I hadn’t known I might have passed out on an isolated trail where if nobody found me I would die. But the more likely scenario is that without the Dexcom I just wouldn’t have gone. I wouldn’t have had the tools and the information to do a long ride safely so I wouldn’t have done one at all. I’d have stayed home. I’d be living a less active life which would make my overall health outcomes worse.

The Dexcom is a miraculous device. More people should know about it. A hot healthy young star like Nick Jonas pulls Type 1 into the spotlight diminishes stigma and increases visibility. Representation matters and so does brand awareness for a product that can keep its user alive.

So why does this commercial rub some in the Type 1 community the wrong way? When the company released the commercial last week a number of people with Type 1 diabetes spoke up on Twitter Facebook Instagram and Reddit. Their chief complaint: this live-saving device is too expensive for most T1s.

“The ad is like Why are you stuck in the past? Get on this be like Nick” says Craig Stubing founder of the Beta Cell Foundation a non-profit that aims to educate and empower Type 1s. “But they don’t have to convince us. Everyone who knows about it wants it. The issue is we can’t afford it.” According to Dexcom’s most recent stockholder statement only a quarter of the country’s 1.6 million Type 1s use the device but Stubing believes that doesn’t speak to a lack of awareness.

While Jonas makes it look fun and easy to use a Dexcom G6—a program to just get with like you would a drone or LED eyelashes—the process of acquiring one is complicated and often very expensive even for people with good insurance. Which makes the year’s most expensive ad buy for a product that only a small percentage of the U.S. population needs confusing to me and others. A 30-second commercial spot in Super Bowl LV costs $5.5 million and that just covers the time. This ad has special effects high production values and a big star. “Spending all this money on an ad when people's lives are at stake” Stubing says pausing. “I don't know if offensive is the right word but it seems out of touch with the reality that their patients are facing.”

Courtesy of Dexcom Nick Jonas shows off his Dexcom G6 a life-saving device for Type 1 diabetics who can afford it.

While a Dexcom can greatly improve a Type 1s quality of life that Type 1’s quantity of life depends on access to insulin. As in if you don’t have any you will die in a matter of days. It’s not cheap either. The list price of a vial of insulin was $20 in 1996; it’s now around $275 for the exact same product. At least once a week I see a fellow Type 1 posting a GoFundMe for insulin or asking if anyone can share theirs. “Twenty-five percent of Type 1s in America can’t afford their insulin” says Stubing. “I've personally given insulin to people friends and strangers because they were out of it and I had happened to have extra because I was lucky.” Being a Type 1 diabetic is already an onerous expense even without the cutting-edge equipment. In the meantime Dexcom made nearly a billion dollars in profit last year.

A spokesman for Dexcom told Esquire that part of the company's marketing efforts—in addition to bringing the conversation about diabetes to the masses—includes improving and expanding access as well. ""It’s important to understand that raising awareness is a critical component of the fight to improve access and reimbursement so running an ad during the Super Bowl is one of the most impactful ways to support and energize our ongoing efforts to make CGM accessible to everyone who can benefit from it"" the spokesman said in an email.

After the ad aired on Sunday several people tweeted positively in response to the awareness it brought to Type 1 diabetes.

The Super Bowl ad is also meant to speak to a much larger segment of the marketplace: the country’s 30 million Type 2 diabetics the company said. Though the names are similar the conditions are different. The pancreas of a Type 2 works as normal but the body has built up a resistance to the insulin it produces. While a Type 2 can benefit from continuous blood glucose monitoring he is not vulnerable to the lows that can result from synthetic insulin. It’s less of an immediate life-or-death situation for them.

“My daughter's pretty excited to see it. Stuff like this makes her feel more normal.”

A run on Dexcom G6 equipment could raise the price even higher and with system outages and production slowdowns plaguing the service already leaving users without supplies for days or weeks at a time breaking into a market that’s twenty times bigger than their existing user base could complicate this further.

I’m glad I have this thing. I want more people to have this thing. And if a company that was making them found itself with let’s say $5.5 million extra dollars burning a hole in its pocket there are other useful things it could do with that money besides buy a Super Bowl ad. The price of the airtime alone for instance could get more than 1300 people up and running on the system for a full year. Stubing has an idea: “Find a thousand people who are struggling who have lost their jobs who have lost their insurance get them up and running on it and film that. Show that you have some empathy for this community and people will share it.”

“Companies in the healthcare space need to have a moral reckoning on what their mission is and be honest about it” he continued. “Is their mission just to make money or is their mission to help people? Seeing a company profit so much off of something people need to live makes us feel like we're just commodities. We're just a thing to sell another thing to. We're not people who want to live full happy lives we're just another line on the balance sheet.”

For its part Dexcom has a team that works with private insurance payers and governments to expand and improve coverage for CGM the company's spokesman said. Last year Dexcom introduced a patient assistance program for U.S. patients who have lost their health insurance coverage as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ad could have some other benefits that are harder to quantify. Just yesterday I traded texts with one of my best friends whose young daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 just last year. It was a hard experience for the whole family; it’s scary it’s painful there is a lot to learn and the stakes are high. His daughter just got up on the Dexcom system. Now he and his wife can follow her blood sugar levels on their phones where just a couple of months ago one of them would have to wake up in the middle of the night and prick her finger. Their family-wide quality of life has improved vastly. “Did you hear about the Dexcom ad?” he asked me. I said I did.

He said she was excited to see it. ""Stuff like this makes her feel more normal.”

So maybe it’s just that simple. But still watching an expensive commercial for an item much of its intended audience can’t afford from a company with enormous cash flow starring and paying someone who will never have to worry about the price of insulin at a time when people are losing their jobs and therefore their insurance I can't help but think: “...Really?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaG9sbHl3b29kbGlmZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9uaWNrLWpvbmFzLWRleGNvbS1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtMjAyMS1hZC13YXRjaC_SAV9odHRwczovL2hvbGx5d29vZGxpZmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvbmljay1qb25hcy1kZXhjb20tc3VwZXItYm93bC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLTIwMjEtYWQtd2F0Y2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nick Jonas Ages 50 Years With A Snap Of His Fingers In Dexcom’s Super Bowl Ad,"View gallery

“We have the technology to do this” Nick Jonas says at the start of Dexcom’s commercial slated for Super Bowl LV (Feb. 7.) With a snap of his finger the 28-year-old singer is suddenly a silver fox. Gone are his boyish looks and instead the pop star shows a touch of grey and a lot of wrinkles. In the past this would be a marvel of CGI and special effects. Today it’s an Instagram filter which is why Nick asks in the commercial why “people with diabetes are still pricking their fingers? What?”

After marveling about delivery drones self-driving cars vacuuming robots and the fact that we’ve visited Mars Nick is done with “fingersticks.” Enter the Dexcom G6 a glucose monitoring system that helps those with diabetes monitor their condition from the comfort of their mobile device. For Nick who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was only 13 finding a better way to manage diabetes is a cause that’s near and dear to his heart.

“Too many people with diabetes suffer through painful antiquated fingerpricks because they don’t know a better way exists” said Jonas in an accompanying press release. “I truly believe people with diabetes deserve the absolute best care and that’s really the spirit of my first Super Bowl commercial. It means so much to me to bring this message of awareness and the need for improved CGM access to as many people with diabetes as possible.”

Nick has also partnered with Dexcom to help bring a bit of joy for Super Bowl Sunday. Those with diabetes are at a higher risk of COVID-19-related complications so social distancing and staying quarantined is a must. To help fans feel less lonely on Feb. 7 Dexcom will offer fans a chance to “watch the game” with Nick Jonas via an augmented reality experience. Visit DexcomGameDay.com to find out how.

“We are very excited to partner with Nick to shed light on [the] technology that we know can significantly improve the lives of people with diabetes” said Chad Patterson senior vice president of global marketing for Dexcom per the press release. “People with diabetes deserve the best care so along with leading diabetes advocacy groups healthcare professionals and payers we are trying to increase awareness and improve access for CGM.”

Tens of millions of people with diabetes worldwide are still pricking their fingers to measure their glucose levels. The Dexcom G6 CGM system per the press release “uses a small wearable sensor and transmitter to measure and send real-time glucose values wirelessly to a compatible smart device or receiver eliminating the need for painful fingerpricks. Dexcom CGM also displays trend arrows to show the speed and direction glucose levels are heading making in-the-moment treatment decisions easier and helping people with diabetes avoid potentially dangerous high or low glucose events.”

Dexcom also noted that if glucose alerts and readings from the Dexcom G6 do not match symptoms or expectations use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions.

Jonas stars alongside two other real users in the ad: Breana Raquel and Ric Peralta. Those interested can also watch the game with Jonas via augmented reality via DexcomGameday.com.

Jonas has long been open about living with Type 1 diabetes.

Last year after the release of the Jonas Brothers' documentary Chasing Happiness in 2019 he shared a message about managing his diabetes.

""This experience has shaped how I approach my health — working out eating well and always thinking about my blood sugar and insulin needs"" Jonas wrote in the post which included a selfie of himself wearing a hat with the Beyond Type 1 logo.

""You can't always see what goes into managing an invisible illness and Type 1 diabetes can feel lonely and isolating"" he continued. ""That's why I co-founded @BeyondType1 in 2015 to make sure no one feels alone with this diagnosis and to share how you can thrive with Type 1 diabetes.""

Jonas' diagnosis came when he was 13 years old after one of his older brothers noticed his symptoms — an unquenchable thirst for sugary sodas paired with some drastic weight loss.

Those with Type 1 diabetes create very little or no insulin requiring medication. Jonas previously said that when he was first diagnosed he was fearful of not being able to continue life as he had been living it.

""I kept asking my parents — am I going to be okay?"" he once told Cigar Aficionado. ""I was just so concerned that it was going to limit my ability to do all the things I wanted to do. I was very scared — it's a big life change.""

Instead there will be at least 15 first-time advertisers stepping in to fill the void.

While every Super Bowl commercial slate features a handful of new brands this year's group is notably large – and particularly eclectic. There's a startup that makes men's soaps and personal care products. A Swedish banking company. And at least two food delivery services.

The going rate for a 30-second spot during CBS' broadcast this year was $5.5 million.

Here's a look at just seven of the brands that will step onto the Super Bowl stage for the first time Sunday courtesy of USA TODAY's Ad Meter which ranks Super Bowl commercials based on consumer rating.

Dexcom

Rarely do we see a niche health technology company step onto the Super Bowl stage. But Dexcom which makes continuous glucose monitoring systems is taking that step this year with a 30-second spot that will air after the first quarter. The ad is narrated by musician Nick Jonas who has Type 1 diabetes.

Dr. Squatch

After years of building brand awareness with viral YouTube videos Dr. Squatch decided to take its campaign to the big game this year a significant step for a company that sells men's soap and other personal care products. The move comes on the heels of a strong 2020 in which Dr. Squatch says it reached roughly $100 million in sales.

Klarna

Actress and comedian Maya Rudolph stars in this 30-second spot for Klarna a Swedish banking company that among other things allows consumers to ""buy now and pay later."" Four miniature versions of Rudolph ride into a Western town to show how Klarna allows consumers to pay for an item in four separate installments. Chief marketing officer David Sandstrom called the ad an ""exciting milestone"" for the company.

Robinhood

It's been quite the month for Robinhood the stock-trading platform that many amateur investors used to purchase shares in Gamestop and manipulate the market. The company later drew criticism (and lawsuits) for temporarily blocking its users from buying Gamestop shares. Robinhood's 30-second Super Bowl ad is titled ""We Are All Investors.""

ScottsMiracle-Gro

The lawn and gardening company is making its first foray into the Super Bowl with a celebrity-heavy spot featuring Martha Stewart John Travolta and more. The 45-second ad which will run in the second quarter is part of a broader campaign from ScottsMiracle-Gro in the leadup to spring and encourages viewers to ""keep growing.""

Uber Eats

Mike Myers and Dana Carvey reprise their ""Wayne's World"" roles in a 60-second spot for Uber Eats which also features rapper Cardi B. The food delivery service has enjoyed a surge in business during the COVID-19 pandemic as many Americans have eschewed dining out at restaurants. DoorDash a similar company is also making its Super Bowl advertising debut with a 60-second ad of its own during the first quarter.

Vroom

While car brands like Hyundai and Kia decided to bow out of this year's commercial lineup Vroom – which allows people to buy or sell used vehicles online – decided to hop in. The company said its 30-second spot will be the first national ad for a used car company to air during the Super Bowl since 2014. It also comes roughly eight months after Vroom went public.

Baijiu (pronounced bye-j’ou) is made in vast quantities there; the annual production is nearly eight billion litres and there are 6000 certified distilleries.

Yet strangely it is barely known here – indeed it’s estimated that 99 per cent of baijiu is consumed in China with very little trickling out into the export market. But now entrepreneur ex-pastry chef and part-time ballroom dancer Qiqi Chen has started bringing Fenjiu Baijiu from north-west Shanxi province into the UK – and I’m a convert.

Baijiu is a clear spirit made from fermented grains and (usually) aged for a long time before release. Its production is complex involving the creation of qu a “starter” in the form of a brick made of grains and pulses (in Fenjiu’s case from peas and barley) and spring water which attracts specific bacteria and is then mixed with sorghum grain and more water fermented and twice distilled.

The result is stored in a ceramic jar the minute porous quality of which aids the ageing process which might take 10 20 30 years or more (the age is in each spirit’s title).

There are three main types named Light Aroma Strong Aroma and Sauce Aroma (the latter intense and savoury). Fenjiu makes Light Aroma baijius – Chen believes this more delicate expression offers the best introduction to the spirit but there’s also a range infused with bamboo leaves and 11 other Chinese herbs which are pale gold and have (unsurprisingly) herbal notes – to my mind the botanical gin to baijiu’s fine vodka.

She guided me on Zoom through 10 samples of Fenjiu Baijiu including several bamboo-infused versions and ranging from a rare unaged spirit to 30-year-old examples. Delicate they might be but they are certainly complex and highly distinctive from one other. My tasting notes included “honeyed” “spicy” “umami” “fresh and grassy” “peppery” with light hints of apricot ginger various tropical fruits and toffee.

Baijiu is usually served at room temperature neat and during celebrations it is sipped before during and after a meal and especially as an accompaniment to traditional Chinese dumplings.

It also makes an inspiring cocktail ingredient. Try a simple mix of 30ml Fenjiu Baijiu with 30ml Campari 75ml chilled orange juice topped up with 25ml ginger ale and garnished with an orange slice.

The prices are steep thanks to the intricate and lengthy production process. But baijiu lasts just fine for months after opening and it comes in the most beautiful bottles. It’s something for a special occasion I feel starting perhaps with the arrival of the Year of the Ox.

Bill Breeden sat at a picnic table a few miles from the penitentiary mulling his last words. As Johnson’s minister of record Breeden had agreed to read a final statement on his behalf. “I took notes on what he wants to say and kind of put it together” he told me. Anyone who had corresponded with Johnson knew that his writing skills were limited. “He’s childlike in a lot of ways” Breeden said. “But he’s extremely brilliant in a lot of ways.”

Breeden had left the penitentiary in Terre Haute Indiana just a little while earlier. It was his final visit with Johnson and his eyes were red. Their time together had been brief but intense: five visits over a couple of weeks. Johnson was recovering from Covid-19 which left him fatigued. Breeden marveled at Johnson’s spirit which had withstood 29 years in solitary confinement without a visitor apart from his attorneys. “He’s a beautiful person” Breeden said adding “He’s very remorseful about his crimes.”

Johnson 52 was sentenced to death in 1993 when he was in his early 20s. Tried as a “drug kingpin” alongside two other men under the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act he was convicted of seven murders — a shocking body count that many would associate with the “worst of the worst.” Yet the case would not likely end in a death sentence today. There was significant proof that Johnson had an intellectual disability which should have forbidden him from being sentenced to death. But reviewing courts refused to consider the evidence.

Regardless Breeden’s task was not to judge Johnson for his crimes. As Johnson’s spiritual adviser his job was to prepare him to die. “I don’t care who you are or what you’ve done” he said. “I think when you’re dying life should give you the gift of being in the presence of somebody who cares instead of just people who are paid to kill you.” Breeden knew that many on death row had little sense of self-worth. He shared with Johnson the tale of “The Velveteen Rabbit” about a boy and his beloved stuffed animal which eventually comes to life. “You become real by being loved” Breeden said. Although Johnson’s family had never come to see him on death row they were in Terre Haute now. Several planned to witness his execution.

A Unitarian minister with a history of civil disobedience Breeden is well-known among a certain generation of social justice activists in Southern Indiana. He and his wife Glenda live on 42 rural acres just outside Spencer a small town 15 miles from Bloomington. A lifelong pacifist Breeden’s biggest claim to fame is being the only person imprisoned as a result of the Iran-Contra scandal. After a street in his hometown of Odon was renamed for Adm. John Poindexter President Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser Breeden stole the sign and held it for a ransom of $30 million — the sum transferred to the Contras in Nicaragua. He spent four days in jail.

The Breedens were a regular presence at the protests against the Trump administration’s executions. They were among a small handful of activists who had also protested the last round of federal executions 17 years earlier beginning with Timothy McVeigh in 2001. In the intervening years Bill Breeden had forged a close relationship with another man on federal death row. When we first spoke last summer Breeden was worried that the man who also has an intellectual disability might be on the verge of an execution date.

Although Breeden has generally found the employees who work in the Special Confinement Unit to be decent people there have been exceptions. Breeden often tells a story that captures how cruel such individuals can be. It was an open secret that his friend on death row had raised mice for years — one way to forge connections with living creatures while living in crushing isolation. He named the mice and trained them. But one year a new unit manager came in and ordered an unexpected shakedown. The mice were discovered. When Breeden’s friend begged the guards not to harm the mice the unit manager mocked him. “And he said ‘I can’t give them back to you I just flushed them down the stool’” Breeden said. His friend tried to kill himself shortly afterward.

There were smaller indignities too right up until a person’s execution date. Johnson had requested jelly-filled donuts as part of his last meal Breeden told me but was given donut holes instead. “I said ‘That ain’t right. They tell you you can have anything you want but you can’t get jelly-filled donuts?’” He said he planned to incorporate this into Johnson’s final statement. Perhaps it would add a moment of levity.

But the moment never came. The next time I saw Breeden it was just after midnight and he was walking unsteadily in the dark toward the activists gathered at the Dollar General across from the penitentiary. Raw anguish was written on his face. Johnson had been pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m. “I’ve just witnessed the most unimaginable cold-blooded premeditated murder” Breeden said. “I can’t imagine anything worse.”

“I’ve just witnessed the most unimaginable cold-blooded premeditated murder. I can’t imagine anything worse.”

Inside the execution chamber a Bureau of Prisons official had read the death warrant with the exaggerated flair of a circus announcer. There was cheering and applause from one of the witness rooms when Johnson was declared dead presumably from relatives of Johnson’s victims. “I don’t think they would have laughed and clapped if they had let me read Corey’s last statement” Breeden said. But officials wouldn’t allow it. “They said he has to read it. How’s he gonna read it when he’s lying like this?” he said stretching out his arms.

Breeden asked for a flashlight and read the statement he had crafted with Johnson. “I want to say that I am sorry for my crimes” he began. He listed all seven of Johnson’s victims. “I want these names to be remembered” he said telling their families “I hope you will find peace.”

“To my family I have always loved you” Breeden continued. “And your love has made me real. … I am not the same man that I was.” He thanked the prison staff for their kindness and for giving him pizza and a strawberry shake. “But I didn’t get my jelly-filled donuts that I ordered. What’s with that? This should be fixed.”

Dismantle the Death Chamber

Amid the coronavirus pandemic presidential election and right-wing insurrection Trump’s execution spree ended much like it began with three killings carried out back-to-back over the course of one week. In all 13 people died in the federal death chamber between July 2020 and January 2021. If not for the abrupt departure of Attorney General William Barr and a major Covid-19 outbreak on federal death row in December the number may well have been even higher.

Although it took some time for Americans to start paying attention the killings revitalized the fight against the death penalty in the United States. Many of the executions were emblematic of capital punishment’s enduring unfairness and the final three were no exception. Lisa Montgomery the only woman under a federal death sentence had lived a life marked by extreme trauma and mental illness. Johnson was killed despite a Supreme Court ban on executing people with intellectual disabilities. And Dustin Higgs the last man to die was executed for three murders carried out by another man who had since said that the government’s case was “bullshit.” All of the last six men killed were Black.

On January 21 the day after Joe Biden’s inauguration I joined a Zoom panel sponsored by Columbia University titled “Abolish the Federal Death Penalty!” The introduction was upbeat. “This is the first time in American history … that a president of the United States has declared himself to be an abolitionist” said the moderator law professor Bernard Harcourt who has handled capital cases for years.

One of the featured speakers was Rep. Adriano Espaillat D-N.Y. who has helped lead the charge to abolish the federal death penalty. The calls from activists and lawmakers go well beyond asking Biden to issue a moratorium which would leave people on federal death row vulnerable to execution in the future. In a letter written on behalf of 45 members of Congress last month Espaillat and Rep. Ayanna Pressley D-Mass. urged Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland to stop seeking new death sentences and “direct the Bureau of Prisons to dismantle the federal death chamber” in Terre Haute.

Much of the panel focused on an aspect of executions that is often ignored: the impact on the families of the condemned. Author and activist Susannah Sheffer explained it in terms of a concept known as disenfranchised grief: “when a loss cannot be openly acknowledged publicly mourned or socially supported.” She was joined by Lee Greenwood whose son was executed in Texas in 2007. His death continued to reverberate Greenwood said but she was also fortunate compared to others in her position. One woman she knew had been shunned in her small town after her loved one was sent to death row. Greenwood was grateful that her own friends stood by her. “I don’t know what to say just know that I’m here” she recalled some of them telling her.

As the panelists spoke Alexa Cave Wingate was watching the event on her phone at a shopping mall in Georgia where she was buying birthday gifts for her granddaughters. It had been less than a week since she’d witnessed the execution of her brother Higgs. Media witnesses had described loud sobbing coming through the walls that night; the sounds had come from her. Now Wingate was trying to move forward but the Bureau of Prisons had not even sent her brother’s body for burial. Unable to get through to anyone from the federal government she took to Twitter to pressure the BOP. “We’re having a hard time” she told me in a text message later that night. “But we’ll get it together.”

The following week Death Penalty Action held another Zoom call this one featuring Pressley. Since the controversial execution of Brandon Bernard in December Pressley said support for her abolition bill which she first introduced in 2019 had skyrocketed. Between the House and Senate versions the number of co-sponsors had climbed from 20 to 80 she said. “And it continues to grow.”

The call also featured Lisa Brown whose son Christopher Vialva was Bernard’s co-defendant — and the seventh person killed in the execution spree. Since witnessing his execution last September Brown had devoted herself to helping other families navigate the process. In a recent phone call Brown told me that Johnson’s family had yet to receive his remains. They feared they had been lost in transit — and like Wingate they could not get any answers from the BOP. “It has just been horrific to talk to the families about the things that they’ve endured after the fact” Brown told attendees of the meeting.

In response to questions about the handling of Johnson’s and Higgs’s remains a BOP spokesperson said he was “unable to address specific inmate cases” but referred me to a document containing policy information on the bureau’s handling of people who die in its custody. It was titled “Patient Care.”

Brown told me she was especially distraught over Johnson’s execution. She had corresponded with him in the month leading up to his execution and it was immediately clear from his limited writing skills that what his lawyers said about his intellectual disability was true. She was angered when she heard about the cheering audible from the witness room the night that he died. Before she set foot in the room where she would watch the government kill her own son she said “I was specifically instructed … that if we banged on that witness room window if we said anything too loud if we got too loud even with our crying that we would be removed.”

Just Look at Me

Of the final three people scheduled to die many believed Lisa Montgomery had the best shot at clemency. Although her crimes were horrific — the murder of a pregnant woman and the abduction of the woman’s unborn child — it was clear to most including others on federal death row that they were driven by trauma and mental illness. “Everyone I’ve talked to about Lisa including the staff all concluded that Lisa was ‘crazy’” one condemned man wrote to me after her execution.

Since the Bureau of Prisons first notified Montgomery in October that she’d been given a date to die her fragile mental state had dramatically worsened. At the medical prison where she was incarcerated in Texas she was stripped of all her belongings including photos of her children and placed in a small cell that was brightly lit around the clock. The conditions designed to prevent suicide were described as torture in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. Montgomery a survivor of extreme sexual violence was not allowed to wear her normal undergarments and she had no privacy when using the bathroom. It was only due to pressure from her attorneys that Montgomery was allowed a pair of socks a crayon and a single piece of paper at a time.

Montgomery’s attorneys arrived in Terre Haute on the Saturday before her scheduled execution on January 12. They were not notified in advance of when she would be transported from Texas to Indiana but they knew it would be close to her execution date. Days earlier her attorney Kelley Henry had presented Montgomery’s clemency petition to pardon attorneys at the Department of Justice in a video call while watching footage of the insurrection at the Capitol.

On the morning of her execution Montgomery met with her spiritual adviser who told her that he would be in the execution chamber with her and would sing “Amazing Grace” and “Jesus Loves Me” when the lethal injection drugs started to flow. But when he arrived that night he was not allowed in the room. As the execution began one media witness wrote an executioner removed Montgomery’s face mask and asked if she had any last words. “‘No’ Montgomery responded in a quiet muffled voice. She said nothing else.” She was pronounced dead at 1:31 a.m.

“We were praying for the stays to stick. Probably the most heartbreaking news was to find out we lost everything.”

At the Dollar General across from the penitentiary a group of people stood quietly apart from the activists who held vigils on execution nights. The group had asked for privacy. When they saw the vans carrying media witnesses pass by they formed a circle and held hands. Later I would discover that they were members of Montgomery’s family. “We were praying for the stays to stick” one of her daughters wrote in a message as the family left Terre Haute. “Probably the most heartbreaking news was to find out we lost everything.”

Wingate arrived in Terre Haute on the evening of Montgomery’s execution. The next morning she visited her brother in person for the first time in 20 years. Although their visit took place behind glass she could see Higgs was struggling with Covid-19 symptoms. “He still was having a hard time breathing and he said his head hurt” she said.

For a time she had been hopeful that the virus would end up saving his life. After both Higgs and Johnson contracted Covid-19 in December a district judge temporarily blocked the executions to allow them to recover. But Higgs warned her not to get her hopes up. It would ultimately come down to the Supreme Court. “He said ‘Watch what they do with Corey and then you’ll know’” Wingate said.

By 10 p.m. on January 14 the courts had ruled against Johnson. “That’s when it really hit me that I’m going to lose my brother tomorrow” Wingate said. In a phone call that night Higgs admitted that he was scared. “I want you to always look at me. Just look at me. Don’t look at nobody else” Wingate told her brother. “I’m going to be right there for you.”

The next morning Wingate woke up with a sense of peace. Her brother’s fate was in God’s hands. For all the fear and anguish of the past few weeks there had been moments of joy as well. She’d gotten married on January 2 and Higgs called her on her wedding day. “My brother was extremely happy for me” she said. He trusted her new husband to take care of her. “He said to me ‘I don’t have to worry about you no more.’”

Just before 4 p.m. Wingate walked from her car toward a white van in the parking lot of the Vigo County Sheriff’s Department. A wet snow was falling hard and fast. Two Bureau of Prisons employees in blue protective gear escorted her into the vehicle where Higgs’s spiritual adviser Yusuf Ahmed Nur an imam and professor at Indiana University Kokomo was waiting. The van drove them to the penitentiary and they were placed in a classroom where they would wait into the night. Nur read a book while Wingate played solitaire. They were given chips and cookies but no dinner. Just before 11 p.m. the Supreme Court lifted the last barriers standing in the way of Higgs’s execution. Shortly afterward it was time to go.

“I don’t think that it became real until the curtain went up” Wingate said. Her brother was lying on the gurney covered with a sheet. There were speakers that fed the sound into the witness room but Wingate did not realize they only went one way. “I thought he could hear me so I kept saying ‘Look at me look at me.’ I was motioning with my hands.” Higgs proclaimed his innocence as he had all along. “Tell my family I love them” he said. “Stay strong.” He was looking at his sister. “He looked at me the whole time until the very end” she said.

Disenfranchised Grief

On the Sunday after the executions ended Breeden welcomed two guests to his Unitarian church in Bloomington for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day service which was streamed over Facebook. To Breeden’s left was Sister Barbara Battista a Catholic nun from St. Mary-of-the-Woods in Terre Haute. To his right was Nur. They now belonged to “a rather unwanted club” Breeden said. Between the three of them they had accompanied five of the 13 people executed by the Trump administration.

Nur was the first to speak. He had contracted Covid-19 in November while serving as the spiritual adviser to Orlando Hall the eighth man to die. Despite a subsequent court order instructing the Bureau of Prisons to abide by stricter Covid-19 protocols media witnesses said members of the execution team did not wear masks during the execution of Corey Johnson. Shortly after the church service in Bloomington two media witnesses would test positive for Covid-19.

Nur spoke haltingly taking long pauses as he described Higgs’s execution that Friday. In the classroom where he and Wingate waited to hear from the Supreme Court he had found a copy of the novella “Heart of Darkness” by Joseph Conrad. “I reread it slowly” he said absorbing the text in a way he never had before. The book was about the horrors visited upon the Congolese by King Leopold II of Belgium he said horrors committed by “people who described themselves as enlightened and civilized.”

“The government would like you to believe that [an execution is] a painless death” Nur said. “It’s not. And it takes a lot out of us who witness. … You see a fellow human being killed right in front of you. And you can’t do anything about it.”

A few days later Biden was inaugurated and the Covid-19 lockdown over the Special Confinement Unit was lifted. “I must admit these last 7 months have been very stressful to me and others” one man on death row wrote in an email. The execution dates tended to come at the end of the week late in the afternoon. “Every Friday I was just like everyone here praying and hoping they didn’t come to my cell saying the Warden wanted to talk with me. … Last week was the first time since July everyone … wasn’t watching the clock around 5:30. You could feel the stress leave this place once Biden was sworn in.”

Another condemned man who works as an orderly went to clean the death range where his neighbors had spent their last days. “Upon entering each of the cells intimate memories of each of them fluttered in my consciousness” he wrote. When he entered the cell where Higgs was held “I was surprised to see that he had spent some of his last days painting: there was pieces of used masking tape with acrylic paint on them on the outside corner of his shower; plus paint splatter was on the floor and sink.”

Higgs had become an artist during his final years on death row. In an email before he was killed he told me he’d taught himself to draw and paint as part of a larger effort at self-improvement. “I have worked relentlessly for over two decades to transform my mind by changing the way I think” he wrote. He was formulating a plan for a business and charity and would leave instructions for his family to see it through. “I truly believe I will bring them out of poverty” he said. “That will be my legacy.”

On Friday January 29 Wingate buried her brother in their hometown of Poughkeepsie New York in the cemetery where his mother is also buried. She wore a black top printed with the word “faith.” “I know that’s what’s going to help me get through this” she said.

In a statement the night of the execution the sister of one of the victims had acknowledged the loss for Higgs’s family. “They are now going to go through the pain we experienced” she wrote. For Wingate the grief comes in waves as is often the case with mourning. But “it’s hard to explain how you feel to people because this is not a normal grief” Wingate said. At the Indianapolis airport the day after her brother’s execution she sat in front of the observation deck. “I was sitting there watching the planes and then next thing you know I’m just boohooing and crying” Wingate said. “It just came out of nowhere.” A woman came over and asked “‘Ma’am are you OK?’ I was like ‘Yeah I’m fine I’m fine.’”

Wingate is impatient for Biden to end the federal death penalty. “I thought that would be one of the first things he did” she said. While she has vowed to take a break from the news and social media she is refusing to be invisible. At a Dunkin’ Donuts in Poughkeepsie a man saw her wearing her Abolish the Death Penalty mask and challenged her. “‘Why?’ he asked. ‘Why abolish the death penalty?’ I said ‘So nobody else has to go through what my family went through.’ He stopped talking. He kept moving. He walked away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYWluZXQub3JnL2VuL2FydGljdWxvLzIxMDg2M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,40+ Economists Regarding Ecuador and the Dollar,"As economists we share a general concern when economic issues are widely misunderstood in political debates that can determine policy sometimes with lasting consequences. This appears to be a problem in Ecuador at the moment in the heat of an election campaign.

Media reports have repeated without any evidence false allegations about the economic program of one of the presidential candidates. Andrés Arauz a former minister and Director General of the Central Bank who is currently leading in most polls has been accused of seeking to abandon the country’s current use of the dollar as its national currency. There is no evidence that he or his political party would do anything at all in this direction.

A transition from the dollar back to a national currency would be costly and involve risks that would be exacerbated by the current dire and precarious economic situation. This false allegation is clearly an attempt to scare voters and indeed those promoting it have warned of a resulting economic collapse if the dollar is abandoned.

In fact not only has Arauz emphasized that he is committed to maintaining the dollar as the national currency he and his party have a long track record of taking strong measures to make sure that dollarization did not come under threat. These included reforms which kept billions of dollars within Ecuador such as taxing capital leaving the country financial regulation—including regulations on foreign banks within the country—increased accountability of the Central Bank; and other reforms and policies that kept the economy stable and avoided crises for the 10 years of the Rafael Correa presidency (2007 to 2017).

These policies and reforms prevented even the slightest threat to Ecuador’s commitment to the dollar even when Ecuador was hit hard by the world recession of 2009 as well as other severe external shocks including a collapse of oil prices in 2014 and steep falls in remittances.

As a result of this prudent economic management the economy did very well during the Correa years and the gains were widely distributed. Income per person rose by 20 percent and poverty fell by more than 38 percent from 2006 to 2017. The Gini coefficient for net household income (which measures inequality) fell by almost 15 percent between 2006 and 2017. During these years social spending more than doubled as a percent of GDP. Much of this went to healthcare and education with enrollment rates in secondary education increasing 26 percent; the number of people treated in public hospitals rose by 56 percent.

Ironically it is some of Arauz’s opponents who are proposing measures that could put Ecuador’s dollarization at risk by doing away with the necessary financial regulation. Guillermo Lasso—Arauz’s main competitor—has called for the elimination of capital controls which would make the country vulnerable to balance of payments crises that could threaten the dollar’s place as Ecuador’s currency.

In contrast to the previous presidency the economy under the current government has run into serious trouble. GDP is estimated by the IMF to be over 10 percent lower in 2020 than it was in 2017. Of course much of this was a result of the Covid-19 pandemic but a large part of these losses were a result of bad decisions. GDP per capita fell 1.5 percent from 2017to 2019 even before the Covid-19 crisis hit. And in 2019 the government signed an IMF agreement committing to a fiscal tightening of 5 percent of GDP over the next three years.

Some of the required spending cuts provoked widespread protests which were met with serious repression. This repression which left at least 9 dead and over 1500 injured was investigated by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which called for further investigations into numerous reports of “unnecessary and disproportionate use of force” by security forces. Indigenous groups were especially affected with Ecuador’s largest indigenous organization filing a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government for alleged “crimes against humanity.”

Another false economic claim has been promoted in the current election cycle: that the Correa government ran up an unsustainable debt which the current government had to reduce. In fact the Correa government left office with a debt of 45 percent of GDP. Under the current government Ecuador’s debt increased to 69 percent of GDP.

Voters need to have accurate information about the most important issues including economic issues that are facing the country when they choose a government. In the United States we have seen the dangers of misinformation multiplied to dangerous levels during the past four years. We hope that Ecuador can avoid these kinds of problems in its upcoming election.

The makeup mogul 23 did Caitlyn’s makeup for a video for her YouTube channel. Advertising the video to fans Kylie said on her Instagram story: “Watch me do my dad’s makeup.” She also refers to Caitlyn as her dad several times in the video such as when she said: “This is going to be the first time that I ever do my dad’s makeup.”

This caused Kylie to receive criticism from fans with many accusing her of being transphobic and misgendering Caitlyn. One YouTube user said that “calling [Caitlyn] a male name is wrong” while another fan on the platform asked: “Are you seriously still calling her “dad”? Makes me so uncomfortable.”

Over on Twitter one fan said to Kylie that they think that it’s “wrong and disgusting that [she] used the wrong pronoun knowing that Caitlyn is [her] mom.”

Article continues after ad

However other fans moved to defend Kylie with one fan on YouTube revealing that despite their own transition “my kids still call me Daddy.” The fan continued: “Everyone is different and should do what works for them.”

In the video itself Caitlyn clarified that while she goes by she/her pronouns she still prefers to be called ‘Dad’ by her daughters. She said that letting Kendall and Kylie continue to call her ‘Dad’ was “one of the best decisions [she’s] made.”

“Sometimes the [LGBTQ+] community can be pretty tough especially when it comes to pronouns and everyone has an opinion” she said. “But I knew from the beginning that I had to do [my transition] my way and in a way that works for me.”

She continued: “Some might say I’m the ‘mother’ but I disagree. I’m the dad. I’ve been a dad the whole way and I will be their father until the day I die.”

This video comes after Caitlyn 71 reveals that she is closer to youngest child Kylie than she is to her nine other children. The retired decathlete revealed during a podcast interview that her and Kylie have weekly dinner dates. Explaining that her other child Kendall 25 is “harder to figure out” Caitlyn admitted that Kylie is “more of an open book.”

Special to USA TODAY

Just because you find yourself short on cash doesn't mean you can't afford a few cool tech toys – so long as you consider your local ""dollar store.""

As evidenced in this Surf Report column – where we look at such deals once or twice a year – you might be surprised what you can buy for loose change in your pocket or purse.

Sometimes it's a gadget such as a clamp-on LED light for reading in bed; other times it's a low-tech accessory for your smartphone. ""Case"" in point: a fitted polycarbonate or silicone case for your iPhone or Android phone might cost you upward of $50 at a big box store but as low as $1 or $2 at places such as Dollar Tree Family Dollar 99 Cents Only Stores or Dollarama (in Canada).

So long as you have reasonable expectations when it comes to quality and longevity you should be pleased with your petite purchase – especially among those watching their wallet. (After all results from a COVID-19 survey by McKinsey Insights found 4 out of 10 Americans say their finances will not return to normal until the latter half of 2021 or 2022 and beyond.)

It’s all in the wrist:5 awesome (and easy) Apple Watch tips and tricks

After scouring the aisles at a few stores I picked the following seven items as some best buys to consider. Note: Not all stores carry the same items and the brand names and exact prices may vary.

Moodlab Rex Fidelity Earbuds with Mic

Whether it's for use with your mobile device laptop or game console it's ideal to invest in a spare set of earbuds.

The Moodlab Rex Fidelity Earbuds with Mic were among the best-sounding (and most comfortable) pair I tried out of three different brands. I've got them plugged into my microphone used for podcasting and they do the trick perfectly.

Available in several colors – including gold blue black and red – these 3.5mm earbuds feature a remote control on a 4.2-foot cable (with ""flat wire"" design).

Extra tips for varying ear sizes are included in the box.

Universal Smartphone Lens Kit

From Solaray this three-piece lens kit ($2) lets you clip on special lenses on top of your smartphone's camera lens – regardless of the make and model – to enhance the images you take.

The kit includes a wide-angle fisheye and macro lens.

The wide-angle lens is ideal for panoramic landscape shots and the ""hemispherical"" fisheye lens offered a more playful look that rounds out the photo (not unlike some Snapchat filters). The macro lens is designed for taking close-up shots of an object such as a flower or insect.

To access each lens you simply unscrew one and attach the other.

Window and Door Alarm

For a mere $1 Window and Door Alarm is a two-part device that can notify a homeowner of a possible break-in.

Simply peel off the sticky adhesives on the back of this alarm press it up against the opening of a door window or cabinet and flick the switch to turn it on. Should the two pieces of the magnetic device become separated a piercing 90-decibel alarm will sound.

Three alkaline watch batteries (LR44) are required and included to operate this inexpensive Dollar Tree product.

6-in-1 Stylus Pen

Another Dollar Tree find this ordinary-looking ballpoint pen ($1) is like a Swiss Army Knife of sorts.

There's a black-ink pen on one end and a stylus on the other to be used on touchscreen smartphones and tablets – perhaps during colder winter months when you might have gloves on.

Along the body of the pen you'll notice a small window with liquid inside as a bubble leveler (for say hanging a picture) as well as a ruler (up to 3 inches).

If you unscrew the soft stylus tip you'll find two screwdriver heads: One is a Phillips (cross-shape) and the other a flat-head to fasten or loosen screws and bolts.

iHip Rugged Durable 2.1 Amp Dual-Wall Charger

Why charge up only one device when you can charge up two at the same time?

For $2 the iHip Rugged is a charging cube to juice up smartphones tablets and such with one of the two USB-A ports a 2.1 amp slot for rapid charging along with a regular 1 amp port for a second device. Simply plug the small black cube into an AC socket and one or two gadgets into the female USB ports.

Tech-1 HDMI cable

Even keen-eyed home theater enthusiasts might not be able to see the difference between pricy cables and this $2 one from Tech-1.

For uncompressed high-definition video and sound simply connect the 5-foot HDMI cable from the output jack of your home theater components – such as a cable box video game system or DVD/Blu-ray player – to the input jack of your television or audio-video (AV) receiver.

Keep in mind you can use an HDMI cable to connect a laptop to your TV monitor or projector.

Eaget 16GB microSD Card

For our Canadian readers I found a 16 gigabyte microSDHC card at Dollarama for a mere $4 (about $3 U.S.) which is enough to store many tens of thousands of documents several thousands of photos or hundreds of TV shows – all on something the size of your pinky fingernail.

Though many Android smartphones and tablets (and some laptops) take a microSD card a full-size SD adaptor is included in the box.

This microSD card is rated as Class 10 flash memory which is fast enough to support full HD video recording.

Meet the new Hot Wheels Mars rover! | Human World,"The landing of the Perseverance rover on Mars is now only days away – on February 18 2021 – and the toy-making company Mattel is helping celebrate! The creator of the very popular Hot Wheels series is releasing a new die-cast scale model – the Hot Wheels Mars Perseverance Rover inspired by the real-life rover – to mark the occasion of its landing.

How to watch live coverage of the Perseverance landing

The new Hot Wheels model a detailed replica of Perseverance at 1:64 scale (about 3 inches or 8 cm long) is part of a new space-themed mini-collection the first in over 20 years. It is intended for children three years and older and will sell for a suggested retail price of $1.09 USD. We haven’t found a place to purchase the new Hot Wheels rover online yet but it’s supposed to have been available in stores since late January. Try searching for “Hot Wheels retailers near me.”

Manson Cheung staff sculptor and lead 3D modeler for Mattel Hot Wheels said in a post at CollectSpace.com:

We want the car to be out there so kids have it in their hands when the actual rover lands in February. We want kids to be like ‘Oh I have the rover in my hand and I can see it on Mars’ so there is a connection for the kids not only with Hot Wheels but space as well.

According to Mattel’s press release:

Space exploration fans and Hot Wheels enthusiasts of all ages can reenact the captivating journey of NASA’s Perseverance Rover as it studies the Martian landscape and seeks signs of ancient microbial life collecting samples over the next year. The Hot Wheels Mars Perseverance Rover pays homage to the cutting-edge instruments and technologies that will help pave the way for human missions to Mars studying critical data about Mars’ geology and climate and eventually sending Martian samples back to Earth.

Hot Wheels and NASA have a partnership that goes back more than 30 years which started in the mid-1980s. The first NASA model made by Hot Wheels was the Sojourner Mars Rover in 1996 part of the company’s Action Packs at the time. After that came the Apollo Mission (1998) the Galileo Mission (1999) John Glenn (1999) and JPL Returns to Mars (1999).

Design teams from Hot Wheels get to go on tours at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to see the actual spacecraft before they are launched.

Due to much current interest in space exploration among both kids and the general public Hot Wheels has brought back the Space mini-collection for 2021. Needless to say the Perseverance rover is a perfect addition to that collection.

Scott Shaffstall senior public relations manager for vehicles action figures and licenses at Mattel added:

NASA’s Perseverance rover just in its name goes hand-in-hand with Hot Wheels’ spirt of ‘Challenge Accepted.’ It’s very much tied that vision of try fail repeat until it is done right. So in our mind this mission is already a success as it is moving the needle and getting us one step closer to Mars. The space mini-collection was brought back in 2021 due to the increased interest from kids and the general public in regards to space exploration. The rover was an obvious fit and we knew that it would be touching down on Mars.

Perseverance is scheduled to land in Jezero Crater on Mars on February 18. Its primary mission is to search for evidence of ancient microbial life. Design-wise the rover is very similar to the Curiosity rover currently in Gale Crater but has some different science instruments. While Curiosity focuses on finding evidence of past habitability which it has done Perseverance is looking for direct evidence of life itself. This will be the first mission since the Viking 1 and 2 landers in the late 1970s/early 1980s to do so.

Jezero Crater used to be a lake a few billion years ago and contains rich sediments and clays that could possibly hold clues to microbial life if any ever existed there. The rover will land near an ancient river delta inside the crater still clearly visible where a river once emptied into the lake. Jezero Crater is therefore a prime location for the search for Martian life.

Perseverance even has a companion a small drone-like helicopter called Ingenuity that will attempt to be the first aircraft ever flown on Mars. It will fly ahead of the rover looking for good places for Perseverance to stop and do analysis and sample collection of rocks and soil. The rover’s onboard laboratory can do substantial analysis itself but some samples will also be stored for later return to Earth by another mission. Labs on Earth can then do much more detailed study of the samples in the search for evidence of past life.

Mattel also made a similar toy replica of the still-active Curiosity rover in 2012.

Bottom line: Mattel the popular Hot Wheels toy maker has just released a new Hot Wheels Mars Perseverance Rover to help NASA celebrate the landing of its Perseverance rover on Mars on February 18.

LS Power Development has a 24% interest in the Bath County Pumped Storage Station a hydroelectric facility that can produce power when it’s most needed. And Appalachian may need it soon LS Power figures.

The company “looks forward to participating in APCo’s anticipated energy storage solicitations” it said in a recent filing with the State Corporation Commission.

Last week the SCC held a three-day hearing on Appalachian’s plan to comply with a new state law that requires it to generate all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. The utility says it will acquire 400 megawatts of energy storage along with much larger quantities of solar and wind energy.

LS Power did not participate in the hearing nor is it asking for any action by the SCC at this point.

But in comments filed in the case LS Power makes it clear that at least part of its share of the pumped storage station’s capacity is available for sale to Appalachian should it be interested.

Located in the Allegheny Mountains about two hours north of Roanoke the station consists of two man-made lakes one of them about 1200 higher in elevation than the other and a mass of machinery that cycles the water from one reservoir to the other.

When demand is low usually at night water is pumped through tunnels from the lower reservoir to the upper one. There it sits until the power grid needs more juice such as during the morning rush hour and when people return home in the evening.

Valves then release the water and it rushes back through the tunnels at a rate of up to 13.5 million gallons a minute turning six giant turbines to produce electricity. The power then goes to PJM a regional organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in 13 states and the District of Columbia.

The Bath County Pumped Storage Station is the largest of its kind in the world capable of producing enough electricity to power 750000 homes according to Jeremy Slayton a spokesman for Dominion Energy which holds a 60% interest in the facility.

Also referred to as batteries pumped storage stations are an important part of the renewable energy movement as they can produce power when the sun is not shining on solar panels or there’s no breeze to spin turbines at wind farms.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act a landmark law passed last year by the General Assembly requires Appalachian and Dominion to invest in energy storage as well solar and wind in order to meet the law’s mandate of an all-renewable power portfolio by mid-century.

Appalachian has not evaluated the use of the pumped storage station at this time spokeswoman Teresa Hall said last week.

In fact the utility is just beginning a plan to add 3400 megawatts of solar 2200 megawatts of onshore wind and 400 megawatts of energy storage to a system that serves about 500000 customers in Western Virginia.

“At the end of the day this is step one in a 29-year process” Noelle Coates an attorney for Appalachian said last week in her opening statements to the SCC which must approve the utility’s renewable energy portfolio standard.

After hearing three days of arguments and testimony SCC chair Judith Jagdmann gave parties in the case until March 11 to file briefs before a decision is made. Appalachian will provide updated plans every year for the SCC to consider.

Short term the company says it will acquire 210 megawatts of solar power and 200 megawatts of wind power over the next five years.

Coal-burning power plants currently generate about 60% of Appalachian’s power. Natural gas accounts for 19% followed by hydroelectric at 11% and wind at 7%. About 1200 customers have rooftop or other private solar sources but the small output is not included in the company’s generation mix.

A large part of the SCC’s work will be to keep the cost of renewable energy to ratepayers as low as possible.

Bills are expected to go up by 3.5% over the next five years as a result of the new law Appalachian has said in SCC filings. That would be in addition to its request for an overall base rate increase of 5% which is pending before the regulatory agency.

One way to save money would be to invest in the Bath County Pumped Storage Station LS Power said in its filing with the SCC.

The station “is already built and in operation and provides the Commonwealth with a very cost-effective storage solution to meet the goals of the VCEA as compared to other alternatives” the document stated.

A spokesperson for the company declined to comment saying the filing speaks for itself.

LS Power acts independently of the facility’s two other owners: Dominion and Allegheny Generating Co. a West Virginia utility that has a 15% interest. Unlike the two utilities its operating costs are not covered by ratepayers.

With offices from New York to California LS Power has developed and managed projects with a total output of more than 45000 megawatts. It operates a natural gas power plant in Henrico County which it says “will help Virginia’s transition to greater reliance on renewable energy.”

Slayton said Dominion had no comment on LS Power’s proposal.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Source: University of Exeter

Scientists have made a significant breakthrough in the quest to understand the intricate processes that occur in the brain during seizures that are the key symptom of epilepsy.

A team of scientists from the University of Exeter has studied the mechanisms behind distinctive patterns of electrical activity of neuron groups in the brain that accompany the onset of seizures.

In healthy brains networks of neurons move through states of similar behavior – known as synchronization – and dissimilar behavior called desynchronization. These processes are also associated with both memory and attention.

However in a brain with a neurological disorder such as epilepsy this synchronization can grow to an almost dangerous extent when a collection of brain cells begins to emit excess electricity.

In a series of new studies published recently in PLoS Computational Biology and the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems the research team used sophisticated mathematical modelling approach to explore the interplay between groups of neurons that leads to transitions in synchronization changes.

Jennifer Creaser co-author of the study and from the University of Exeter said: “Synchronization is thought to be important for information processing. But too much synchronization–such as what occurs in epileptic seizures or Parkinson’s disease–is associated with disease states and can impair brain function.”

The study which took place at the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council’s Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare at the University of Exeter and University of Birmingham used an extended version of an existing mathematical model that represents the brain as a network connecting multiple nodes of neuron groups.

The model network consists of bi-stable nodes meaning that each node can switch between two stable states – resting and seizure. These nodes remain in their current state until they receive a stimulus that gives them the appropriate ‘kick’ to escape to the other state.

This stimulus comes from both other connected nodes and in the form of “noise” — outside sources of neural activity such as endocrine responses that are associated with an emotional state or physiological changes due to disease.

Adding a small amount of noise to the system caused each node to transition to the active state — but the system’s geometry was such that returning to the resting state took much longer than leaving.

Previously the research team found that this leads to a cascade of escapes to the active state–much like a falling line of dominos–that spreads activity across the network.

The new research builds on this ‘domino effect’ to identify the circumstances that bring about these changes in synchrony and investigate how the type of coupling in a network affects its behaviour.

It found that when the model incorporated more general amplitude and phase coupling the nodes’ synchrony could change between consecutive escapes during the domino effect.

Professor Peter Ashwin co-author of the study said: “Although this is a theoretical study of an idealized model it is inspired by challenges posed by understanding transitions between healthy and pathological activity in the brain.”

Professor Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova also co-author of the study added: “The mathematical modeling of seizure initiation and propagation can not only help to uncover seizures’ complex underlying mechanisms but also provide a means for enabling in silico experiments to predict the outcome of manipulating neural systems.”

Abstract

Sequential Escapes and Synchrony Breaking for Networks of Bistable Oscillatory Nodes

Progression through different synchronized and desynchronized regimes in brain networks has been reported to reflect physiological and behavioral states such as working memory and attention. Moreover intracranial recordings of epileptic seizures show a progression towards synchronization as brain regions are recruited and the seizures evolve. In this paper we build on our previous work on noise- induced transitions on networks to explore the interplay between transitions and synchronization. We consider a bistable dynamical system that is initially at a stable equilibrium (quiescent) that coexists with an oscillatory state (active). The addition of noise will typically lead to escape from the quiescent to the active state. If a number of such systems are coupled these escapes can spread sequentially in the manner of a “domino effect.” We illustrate our findings numerically in an example system with three coupled nodes. We first show that a symmetrically coupled network with amplitude-dependent coupling exhibits new phenomena of accelerating and decelerating domino effects modulated by the strength and sign of the coupling. This is quantified by numerically computing escape times for the system with weak coupling. We then apply phase-amplitude-dependent coupling and explore the interplay between synchronized and desynchronized dynamics in the system. We consider escape phases between nodes where the cascade of noise-induced escapes is associated with various types of partial synchrony along the sequence. We show examples for the three-node system in which there is multistability between in-phase and antiphase solutions where solutions switch between the two as the sequence of escapes progresses.

Abstract

Domino-like transient dynamics at seizure onset in epilepsy

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) groups seizures into “focal” “generalized” and “unknown” based on whether the seizure onset is confined to a brain region in one hemisphere arises in several brain region simultaneously or is not known respectively. This separation fails to account for the rich diversity of clinically and experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of seizure onset and even less so for the properties of the brain networks generating them. We consider three different patterns of domino-like seizure onset in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) and present a novel approach to classification of seizures. To understand how these patterns are generated on networks requires understanding of the relationship between intrinsic node dynamics and coupling between nodes in the presence of noise which currently is unknown. We investigate this interplay here in the framework of domino-like recruitment across a network. In particular we use a phenomenological model of seizure onset with heterogeneous coupling and node properties and show that in combination they generate a range of domino-like onset patterns observed in the IGE seizures. We further explore the individual contribution of heterogeneous node dynamics and coupling by interpreting in-vitro experimental data in which the speed of onset can be chemically modulated. This work contributes to a better understanding of possible drivers for the spatiotemporal patterns observed at seizure onset and may ultimately contribute to a more personalized approach to classification of seizure types in clinical practice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdHNwdWxwaXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMi82LzIyMjcwMjI5L25mbC10cmFkZS1ydW1vcnMtcXVhcnRlcmJhY2stY2Fyc29uLXdlbnR6LWVhZ2xlcy1wYXRyaW90c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL trade rumors: Next quarterback domino expected to fall soon,"The NFL’s 2021 offseason has already seen one blockbuster trade and it seems as if the next one might be on the horizon as well. After last week’s Matthew Stafford/Jared Goff exchange between the Detroit Lions and Los Angeles Rams the Philadelphia Eagles are reportedly also on the verge of trading their franchise quarterback.

According to a report by ESPN’s Adam Schefter and Chris Mortensen the Eagles are expected to trade former first-round draft pick Carson Wentz “in the coming days.” While not concrete landing spot has been identified just yet the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears have both been identified as organizations that might be interested in obtaining Wentz’s services.

Wentz originally joined the NFL as the second overall selection of the 2016 draft and has served as Philadelphia’s starting quarterback ever since. However he never quite lived up to his potential due to a mix of injuries inconsistent play and reported issues with the Eagles’ staff.

Appearing in a combined 69 regular season and playoff games over his first five seasons in the league Wentz has posted some solid numbers — he has completed 62.6 percent of his pass attempts for 16814 yards 113 touchdowns and 50 interceptions — but eventually failed to hold onto his starting gig in 2019. Losing the position to second-round rookie Jalen Hurtz late during the year his future was very much put into question.

Now it seems as a if a decision is close to being made.

The deal itself will be a fascinating one to watch. After all the team acquiring the 28-year-old will also inherit the remainder of the $128 million contract extension he signed in 2019. Four years and $98.4 million are still left on the pact with his annual salary cap hits coming in at between $22 million and $26 million.

It would therefore not be a surprise to see a team acquire Wentz in trade looking similar to the one that once sent Brock Osweiler from the Houston Texans to the Cleveland Browns: in order to dump Osweiler and his contract the Texans traded him plus second- and sixth-round picks to the Browns in return for a conditional fourth-round selection. Philadelphia participating in a similar trade would not be a surprise.

The question is not just whether or not the Colts or Bears would be willing to participate in such a move but whether or not the New England Patriots should be on the list of potential suitors as well.

That much can be questioned tough given Wentz’s seemingly plateauing development and the reports of his rumored inability to respond to coaching. Even though his upside is intriguing and they are in need of a long-term solution at the quarterback position the Patriots investing any noticeable assets to get the former first-round draft pick aboard would therefore be a surprise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9tb25leS8xMzk2OTIzOC9kb21pbm9zLWNob2Mtb3JhbmdlLWNvb2tpZXMtbWVudS1sb25nZXIv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL21vbmV5LzEzOTY5MjM4L2RvbWlub3MtY2hvYy1vcmFuZ2UtY29va2llcy1tZW51LWxvbmdlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Good news for fans as Domino’s announces choc orange cookies will stay on the menu for a little longer...,"LAST CHANCE Good news for fans as Domino’s announces choc orange cookies will stay on the menu for a little longer

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged Congress on Sunday to pass President Joe Biden's stimulus plan saying if it does the U.S. could return to full employment by 2022.

Global market sentiment recovered this past week with equities charging higher in North America Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. On Wall Street the S&P 500 Dow Jones and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 4.65% 3.89% and 6.01% respectively. The VIX market ‘fear gauge’ receded to its lowest in almost two months.

Despite the risk-on tone the haven-linked US Dollar managed to hold its ground in some cases. It gained against the Swiss Franc Euro and Japanese Yen while losing to the Australian Dollar New Zealand Dollar and British Pound. A softer-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report at the end of the week caused most of the Greenback’s decline as Friday concluded.

What will be key to watch ahead is the story of longer-term Treasury yields which have been rising. The 30-year rate closed at its highest since February 20th 2020. This combined with a stabilizing Greenback has been weighing on precious metal prices such as gold and silver. US fiscal stimulus bets and rising inflation expectations down the road are likely contributing to this.

The week ahead is relatively quiet with the Lunar New Year taking Chinese exchanges offline starting Thursday opening the door to lower-than-usual liquidity conditions. The US will release its latest inflation figures on Wednesday with University of Michigan consumer sentiment due on Friday. AUD/USD may see some volatility around consumer confidence data.

There will be speeches from central bank policymakers to watch out for. Fed Chair Jerome Powell ECB Chief Christine Lagarde and BoC’s Deputy Governor Timothy Lane are on tap. In addition to weekly EIA inventory data crude oil prices await the latest monthly market report from OPEC. What else are traders watching in the week ahead?

Some of the victims of Gregory Hayes Dow’s heinous crimes say nothing will heal the lifetime scars he left on their bodies and souls.

A guardian of one of the children said it is not enough for Dow to spend 15 and a half years in prison insisting that he should be forced to compensate the distraught victims and their families.

“The children were made to believe that what was happening to them at the orphanage was normal. They should be compensated for the trauma they are undergoing” said the granny who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Bomet County Gender and Social Services director Rose Chepkorir welcomed the conviction and sentence.

Sex pest

“The second part for the victims is counselling and rehabilitation” she said.

Ms Carolyne Cherotich a rights activist in Bomet said the jailing of Dow should serve as a warning to sex predators.

“They can run but cannot hide as the long arm of the law will catch up with them in the end” Ms Cherotich said.

Dow was sent to prison by District Judge Edward G. Smith in Lancaster county Philadelphia on Thursday for the many crimes he admitted to have committed while in Boito Bomet county between 2013 and 2017.

The 61-year-old sex pest will also be under a lifetime of supervised release.

He pleaded guilty to committing the offences against girls between the ages of 11 and 13.

The disgraced missionary was ordered by the court to pay $16000 (Sh1.7 million) in restitution according to a dispatch from acting US Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania justice department.

Dow ran an orphanage in Kapsiratet village. It was shut in September 2017 when he was accosted by the children sexually molesting one of the girls.

The incident opened the lid on abuse of children at the orphanage leading to Dow fleeing Kenya to avoid arrest and prosecution.

Incomprehensible depravity

But the law still caught up with him in the United States. A majority of the children at the home were orphans.

Residents of the sleepy village say Dow passed himself off as a devout Christian missionary though it later emerged that he was a sexual offender back in America.

Dow looked every inch avuncular and a respected grandfather.

Behind the facade however he was a confessed and convicted sexual offender.

He had quietly entered Kenya and continued to perpetrate his crimes – preying on needy and vulnerable children.

By the time of the arrest nine of the 87 girls under Dow’s care had repeatedly been defiled.

To make matters worse contraceptive devices had been inserted in their bodies to prevent them from getting pregnant.

Dow’s wife Mary Rose was in 2017 fined Sh50000 by a court in Sotik when she pleaded guilty to the charge of implanting birth control devices on the children.

“He kept to himself most of the times and did not let the children at the home mingle with villagers. It later emerged that it was an attempt to keep the lid shut on the crimes at the orphanage” Boito Ward Representative Charles Langat told the Saturday Nation.

In July 2019 Dow was charged in the American court with four counts of sexually exploiting the children and pleaded guilty in June last year with the sentence being handed on Thursday.

Ms Williams said in a statement that the sentence followed plea of guilt entered by Dow “for sexually abusing four children in an orphanage which the defendant and his wife operated in Kenya”.

Illicit sexual conduct

“Under the guise of faith-based charity work benefiting orphaned children Gregory Dow travelled half way around the world to prey on incredibly vulnerable victims” Williams said.

“His crimes are nearly incomprehensible in their depravity. We thank the witnesses in this case for coming forward to report him and our law enforcement partners in the United States and Kenya for working diligently to bring Dow to justice. It is no exaggeration to say that the world’s children are safer with Dow behind bars.”

Investigations into the case were conducted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Protection Unit of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in Kenya.

“This case serves as an example to perpetrators of crime. You can run today but can never hide from the long arm of the law” the DCI tweeted yesterday morning.

Mr William McSwain a US Attorney told journalists that Dow faced four counts of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign county.

Wolf in sheep’s clothing

“From or about October 14 2013 until on or about September 13 2014 the defendant engaged in and attempted to engage in illicit sexual conduct with four victims in Kenya” Mr McSwain said.

Mr Michael J. Driscol Special Agent in charge of the FBI in Philadelphia said Dow “is the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing”.

“Dow presented himself as this big-hearted man when all the while he was sexually abusing girls placed in his care” Mr Driscol said in his statement.

“These horrific crimes were a betrayal of an entire community’s trust. If Dow thought he could get away with it because he was in a different country if he thought no one would care because these were underprivileged Black children he victimised this investigation and today’s sentence have most emphatically proved him wrong.”

Before travelling to Kenya from the US in 2008 Dow had been convicted of sexually abusing his daughter.

Dow’s former wife Janie Jenkins has publicly said he abused their daughter for years when the family was in Ohio state.

Dow who was arrested and charged with the offence also pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit sexual abuse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL2luc2lkZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9BYmlnYWlsLUFobi0xNTkxMDg2MS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Performing arts spotlight: Abigail Ahn says shutdown helped make her a better musician,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ourmidland.com/insider/article/Abigail-Ahn-15910861.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL2luc2lkZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9BYmlnYWlsLUFobi0xNTkxMDg2MS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

They said they never would have guessed the pandemic would make homes sales skyrocket.

But that's what sales did.

""We were all thinking 'Oh my god we're not going to be able to build any homes'"" said Moses Mostaghasi of MPM Homes Inc. ""And as people realized that they need to be at home stay at home lifestyles probably have changed. Mindsets have changed.""

""People are investing in their life and their future by purchasing homes more than ever. So the housing market has not slowed down. During the pandemic it's probably only picked up.""

Even with a three-month shut down nearly 1200 more homes were sold -- a total of 6985 -- in the Corpus Christi metropolitan statistical area in 2020 compared with 5809 homes in 2019.

The median price of homes also jumped by roughly 13 percent from $200000 in 2019 to $225000 in 2020.

That means the average family in Corpus Christi can't afford the average-priced home said Iain Vasey president/CEO of the Corpus Christi Regional Economic Development Corp. The median household income in Corpus Christi is $56333 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""Can we say $60000 a year buy the median house using traditional financing? And they can't"" Vasey said.

That's not all the tight market has caused. Builders can't keep up with the high demand for new houses. COVID-19 challenges are a big part of that.

Prices of materials have also drastically increased which factors into the increase in home prices along with the demand. Lumber costs have gone up 50 percent to 150 percent Mostaghasi said. Plumbing prices have increased roughly 20 percent and shingles by about 9 percent.

He also said it used to take builders about 10 days to get a window package order. Now it takes around 10 months.

""Where everybody gets their windows they went from like 5000 employees to 1000 employees because of the pandemic"" Mostaghasi said. ""The problem right now is the price of goods or materials.""

""And the labor force just being an unknown because from one day to the next you don't know who's got COVID (and) who's tracing it.""

The current market

Being a large developer has been an advantage for MPM Homes during the pandemic.

""We've got good suppliers. We've pre-planned meaning we've already given them insight on what we're anticipating so they can prepare for that"" Mostaghasi said.

Mostaghasi develops roughly 200 lots and builds 100 homes a year. In 2020 his company met the 100 home-build mark for the first time.

""We grew by 20 percent last year even with a two to three month void that we had with no homes being sold"" he said.

MPM Homes is developing roughly 3000 homes in the London area over a 10- to 15-year span. At least half of those houses will be priced at an average of $325000.

Jim Lee director Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi's South Texas Economic Development Center has been tracking the pandemic's impacts on the Coastal Bend economy.

""The housing market is the brightest if not the only bright spot in the COVID economy"" Lee said. ""While the market looks solid across the nation it is very fragile because falling income and job losses will sooner or later raise the foreclosure and bankruptcy rates.""

New home prices are currently increasing at a record pace above 15 percent Lee said. The pace of price rises during the final quarter of 2020 was the highest ever recorded even higher than the pace during the housing boom in the mid-2010s.

The current housing inventory has dipped to 2.3 months compared to historically 5 to 6 months which is considered a balanced market Lee said.

The housing shortage will only be amplified once Steel Dynamics Inc. finishes building a $1.9 billion steel mill near Sinton in late 2021 or early 2022. As employment growth of the plant's campus ramps up the CCREDC expects more than 100 homes a year could be acquired by the plant's employees.

""It's going to further drive up housing prices"" Vasey said. ""We need to see more houses being built total and more affordable houses being built. Which means we need to see houses being built between $150000 and $250000.""

The CCREDC also projects Corpus Christi needs 2000 to 4000 more residential units a year to come online. Of those at least 1500 should be houses.

""Things are afloat but prices keep going up"" said Navid Zarghoon owner of Devonshire Custom Homes. ""That's going to push out the affordability for new homes. As prices keep going up that affordability is going to get harder and harder to build.""

Low interest rates

One reason for the increase in sales during 2020 is the slide in mortgage interest rates. They are averaging 3.11 percent in 2020 compared with 3.94 percent in 2019 said Paige Silva research associate at the Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&M University in College Station.

Silva expects interest rates to increase slightly in 2021 due to the economy heating up.

""While we expect housing demand to remain strong in 2021 the lack of inventory will be a contributor to a deceleration in sales in 2021"" she said.

Demand expands housing shortage

Texas and Corpus Christi faced a very tight housing market due to limited new home construction even before last year Lee said. He expects the tight housing market trend to continue at least for a while.

Realtor Candy Crisman-Lopez's business has had more traffic than normal since Hurricane Harvey. And the housing industry has gotten even more active because of the pandemic.

""I know this kind of sounds cliche but it's been crazy busy nonstop"" she said.

Half of the residential sales at Crisman-Lopez's office The Crisman Group with Keller Williams Coastal Bend are new home construction.

""We have (homes) in framing and we're getting them under contract"" she said.

Crisman-Lopez doesn't foresee the market slowing down in 2021. The Coastal Bend is still in the five- to seven-year rebuild phase following the hurricane's wrath in 2017. That also contributes to the shortage of homes.

""There's never a crystal ball"" she said. ""We never know for sure what's going to come up. We can just go by things that we've known from history in the past.""

""I tell people all the time corpus is in its own little world.""

Local industry changing

John Tamez of Tamez Development is developing between 600 and 800 homes in the London area that would be priced between $225000 and $425000.

His company is roughly eight months behind schedule because of the pandemic.

He's currently building a waste water system for his subdivision. But doesn't know yet what his future moves for the development will be. Tamez will decide during the next six months while the lift station is being built.

""D.R. Horton is coming to town. And I think they're changing the industry"" he said. ""We'll start making our decision on what kind of product we would want to put out and what the consumption rate will be.""

Late last year national homebuilder D.R. Horton acquired Braselton Homes the largest homebuilder in Corpus Christi.

Things have also been difficult for smaller family-owned companies.

Zarghooni started Devonshire Custom Homes a homebuilding company in Corpus Christi more than a decade ago. He builds roughly 25 homes a year.

One of the biggest challenges he's faced is finding lots to build on. Many large developers now build on the plats they own instead of selling them. This is a trend that started several years ago before the pandemic several years ago Zarghooni said.

""Now what's happening is that the developer is becoming the builder and not allowing other builders to come into buy lots and controlling the market"" he said. ""So basically the only way you're going to be able to build in the next couple of years is if you have your own land.""

Number 74 Fitzgerald Street is the address given on the record of her baptism as Eliza Paterson on May 19 1910 at St James’s Church off Manchester Road just over a month after her birth on April 7. Her parents are John who was born in Lochgelly Scotland whose occupation is given as grease presser and Hannah born in Bradford.

By the census of the following year the family of parents Eliza and her older brother John were living in a two-roomed house in nearby Crowther Court. Thirty years later in the US census of 1940 she was living with husband Charles Boyer in Beverly Hills Los Angeles.

Fitzgerald Street was named for the family which owned a large amount of land hereabouts which had come into the possession of Colonel Thomas George Fitzgerald of Turlough Castle Ireland on his marriage to Elizabeth Crowther in 1819 who was the heir to the extensive Lister estates. They lived at Boldhsay Hall Bradford Moor. Their son Henry Thomas George inherited it and he too married an Elizabeth but they moved to the south of England.

The Fitzgeralds sold land for building as Bradford experienced its massive growth from the 1820s. All this is detailed in local historian William Cudworth’s 1886 book Rambles Round Horton.

Fitzgerald Street connected Manchester Road with Little Horton Lane. Crowther Street may be seen in the photo to the left of the pub. The beerhouse which became the Fitzgerald Arms was built in 1852 for one Joseph Marshall. The plans survive at Bradford Archives and show it as having a bar parlour bar and kitchen and back room on the ground floor. It was later bought by Bradford brewers Heys in 1896 and shows changes they made to its frontage.

As the photo also shows change was on the way to the area generally by 1960 which would transform it utterly. In that year the licence of the Fitzgerald Arms was given up together with that of the Brunswick Hotel in Thornton Road to be granted to a new pub in Norman Lane at Eccleshill which became the Sycamores.

The whole district then was demolished in the 1960s. The senior housing officer at Bradford Council who was good enough many years ago to allow me to look at the records of this and to copy the photograph commented that along with some slum properties many perfectly decent houses were destroyed. They were replaced with blocks of flats and open spaces. Today all that remains of Fitzgerald Street are some rather fine mid-Victorian houses built for Bradford’s middle class at its Little Horton Lane end.

DUK,Duke Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3VuYy9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL3VuYy1kZWZlYXRzLWR1a2UtMjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UNC Basketball: North Carolina Defeats In-State Rival Duke 91087,"DURHAM N.C.- ""He picked the perfect time"" are the words from senior leader Garrison Brooks about freshman Caleb Love. Love stole the show from the opening act helping the Tar Heels secure their first win over Duke 91-87. Saturday night's game is the highest-scoring matchup between the rivals in twelve years.

Only eleven miles separate the two dominant programs and has been dubbed one of if not the best rivalries in college sports. Saturday night's game is the first time since 1960 where both teams were unranked; Roy Williams was only nine years old. After tonight UNC is 38-46 at Cameron but it's worth noting that North Carolina leads the series 140-114.

The freshman has struggled this season finding his confidence in Chapel Hill; late-night shots after game practice and meditation Love was determined but it's something about Duke that will bring the best out of you.

""Being part of one of the biggest rivalries in college basketball if not the best we knew we had to bring our energy; there's no fan but it felt like fans because of how hard we were playing and into the game. We were just locked in and got the win.""

As a team the Heels had a big night shooting their season-high from the three at 67% and their second-best shooting night at 53%. The Tar Heels had six scorers in double digits Day'ron Sharpe (11) Garrison Brooks (12) Leaky Black (12) Kerwin Walton (12) and Armando Bacot (16) but it was Caleb Love whose name is being sung in high praise. Love scored a season-high of 25 points and led the team in assists with seven.

Despite the significant win Williams still wants to fine-tune the details. Love's scoring effort didn't go unnoticed but it was the turnovers that Williams need correcting. The position of point guard weighs heavy at Carolina and five turnovers will not cut it.

""We hurt ourselves so much with the turnovers (16) in the first half in addition to hurting ourselves with their 11 points and offensive rebounds to our four. The biggest message during halftime was to clean up those two areas. Let's do a better job.""

Duke faced a tough night with Matthew Hurt predominately quiet. The sophomore forward finished the game with seven points and fouled out the competition late in the second half. Almost mirroring UNC it was Duke's young backcourt that kept the Blue Devils within reach; Jeremy Roach (16) Wendell Moore Jr. (15) and Jalen Johnson (14). Duke has now dropped five of their last seven.

The Heels have a quick turnaround with a Monday game against Miami at 7 pm on ESPN.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L2ZpcmUtY2F1c2VzLWstZGFtYWdlcy1hdm9uZGFsZS1mb29kLW1hcnQtZGlzdHJpY3QtZmlyZS1jaGllZi1zYXlzL9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L2ZpcmUtY2F1c2VzLWstZGFtYWdlcy1hdm9uZGFsZS1mb29kLW1hcnQtZGlzdHJpY3QtZmlyZS1jaGllZi1zYXlzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fire causes $200K in damage at Avondale Food Mart,"CINCINNATI (FOX19) -A fire at the Avondale Food Mart occurred Saturday morning causing $200000 in damages Fire District Chief Mathew J. Rotert said.

Firefighters say they received a call about the fire around 9:20 a.m. at Reading Road and Ridgeway Avenue.

When they arrived they found that the fire was inside the store. Rotert says the fire started outside of the building and spread to the attic.

Firefighters had to initiate an interior attack and the fire was brought under control in 30 minutes Rotert said.

Rotert says a second alarm was called due intensity of the fire and the cold weather conditions.

By the time firefighters arrived everyone was out of the building and no one was displaced Rotert said.

Rotert says no one was injured.

Officers say Duke Energy was notified.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

The sprawling state forest sprinkled with world-famous waterfalls hiking and mountain biking trails in Henderson and Transylvania counties saw a nearly 31% increase in visitation last year up from 918000 visitors in 2019 – a number even more notable considering DuPont was closed for two months due to COVID-19 safety precautions.

The increased traffic put excessive pressure on an already crowded outdoor destination generating potholes in parking lots creating the potential for sedimentation to reach the Little River and the need to temporarily close parking lots for repairs.

These repairs will start Feb. 8-18 with a complete closure at Hooker Falls then continue with improvements at Lake Imaging and High Falls access areas through April depending on weather conditions said Christie Adams spokeswoman for the N.C. Forest Service.

This uptick in visitation increased the amount of everyday wear and tear across the forest as a whole but especially in those popular parking access areas” Adams said.

Vandalism was also a “common occurrence” in high-use areas of the forest which included spray-painting structures carving in trees and breaking fencing in addition to persistent littering.

The work will completely close the 120-space parking area at Hooker Falls which leads to the easy half-mile hike to the most popular falls drawing about 426000 visitors last year.

Repair and renovation of the access area will be to improve degraded infrastructure improve visitor safety in the lot and improve water quality in the parking lot area she said.

An expansion in 2013 added 55 spaces and a bathroom to the lot but the access area which also provides parking for people to cross busy Staton Road for trails to Triple Falls and High Falls had become so popular that parking overflowed onto the shoulders of the busy state road. The roadsides were closed to parking last year.

The bathrooms and the visitor center were closed starting in April because staff could not keep them cleaned to CDC-recommended standards to protect from COVID and people used highly trafficked areas as an outdoor bathroom.

Outdoor spaces overwhelmed during COVID

The year 2020 wasn’t the way the N.C. Forest Service and the Friends of DuPont State Forest the nonprofit that cares for the forest wanted to celebrate.

There were many activities planned for the rugged scenic forest about an hour southwest of Asheville crisscrossed with 80 miles of hiking mountain biking and horseback riding trails.

The coronavirus pandemic forced an end to gatherings and guided hikes but people still flocked to the state forest just as they did to state parks like Gorges and Mount Mitchell national parks like the Blue Ridge Parkway and Great Smokies and national forests including Pisgah and Nantahala because of the relative feeling of safety outdoors.

“During COVID the parking lots are really the place where social distancing is hard. That was one of the reasons why we closed in April and May” said Sara Landry president of the Friends group which raises money maintains trails and does educational outreach for the state forest.

She said the summer and fall crowds were unlike any she had seen. And the damage. Landry said the parking lots were left with “tree-size” potholes with sediment from broken pavement heading toward the river resource damage by people walking and riding on muddy trails and “dog and human poop” across the landscape.

“For the Friends of Dupont we’re all about access to the forest. But how do you balance access with protection of natural resources and the trails?” she said.

It’s a quandary the group has been battling for more than two decades starting with a fight to save the land from a large residential development.

The heart of the forest is a 2200-acre tract containing High Triple and Bridal Veil waterfalls which was acquired by the state Oct. 23 2000 after the North Carolina Council of State led by Gov. Jim Hunt voted to invoke eminent domain to protect the land from a developer.

Conservation groups worked through the years to protect and add more land to the state forest which is now 12500 acres. The scenic beauty drew more visitors each year as well as Hollywood. Most notably the forest was used for scenes in the 2012 hit “The Hunger Games” leading to visitation from across the globe.

The Friends group was recently selected by the Stand Up Initiative of Asheville-based Darby Communications and Status Forward which will provide 100 hours of marketing for the Friends’ “Share the Trails” campaign.

“We hope to educate visitors on how to be good stewards of the forest how to share the trails the principle of pack-it-in pack-it-out don't ride on muddy trails and get that message out to different markets so that visitors know what to expect” Landry said.

He said the Friends of DuPont is also advocating for a master trails plan for the forest which will help toward the parking and crowding issues.

“We want to take a look at the forest as a whole with an understanding that when the trails were built and when the forest opened there were not a million visitors” she said.

“Now there are so we need to figure out how we can protect the trails protect the natural resources and still enhance recreation.”

This France team’s excellence may not be eternal but we are coming to rely on it. Italy’s status as whipping boys though shows no sign of lifting. The hosts played plenty of rugby forcing France into roughly twice the number of tackles – and yet they were thrashed. Again.

Take your pick of the princely Frenchmen but if brilliance can ever be reliable Antoine Dupont is starting to rival the sun in that department. He had hands and feet in all too many of France’s tries of which there were seven in the end. It was another masterclass in how to make energy and imagination tell.

Italy are in need of such an exhibition. As ever they brought plenty to the party inspired by their unusually youthful selections; as ever the bite was lacking. They are quick and ambitious befitting their age but a heavy-duty cutting edge remains a weapon beyond them.

The first five minutes were illustrative. Italy came at France from a variety of angles Ignacio Brex cutting them open superbly but the French were able to regroup and win the penalty. Seconds later Teddy Thomas a cutting edge if ever there were one was slashing this way and that down the right then Gabin Villière down the left before Dylan Cretin took the direct route to the line from Dupont’s pass. That is how you do it Italy.

Unperturbed the Italians kept up their pace. Their young half-backs are genuine prospects. Paolo Garbisi looked very sharp at fly-half. Stephen Varney his partner at scrum-half thought he had put Monty Ioane away after an outrageous double-dummy break the second dummy bought by Dupont no less. Alas Varney’s pass was deemed forward.

But by then France had scored two more tries pouncing with menace whenever they were given the chance between Italy’s flamboyant gesticulations. Dupont’s chip for Gaël Fickou’s try France’s second just before the half-hour mark was simple and deadly in equal measure.

Meanwhile his contribution to France’s third bang on that half-hour mark was another level up again. None of a phalanx of Italian forwards chose to catch the latest pass from Varney but Dupont was on to the loose ball with a fly-hack. Villière secured it to find Dupont in support. When he was hauled down his over-the-shoulder pass to Arthur Vincent was outrageous and deadly in equal measure.

France’s bonus point duly followed a few minutes into the second half Brice Dulin combining in counterattack with Villière with unseemly ease to finish. Two more tries followed before the hour was out. Dupont scored the first on hand to take Thomas’s inside ball after the latter broke outside Brex from a lineout. Four minutes later and Dupont returned the favour playing linkman after Matthieu Jalibert’s break to send Thomas away.

Italy were in pieces now young men pondering the realities of international rugby – 45-3 down yet probably feeling as if they had played all right. They did more than that a few minutes into the final quarter for their try. Luca Sperandio was released down the right by some sweet handling. His chip and gather on the full over the head of Louis Carbonel was as classy as anything on show.

Of course it mattered naught. Brilliance is easy in bursts. Thomas finished the rout with five minutes to go set away for his second by the flashing hands of Dulin. The brilliance of this French team comes at you in waves and from every conceivable angle. They too need to produce it when it really really matters but for now an empty stadium in Rome is little more than a gallery for them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1Z2J5ZHVtcC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWdpY2lhbi1kdXBvbnQtc2V0cy11cC12aW5jZW50LXRyeS13aXRoLXNpbGt5LWJsaW5kLXBhc3MtYXMtZnJhbmNlLXJ1bi1yYW1wYW50LWFnYWluc3QtaXRhbHkv0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAucnVnYnlkdW1wLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2ljaWFuLWR1cG9udC1zZXRzLXVwLXZpbmNlbnQtdHJ5LXdpdGgtc2lsa3ktYmxpbmQtcGFzcy1hcy1mcmFuY2UtcnVuLXJhbXBhbnQtYWdhaW5zdC1pdGFseS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Magician Dupont dazzles with silky blind pass as France run rampant | RugbyDump,"Antoine Dupont put in another man-of-the-match performance as France kicked off their 6 Nations campaign in comfortable fashion beating Italy 50-10 in Rome.

The scrum-half was not at his complete best with a couple of stray kicks but remained the petit général of the French team setting up three tries and scoring one of his own as Fabien Galthié’s men got off to a flying bonus point start.

Dupont was instrumental in Gaël Fickou’s try to open the scoring and then produced a sublim no-look reverse pass to Arthur Vincent before the half-hour mark.

Such was France’s dominance and Dupont’s impact in the match that he was subbed off before the final quarter. But he still managed to score off one of his trademark inside supporting lines from a Teddy Thomas break and then returned the favour to his winger.

It was a superb display of natural skill – albeit against a weak Italy – and one which deserved the post-match praise from his captain Charles Ollivon.

“As usual he [Antoine Dupont] put in a great performance” Ollivon said.

In a world gripped by economic uncertainty and the steady tightening of targets for reducing carbon emissions now is the perfect time to transition to a business model that combines cheaper and more sustainable chemical production.

That’s the position held by BASF which recently disclosed plans to make this transition by producing chemicals according to the principles of the circular economy. This approach grew out of the cradle-to-cradle production systems promoted in the 1990s by environmentalist and chemistry professor Michael Braungart; those systems aim to avoid waste reuse products and recover resources. They contrast heavily with today’s predominantly linear approach to manufacturing of “make-take-dispose.”

Principles of the circular economy ▸ Sustainable design: Design materials and products to avoid waste and pollution. ▸ No waste: Keep materials and products in use. ▸ Regeneration: Regenerate natural systems when using biobased materials. ▸ Renewable energy: Use only renewable resources. ▸ Nontoxic materials: Exclude hazardous materials from recycling systems. ▸ Systems thinking: Draw inspiration from nature where one species’ waste is always another species’ food. ▸ Deemphasis of efficiency: Focus on benefiting the planet—through methods such as storing carbon from production processes in soil—rather than on reducing environmental harm by increasing efficiency. Sources: Cradle to Cradle by Michael Braungart and William McDonough; Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

BASF the world’s largest chemical maker insists that its new strategy marks a meaningful shift in approach. The firm aims to double its sales generated from circular economy products—made of materials that can be regenerated and that minimize disposed waste—to $20.5 billion by 2030. Its total sales last year were $72.3 billion. Being both sustainable and profitable is a laudable goal but whether BASF has the will and means to achieve it is another matter critics say.

BASF executives acknowledge they have a long way to go before the firm is truly circular. “The path to a circular economy will require enormous efforts on our part” BASF’s chairman Martin Brudermüller told journalists in December during a virtual conference on the new strategy.

The cornerstone idea of BASF’s approach is the steady substitution of fossil fuel raw materials with renewable materials and waste feedstocks including postconsumer plastic waste. Additionally the firm plans to be a key player in the recycling of lithium-ion battery materials for electric vehicles and the sustainable production of biomaterials.

The German company is already dabbling in the area by substituting fossil fuel–derived feedstock with pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastics and tires to make industrial chemicals and polymers. BASF aims to convert at least 250000 metric tons (t) of waste into pyrolysis oil by 2025.

BASF won’t state the percentage of its total annual consumption of fossil fuels that this would displace. But using data from BASF C&EN calculates that even if the firm achieves its 2025 target the pyrolysis oil would represent less than 5% of the company’s total fossil fuel consumption.

Nevertheless with more than 30 million t of plastic waste generated annually in Europe and 250 million t globally the approach has significant potential. “We see a huge opportunity for growth here” Christian Lach head of BASF’s ChemCycling project for using waste plastic as a feedstock said at the December event.

To capitalize on this opportunity BASF has developed a catalyst for the cracking and hydrogenation of plastic waste into an oil that is 99.9% carbon and hydrogen. “It takes a lot of effort and is feasible only if you can turn low-value waste into high-value product” Lach said.

Pyrolysis oil needs to be purified to remove chlorine that can cause corrosion sulfur that can poison catalysts and oxygen that can trigger explosions. BASF is working to solve such problems in partnerships with technology firms including the Norwegian chemical recycling company Quantafuel.

Some environmentalists think using pyrolysis to chemically recycle plastic waste is unsustainable. “Chemical recycling is only viable under limited circumstances and needs a lot of energy” says Sonja Haider senior business adviser at the Swedish environmental group International Chemical Secretariat (ChemSec).

BASF’s pyrolysis yield however is about 70% which is similar to that of the more widely accepted option of mechanical recycling of plastics Lach said when questioned on the issue. From a sustainability perspective he added pyrolysis is best applied to mixed-plastics waste that cannot readily be mechanically recycled.

Braungart founder of the environmental consulting firm EPEA and professor of ecodesign and ecoeffectiveness at Leuphana University Lüneburg asserts that BASF has much more to do to recycle plastics sustainably and be more broadly sustainable.

“The company’s approach is greenwashing and just a nightmare” Braungart says. “BASF is very busy trying to be more efficient at reducing its environmental footprint whereas to be truly sustainable BASF and the wider chemical industry must ask far more fundamental questions and deploy systems that benefit the planet such as making products by taking CO 2 out of the atmosphere” Braungart says.

Braungart laments that Brudermüller also a chemist who in 2018 became chairman of BASF and until recently was also the firm’s chief technology officer hasn’t advanced the firm’s thinking about sustainability beyond that of his predecessors. “BASF’s thinking is still linear” Braungart says. “It’s a pity. I had so much hope for the new CEO Martin Brudermüller.”

BASF also appears to have substantial room for improvement when it comes to carbon emissions. Its climate change goal is to keep its greenhouse gas emissions flat through 2030 even with increases in production. This is a relatively modest commitment compared with the goals of many of its peers—including Dow DuPont Eastman Chemical and PetroChina—which have all committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050.

While the reduction of carbon emissions is often subsidized especially in Europe via its Emissions Trading System there is no equivalent financial benefit to waste avoidance a principle of the circular economy. “Near-term capital expenditure and operating costs for novel circular technologies could have marginal near-term economic benefits and the approach is not without risk” warns Sebastian Bray a stock analyst at the German investment bank Berenberg.

The company’s approach is greenwashing and just a nightmare. Michael Braungart founder EPEA and professor Leuphana University Lüneburg

And even with subsidies some projects for reducing carbon emissions still look expensive. As an example Bray flags the potentially significant expenditure that could arise if BASF converts the heat source for its petrochemical crackers from fossil fuels to renewable electricity. “The change whilst necessary could take 20 years and be costly” Bray says.

Brudermüller though is convinced that the firm’s circular economy approach will yield significant financial and environmental benefits. “Companies that can provide solutions to the transformation to a circular economy will have a crucial competitive advantage” he said.

To help companies such as BASF make the transition the European Chemical Industry Council Europe’s main chemical industry association is lobbying the European Commission to provide subsidies for circular production systems. The EC has promised billions of euros to European businesses and the council hopes that the chemical sector will be a major beneficiary.

Even without government support BASF has circular technologies that it expects will be financially viable. An example is recycling materials—including the metals lithium cobalt and nickel—from electric car batteries.

By 2030 1.6 million t per year of waste car-battery cells will be generated annually around the world—enough feedstock to support multiple industrial-scale recyclers BASF says. Current recycling processes have a carbon footprint that is at least 25% lower than that of any metal mining process but recycling metal is still energy intensive and generates large volumes of waste salts. Moreover state-of-the-art recycling processes generate lithium carbonate which must be further processed to make lithium hydroxide the starting material generally required to make batteries.

The firm has an edge over the competition with selective leaching additives that enable it to extract the lithium from old batteries directly as lithium hydroxide Kerstin Schierle-Arndt BASF’s vice president of research for inorganic materials and synthesis said at the virtual meeting. “This allows us to build the value chain in a simple and cost-effective way” Schierle-Arndt said. The company plans to open a pilot plant for the process in 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Something went wrong please try again later.

A man who live-streamed a video of himself making racist and threatening comments is back behind bars.

Aaron Brennan 28 was released from prison on January 12 after serving a sentence for assault and he was made the subject of a criminal behaviour order until April next year.

That order had a number of conditions which included a ban on him acting or encouraging others to act anti-socially or in a way that would likely cause alarm harassment or distress to people in Notts or Derbyshire.

But Brennan who is of no fixed address but of the Ilkeston and Long Eaton areas made the video on January 19 just seven days after he was released.

He was arrested that day and later charged with making malicious communications and breaching his order.

He was sentenced to 14 weeks in prison after pleading guilty when he appeared before Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court.

Sergeant Sarah Carlile of the Long Eaton Safer Neighbourhood Policing Team said: “Members of the community made us aware of this video and our officers took positive action. No one should feel alarmed threatened or distressed by the actions of others and this behaviour was totally unacceptable.

“I hope that Brennan is able to reflect and understand not only the consequences of his behaviour but also that he will go back to prison if he breaches his Community Behaviour Order.”"

However eBay recently announced a new way of shipping trading cards that should help the market there. Sadly it won’t cut down on fraud and the like but the new eBay Standard Envelope (eBS) may help draw more legitimate sellers to the site.

The eBS is a low cost shipping service that eBay now offers for trading cards priced $20 and below that way no more than 3 oz. You can print a label and mail off the package for less than $1 and you get tracking. I don’t know of any other shipping service that provides tracking and shipping for less than $1 so that’s pretty amazing. It also has shipping protection so that buyers and sellers can rest easy. In a world where more and more people are going back to buying trading cards this is very timely.

I do want to note that the cost does vary by weight so that is something to be careful of. 1 oz costs $0.51 2 oz costs $0.71 and 3 oz costs $0.91.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjI4MjI4Ny9idWNrcy1maXp6LWNoZXJ5bC1iYWtlci1zZWxsaW5nLXBvc3Nlc3Npb25zLW9uLWViYXkv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8yMjgyMjg3L2J1Y2tzLWZpenotY2hlcnlsLWJha2VyLXNlbGxpbmctcG9zc2Vzc2lvbnMtb24tZWJheS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bucks Fizz star Cheryl Baker is selling her furniture on eBay after lockdown left her ‘totally broke’...,"BUCK Fizz star Cheryl Baker has been forced to sell her furniture on eBay after lockdown left her 'totally broke'.

The 66-year-old has been hit hard by ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and revealed she's not only peddling her furniture but also clothes painting and jewellery.

Speaking to The Daily Mail the Making Your Mind Up hitmaker revealed: ""Clothes and all sorts. My daughters are doing it for me.

""Though I haven't got any proper jewellery it's all fake along with my furniture and the paintings on the wall!'

Her admission comes a week after she revealed she’s currently living on £950 a month.

Cheryl who won Eurovision in 1981 with Bucks Fizz previously kept herself afloat by touring with bandmates Mike Nolan and Jay Ashton as a break-away group called The Fizz.

4 Back in the '80s Cheryl was riding high as part of Bucks Fizz who won Eurovision in 1981

But as live gigs came to a screeching halt thanks to the pandemic Cheryl revealed to The Sun that she has turned to her pension to pay her mortgage.

She said: ""I started paying into pensions when I was 21 but for one reason or another had to cash in all but one.

""So I get a £700 state pension a month plus £250 from my private one which is great.

""At 66 I still have a mortgage. I don’t suppose there are many people my age who still have one they’ve been sensible with their money or downsized.""

4 Bucks Fizz performed as a four-piece in 2015 though Bobby G left the group leaving the remaining members as 'The Fizz'

The singer also confessed that she’s due to pay a large tax bill – and now grows her own veggies at her home in Kent to keep costs down.

At times things have been so tough that bandmates co-stars and fans have offered monetary support.

She shared: ""Mike [Ashton] rang me and said ‘I’m coming down on the train. Pick me up at the station I’m bringing cash for you’.

""My skating partner from Dancing On Ice Dan Whiston called and offered to send money.

""A fan in Australia put a call out saying 'Cheryl’s destitute we need to start a collection'.""

It’s difficult to know what the future will hold for Cheryl – with gigs due for March 2021 now pushed back for 2022.

""Everything was cancelled or postponed and now some of the dates that were postponed to the beginning of this year have been put back again. I’ve just been told one gig set for March 6 this year will be in 2022.""

And unable to pick up work as a delivery driver due to Covid concerns Cheryl now charges fans a reasonable £30 for private video messages on the CelebVM app.

She added: ""I could be a delivery person but I don’t want to risk my health by working somewhere.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vaW1tb3J0YWwtaHVsay00My1lYmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Immortal Hulk #43 Skyrockets on eBay Following Anti-Semitic Art Controversy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vaW1tb3J0YWwtaHVsay00My1lYmF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC95ZWV6eS1jb2xvcndheXMtZWJheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ten Standout YEEZY Colorways We Found at eBay,"This content has been paid for by an advertiser.

Even the most dedicated YEEZY disciple would have to concede that there are a lot of them out there. With Kanye and adidas continuing to drop new YEEZY colorways like there’s no tomorrow and who can blame them really it’s pretty difficult to keep track of the special ones. But today we’ve taken care of that difficult part for you.

We recently hit go-to marketplace eBay to pick out 10 of the YEEZY colorways that actually stood out both aesthetically and investment-wise. From the new sunglasses-demanding YEEZY 700 ""Sun"" to highlight iterations of the fan-favorite 350 V2 these are the YEEZYs that emerged triumphant from the wave of near-constant drops.

All of the YEEZYs below fall under eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program which ensures all YEEZY sneakers over $100 are 100 percent legit.

Scroll for the standout YEEZY colorways we found at eBay.

YEEZY Boost 350 V2 ""Clay""

adidas YEEZY Boost 350 V2 Clay $255 Buy at ebay

A staple silhouette of the YEEZY lineup the 350 V2 got this clay-hued makeover back in March 2019. Maintaining the signature features of the line including the Primeknit upper and full-length Boost tech this one was exclusive to certain North American cities.

YEEZY Boost 700 ""Wave Runner""

adidas YEEZY Boost 700 Wave Runner $180 Buy at ebay

Kanye and adidas unveiled the 700 silhouette to the world in 2017 and the ""Wave Runner"" was the first of the family. Bearing a color combo that has spawned various copycats this OG is a future classic for sure.

YEEZY Boost 350 V2 ""Zebra""

adidas YEEZY Boost 350 V2 Zebra $100 Buy at ebay

They don't come much more standout than the 350 V2 ""Zebra"". And we don't need to explain where this one got its name.

YEEZY Boost 700 ""Sun""

adidas YEEZY Boost 700 Sun $300 Buy at ebay

Most of us are still suffering the cold dark days of winter but adidas and Ye dropped a heavy dose of sunshine earlier this month with the YEEZY Boost 700 ""Sun"". A sneaker that has us dreaming of summer days to come.

YEEZY Boost 700 V3 ""Arzareth""

adidas YEEZY 700 V3 Arzareth $230 Buy at ebay

The V3 offered a fresh new spin on the 700 when it dropped late last year adding a semi-translucent RPU cage and EVA midsole. The icy ""Arzareth"" is a perfect alternative if the ""Sun"" above is a little too hot for you.

YEEZY Boost 350 V2 ""Yecheil""

adidas YEEZY Boost 350 V2 Yecheil Non-Reflective $180 Buy at ebay

Shopping standout YEEZY colorways doesn't have to mean bright colors. We know that's not for everyone. If that's the case with you — enter the 350 V2 ""Yecheil"". YEEZY's customary earth tones are nowhere to be found on this dark edition of the hugely popular silhouette.

YEEZY 500 ""Soft Vision""

adidas YEEZY 500 Soft Vision $225 Buy at ebay

The 500 first made an appearance back in 2017 a bulkier choice than usual for YEEZY fans and the first of the label's sneakers to do away with adidas' Boost technology. Taking cues from basketball sneakers particularly for the sole the lilac ""Soft Vision"" colorway is perfect for the upcoming spring.

YEEZY Boost 350 V2 ""Semi Frozen""

adidas YEEZY Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow $165 Buy at ebay

We're not done with the 350 V2 yet and we're guessing you're not either. Counting the most colorway options of all YEEZY silhouettes this is the trickiest line to navigate. The ""Semi Frozen"" dropped in 2017 and is the loud neon shoe your bland rotation may need.

YEEZY Boost 350 V2 ""Bred""

adidas YEEZY Boost 350 V2 Bred $250 Buy at ebay

Taking on a colorway synonymous with Nike and Jordan the 350 ""Bred"" looks like it could be part of the uniform for future missions to the moon.

YEEZY Boost 700 ""MNVN Orange""

adidas YEEZY Boost 700 MNVN $235 Buy at ebay

If you've made it this far you should know that Kanye West and YEEZY are not always about the earth tones. Case in point: the 700 ""MNVN Orange"" which released last year. Designers Christian Tresser and Steven Smith worked on the 700's update resulting in a new nylon upper overlay and loud graphic work.

The game's most powerful and sought-after card Black Lotus – which was released as part of the Alpha set in 1993 – popped up on eBay earlier this month and closed at the end of January having sold for an astonishing $511100. That's three times the price paid for a similar quality card in 2019 and five times the price paid in 2018 (thanks Polygon ).

The steep price is thought to have been achieved due to the card's mint condition – rated as ""MT 10"" – and the fact it's been signed by artist Christopher Rush who sadly died back in 2016.

Another Black Lotus card is currently on sale now for – yup you've guessed it – $499999. However that card has been on sale since May 2018 according to the eBay listing history and ""only"" sports a GEM Mint rating of 9.5 and hasn't been signed.

ICYMI the first Magic: Legends open beta will begin on March 23  giving players their first taste of the free-to-play deck-building action-RPG.

You can sign up for the beta via the official Magic: Legends website. All you have to do is make a free Arc account and click the button in the top-right corner. Ahead of the beta you can also put in for a slot in the final closed alpha.

Alpha and beta testing is exclusive to PC but PS4 and Xbox One players will get to join in the full release later this year. In a new deck-building deep-dive Perfect World gave us a better idea of what to expect from Magic: Legends and a clearer picture of how it adapts the rules of Magic: The Gathering.

Launched in November 2019 NFS Heat has been received with mixed reactions by gamers out there but this doesn’t necessarily mean that people stopped playing it.It may not be a simulation game like Assetto Corsa or Gran Turismo  but it certainly has the pure Need for Speed feel that gamers expect such a title to come with.One Need for Speed Heat player has decided to do something that required months of work: they recreated the original launch trailer published by Electronic Arts in August 2019 all using nothing but real-life footage and videos they recorded.In other words the video you see embedded below might look like a Need for Speed trailer but it’s not. It’s just a clip created by someone with the right video editing skills all while paying impressive attention even to the smallest details.Now before you rush to the comments section to say this isn’t an actual replica of the trailer let’s set things straight: the purpose of this project wasn’t necessarily to serve as a 100 percent accurately copy of EA’s video but to provide us with a glimpse into the thrilling race experience offered by Need for Speed on PCs and consoles using real-time footage.There are things that could be improved there’s no doubt about that but the creator of the video themselves said they spent months to make everything look just the way it looks today. And honestly this clip really isn’t getting the love it deserves especially because some scenes look just like they’ve been recorded in a video game.We’ve embedded both the original Need for Speed Heat launch trailer and the video based on real-life footage below and of course make sure you watch both with your headphones on for the full experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYXlzdGF0aW9ubGlmZXN0eWxlLm5ldC8yMDIxLzAyLzA3L21hc3MtZWZmZWN0LTMtZW5kaW5nLWRpdmlkZWQtZGV2cy_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbmxpZmVzdHlsZS5uZXQvMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9tYXNzLWVmZmVjdC0zLWVuZGluZy1kaXZpZGVkLWRldnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mass Effect 3’s Controversial Ending Proved to Be Divisive Among Its Developers as Well,"If you’ve played Mass Effect 3 then you probably remember the backlash that its ending received. Without spoiling anything for our readers the game’s ending was criticized for undermining one of the series’ major selling points and disregarding the decisions made prior. It has now emerged that the ending was just as divisive among the game’s developers as it was among fans.

Speaking to The Gamer’s Cian Maher writer Jay Turner revealed that he was “pretty upset” about the ending. He had moved on to a different company before the game’s development wrapped up.

“When I played the game I was pretty OK with the ending since I considered the whole of Mass Effect 3 to be the ending for the trilogy but after I replayed it and realized that my decisions only really changed the color of the explosions in the ending cutscene I was pretty upset” said Turner.

Patrick Moran who worked on Mass Effect 3‘s multiplayer as Senior Gameplay Designer revealed that he sent an email to BioWare to express his concerns about the ending but he never received a response.

“A good number of the Mass Effect team pushed back against the ending” said Moran. “I remember reading the story beats getting upset because it felt like all the decisions I made no longer mattered. I sent an email off challenging the ending and received no reply. The Mass Effect team was run like a navy ship with strict reporting lines scopes of responsibility and team leaders who had been there awaiting their turn for promotion for years and years. You followed orders and tried to not be too squeaky or uppity.”

Such was the fan backlash that BioWare released free DLC focused on the ending. However many still feel like it didn’t do the series justice.

This 22nd year again we are celebrating art and culture through a different medium that has spurred us on to ‘unlock’ the festival and make it virtual. Our partners artistes and longtime collaborators have stepped forward this year too to make this festival a virtual reality” said Brinda Miller honorary chairperson of the Kala Ghoda Association. “What is encouraging is that we have well-wishers from around the world and this has been an opportunity for us to reinvent the wheel!”E-festival goers can toggle between moveable scalable virtual stages spanning conversations music performances film screenings virtual walks and live chat sessions in sync with the festival’s core tradition. If speaking or performing at different venues of the festival earlier meant 50 to 300 attendees hosting the event online means reaching a much larger audience especially nostalgic Mumbaikars in faraway places. Hosting online also no longer means compromising on cost scale or content with experts beaming in from as far as the UK US Brazil and Italy.Highlights include popular stand-up comics like Radhika Vaz Aditi Mittal Vir Das and Atul Khatri tickling your funny bones; kitchen secrets of Tara Deshpande and Kunal Vijaykar; sommelier Gargi Kothari conducting a virtual wine-tasting workshop; top children’s entertainer Robert Harun or Rob teaching kids to explore creativity; virtual tours around Marine Drive and Kala Ghoda; and musical reunion between Pankaj Udhas and Kavita Krishnamurthi.A festival top draw — the marketplace — is pivoting to e-stalls that will allow people to browse Indian handicrafts by 100 folk artisans from across the country till the end of February. “The Kala Ghoda Arts Festival celebration is as much about experiencing art as it is about playing patron to them. The range of e-stalls will offer everything from cloth jewellery and pet scarves to apparel and knick knacks for the home made by I n d i a’s skilled but oft-forgotten smaller craftsmen from different states” added Miller.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbGtlc3BvcnQuY29tL25ld3MvZmlmYS0yMS9lYS10by1sYXVuY2gtZmlmYS0yMS1mb3ItZ29vZ2xlLXN0YWRpYS1pbi1tYXJjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA to launch FIFA 21 for Google Stadia in March » TalkEsport,"EA’s AAA title FIFA 21 is finally coming to Google Stadia next month.

WRITTEN BY: Lala Jackson

Editor’s Note: People who take insulin require consistently affordable and predictable sources of insulin at all times. If you or a loved one are struggling to afford or access insulin you can build custom plans based on your personal circumstances through our tool GetInsulin.org.

In January 2021 the United States Senate Finance Committee issued their findings from a two-year investigation into the price of insulin in the US. Their findings are unsurprising to anyone impacted by the cost of insulin. Too many entities—manufacturers pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurance companies—are driving up the cost of insulin a life-sustaining drug that insulin-dependent people cannot go without.

The diabetes community has never gotten this level of insight before; all of the contracts and deals the Senate Finance Committee were able to investigate were confidential. Below we break down what’s in the Senate Finance Committee’s 90-page report.

To best understand the findings here are four definitions you need to know:

Insulin manufacturers – Refers to the companies who manufacture insulin. Currently there are three primary insulin manufacturers that market insulin in the US sometimes referred to as “the Big 3”: Eli Lilly Novo Nordisk and Sanofi. These three companies produce almost 90 percent of insulin worldwide. Other companies include MannKind which makes Afrezza inhalable insulin Viatris (formerly known as Mylan) which makes Semglee as well as multiple manufacturers who market insulin outside of the US.

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) – PBMs are third-party intermediaries who negotiate prices and drug placements on insurance formularies between pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies. Sometimes they are standalone companies other times they are attached to national pharmacies or insurance companies. For their negotiating services they take a share of the profits from prescriptions. This share is known as ‘rebates.’ They also profit from “administrative fees” for each unit of drug sold which can be up to 5 percent of the list price.

Rebates – A percentage of the list price of a medication given by a drug manufacturer to a PBM in order to be listed on the health insurance plan formulary or placed in a pharmacy. Rebates function a bit like a “broker’s fee” of sorts and can account for 30-70 percent of the cost a person has to pay at the counter for insulin. The PBM takes a portion of the rebate and then gives the remainder to their client which can be the federal government (Medicare) an employer’s health plan or a standalone health insurer.

Formulary – Also known as an insurance or prescription formulary this is the list of prescription drugs covered by your health insurance or prescription drug plan also called a drug list. Health insurance companies change their covered prescription drugs from year to year based on negotiations with PBMs and drug manufacturers. This is why you may hear that the insulin you use is no longer “covered on the formulary.” This is also why you may notice the cost of your insulin changing sometimes from an amount like $500 a month one year to $35 a month in another. This has nothing to do with federal drug pricing policy and everything to do with private deals made between PBMs insurance companies and manufacturers.

Editor’s Note: See Beyond Type 1’s full glossary for the US Healthcare System HERE

Over almost two years the Senate Finance Committee poured over 100000 pages of internal documents provided by insulin manufacturers the three major PBMs and reports from The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) trying to determine the financial and contractual relationships between the companies.

As stated in the report “…the opaque business practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs have huge implications for patients payers and the Federal government with respect to insulin and therapies for other diseases.”

This report is drastically different from the 2018 report issued by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus which was a very light overview of the issue thanking manufacturers PBMs plans and organizations for their participation.

Some of the top line findings from the report include::

Two insulin manufacturers considered dropping list prices by up to 50 percent in 2018—neither did because it wasn’t good for business.

The rise of list prices is due to the profits they create for insulin manufacturers and PBMs as well as PBM pressure for rebates and threats to exclude products from insurance formularies.

The insulin manufacturers admit they could drop some rebates by up to 89 percent and still be profitable.

The report puts numbers on what all those examining healthcare policy in the US already knew—this problem is complex. It requires multiple drastic solutions from many angles. There is no quick fix—bandaids in one place create issues in another. And it’s not limited to insulin—even if the government were to place a federal list price cap on insulin many other diabetes medications and technologies would still be within the PBM and rebate system. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for example have started going through pharmacy benefits making them subject to rebates. GLP-1 medications particularly vital for people with type 2 diabetes and various forms of glucagon crucial for anyone on insulin are prohibitively expensive and hard to be approved for. The entire system is broken; here’s the how of some of it.

The role of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)



A definition you need to know for this section: insulin WAC is the wholesale acquisition cost an estimate of the manufacturer’s list price for a drug to wholesalers or direct purchasers that does not include discounts or rebates.

Speculated about for some time but difficult to prove because of private contracts (fully legal through the US system which is notoriously bad at regulating drug pricing) is the sheer amount of cash being collected by PBMs. Originally created to help get needed drugs to patients more efficiently PBMs have unfortunately become a key agitator to high out-of-pocket drug costs.

Page 5 of the report outlines the issue—“…drug manufacturers increased insulin WAC in part to give them room to offer larger rebates to PBM and health insurers all in the hopes that their product would receive preferred formulary placement. This pricing strategy translated into higher sales volumes and revenue for manufacturers. In some cases manufacturers appear to have been concerned that decreasing WAC prices would be viewed negatively by PBMs since PBM’s capture a portion of rebate revenue and are also paid administrative fees based on a percentage of WAC.”

The big legislative stumbling block we now face is just how reliant on PBMs the US healthcare system has become. In a more simple system a pharmaceutical manufacturer could provide their medications to a pharmacy for direct disbursement to patients who require them. But in a system with a shaky foundation to start with and many players in the space across private and public entities the water gets significantly muddied.

From the report “PBMs play a major role in the drug supply and payment chain by negotiating drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers and managing drug benefits for health care payers including private insurers employers and entities that provide coverage under Medicare Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).”

To keep PBMs happy ensuring they negotiate the placement of each manufacturer’s insulin on insurance formularies rebates for insulins have increased exponentially particularly since 2013. In July 2013 Sanofi offered rebates between 2 percent and 4 percent for preferred placement on a formulary. The same product in 2018 provided a 56 percent rebate. That’s more than half of the out-of-pocket cost of insulin being handed to companies that don’t make the insulin. This is one example but every single insulin manufacturer does this. As the report states “What is clear is that the money that flows through PBMs is nothing short of enormous. As discussed throughout this report rebates have grown at a rapid pace in the insulin market in recent years which is not true in all therapeutic markets.”

The bigger the PBM the greater the power. The three largest PBMs—CVS Caremark Express Scripts and Optum Rx—wield significant power in the market commanding large rebates to the detriment of the smaller PBM players in the country. Lilly documents show that they offered a 22 percent rebate to a small PBM but offered Optum Rx a 68 percent rebate for the same products in order to get placement in Medicare’s Part D prescription plan. As noted in the report this robust ability to negotiate has led to “…some PBMs securing rebates as high as 70 percent in recent years.”

Manufacturer contracts with PBMs previously confidential but exposed by the Senate Finance Committee report are written in percentages. This means that it is to the PBMs’ benefit to encourage list price increases making their portion of payout larger. The bundling of multiple products (increasing one product’s rebate amount to get other products included) is also a tactic used in PBM and manufacturer negotiations especially in exclusivity contracts.

“As Eli Lilly explained to its investors in 2019 failing to secure formulary placement can “lead to reduced usage of the drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions such as prior authorization in formulary exclusions or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost such as non-preferred co-pay tiers increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles.”

How rebates—most of the cost of your insulin—work

The math is infuriating but here’s the heavily-simplified basics of how rebates work—if you made a product for $5 and wanted to sell it you may set the price at $10 to create a $5 profit. With that $5 profit you can invest back in your company to create better products pay yourself—whatever you want to do with your $5.

But let’s say you want your product to be in more places and available to more people. You might hire a middle person to place your product in new stores across the country and they’ll charge a fee which is reasonable.

When you begin their fee is $1. So that you can keep your $5 profit you raise your price to $11. Still reasonable. But over time your middle person makes themselves indispensable and knows it. You’re making way more money because of how many products you’re able to sell so you’re not about to drop your middle person.

And oh oops—you also signed a contract with your middle person to ensure you’ll always get your product placed in these nation-wide stores so you’re locked in. And part of that contract was an understanding that you won’t lower your price since that would impact your middle-person’s profit.

And oh oops—your middle person also has contracts with your competitors and the contracts signed with those competitors makes it so that if your competitor gives the middle person a little bit more of their profits your middle person won’t sell your product in certain stores for a year. You can fix this by raising your own price to give the middle person more profits so you can kick your competitor out of a store the next year.

So now your product costs $50. It’s the same product—you’ve never improved it. Your customers are receiving no more value than when the product cost just $10. Over time you wanted to make more money from it so your profit is now $10.

It’s still $5 to make your product.

You get $10 profit doubled from your original earnings.

And your middle person? They’re making $35 70 percent of the list price off a product they don’t make or even touch.

But you’re definitely not going to get rid of your middle person because they’re the reason you’re able to sell so many products and make the money that you do.

For a regular product like a water bottle no worries your customer will just go somewhere else.

But what if your product was water and your customer needed it to survive?

List prices as a marketing tool

A part of drug pricing that can be jarring and confusing is the practice of including list prices—effectively the cost one pays without insurance—on a medication’s receipt. Typically 30-50 percent of the cost sometimes up to 70 percent of the cost is not for the medication itself but to pay for the rebates given back to the PBMs and insurance companies often the very company that is printing the receipt. It’s not necessarily that your insurance or the pharmacy “saved” you that money—it’s that by buying the medication through them they are getting a kickback from the sheer amount of medication they were able to negotiate to go through their company.

That list price ends up being what someone who does not have insurance coverage has to pay because that person is not participating in the very system of insurance and PBMs that drove the price up in the first place.

Insulin manufacturers offer Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) cash pricing through the manufacturer and co-pay cards to bypass the PBM system and get insulin at less than the list price usually for no more than $100 per month and often for $0-$50 per month. In order to access these programs a patient may have to know where to look how to assess eligibility and navigate what can sometimes be a challenging approval process. Beyond Type 1 launched GetInsulin.org for exactly this reason (through the tool you can quickly find what programs you qualify for based on your unique circumstances such as brand income insurance type etc).

The role of insulin manufacturers

The list price of insulin has risen steeply over time with the greatest increase over the last 15 years. For context one vial of insulin typically lasts an insulin-dependent person anywhere from 5 to 20 days. Most insulin-dependent people require two to three vials of insulin per month while some require six or more. Every case of diabetes is unique.

In the late-90s one vial of analog (modern) insulin cost about $25-40 per vial without insurance. By 2005 this had doubled to about $80 then started sharply increasing—about $125 by 2010 $260 in 2015 and—depending on the type of insulin—up to $275 and sometimes as much as $500 or more for long-acting analog insulins. Experts have stated that even in a capitalist but competitive market an insulin-dependent person should be paying $130 or less per year for their insulin needs.

These price hikes are not limited to insulin—all drugs including all glucose regulating medications and most recently diabetes devices are subject to the rebates problem. But insulin is certainly where we see one of the clearest examples of how the US healthcare system is broken. Not only do PBMs and insurance companies benefit but the Senate Finance Committee’s January 2020 report states that despite the insulin manufacturers saying that they are not making as much off insulin as people say evidence shows that they are.

From the report “…companies set their WAC price for insulin based on competitive considerations in the insulin market maximizing revenue and maximizing market share.” Each insulin manufacturer often states that the reason for increasing their list prices is due to the need to earn more money to invest in research and development of new insulins but the Senate Report shows that this reasoning falls apart quickly when looking through financial documents.

The report calls out several clear instances of the pricing increase practices:

Sanofi increased the list price of Lantus three times in 2013 alone—on April 26 August 2 and December 13—resulting in a total increase of approximately 39.7 percent for Lantus vials and 29.7 percent for Lantus pens. The Senate Finance Committee showed these price increases to be based on a conscious choice from Sanofi aimed at setting up a higher list price for their newer product Toujeo while getting their Lantus users ready to switch to the new product because they would already be used to the higher price. This was combined with increased pressure from PBMs to offer higher rebates or suffer exclusion of Lantus and/or Toujeo from insurance formularies.

Novo Nordisk did the same with their long-acting insulin product Tresiba. Before Tresiba Novo Nordisk “shadow priced” Sanofi in 2014. This is different from “lockstep pricing” where companies illegally work together to increase their prices at the same time. But Novo Nordisk’s internal documents show that Novo Nordisk would track the price of Sanofi’s Lantus long-acting insulin then increase the own price of their competitive product Levemir sometimes getting approval turnaround within 24 hours. This strategy changed in 2015 with Novo Nordisk’s launch of the long-acting insulin Tresiba. Instead of shadow-pricing Sanofi Novo Nordisk raised the price of Levemir before Lantus was increased in order to “…set a high basal insulin price floor from which to launch Tresiba’s initial list price.”

From 2014 to 2019 Novo Nordisk increased the list price of the NovoLog FlexPen by 70 percent.

Perhaps the biggest blow is that Novo Nordisk’s Board of Directors voted against a proposed insulin price decrease. From the report “On May 29 2018 Novo Nordisk USPC debated whether it should reduce the list price of its insulin drugs by 50 percent after a string of news reports detailed how patients were struggling to afford their medications. Novo Nordisk believed that a 50 percent cut would be a meaningful reduction to patients significantly close the list-to-net [price] gap head off negative press attention and reduce “pressure” from Congressional hearings.”

The Novo Nordisk board voted against the price reduction and recommended that the company continue its “reactive posture.” The board recommended that Novo Nordisk “monitor the market… to determine if other major pharma companies are taking list price [increases].” Internal documents show that this decision was due to “financial downsides risk of backlash from PBMs and payers and expected pressure to take similar action on other products. PBM and payer [insurance company] backlash appeared to be of particular concern to Novo Nordisk. The company believes that its decision to decrease list price could upset payers and that many in the drug supply chain (e.g. wholesale distributors PBMs and health insurers) would be negatively impacted financially and could retaliate against Novo Nordisk.”

The role of insurance companies

When negotiating with PBMs to create their insurance formularies i.e. the products that they will provide insurance coverage for insurance companies also receive portions of the drug rebates. Those rebates often go back to those enrolled under the insurance plans in the form of lower premiums. However people who require maintenance (ongoing) medications like those for diabetes asthma etc. are the bulk of those paying for hefty rebates while the rebates received by insurance companies themselves get spread amongst the entire population of those enrolled on a health insurance plan.

Over the last several years further complicating privatized US healthcare PBMs have merged with health insurance (also known as “payer”) companies further increasing their leverage buying power and ability to control the healthcare market. Express Scripts merged with Cigna CVS Health with Caremark and Aetna and Optum Rx became a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. These large mergers and acquisitions further complicate an already clunky system built more upon profit than patient care.

In the US most of those who have health insurance are covered by for-profit insurance companies. This means that even for the companies who do have strong social missions their business decisions are still driven by profit. This has led to the rise of high deductible healthcare plans (HDHPs) and other measures meant to decrease healthcare spending and increase profits very often to the particular detriment of anyone living with a lifelong disease like diabetes.

From the report “The Internal Revenue Service sought to address this issue in July 2019 when it released guidance that expanded the list of preventive services that an HDHP can cover below the deductible to include insulin.” However this is a voluntary offering for HDHP plans; it is up to the employer to decide if they want to offer this “first dollar coverage” (exempting insulin from the deductible so people are not paying the list price of insulin before they hit their deductible) which creates an additional cost to the employer.

Of course this issue is not unique to private insurance; federal insurance like Medicare is also involved. Medicare is a federal health program provided mostly for those aged 65 and older. From the report in 2019 Eli Lilly offered rebates as high as $75 per vial of insulin for preferred formulary placement in Medicare Part D the section of Medicare that oversees prescription drugs. For Lilly this meant securing the Medicare population as their customers.

The number of patients on Medicare who are using insulin has increased 51 percent from 2010 to 2017 whereas spending on insulin—prior to rebates—increased more than 470 percent during the same time. It is a large market to corner and insulin manufacturers wanting preferred formulary placement are willing to include large rebates in their insulin pricing structure as incentive. From the report “…on July 28th 2017 one Sanofi official wrote to colleagues after considering their offer to CVS Caremark [one of the PBMs utilized by Medicare] for placement on the [Medicare] Part D formulary: “after including of additional fees we are still profitable up to a 89 percent rebate.””



The bottom line

The US healthcare system is deeply broken and insulin pricing is one of the clearest examples that an unregulated drug pricing system motivated by profit will always put cash flow over patient lives. With a new political administration in place and further transparency provided by the Senate Finance Committee’s report now is the time to create pressure for change.

Significant rebate reform and an overhaul or removal of the PBM system could slash the list price of insulin by up to 70 percent and would impact not just insulin but many medications and devices that are subject to the rebate system. Robust federal healthcare reform could create a system where drug prices could be negotiated on a federal level and current proposals like rolling back prices to more reasonable levels could be a step. A deeply broken system requires layered solutions. Without a full overhaul we risk fixing the insulin pricing issue with a bandaid while driving up prices and limiting access to other life sustaining medications and life changing technology.

Susan 61 died surrounded by her family in McLean Virginia a suburb of Washington D.C.

Governor Eric J. Holcomb made the following statement:

“Janet and I were saddened to learn about the passing of former First Lady Susan Bayh. She was an extraordinary and radiant public servant wife mother and friend who leaves a remarkable impact on our state and nation. I ask all Hoosiers to join us in praying and being there for the Bayh family.”

Her family shared this video on Saturday on YouTube.

Her husband a Democrat was governor from January 1989 through January 1997 after he’d served four years as Indiana’s secretary of state. She was the 46th “First Lady of Indiana” and was the youngest in 150 years to assume the role at age 29.

She was Miss Southern California 1978; that’s the same year she was a princess in the Rose Bowl Parade.

Susan earned her law degree from the University of Southern California Law School in 1984 and later worked for law firms in Los Angeles and Indiana handled federal regulatory issues for Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly & Co. served on several corporate boards and taught at and became a trustee of Butler University.

In 1994 President Bill Clinton appointed Susan to the International Joint Commission. She served six years addressing issues between Canada and the United States. Evan served as one of Indiana’s U.S. senators from January 1999 to January 2011.

Susan’s battle with cancer was first revealed in May 2018 when she underwent surgery for malignant brain cancer. She began chemotherapy and radiation therapy following the surgery.

She is survived by her husband; their twin sons Nick and Beau; her parents Bob and Carol Breshears; her siblings Bob Jr. Ann and Linda; and numerous nieces and nephews.

I remember returning to New Delhi after a semester at Yale University in Connecticut some years back and trying to move what I had in U.S. dollars to my bank account in India. The process of remitting these savings was so clunky – involving applications in banks in both countries — that I just used my U.S. debit card until the account ran dry. I’m sure I paid a bunch of fees and got short-changed on currency conversion costs but I found it easier to spend this money rather than spending time trying to find a cheaper way."

Public Service Commissioner Craig Greene directed Entergy to investigate claims of high bills. The investigation will look at individual complaints and there will also be a general investigation.

The office is hoping to hear back from Entergy by February 24 with an update on the investigation.

Entergy toldus the increases could be coming from higher usage. Since it’s colder in December more people will use their heaters.

We spoke to one viewer in Arnaudville who tells us his bill increased by 126% in December.

He says he wasn’t at home for seven of the coldest days in the month which is what Entergy is attributing the increases to.

He shared his billing statements with us and it shows his bill went from $144.15 in January 2020 to $342.60 in January 2021.

He says he has requested for Entergy to re-read his meter but they have not shown up.

He tells us he requested to have his meter re-read and tells us Entergy has failed to show up twice.

Another concern viewers say they have is the new meters Entergy installed.

Entergy says the new advanced meters are tested prior to during and after installation to ensure they’re accurate. They also say if a customer had an older analog meter prior to receiving their new advanced meter there is the possibility their older meter was reading under the actual usage.

Call 1-800-ENTERGY (368-3749) if you have an issue with your bill.

One of the first scenes in Netflix's buzzy new period drama ""Bridgerton"" features a character being laced into a corset. So it's no surprise that the show based on Julia Quinn's romance novels has precipitated a new surge of interest in corsets and other Regency-inspired garb.

The series created by Chris Van Dusen as part of Shonda Rhimes' reported $150 million Netflix deal was released in late December 2020. Netflix said in a press release in January that Bridgerton was the streaming service's ""biggest show ever"" with a viewership of 82 million households in its first 28 days.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Viewers responded to the Austen-meets-Ariana Grande feel of the show: contemporary casting music and love scenes overlaid on a glitzy 1800s background.

Ironically Wendy LeSesne the chief marketing officer of Orchard Corsets told Insider that the Regency era was not the inspiration for the kind of corsets that viewers are looking for after watching the show. That time period was characterized by flowing waists but for many modern consumers purchasing a corset is an effort to achieve an hourglass figure. But given that ""Bridgerton"" weaves together past and present in its plot subject matter and score a little revisionist fashion history is par for the course.

Orchard Corsets reported an increase in sales since the show began airing. Traffic to the retailer's website grew by 71% in the same time period LeSesne said and it noticed more new viewers —unusual for the retailer which relies on repeat buyers.

Etsy told Insider that the site saw a 91% increase in searches for corsets in the past three months compared to the same time period last year.

High-end corset purveyor Corset Story saw a 20% increase in site traffic in January. But a representative told Insider that revenue ""ended up a little below our original targets."" The representative said that the reason for an increase in traffic but not revenue could be higher prices or that ""people gravitated towards marketplaces.""

Indeed the top Amazon result for ""corset"" has several sizes and colors sold out or backordered. One reviewer wrote: ""I love this corset so much! I was inspired by Bridgerton (like so many others).""

In addition to Etsy seeing searches for corsets soar it saw a similar lift in searches for old-fashioned or Regency-inspired lifestyle items like tea sets which went up by 110%. And the impractical-but-fabulous query ""lace gloves"" surged 744%.

But as Dayna Isom Johnson Etsy's trend expert told Insider ""We love the show … but that doesn't mean that we're all trading in our sweatpants for ball gowns.""

The rise of interest in corsets Johnson suspects lets people feel on-trend while ""not completely stepping back into getting dressed from head to toe but rather making yourself feel a little bit more polished and sophisticated.""

Orchard Corsets is looking to capitalize on the success of the show by adding some ""Bridgerton""-inspired items to its site later this year. It'll also be putting together a page detailing the history of the time period's attire for interested shoppers with an eye toward historical accuracy.

""Bridgerton"" isn't the first Netflix show to move markets. Insider reported that the success of the limited series ""The Queen's Gambit"" has driven increased interest in chess sets lessons and merchandise.

Johnson thinks that with many consumers spending more time at home due to the pandemic ""it's no surprise why shoppers are really drawing this inspiration from the TV shows that we're tuning into.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vYWdlbmNpZXMvcHJvZmlsZXMtaW4tYmxhY2stY3JlYXRpdml0eS10LWRvdWdsYXMtdG9sZXMtcmFjaXNtLWlzLXRlcnJvcmlzbS10LXNoaXJ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Profiles in Black Creativity: T.

Pop on a faux collar,"New York CNN —

A styling hack that converts even the dowdiest of t-shirts into a Zoom-ready look is gaining steam.

It’s called the “faux collar” a detachable collar that you pop around your neck over a shirt or sweater to give it some oomph just in time for that video call. Retailers like H&M and Macy’s are ready to take it mainstream as they try to capitalize on America’s penchant for comfort–and easy wardrobe solutions– in the work-from-home era.

It comes at a time when major chains are struggling to convince people to shop. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores tumbled 26.4% in 2020 versus the prior year according to the Commerce Department.

While it’s no silver bullet on-trend products like faux collars could help retailers generate some incremental sales.

“Faux collars are an emerging trend as we push ourselves to showcase our individuality in front of the screen” said Dayna Isom Johnson resident trend expert with Etsy (ETSY). “Some collars are embellished with intricate details floral patterns or beads. It’s a really easy way to add glamor.”

H&M is bringing faux collars into its stores this spring. H&M

Fast fashion seller H&M said it is bringing faux collars to its stores in the coming weeks featuring frilly edges and eyeleted options and says it will sell more variations in the spring Maria Östblom head of womenswear design for H&M said in an email.

Macy’s (M)will have an assortment of detachable oversized collars on sweaters and t-shirts in the spring. In the fall it will also launch standalone versions of collars with lace ruffles eyelet designs and jeweled embellishments.

“[It] perfectly reflects this era of above the keyboard style” Durand Guion vice president of Macy’s Fashion said in an email to CNN Business.

ASOS said its faux collars have been selling fast since last summer. ASOS

Online fashion seller ASOS started selling fake collars last summer. On the low-end ASOS has a frill detachable collar in gingham priced at $9.50. It’s selling another dressier black oversized faux collar with frills for $17.50.

ASOS said sales have been strong and that it is adding more styles and colors to its offering.

“They’re both a sustainable and affordable way to change up an outfit and update the look promoting more longevity in items we already own” the retailer said in a statement.

What’s old is new again

Faux collars aren’t a brand new sartorial invention said Jessica Cadmus a New York-based stylist and personal shopper.

“Women were wearing detachable collars as far back as the 1930s” she said. The vintage collars then were ornate made with fur lace and beads.

And there was a utilitarian value in the detachable collar especially for menswear in the 1850s. “You didn’t have to wash the body of the shirt as often. You could simply detach and scrub both the collar and the cuffs” she said.

Etsy seller Annabel Kleyweg adds a quirky asymmetrical design to her faux collar. Annabel Kleyweg

Vogue noted the comeback of the faux collar on couture runway shows in 2020.

“We saw a few removable collars in the fall 2020 collections from brands like JW Anderson and Ganni. However colorful gingham versions from a smaller brand called La Veste have popped up on my Instagram feeds as of late” said Madeline Fass Vogue’s fashion market editor.

There are more signs the collar is gaining traction beyond the runway. As a category overall searches for detachable removable or faux collars on Etsy have surged 96% just in the last three months compared to the same period a year earlier said Isom Johnson.

Annabel Kleweg also makes detachable cuffs. Annabel Kleyweg

Annabel Kleyweg has been selling handcrafted faux collars on her Etsy shop Before7am since 2017. Her designs favor ’70s inspired rounded-and-pointed collars Tuxedo styles and the occasional quirky asymmetrical collar.

She used to describe the collars as niche products for a niche market but now expects them to go mainstream.

Since September Kleyweg said she’s noticed demand rev up for faux collars so much so that her revenue had increased three-fold since 2019. “I’m even getting interest from retailers” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNlYmVhdXRpZnVsLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYTM1NDQwMDQ2L2dpZ2ktaGFkaWQtaW5mYW50LWRhdWdodGVyLXBpbmstdmhzLXBsYXllci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a VHS Player in Gigi Hadid's Infant Daughter's Nursery,"Model Gigi Hadid has provided an ample number of sneak peeks into the nursery she intricately crafted for her infant daughter but her latest nursery reveal is quite literally a blast from the past.

As if the addition of a pink VHS player wasn't already adorable enough Hadid explained that it was her daughter's father Zayn Malik who purchased the VHS player. According to Hadid he purchased the VHS player so that their daughter will be able to watch Disney cartoons and his favorite Bollywood films.

From enrichment classes in Math to college admissions students in grades 1 through university are provided study courses that best suit their needs at multiple locations across Saigon thanks to Everest’s large network of learning centers and or online classes.



Staunch believers in intellectual curiosity as a foundation for life-long learning Tony and Don are constantly challenging learners at Everest to capitalize on their innate curiosity and fulfill it with resilience and grit. Working with online learning tools hands-on experimentation and collaboration they are determined to support and instill a can-do attitude in their students when mastering difficult assignments. We quizzed Tony about empowering students to chase their aspirations and picked his brain about the future of online learning in Vietnam. Tony and Don are constantly challenging learners at Everest to capitalize on their innate curiosity and fulfill it with resilience and grit. | Source: Everest Education

What was the initial spark that inspired you and Don to create Everest? Don and I have been fortunate enough to have access to world-class education including Harvard and Stanford Universities. Our younger brothers have even more impressive educational degrees than we do and it's all because of the sacrifices our parents made for us. Our personal mission is to bring that transformational learning experience to as many families in Vietnam as possible.



I have had extensive experience investing in and working with education businesses across the world especially in the United States and in China and along the way I realized that Vietnam has so much untapped potential in terms of creating academic learning opportunities for students. Most English Language learning centers typically provide conversational English. With Everest we're aspiring to help students tap into international quality education no matter where they are in the world by teaching a variety of academic subjects to them. Our personal mission is to bring that transformational learning experience to as many families in Vietnam as possible. | Source: Everest Education

What differentiates Everest from other educational institutions? Unlike the vast majority of after-school education providers in Vietnam Everest's focus is on serving academically ambitious students and their families. We provide a comprehensive range of courses from Mathematics to English as well as Test-Prep and College Advisory courses. We've uniquely built our reputation through a combination of offline and online offerings. There are a number of traditional offline learning centers and there are dozens of EdTech app providers but there are very few integrated providers. Because of our variety of touchpoints we have what it takes to guide students through every stage of their academic journey and ultimately help them gain acceptance into the world's top international education programs. Just last year alone our students earned a total of $12 million in scholarship money to attend some of American's top universities including the University of Southern California Harvard and Amherst College!

What Ed-Tech features has Everest adopted to help students transition from offline to online learning? Edtech tools have rapidly evolved since we began building our first software platform seven years ago. Nowadays there is a wider range of tools that you can use off-the-shelf rather than having to build everything from scratch. The Everest team has meticulously studied the power of technology and the ways in which it transforms the learning experience and efficacy from looking at examples all over the world.



Back in 2015 it made sense for us to build our own software platform that enabled personalized learning for all the students taking our classes. From there on we quickly saw that when students are given the right learning materials with the right amount of coaching and feedback at the right stage in their learning process they are able to improve tremendously and earn a sense of accomplishment that further propels their aspirations. As a result of this confidence their academic performance naturally improves. And our coaching only accelerates this transition even more. The Everest team has meticulously studied the power of technology and the ways in which it transforms the learning experience and efficacy from looking at examples all over the world. | Source: Everest Education One of the innovations we’ve implemented is blended learning -- an educational approach that combines online opportunities with traditional place-based classroom methods. In fact Michael Horn one of the founding fathers of blended learning and the author of several books on the subject such as Disrupted Class and Blended is our advisor and board member When he shared his research our team was inspired to study all the great schools and companies pioneering blended learning models and Michael introduced us to dozens of industry leaders. After visiting many of these institutions in Silicon Valley Los Angeles and New York we designed our own proprietary methodology of blended learning adapted for Vietnamese students. But perhaps the best example of how education technology has matured is the development of ClassIn. ClassIn provides so much more interactivity than any other online classroom platform out there. Thanks to ClassIn’s solutions our teachers are able to engage students in ways that Zoom or Google Meet could never do. With ClassIn we found that the emotional engagement during our classes has been extraordinary. We love how students are able to feel like they're standing right at the blackboard alongside their peers. Having those small magical moments where they can joke and play with each other is just as important as memorizing the quadratic formula for their next math test.

Based on personal observations how do students and teachers feel about online learning? When the goal is to disrupt the market there are many obvious challenges. Perhaps the biggest challenge in Vietnam for online learning is that it is overlooked and is still not as accepted as its counterpart — in-person learning. A lot of students and teachers are frustrated about their forced experiences with online learning over the past year. Many of those experiences of course were pretty terrible. We recognize that teachers had a hard time engaging their students with pre-recorded videos and online class agenda but there is so much we can do to ameliorate that.



After showing our own teachers how powerful online-learning platforms like ClassIn truly were they became much more excited about adopting the ""superpowers"" that ClassIn provides to create fun and engaging lessons for our students. To think of it I don't remember the last time we got a complaint from a teacher about teaching online. We recognize that teachers had a hard time engaging their students with pre-recorded videos and online class agenda but there is so much we can do to ameliorate that. | Source: Everest Education User behavior is always difficult to change and my guess is that we're going to need a strong case in order to show students and their parents the true effectiveness and convenience of online learning. Plus because we have entirely reimagined the learning experience online we're able to provide these engaging experiences at a much lower cost than in person as well. In many other countries we've seen how online learning has actually been even more transformative in terms of allowing students more accessibility. Students can learn at their own convenience and are given more innovative learning formats than in-person classes can offer.

Special to USA TODAY

Remember back when you had to lug around a digital single-lens reflex camera to take decent photos? Now our smartphones have cameras capable of taking gorgeous pro-quality shots.

If you know just a few hidden settings you can go even further than the defaults built into your iPhone or Android. Tap or click here for five of my favorite hidden tricks.

While you're digging into secret features I've got 10 smart iPhone tips you might not know. Tap or click to unlock some powerful iPhone shortcuts you’ll use again and again.

The new high-end iPhone models bring a new feature that can take your photos to the next level but think twice before you turn it on.

iPhone photos RAW files

You may have heard photographers talk about shooting in RAW. When you snap a photo with your phone or digital camera it is saved as an image file such as a JPEG TIFF or RAW.

A JPEG is a processed compressed image that’s ideal for everyday use. These images don’t take up much storage space and are easy to share via text email and social media.

On the other hand RAW files are huge by comparison and can eat up a ton of storage space. RAW files are just that – the raw photo data. Your camera stores the photo as it was taken without processing or compression.

Are you suffering from photo-overload? Listen to this podcast to learn the best ways to organize share and store photos.

The result is a much larger file than a JPEG but that comes with greater control. You can edit a photo's white balance color and exposure much more precisely with a RAW file.

Where RAW really shines is saving your under- or overexposed photos. Say you underexposed your subject’s face and he or she is just a shadow; there’s no saving it. If you shot in RAW you’ll most likely have enough data to bring out the details in your subject’s face.

iPhone ProRAW setting is good and bad

It wasn't long ago that the RAW image format was reserved for digital cameras. The feature came to smartphones via third-party apps more recently. In December Apple introduced its ProRAW format with iOS 14.3.

Here’s the bad news: This is only available if you have an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max. ProRAW gives you the benefits of so-called lossless imagery and works on all four of the iPhone 12 Pro’s cameras. This means that your RAW images make full use of Apple’s Smart HDR and Deep Fusion as well as night mode.

ProRAW also uses the industry-standard DNG file extension allowing you to edit photos with third-party software.

To turn it on: Go to Settings > Camera > Formats then toggle on Apple ProRAW to try it out.

A RAW icon will appear in your camera app which you can toggle on and off as you shoot.

When you close the camera app and reopen it ProRaw defaults to off. To keep it on permanently go to Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings and toggle ProRAW on.

iPhone security: These light indicators tell you when your camera or mic is in use.

Did you unbox a new iPhone 12? Here are the first 5 things to try.

Leave ProRAW turned off

RAW photos take up a ton of storage space and Apple itself puts a warning in the camera settings citing that each file is 25MB. Compare this to the standard JPEG photos on your phone that take up about 1MB of space.

You can fit hundreds of JPEG photos for each gigabyte of space on your phone but fewer than 50 RAW photos. The smallest storage capacity available for the iPhone 12 Pro is 128GB.

If you have 50GB free that’s enough room for 25000 JPEG photos at an average of 2MB each. That same space can only fit about 2000 RAW images. This may seem like a lot but remember that you can’t do much with these photos until they are edited and saved as a different file type. They are unwieldy and not easily shareable.

My recommendation? Leave ProRAW turned off until you actually need it.

Some snag the aisle; others like me choose the window.

But another consideration that will make a substantial difference in the flight experience is where you sit in the cabin.

Personally the answer is never the bulkhead. Let me explain why.

No under-seat storage

When I first posed the question on my Instagram page (follow me there) the biggest drawback I noted about the bulkhead was the lack of under-seat storage.

Bulkhead on a United 737 (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Federal rules require that anyone seated in Row 1 or in another row with a fixed wall in front of them store all their belongings in the overhead compartment during taxi takeoff and landing.

You're allowed to keep your bags at your seat once cruising but there's no dedicated storage space so your belongings will cut into your (already limited) legroom.

I'm often working during flight so I value convenient access to my backpack. Plus finding overhead bin space can be challenging especially for me since I always try to board at the end.

No space to stretch your legs

Many proponents of sitting in the bulkhead cite the advantage that no one will recline into your space.

But the flipside to that argument is that there's less space to stretch your legs. Though some cabins including American's improved ""Kodiak"" first-class on the Airbus A321 have built footwell cutouts into the bulkhead walls most airlines don't offer such passenger-friendly features.

As such your leg space is limited by the immovable wall. Sure you can perch your legs on the wall but I find that uncomfortable (and some find that socially unacceptable).

Immovable armrests and misplaced in-flight entertainment

Two of the other inconveniences with the bulkhead include the placement of the tray tables and seat-back screens.

In most economy and domestic first-class seats the tray table folds down from the seat in front of you. In the bulkhead it folds out of the armrest.

As such the table has less support and is often more flimsy than normal. It's also placed more awkwardly — closer to the stomach and lower toward the legs.

The armrest is also immovable since it holds the tray table often limiting the seat width.

Additionally if your jet is outfitted with seat-back screens you'll either find that they flip out from the center console or are fixed to the wall in front of you. Both have awkward viewing angles compared to those in regular seats.

Overcrowding

During the pandemic I'm doing as much as I can to minimize my person-to-person interactions. Of course that's nearly impossible on a plane though the bulkhead is definitely one of the more crowded spaces throughout the cabin.

You'll often find the lavatories and/or galley situated right in front of the bulkhead row meaning that lines could form for the restrooms and crew could congregate during service — right next to your seat.

When faced with the choice I prefer to sit in the last row of the domestic first-class cabin far away from the lavatories and galley. In coach I'll give myself at least a three-row buffer from the front of the plane.

Of course some people swear by Row 1 since it offers faster deplaning but I prefer waiting a few minutes once we're on the ground in exchange for a more comfortable in-flight experience.

The one case where I might choose the bulkhead

While much of the above reasoning applies to nearly every domestic flight I take the opposite is true for long-haul jaunts in premium cabins.

When flying internationally in business or first-class the bulkhead is often one of the best seats for an improved sleeping experience.

For taller passengers and/or those with large feet the footwell cutout in the bulkhead is usually substantially larger than other pods.

Of course you'll need to consider the noise and light pollution that might come from the galley during a red-eye flight.

In JetBlue's overhauled Mint cabin the carrier will offer two ""Studios"" with substantially more living space in the front row. When flying the new product I'll do all that I can to snag one of the two above-average suites even though it's located in the bulkhead.

Bottom line

The bulkhead is my least favorite seat on the plane.

With limited under-seat storage and legroom I'll typically do all that I can to avoid sitting there. Your tray table and seat-back monitor are also placed inconveniently in the front row.

Others prefer the bulkhead since there's no one reclining into them but for me the cons far outweigh the (limited) advantages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3F1aWNrZXJiZXR0ZXJ0ZWNoLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXNwYXJrcy1hbmdlci13aXRoLWhvdG1haWwtYW5kLW91dGxvb2stYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50c2FuZC1vdGhlci1zbWFsbC1idXNpbmVzcy10ZWNoLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Sparks Anger With Hotmail And Outlook Announcements…And Other Small Business Tech News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2021/02/07/microsoft-sparks-anger-with-hotmail-and-outlook-announcementsand-other-small-business-tech-news/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3F1aWNrZXJiZXR0ZXJ0ZWNoLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXNwYXJrcy1hbmdlci13aXRoLWhvdG1haWwtYW5kLW91dGxvb2stYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50c2FuZC1vdGhlci1zbWFsbC1idXNpbmVzcy10ZWNoLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L21vZGVscy1vcGVuLW5vcnRoLXJpdmVyLXJhbmNoLW5ldy1ob21lc2l0ZXMtYmFiY29jay1yYW5jaC80MzQ4MTU3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Models open in North River Ranch new homesites in Babcock Ranch,"Staff Report

Babcock Ranch is northeast of Fort Myers off Babcock Ranch Road/State Road 31.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuYXV0b3NibG9nLmNvbS90dnMtanVwaXRlci10dnMtaW50ZWxsaWdvLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZGV0YWlscy1wMzIyNTI00gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmluZGlhbmF1dG9zYmxvZy5jb20vdHZzLWp1cGl0ZXItdHZzLWludGVsbGlnby10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWRldGFpbHMtcDMyMjUyNC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TVS Jupiter Gets TVS intelliGO Technology - What is it All About?,"The TVS Jupiter comes with several features that make it an interesting buy. For example it has a large under-seat storage space external fuel filler cap iTouch start function sturdy metal body large leg space semi-digital instrument cluster 3-step adjustable rear suspension and much more. Now to make the Jupiter even a better proposition TVS Motor Company has added a new feature - TVS intelliGo. So what is this latest technological addition all about?

TVS intelliGO Technology

It is basically an automatic start/stop system that we have already seen in other two-wheelers from different brands such as Hero MotoCorp and Honda. Its primary purpose is to enhance the overall fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Thus at the end of the day TVS intelliGO is easy on your pocket and kinder to the environment.

Also Read: TVS NTorq 125 Fuel Economy Test - Can it Reach 50km/l Mark? [Video]

Looking at it from a different perspective it can also be categorised as a convenient feature. It enhances rider comfort by automatically switching off the engine when the scooter is left idle for a few seconds in situations like a traffic signal and/or other transient stops. The two-wheeler is again ready to go as soon as the throttle is twisted slightly. Thus TVS intelliGO eliminates pressing of the ignition or self-start button in the aforementioned scenarios.

TVS Jupiter with TVS intelliGO Technology

Unfortunately the new TVS intelliGO Technology is only available with the ZX disc variant of the scooter as of now. TVS Motor Company is asking nothing extra for it which is quite applaudable. So to buy the Jupiter ZX Disc with TVS intelliGO you will need to shell out INR 72347 (ex-showroom Delhi). No other changes have been implemented in the scooter.

What are your opinions about TVS intelliGO and other similar technologies that can be found in other two-wheelers? Do you think it’s an added advantage and really acts as a convenient feature or it just intervenes with the rider’s inputs? Let us know in the comment section below.

The tie-up strings back together bits of Standard Oil—broken up in 1911 in the world’s most famous trustbusting exercise. The year was 1999 and Exxon had just completed an $81bn merger with Mobil. Might history repeat itself in 2021? The world of corporate dealmaking is abuzz following reports that last year the bosses of ExxonMobil and Chevron discussed combining the two firms clobbered by covid-19 along with the rest of their industry. The talks are off apparently. But they could be rekindled. The resulting crude-pumping colossus could produce enough to meet over 7% of global oil demand.

This time though the deal would not be a show of strength especially for ExxonMobil. The company was under strain before the pandemic. Despite a $261bn capital-spending splurge between 2010 and 2019 its oil production was flat. Its net debt has ballooned from small change to $63bn in part to maintain its sacrosanct dividend which costs it $15bn annually. The company which had a market capitalisation of $410bn ten years ago—and in 2013 was the world’s most valuable listed firm—is worth less than half that now. In a symbolic blow last August it was ejected from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 92 years in the index.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZGVtZXJhcmF3YXZlcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9vaWwtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1kaXBzLWJ5LTUwMDAtYmFycmVscy1wZXItZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil production dips by 5000 barrels per day – Demerara Waves Online News- Guyana,"Guyana’s oil production from the Liza One well has dropped by about 5000 barrels per day a top sector official said Sunday.

Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat says the production has not dropped much and that ExxonMobil was trying to find the “right balance” between flaring excess gas and maximising production.

Mr. Bharrat’s disclosure of an actual figure has come days after ExxonMobil merely said that production has been reduced as a result of a damaged gas compressor which is being sent to Germany for repairs. He refuted suggestions in some quarters that the compressor was damaged due to increased production.

ExxonMobil says it does not release production figures and has referred all such queries to the government.

The only figures that that American oil company has released to date is that it is using or reinjecting at least 88 percent of the gas associated with oil production at the Liza well. Mr. Bharrat has already said that the aim is to keep flaring as close as possible to 15 million cubic metres of gas per day.

The Natural Resources Minister says Guyanese authorities will soon be able to get real-time data about oil and gas production when ExxonMobil installs its own submarine fibre optic cable.

Mr. Bharrat says this will allow ExxonMobil to feed all of its data immediately to a data room at the Ministry of Natural Resources. He says that the government will be spending US$4 million from a US$20 million World Bank-funded project to build the data centre and train personnel. A Request for Proposal he said was in the works to get a company with the expertise to install the data centre.

Currently he says all of Guyana’s oil production data is stored at ExxonMobil’s headquarters in the United States.

Stressing that “I am not playing politics” the Natural Resources Minister said the data centre for real-time transfer of production data should have been in place before ‘First Oil’ in December 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9leHhvbi1zYXlzLW9pbC1vdXRwdXQtY3V0LWJ1dC1uby1maWd1cmUtcHJvdmlkZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon says oil output cut but no figure provided,"In the wake of equipment problems on its offshore platform ExxonMobil yesterday said that it has cut oil production but it didn’t say by how much and there is no word on the volume of gas being flared which has become a major environmental issue.

Flaring is likely to go on for some time at the Liza Destiny Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) platform until an assessment and subsequent repair of the gas compressor that malfunctioned by the manufacturer in Germany.

Yesterday Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat told Stabroek News that production per day offshore remains around 115000 to 120000 barrels per day (bpd) which was at odds with what Exxon said.

“Production level has been maintained. The compressor problem has no impact on production” Bharrat told this newspaper yesterday when contacted for an update.

Asked about the timeframe for fixing the compressor problem Bharrat said “Without an assessment from SBM and ManTurbo the manufacturer in Germany we cannot say at this point”.

Asked about the daily gas flaring volume and production figure Bharrat said those numbers are given to the government every 48 hours and estimated that production was around 115000 to 120000 barrels per day.

He would later advise that he would get the exact figures for this newspaper but up to press time this was not done.

Repeated calls yesterday to the Environmental Pro-tection Agency’s acting Director Sharifah Razack’s office went unanswered.

ExxonMobil yesterday issued an update on the compressor problem six days after it occurred and after numerous media requests for information. It said that it had removed the faulty compressor from its Liza Destiny offshore platform for repairs overseas and that production levels had been cut to limit the controversial flaring of gas.

“A technical team has safely removed the 3rd stage compressor from the package enclosure on the Liza Destiny and is preparing it for transport onshore. An initial examination determined that the unit has to be sent for repairs in Germany where it is expected to arrive on February 9. The full extent of the damage will not be known until a detailed inspection of the compressor can take place at the workshop of the manufacturer MAN Turbo in Ger-many” the statement said.

“I wish to assure you that teams of experts from ExxonMobil SBM Off-shore and MAN Turbo are working diligently to fix the compressor and return it to service as quickly as possible” ExxonMobil’s Country President Alistair Routledge was quoted as saying.

“We have lowered production levels on the Liza Destiny since the compressor failed and continue to seek ways to reduce flaring. We are currently injecting or using 88 percent of the gas produced from the wells. We share a common interest in responsible management and appropriate standards for development of the country’s natural resources” he added.

ExxonMobil Guyana said that is providing daily updates to the relevant government agencies.

It is unclear if the cut in production was from levels over the 120000 barrels per day maximum capacity. Exxon’s partner Hess had told its fourth quarter Earnings Call last week that production levels had been over the 120000 barrels mark and they were looking to increase it.

After announcing only in December last year that it had rectified gas compression problems on the Liza Destiny FPSO vessel which saw the company flaring over two billion cubic feet of associated gas in 2020 ExxonMobil on January 29th said that it had begun flaring again after experiencing another issue with its compressor seal.

Unfortunate incident

“There was a technical issue regarding a seal on the gas compressor on Liza Destiny. This unfortunate incident resulted in us having to temporarily increase our flare above pilot levels in order to maintain safe operations” Exxon said in a brief statement.

From the beginning of production in December of 2019 ExxonMobil had been beset by technical problems in meeting its target of 120000 barrels of oil per day which saw large volumes of gas being flared.

The large amounts flared from its offshore operations prompted the EPA under its former Director Vincent Adams to put the company under close scrutiny. He had production rates reduced to at one time 30000 bpd and flaring of gas between 10 and 15 million cubic feet per day.

The January 29th compressor problem saw the company being flayed by Adams for continuing its maximum production. Adams who was sacked by the PPP/C government last year said that he had cautioned against allowing the maximum production rate and advised that a plan be devised to “keep stability in the reservoir.” Adams said that the company should be asked to address the problems with alacrity.

“Operating full blast is not emergency. You cannot tell me that you are producing at full capacity and call that an emergency situation. The permit specifically prohibits flaring under normal operations. So what then is happening here? Something is wrong with that whole picture” he contended.

“They should not continue producing at maximum and production should have gone to minimum to keep stability in the reservoir. If they are flaring with those production rates that is a whole lot of flaring” he added.

The Minister of Natural Resources had said that government was disappointed at the latest problem and had asked ExxonMobil to replace the defective platform seal as soon as possible.

Yesterday he reiterated that position and said that government’s own technical team was working along with the company so that the desired goal of rectifying the problem in the shortest possible time is realised. “We have our technical team working also but we have to wait on MAN Turbo and the assessment and then see how quickly this can be fixed” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbmFpcmFtZXRyaWNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L25lcmMtc2F5cy02Mi02My1vZi1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS1jb25zdW1lcnMtb24tZXN0aW1hdGVkLWJpbGxpbmcv0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9uYWlyYW1ldHJpY3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvbmVyYy1zYXlzLTYyLTYzLW9mLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LWNvbnN1bWVycy1vbi1lc3RpbWF0ZWQtYmlsbGluZy8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NERC says 62.63% of electricity consumers on estimated billing,"The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has announced that 62.63% of electric customers in Nigeria were under the estimated billing package as at September 2020.

Golfweek

Brooks Koepka is back.

The four-time major champion hadn’t won a PGA Tour title since the 2019 WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational and suffered through an injury-riddled 2020. When asked on Friday if it felt like it had been a long time since he’d claimed victory he said “I would say so. In my mind last year didn't even happen. I do know it's been a long time so I'm itching to get a W.”

Koepka scratched that itch in dramatic fashion chipping in for eagle from 98 feet at the 334-yard 17th hole. It was Koepka’s second eagle of the day and it lifted him to a come-from-behind victory on Sunday at the Waste Management Phoenix Open edging South Korea’s K.H. Lee (68) and Xander Schauffele (71) by one stroke.

“It's what I live for” Koepka said. “I live for those moments where you got to close you got to hit some quality shots quality putts. I don't know I just like showing off I guess.”

But for about 18 months he couldn’t perform like the player who won four major championships and climbed to No. 1 in the world. Koepka battled injuries to his left knee which required multiple stem-cell treatments and hip. He missed the Presidents Cup in December 2019 and needed another two-month layoff last year missing the FedEx Cup playoffs and U.S. Open to allow his injuries to heal properly.

“It was a lot worse than I probably let on” he said. “There was a period maybe for about two months where I just questioned whether I was ever going to be the same whether I was even going to be somewhat remotely the same golfer that I ever was. Those dark places a lot of tears questioning yourself and in dark places mentally. You've got to come out of that…I'll tell you what it takes a lot of effort just do get out of those places.”

Despite entering the week having missed three straight cuts for the first time in his career Koepka kept telling anyone that would listen that his game was fine. “Sometimes results aren’t everything” he said. “You know it’s coming. You can feel it.”

Koepka made birdie on his final four holes on Saturday to climb within five strokes of the lead entering the final round. He erased that deficit with a 24-foot eagle putt at the third hole and a string of three birdies in a row beginning at No. 13. Koepka who won his maiden Tour title here in 2015 collected his eighth Tour trophy signing for a 6-under 65 and 72-hole total of 19-under 265.

Former World No. 1 Jordan Spieth who has plummeted to No. 92 in the rankings and hasn’t won since the 2017 British Open shared the 54-hole lead after a sizzling 10-under 61. But his troubles off the tee continued to plague him as he ranked last in driving accuracy and pulled his tee shot into the water at the par-5 15th and par-4 17th holes. He closed with a 1-over 72 but recorded his first top-10 finish in nearly a year finishing in a share of fourth place with 53-year-old U.S. Ryder Cup captain Steve Stricker and Carlos Ortiz. Spieth emphasized the positives that he’s moving in the right direction despite his swing failing him in crunch time.

“It is far from where I want it to be as far as how it feels but boy I was debating not even playing this week dropping out on Friday afternoon last week” he said. “I felt like I was really far from where I needed to be and this golf course in general isn't a great golf course for me historically so I thought I could then go in to Pebble Beach a little fresher. Boy I'm glad I came.”

It was an equally tough final round for World No. 4 Xander Schauffele who failed to end his winless drought of more than two years. Schauffele pulled his drive into the water at 17 sealing his fate and marking the fifth time he’s held or shared the 54-hole lead without converting a victory. He recorded his 10th runner-up finish since the start of the 2017-18 season.

“Just going to try and lick my wounds. I think Brooks is a great example for me. He hasn't been in great form missed few cuts and comes out and wins” Schauffele said. “There is a reason he's knocked off a bunch of majors. That's something I'm trying to do. I need to learn from a recipe like his.”

As the leaders struggled it left the door open for someone to surge from the pack. James Hahn raced ahead by three strokes after six birdies in his first 10 holes but the wheels soon came off. He hit into the water on both of the par 5s on the back nine making four bogeys coming home and finishing 10th at 15 under.

Ortiz held the clubhouse lead at 17 under until Koepka’s heroics at 17. Koepka lifted his wedge to the sky in celebration and pumped his right fist as his eagle chip dropped in the hole.

Henry’s 2027 yards and rushing title got him 32 votes for OPOY far outpacing the next closest players Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Green Bay Packers signal-caller Aaron Rodgers both of whom got five each.

Rodgers ended up taking home the AP Most Valuable Player award for the third time in his career and while we didn’t expect Henry to take home that particular honor because it’s basically a quarterback award at this point he should have at least gotten one vote.

Instead Henry was snubbed altogether with Rodgers getting 44 votes and Mahomes and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen receiving two and four respectively.

Whatever the case may be Henry was dressed to impress on Saturday night as he rocked what many on social media called a “highlighter suit” that he pulled off quite well.

Here’s a look at the best photos from Henry’s special night.

One of the more classic ones on here but I seriously forgot that it was a Super Bowl commercial.

I think Betty as a receiver would be better out in the flat. Sending her into the middle of the field was a bad call and the quarterback set her up for failure. I'd still draft the Golden Girl for my fantasy team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL3N1cGVyLWJvd2wtY29tbWVyY2lhbHMtY29udHJvdmVyc2lhbC12aWRlb3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Super Bowl Commercials That Sparked Outrage (Videos),"GODADDY (2015)

In the ad a puppy falls off a truck and hearteningly finds its way home. The seemingly sweet commercial shocked viewers as the owner then sells the puppy. Outrage ensued forcing GoDaddy and ad agency Barton F. Graf to remake the spot dog-free.

SNICKERS (2007)

After two men accidentally kiss they respond by having to do something “manly” in this spot for the Mars candy bar. The Gay and Lesbian Anti Defamation League said the ad’s message was homophobic and a few years later it was voted the second worst Super Bowl ad of all time by Ad Age.

NATIONSWIDE’S “BOY” (2015)

This ad depicted the unrealized life of a boy who never grew up after dying in an accident. The spot sparked online debate about the inappropriateness of using tragedy to sell insurance. Nationwide’s Chief Marketing officer left the company three months later and the insurer skipped the Super Bowl the following year.

JUST FOR FEET (1999) This was considered one of the biggest “oops” commercials of all time. In the spot a group of men hunts a barefoot Kenyan runner to force shoes on him. After objectors hinted at the ad’s blatant racism the client sued its ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. The next year Just for Feet went bankrupt.

ANTI-DRUG PSA (2002)

This commercial ran shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks and uses the excuse making that’s common to narcotics use to suggest a link between drug money and terrorism.

GROUPON (2011)

Starring Timothy Hutton this spot starts by highlighting the crisis in Tibet but pivots to a pitch for Groupon hyping a deal that offered $30 worth of Tibetan food for $15 at a restaurant in Chicago. The slogan “Save the Money” prompted widespread Twitter indignation.

FEDEX (2008)

This “Wizard of Oz”-inspired commercial was banned for allegedly encouraging viewers to huff substances.

TIM TEBOW FOR FOCUS ON THE FAMILY (2010)

The NFL star and his mother starred in this ad discouraging abortion enraging many over the commercial’s pro-life message.

SKETCHERS DOG RACING (2012)

This spot for the shoemaker outraged animal lovers and was accused of promoting abuse for promoting dog racing. More than 100000 people signed a petition to get the ad pulled from from the Super Bowl but it aired any way.

SALESGENIE (2008)

Racism was the charge leveled at SalesGenie for this ad featuring a pair of animated pandas who work in a bamboo furniture store and sport hyperbolized Chinese accents. It was pulled from the airwaves following the Super Bowl.

HOLIDAY INN (1999)

Holiday Inn came under fire first by transgender advocates when it ran this ad comparing the $1 billion worth of upgrades at its hotels to gender reassignment surgery. The commercial was cut shortly after the Super Bowl.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2ZhY3QtY2hlY2svc3RvcnkvZmFjdC1jaGVjay10aGlzLWVtb3Rpb25hbC1wb3N0LWFib3V0LWEtZmFybWVyLWFuZC1oaXMtc29sZGllci1zb24taXMtbWlzbGVhZGluZy0xNzY2ODc4LTIwMjEtMDItMDfSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvZmFjdC1jaGVjay9zdG9yeS9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLXRoaXMtZW1vdGlvbmFsLXBvc3QtYWJvdXQtYS1mYXJtZXItYW5kLWhpcy1zb2xkaWVyLXNvbi1pcy1taXNsZWFkaW5nLTE3NjY4NzgtMjAyMS0wMi0wNw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact Check: This emotional post about a farmer and his soldier son is misleading,"A set of two pictures one of them showing a man embracing a young Sikh soldier is going viral on social media in the context of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. It is being claimed that soon after getting leave the soldier came to meet his father at Delhi border where he has been protesting against the farm laws for 75 days.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the pictures to misleading. The picture was taken not in Delhi but Punjab’s Ludhiana.

The claim is being widely circulated on Facebook and Twitter. Some verified Twitter handles have also shared the post. The archived version can be seen here.

AFWA investigation

We did not find any credible news report regarding the viral pictures. But with the help of some clues in the pictures AFWA ascertained that they are from Ludhiana.

The viral pictures show a board of shipping company “FedEx” behind the men and another with “PARKING BUS STAND” written on it. Though it can’t be seen clearly a closer look at the second board reveals “LUDHIANA” printed just below the words “BUS STAND”. Some other boards in Punjabi can also be seen.

Using related keywords we found that a “FedEx” outlet is indeed located near Ludhiana bus stand. AFWA reached out to the owner of this “FedEx” outlet Surinder Bansal with the help of the contact number given on the Internet.

Bansal confirmed to us that the viral pictures are from outside his shop near Ludhiana bus stand. He however could not tell us anything about the soldiers seen in the pictures.

Our Ludhiana correspondent visited the same place and clicked some pictures to authenticate the information given by Bansal. These pictures show exactly the same boards as seen in the viral photographs.

We also have a video of this location in which the board of “PARKING BUS STAND” can be seen. India Today could not verify the identity of the soldiers or the two other men seen in the viral pictures. But it is clear that they were clicked at Ludhiana and not Delhi and the accompanying post is also misleading. (With inputs from Munish Atrey in Ludhiana)"

The Hebrew word for stars includes the planets1 their satellites comets and asteroids so we can infer that the rest of the solar system was made after the earth was. This is very different from the evolutionary view of the origin of the solar system. Most scientists today think that the earth formed about the same time as the sun and everything else in the solar system—about 4.6 billion years ago. The solar system supposedly formed gradually from the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. Obviously this idea is at odds with the biblical creation narrative.

We can trace the origin of the modern theory of solar system formation to Emmanuel Swedenborg in 1734 but it was Emmanuel Kant who developed the idea in 1755. Pierre-Simon Laplace proposed a similar model in 1796. This nebular hypothesis was that the solar system began as a contracting and cooling proto-solar nebula. As the nebula contracted it flattened into a disk and most of the material fell to the center. The material in the center formed the sun and the material in the disk eventually coalesced to form the planets. Any remaining material formed the satellites of the planets asteroids and comets. The nebular hypothesis enjoyed wide support throughout the 19th century but eventually astronomers realized there was an angular momentum problem. While the sun has more than 99 percent of the mass in the solar system the planets possess more than 99 percent of the angular momentum. If the solar system formed via the nebular hypothesis the distribution of angular momentum ought to be proportional to the distribution of mass. Because of this problem astronomers abandoned the nebular hypothesis in the early 20th century.

The first replacement theory was the tidal hypothesis of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Ray Moulton in 1905. They suggested that shortly after the sun formed another star passed very close to the sun raising tidal bulges on the solar surface. The tidal bulges combined with solar prominences to eject material from the sun that produced two spiral-like arms. Much of the material in the spiral arms fell back onto the sun but some coalesced into planets. As before leftover matter formed the satellites asteroids and planets.

Nebula Once ""Proof"" for Evolutionary Views of Universe

With both the nebular and tidal hypotheses astronomers looked for confirmation elsewhere and they thought that they found it in photographs of “spiral nebulae.” The word nebula comes from the Latin word for cloud. A nebula is a cloudy indistinct luminous object in the night sky. A few were known to the ancients but many more were discovered after the invention of the telescope. The telescope also revealed that many nebulae actually were star clusters in which the individual stars are too faint to be seen with the eye alone. Many other nebulae remained indistinct from which astronomers concluded that they truly were clouds of gas in space. Today we reserve the use of the word nebula to refer to one of these and the true nebulae probably inspired Kant and Laplace in their ideas. Many of the “nebulae” appeared flattened with bulges in their centers and many sported spiral arms. This appearance certainly inspired Kant and Laplace but also Chamberlin and Moulton. In fact a century ago first drawings and later photographs of the “spiral nebulae” often were used as proof of these naturalistic theories of the solar system’s origin. I keep putting “spiral nebulae” in quotes because in 1924 Edwin Hubble showed that these were not nebulae at allt but instead were galaxies vast collections of many billions of stars that are millions of light-years away from us. Being so far away the stars in other galaxies appear very faint to us. Astronomers up to that time had failed to recognize that the “spiral nebulae” were distant galaxies similar to our Milky Way galaxy because their telescopes were not large enough to reveal any individual stars in them. However in 1924 Hubble using what was then the largest telescope in the world was able to photograph a few of the brightest individual stars in a couple of these “nebulae.” Since 1924 it has not been proper to refer to these objects as “spiral nebulae” though that term continued being used for decades afterward. It is important to note that for years astronomers used these objects as proof of the evolutionary view of the formation of the solar system though astronomers eventually were forced to abandon this proof.

There were variations on the tidal interaction theme suggested by Chamberlin and Moulton. For instance in 1918 Sir James Jeans and Sir Harold Jeffreys suggested that solar prominences were not involved and that a near miss by a passing star raised a single filament of material from the sun from which the planets and other bodies in the solar system formed. The tidal theory enjoyed broad support for much of the first half of the 20th century but by 1940 problems had developed. One problem was that any column drawn out of the sun would dissipate rather than condense. Another problem was that material drawn out with sufficient speed to account for the angular momentum of the planets (especially Jupiter) would have left the solar system entirely so the angular momentum problem remained. Consequently during the middle of the 20th century there was no agreed-upon theory for the formation of the solar system.2

Revivial of Old Nebular Hypothesis

In the 1960s astronomers began to revive a form of the old nebular hypothesis; though I suppose in an attempt to dissociate it from the original that name is not used to describe the modern version. As before the solar system supposedly formed from the collapse of a gas cloud that flattened and concentrated in its center with the sun forming from the central condensation and the planets forming from material in the disk. The modern theory borrows a term coined by Chamberlin planetesimal (from the words “planet” and “infinitesimal”). A planetesimal is a small body amalgamated from microscopic particles. Planetesimals supposedly grew within the proto-planetary disk to form bodies large enough to begin gravitationally attracting other planetesimals to form the planets. As before leftover planetesimals formed planetary satellites asteroids and comets. And as before the angular momentum problem remained. The most common explanation for that problem now is that magnetic effects removed angular momentum from the inner part of the nebula and transferred it to the outer portions of the nebula in the form of spiral arms or through jets extending fore and aft out of the disks.

The modern nebular hypothesis has other problems as well. What causes the microscopic bits of matter to coalesce into planetesimals? Gravity will work only when planetesimals have grown to kilometer size. Various mechanisms have been proposed to get the planetesimals up to that size. One mechanism is that static electricity attracted particles together. Another is that sticky organic goo coated microscopic dust particles so that they stuck together when they happened to touch. Another idea is that gaseous molecules in space froze onto solid particles. Of course none of this is actually observed but astronomers generally assume that it must have happened somehow or else how did those planets get here? Another problem is what caused the gas cloud to contract to begin with. This is the long-standing problem of star formation in general. One might answer that gravity drove the process. Gas clouds do have gravity but they also possess gas pressure and that pressure very effectively counteracts gravity. Early in the 20th century Jeans showed that if a gas cloud is contracted down to a certain size gravity can take over to complete the process. The problem is that all gas clouds that we see are far larger than Jean’s length. Compression or cooling is needed to further contract the gas cloud so that gravity could complete the process. Some astronomers have suggested cooling from dust particles but astronomers do not think that dust is primordial. Where did dust come from? This theory requires that several generations of stars must first create dust before stars could form by this mechanism. One might suppose that a gas cloud could get a sort of jump-start by an outside agent that compresses the cloud. For instance a shock front from the explosion of a nearby supernova or associations of hot stars with strong UV radiation and stellar winds might do this but this does not tell us where stars ultimately came from because it requires that at least one star first exist. All theories of pre-stellar collapse of gas clouds suffer from this chicken-and-egg problem — stars must first exist to produce stars.

Modern Theory of Solar System Formation

The modern theory of solar system formation has been refined with the addition of magnetic fields. If a gas cloud contained any magnetic field initially the magnetic field would intensify as the cloud contracted. And as the cloud contracted it would have heated and ionized some of the gas. This produces plasma. In the swirling environment of the contracting cloud models suggest that electromagnetic effects propel material outward in the two directions along the axis perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Astronomers call this bi-polar flow a phenomenon found in some stars and in many galaxies and quasars. In more recent years astronomers have created computer simulations supposedly to show how the solar system might have formed. One might question if the success of the simulation merely proves that the programmer was especially good at writing a program to produce the intended outcome.

In addition to improved models since the early 1970s astronomers have made much progress in the development of technology such as in the infrared (IR) part of the spectrum and the superb clarity of telescopes in space. These have resulted in observations of objects that astronomers generally think are stars and solar systems in the process of forming. For instance in 1995 the Hubble Space Telescope took the stunning “Pillars of Creation” photograph of a dark dust and gas region in the Eagle Nebula that astronomers think is the site of active star formation. Orion is a region where astronomers think new stars are forming or recently formed. In this region astronomers have used IR telescopes to detect star-like sources embedded in clouds of dust and gas which are regions where they think stars likely form. Astronomers have observed bipolar flows from stars or star-like objects in environments supposedly conducive for star formation suggesting that these are stars that have nearly formed or very recently formed. Some stars have IR excess that suggest that they are surrounded by dust. The star β Pictoris was the first star discovered to have what appears to be a disk of dust surrounding it. This was interpreted as a protoplanetary disk that may yet condense into planets. More recently astronomers have found disks of material around other stars that astronomers think are very young. All of these sorts of things have been put forth as proof of the prevailing theory of solar system formation.

But is this proof? The process of solar system formation is supposedly a very slow one progressing far too slowly for us to witness any real change even in many human lifetimes. So these data all amount to sorts of snapshots of various stars and other astronomical bodies supposedly in various stages of the process of stellar and planetary formation but with no real evidence that these objects are actually undergoing the alleged processes. Rather these snapshots are interpreted in terms of the ruling paradigm of solar system formation and then they are offered up as proof of that paradigm. This amounts to circular reasoning which is no proof at all. Remember that a century ago astronomers used the photographs of “spiral nebulae” as proof of the then-prevailing ideas of solar system formation. At the time nearly everyone was convinced of the correctness of this view but later observations proved otherwise. The supposedly iron-clad proof of solar system formation today could be interpreted very differently in just a few years. In fact the history of science strongly suggests that the current paradigm of solar system formation eventually will be discarded.

Star Formation Today?

Do stars form today? Biblically we do not have a clear answer. Some recent creationists think that since Genesis 1 records that God made the stars on day 4 no more stars are being made. But Genesis 1 also tells us that God made horses on day 6 but new horses are born every day. While no one has never observed the formation of new stars there is no reason why stars could not form today (e.g. it would not be inconsistent with a biblical worldview). The question is whether the star formation rate today is nearly great enough as required by the evolutionary paradigm.

In the 1990s astronomers first discovered planets orbiting other stars. Since then the number of extra-solar planets has grown tremendously. This has shown that planets must be common in the universe and hence planetary system formation must be common in the universe today. However this conclusion stems entirely from an evolutionary worldview. That is the assumption is made that planetary systems can arise only through natural means apart from a Creator. Therefore if planetary systems are common then all of them must have come about through evolutionary processes. Since planetary systems are common planetary formation must be simple and straightforward which proves that our solar system must have formed through such a process. Therefore the solar system formed pretty much the way astronomers think that it did. Of course this is circular reasoning and no such inference of naturalism legitimately can be drawn. A creationist could just as easily state that since all things were made by God then anything that exists was made by Him. Since so many other planetary systems exist then God must have made them all just as He made our solar system. Therefore this proves creation. Of course evolutionists would violently disagree with this conclusion for it disagrees with their starting premise of naturalism. This illustrates that the data alone do not allow for a definite conclusion about the ultimate origin of planetary systems including our own.

The purpose of looking for extra-solar planets is to show how common planets are and how typical our solar system is. But is our solar system common? The evidence thus far suggests otherwise. In our solar system the large gas giant planets are far from the sun and the small rocky planets are close to the sun. Planetary scientists have developed models of how this might have happened and those theories indicate that the large gas giant planets ought to be far from the sun as is the case in the solar system. But extra-solar planets tend to be very large and very close to their parent stars3 the opposite of the situation in the solar system and contrary to the prevailing theories of planetary formation. Scientists have concocted multiple encounters of planets (again using computer simulations) to show how extra-solar planets might have formed far from their stars but then migrated inward. Evolutionists must devise these explanations because the observations defy their theories.

Planet Formation: Evolution vs. Revelation

Evolutionary ideas of planetary formation are fraught with problems. Man’s ideas about the origin of the solar system have changed and they will continue to change. However the Word of God does not change. While the Bible does not tell us much about how the solar system came into being it does give us some information about when the earth and the rest of the solar system came into existence. The Christian has confidence that what God has revealed to us is true so we ought to compare man’s ideas to the revealed truth. The current thinking of solar system formation disagrees with the Genesis creation account so we know that it is not correct.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcnJpY2suY29tL0VuZ2xpc2gvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWRldGFpbHMvMjAyMS9sb3Vsby1nb3Vua290by1iZWF0cy1ndWlkYW5jZS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loulo-Gounkoto Beats Guidance Plans to Replace Depleted Reserves,"All amounts expressed in US dollars

Loulo gold mine Mali – Barrick Gold Corporation’s Loulo-Gounkoto mine complex delivered production of 680215 ounces of gold in 2020 exceeding its full year guidance despite Covid-19 and other challenges1.

Underground at Loulo.

At the same time it improved its safety performance reducing its Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate2 by more than half compared to 2019 and achieving a Lost Time Injury Free year in its underground operations. The complex retained its ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 health safety and environmental certifications.

The underground operations have reached a world-class level of automation hard on the heels of pace-setter Kibali. The two existing underground mines Yalea and Gara will shortly be joined by a third when Gounkoto underground delivers its first ore tonnes planned for the second quarter of this year.

In another major technological advance Loulo commissioned Barrick’s first solar power plant in the Africa and Middle East region delivering 20MW of capacity into the microgrid. Projects scheduled for completion in 2021 include the commissioning of a water treatment plant an expansion of power generating capacity and a powerline upgrade to support the new Gounkoto underground mine.

The complex continued to support and develop local businesses spending more than $375 million with local contractors and suppliers in 2020. Its accelerator program designed to equip budding businessmen and women with commercial skills established 48 entrepreneurs and granted them credit totalling about $390000. Loulo-Gounkoto’s local content program was further improved by the formation of a transport consortium which incorporates most of its existing Malian transport providers.

In a presentation to local media and stakeholders at Loulo today Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow said that thanks to continuing successful exploration the complex’s gold reserves were now larger than they had been 15 years ago and indications were that it would once more have replaced ounces depleted by mining in 2020.

“The Loulo district lies at the heart of one of the world’s most prolific gold regions. Over the past 15 years this has delivered more world-class discoveries than any other and our extensive exploration programs are designed not only to replenish our reserves but to find our next Tier One3 mine” he said.

Loulo and Gounkoto paid and declared combined dividends of $240 million for 2020. Over the past almost 24 years Barrick and its legacy company Randgold Resources contributed $7.7 billion to Mali’s economy in the form of taxes royalties salaries and payments to local suppliers. Its annual contribution amounts to between 5% and 10% of the country’s GDP.

Mali's minister of mines Lamine Seydou Traore and a delegation from his department attended Bristow's presentation and toured the operation with the Barrick team.

On a chilly December morning in northern Arizona near the town of Page Nicole Horseherder stood beside a barbed-wire fence waiting for the smokestacks of the Navajo Generating Station to fall. The coal-fired power plant just a mile away towered against the backdrop of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and a cloudless blue sky.

As they waited Horseherder a Diné (Navajo) environmental activist and her husband Marshall Johnson spoke into a phone camera trained on the power plant. They were livestreaming the demolition on Facebook. Horseherder’s hands were nestled in the pockets of her long tan wool jacket its tassels swaying at her ankles. She and Johnson switched between English and Navajo as they spoke to the tens of thousands of people who had tuned in to watch.

The Navajo Generating Station which opened in 1974 and operated for decades before shuttering in 2019 was the largest coal-fired power plant in the Western United States. It supplied electricity to millions of customers in Arizona California and Nevada using coal from Black Mesa where Horseherder lives. As she spoke she acknowledged the economic benefits the plant had brought to the region. “But it has also had devastating impacts to the environment and to some of our most valuable elements of life such as water” she said leaning into the microphone.

The towers shifted and slowly almost gracefully began to tilt. The first smokestack began to crumble. Explosives crackled and Horseherder could feel the earth move through the soles of her boots. And then one after another they hit the ground with a thundering boom leaving a cloud of gray dust in their wake. The demolition was the culmination of years of work: Horseherder has been fighting the ravages of the coal industry for nearly two decades. In her lifetime thousands of acres of Black Mesa were destroyed for strip-mining while coal mining depleted the area’s only source of drinking water. Coal miners got sick and many residents still suffer from asthma including Horseherder’s mother and two of her daughters.

Now she’s charting a new path forward for the Diné people as the coal economy fades — a complicated quest since coal has long been an integral part of life on the nation. The industry brought high-paying jobs that sustained families for generations. Many former plant workers were there to watch the demolition that morning. “For the older folks like my dad that is where they worked” Irvin Frank Jr. the son of a former steam-pump mechanic at the plant told me. “That’s how they supported their family over time.”

Over the years Horseherder has attended public hearings and testified in front of lawmakers from the reservation to Washington D.C. advocating for an end to extractive energy economies. She’s often been the lone voice in the room — confronting not only the coal companies and private interests but also her own neighbors and tribal government. Now that the Navajo Generating Station has closed and other power plants in the region are soon to follow her vision of a more sustainable energy economy — one powered by wind and solar — is coming more clearly into view. “No matter how frustrated I get sometimes with the way tribal government works or with how hard it is sometimes to educate people and the community — still it’s the right thing to do” Horseherder told me. “And it’s a worthwhile thing to do.”

Though some states like New Mexico and Colorado have recently passed laws that together provide millions of dollars for workforce training and economic support for coal-dependent communities other states including Arizona and Nevada have not. Horseherder is demanding support directly from utilities and industry. It’s a moral imperative she says. “We’re trying to compel them to provide some kind of transition support for the Navajo Nation instead of just walking away and leaving — leaving the NGS plant and leaving the communities behind” Horseherder said.

The demolition of the Navajo Generating Station marks the decline of coal in the West. And if Horseherder is successful in her work it will also symbolize the beginning of what she calls “a just transition”: a new more equitable relationship with the energy economy — “one in which there is mutual benefit between the Navajo Nation and its partners” Horseherder said.

Black Mes a plateau that rises thousands of feet above the Painted Desert has been home to Horseherder’s people for centuries. Her parents like the generations that came before were nomadic sheepherders. On breaks from school during her childhood Horseherder would wake while it was still dark to lead her family’s sheep to water. She remembers digging in the dry sandy arroyo for a seep waiting for water to well up for the sheep to drink. When she returned home a decade later she found that the land had changed. “I discovered that the seeps had vanished” she wrote in High Country News in 2013. “The springs at all of the camps from my childhood were drying up.”

Beginning in the late 1960s the water that Horseherder’s family depended on was diverted to transport coal through a slurry line 273 miles from a mine on Black Mesa to the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nevada. At the time Peabody Energy the coal-mining company that owned the operation pumped nearly 3.3 million gallons of water a day out of the Navajo Aquifer known as the N-aquifer. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council or NRDC an environmental nonprofit Peabody’s pumping depressurized the aquifer lowering the water table and causing the springs to dry up. Peabody disputes this. In an email to HCN a company spokesperson stated that the aquifer “is healthy and robust” something that is “well documented through decades of public and private study.” However according to the U.S. Geological Survey some of the wells on the mesa had been in decline for decades. They only stabilized in 2010 a change that one environmental researcher linked to the closure of Peabody’s slurry operation.

The aquifer was Black Mesa’s only source of drinking water in a region that in some years gets just six inches of rain. Horseherder and others who lived on the mesa including members of the Hopi Tribe whose land lies entirely within the Navajo Nation didn’t want their precious water carried away to burn coal.

For decades U.S. mining laws favored corporations and cleared the way for industry to exploit tribal lands under the guise of tribal consultation. Oil prospectors negotiated with a Navajo tribal governing body which was formed in 1923 by the Department of Interior for the express purpose of energy development on Indigenous land. Too often it was a lopsided relationship where most of the benefits of ownership flowed off the reservation. On Black Mesa in the 1960s for example a Utah lawyer named John Boyden formed an illegitimate council that did not have majority support from the Hopi Tribe. Through this “puppet council” he negotiated on behalf of the tribe and sold mineral and water leases to Peabody at exorbitantly low rates: $1.67 per acre-foot of water at a time when that water was worth far more than that. According to legal files unearthed by a University of Colorado law professor Boyden was on Peabody’s payroll at the same time he was working for the Hopi.

Many residents of the Navajo Nation still lack electricity in their homes but for decades their coal made the lights on the Las Vegas Strip visible from space. While the tribes’ water was depleted to slurry coal the energy their land produced powered the Central Arizona Project an extensive canal system which used the electricity to move water from the Colorado River down to Phoenix and Tucson. Development was booming outside the reservation but families like the Horseherders hauled water from community wells at chapter houses miles away to care for their homes and animals.

In the 1990s Vernon Masayesva a former Hopi tribal chairman and a vocal critic of Peabody’s aquifer use began hosting talks about coal’s impact on local water. He eventually formed a nonprofit called the Black Mesa Trust. It was during one of these meetings that Horseherder pieced together what had happened to the springs of her childhood. She had recently moved back to Black Mesa after completing her master’s in linguistics from the University of British Columbia. At a meeting about how to drum up awareness of the water situation a former tribal leader told her “Somebody needs to do this work and I think that person has to be you.” Horseherder didn’t hesitate.

She first consulted with elders to figure out: “OK how do we do this? How do we start this?” Later that year she and Marshall Johnson her husband founded their own organization — Tó Nizhóní Ání which means “sacred water speaks” — to halt the use of the N-aquifer for the Black Mesa coal mine. For Horseherder it also came down to protecting her children and future generations on Black Mesa. “I know outside people just have a hard time understanding that it’s home. There are just so many generations of your family that have existed there and have been living there” she told me. “Why would you leave to go do something else when the blueprint for a good life is right there?”

When Horseherder began organizing in 2001 some of the largest strip-mining operations in the United States were on Black Mesa. Horseherder and Masayesva were part of a growing resistance but they were not yet representative of a larger tribal opposition. After attending a Navajo tribal government meeting Horseherder realized that Black Mesa’s concerns weren’t registering with tribal officials in Window Rock where the government offices are located. She set out to change that.

She and her husband Johnson devised a strategy: They would visit chapter houses the local governing bodies on the Navajo Nation and present their argument. Their community’s only source of drinking water was in jeopardy and in a region with so little precipitation they wanted that water to stay in the ground.

In those early days Horseherder raised their children — at that time a baby and a tween — while Johnson traveled for his job as an ironworker. They spent mornings tuning into the Navajo-language radio station KTNN often listening outside the house and in their car “because you know how we had noisy kids back then” Horseherder said. As the announcer rattled off the schedule they would jot down the locations of that week’s chapter-house meetings which they would sometimes travel many miles to attend. They’d bring poster boards covered with information and make their case directly to the community. If the chapter houses voted to oppose Peabody’s pumping of the aquifer Horseherder could take those resolutions to the Navajo Tribal Council hoping that it would do the same.

By March of 2003 she had secured 11 resolutions from 14 of the chapter houses that were directly impacted by the coal mining. (They’d go on to secure dozens; there are 110 chapter houses on the Navajo Nation.) In June of that year the Navajo Tribal Council voted to approve the resolution formally making the nation’s position clear: The tribe wanted to cease pumping the N-aquifer for the coal slurry that powered the Mohave Generating Station. Peabody had already begun looking for alternative water sources but when the Navajo Nation formally voted against the use of the aquifer for the slurry line that cemented the deal. “The resolution changed everything” Horseherder told the Los Angeles Times. “It meant that if the mine continued using the Navajo aquifer it did so directly against the wishes and requests of the Navajo tribe.”

“Thirty years of strip-mining have devastated the land and disrupted the life of many people” Horseherder wrote in her testimony to a California Public Utility Commission at the time. “As the Chapter Resolutions show the local people are united in this position. We have to stop the groundwater pumping.”

In 2005 thanks in part to the organizing efforts of the Black Mesa Trust and Tó Nizhóní Ání the Mohave Generating Station closed. The owners facing a deadline to install expensive pollution controls could not prove to the California Public Utility Commission that they would have access to the water and coal they would need to keep the plant running. For Horseherder it was a major win. “It motivated us to keep working for the things that we knew to be true” she told me. “And that is that (this is) our homeland. And there’s no one else that’s going to protect it — except us.”

Over the years Horseherder and other Black Mesa residents mounted opposition against numerous proposals that attempted to expand or prolong the life of coal mining on Black Mesa — a second mine the Kayenta Mine was still operational carrying coal to NGS by train. She conducted her own community health surveys showing the impact of the air pollution on asthma rates near the mines and she often brought residents from Black Mesa to speak in front of the tribal council. She frequently found herself in opposition to tribal government officials who wanted to keep the mines and power plants open. At a coffee shop this fall Horseherder told me that sometimes she felt the tribal government prioritized corporations over the people. Raising her voice she said: “(They) sold the water right out from under us to some company that doesn’t give a shit about us. Once (Peabody is) done mining they’re going to leave and they don’t care.”

With NGS shuttered Horseherder is focusing on clean energy for the Navajo Nation by building support for renewable energy projects. Her organization and other grassroots groups including the Black Mesa Water Coalition and Diné CARE have pushed the Navajo Nation to develop a more progressive energy policy in recent years. “They’ve succeeded in making the conversation about transition” said Andrew Curley a Diné scholar and assistant professor at the University of Arizona who studies the relationship between coal and the Navajo Nation. “There was even reluctance about that initially. There was a perspective that coal doesn’t need to transition.”

That transition has been painful. The Navajo Generating Station and Peabody paid approximately $40 million in the 2019 fiscal year to the Navajo Nation and millions more to the Hopi. (In 2016 money from the industry accounted for nearly 80% of the tribe’s budget.) These royalties and leasing income funded essential government services like education and health care. “Everybody wants to talk in the language of economics” Curley said. But it’s more than that; people forge identities around coal. “The dynamics that are often underappreciated are the social (and) political dynamics.”

For many families it was a tragedy to see coal jobs disappear. Last August Peabody laid off its workers even though many could have transitioned to reclamation work — jobs that according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis would have kept approximately 200 people employed for at least two years at the Kayenta Mine. Others were more fortunate; the Salt River Project or SRP the company that operated the Navajo Generating Station offered to relocate all of its workers from the power plant. The company has re-hired more than 300 people at other often far-away facilities.

As Horseherder draws up the blueprints for a future where the relationship between energy economies and local communities is more equitable from the start she’s also pushing to make companies like SRP and Peabody pay. So far she’s helped secure millions for her community. NGS owners were already paying $110 million to the Navajo Nation over the next 35 years as part of an extension lease and now SRP is looking to buy up to 200 megawatts of solar sited on the Nation. The utility company Arizona Public Service has pledged $144 million for transition assistance economic development and electrification for the Navajo Nation Hopi Tribe and the communities near the Cholla Power Plant in Joseph City. If approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission the state public utilities commission it will be the largest amount pledged for an equitable transition by a utility company in the United States.

So far Peabody has proven the most difficult to deal with by far. The company has submitted a request to the Office of Surface Mining a federal regulatory agency to delay much of the reclamation work which involves returning the open coal pits to workable land until 2022 at the earliest. The company doesn’t have the best track record. In 2015 nearly a decade after it closed the Black Mesa Mine the Bureau of Indian Affairs called its reclamation work inadequate stating that some of the land had taken on “moonscape surface features” due to poor topsoiling and backfilling. Horseherder also fears what could happen to reclamation if the coal-mining company goes into bankruptcy — a likely possibility since Peabody announced in November that it would have trouble meeting financial obligations. For more than a year now rolling mounds of coal have sat at the Kayenta Mine in open pits spanning thousands of acres across Black Mesa.

Over the years the company has chosen not to work with organizers like Horseherder. “They’ll never reach out and say ‘You know we hear your concerns. Can we come to some kind of reasonable agreement?’ ” she told me over the phone this fall. Horseherder who maintains a calm and measured manner in all conversations seemed to be holding back tears. “They won’t even suggest dialogue.”

Peabody still hasn’t filed a significant permit revision as is required by law after the mine’s closure. Horseherder has been urging the tribal government to demand this revision because it would trigger a full environmental impact statement opening reclamation to public comment and bringing transparency to the process. “This really is the last opportunity for the tribes to have a say in what reclamation looks like” said Eric Frankowski the executive director of the Western Clean Energy Campaign which works with Horseherder. It’s also the final chance to review the damages to the N-aquifer and fight for reclamation of the groundwater. Frankowski said “If the permit is renewed and rubber-stamped as is it lasts for another five years.” Peabody maintains that it will resume reclamation work once pandemic-related restrictions are lifted and that it remains “committed to restoring the land as a vital part of the mining process.”

About two hours from Horseherder’s home on Black Mesa just outside the town of Kayenta a new future is beginning to take shape. There the tribe’s first solar facility supplies energy to 36000 homes on the Navajo Nation. The Kayenta Solar Plant was built in 2016. From the road the solar panels are arranged in rows like a vineyard blending in with the sandstone mesa behind them. The project is relatively small; it provides approximately 55 megawatts of solar energy compared to the 2200 megawatts-capacity produced by the Navajo Generating Station. Still it’s one example of a growing effort by the tribal government to bring renewables to the nation. Navajo President Jonathan Nez has been increasingly vocal about steering the nation toward clean energy. “For the many who have called upon our Nation’s leaders to transition away from our overdependence on fossil fuels” Nez wrote in 2019 in what’s now known as the Sunrise Proclamation. “The Navajo Nation will strive for a balanced energy portfolio and will pursue and prioritize clean renewable energy development for the long-term benefit of the Navajo People and our communities.”

Horseherder’s work securing transition assistance and obligations for new energy contracts could help Diné entrepreneurs get the investments and infrastructure they need to be successful in this energy future. Brett Isaac for example grew up near Kayenta in an area called Baby Rocks. In 2018 he co-founded a company called Navajo Power. He’s developing a 750-megawatt project but unlike the coal companies of the past he’s working with the community building out infrastructure that ultimately benefits Navajo. Eighty percent of his company’s profits will go toward community benefits and investment in new projects. Black Mesa resident Wahleah Johns started Native Renewables a nonprofit. She builds off-grid solar projects and leads workforce training programs including for some former coal miners. “We see off-grid solar as a solution to making home stronger” she said. “When a family member can manage their energy load and own their power that’s part of the self-determination and self-reliance that we are trying to attain as a nation and as a people.”

Curley who has studied past energy transitions is cautiously optimistic but worries about the existing dynamics around extraction and exploitation. “We were part of an energy economy for 50 years. (Coal) transitioned out and we were left with all of its costs. … How do we prevent that from happening again regardless of the technologies involved whether that be solar or wind?” he said. If “we’re selling (energy) to Phoenix and Tucson and suddenly there’s something else that comes on the horizon and they don’t want our wind anymore (and) they don’t want our solar who is going to be left to clean up the cost? Again it’s going to be us to bear the cost of the transition.

“Energy is a dangerous game to get into” Curley continued. “If you do clean energy in a colonial setting you’re still in a colonial setting.” Horseherder agrees: A new energy economy must be structured differently than the relationships of the past. That’s the whole point: “We want to make sure that there’s clear guidelines as to how to operate projects on the reservation especially for outside entities but also for inside Navajo developers” she said.

As the December demolition live-streamed over Horseherder’s cell phone Diné teachers made their students watch the smokestacks fall from afar. As the towers disappeared into a pile of dust people cheered and those in cars honked their horns. Others teared up. “A lot of people that were here this morning to watch this demolition are expressing their sadness to see it go” Horseherder told her audience. “But in addition there are a lot of people here who are looking forward to a renewal of the economy and a renewal of a way of life that doesn’t rely on this coal industrial complex.”

The COVID-19 pandemic was still raging and the Navajo Nation was closed to visitors. Still hundreds of people gathered to witness the demolition in person. Sam Minkler a Diné photographer and associate professor at Northern Arizona University drove up from Flagstaff to document what he called “the end of coal.” For him it was the beginning of a new chapter — one that could be more sustainable for the people and the planet. He like Horseherder thinks renewable energy should come next.

“The sun is very powerful” he said. “It runs the earth.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3RoZWZlZGVyYWwuY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2lmLXRoZS11bml0LWhhcy10aGUtY2FwYWNpdHktdG8tZ2VuZXJhdGUtbW9yZS10aGFuLTEwa3ctZW5lcmd5LXRoZW4taXQtd2lsbC1oYXZlLXRvLXJ1bi1vbi1ncm9zcy1tZXRlcmluZy1hbmQtbm90LW5ldC1tZXRlcmluZy_SAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVmZWRlcmFsLmNvbS9hbXAvYW5hbHlzaXMvaWYtdGhlLXVuaXQtaGFzLXRoZS1jYXBhY2l0eS10by1nZW5lcmF0ZS1tb3JlLXRoYW4tMTBrdy1lbmVyZ3ktdGhlbi1pdC13aWxsLWhhdmUtdG8tcnVuLW9uLWdyb3NzLW1ldGVyaW5nLWFuZC1ub3QtbmV0LW1ldGVyaW5nLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to install a solar rooftop? Read this first,"Sameer Danve is a young engineer from Latur in Maharashtra. Two years ago he decided to become a solar entrepreneur instead of taking up a job with a meagre salary that couldn’t even cover his graduation fees for years. Today Sameer installs rooftop solar plants for household and commercial consumers and also provides jobs to 10 people. But he may have to shut shop because a recent Power Ministry notification makes it compulsory for every rooftop solar unit above 10 kw capacity to move to gross metering.

Why is gross metering rule bad for you?

The Ministry of Power notification glorifies an electricity consumer as a “prosumer” (a consumer who is also a producer) and encourages him to set up rooftop power generation unit but on one condition: If the unit has the capacity to generate more than 10kw energy then it will have to run on gross metering and not net metering.

Net metering: It is an arrangement in which electricity exports are adjusted against imports directly lowering the final electricity bills of the prosumers such that electricity produced is deducted from the total electricity consumed over a fixed period of time.

For example: Suppose your rooftop solar unit generates 100 units (100 kW) a day but you use only 60 kW. So under net metering system you could send the remaining 40 kW to the DISCOM (power distribution company) during the day time when the sun shines bright and get the same electricity back at night (free of cost).

Gross metering: Now the government wants prosumers generating above 10 kw solar electricity to move to gross metering. So now you have to sell the entire 100 units to the DISCOM at a fixed rate (about ₹ 3.50) and buy back at a price which could be double or even triple of what you sold for.

“A prosumer who invests lakhs of rupees installing the solar unit on the terrace is now expected to sell the energy to the DISCOM for a low price and buys back the same at three times the price. Why would anyone install a solar rooftop?” asks Abhijeet Shukla founder and CEO of Mega Power a solar entrepreneur based in Nagpur.

Why do people install solar rooftop?

It is definitely a clean and green source of energy besides it is economically viable thanks to constantly falling prices of solar photovoltaic cells (solar panels).

Solar units above 10 kW capacity are mostly installed by small scale and medium scale industries. “Installing solar rooftop helps a businessman increase profitability by saving on electricity bills. The cost of solar installation is recovered in 3-4 years. However the proposed gross metering system takes away that cost advantage” adds Shukla.

Any industry buys electricity for about ₹ 8 per unit from the local DISCOM. By putting up solar panels on the roof the cost comes down to ₹ 2 per unit. After the initial 3-4 years the electricity is practically free for the next 20 years or so. So it is logical for any small or medium scale enterprise to install a solar rooftop and save money.

“In Maharashtra small solar entrepreneurs employ about 25000 people. The Union Power Ministry notification will leave all of them jobless” said an official with the Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA).

The Modi government has set a target to develop 100GW solar energy capacity by 2022. Ground mounting solar set up (60GW) and rooftop (40GW) are together expected to help fulfill India’s commitment of cutting down carbon emission under the Paris Climate Change Agreement of 2015. Ground mounting units include huge solar parks for example the 30000 MW capacity park inaugurated by the Prime Minister in Kutch recently.

“Solar parks are backed by big corporates and their big money. So completing the 60GW large scale projects may still be possible. However the 40GW rooftop target can be fulfilled only by small solar entrepreneurs. The new notification will kill these entrepreneurs’ businesses” said Manish Bagadia Managing Director of Grace Renewable Energy Private Ltd in Ahmedabad.

Notably of the 40GW rooftop target our country has been able to achieve only about 3GW capacity development target till the end of 2020. So there is a lot more to be done.

Why does the government want to kill solar rooftop business?

Firstly to save power distribution companies and secondly to benefit big corporates.

Theory 1:

“In any given location solar installations are allowed up to 70% of the transformer capacity. So if 70% energy requirement of Delhi is generated through solar then the 70% operational cost of maintaining the transformer during the peak period (when sun is shining bright) becomes the operational loss of the DISCOM. Therefore I see gross metering notification as an attempt to save DISCOMS which will find it difficult to survive if industries go whole hog with solar installations” said Shukla.

“We know DISCOMS across the country are in bad financial health because of mismanagement. Their losses are mounting each year. Their power purchase rate (PPR) from NTPC or Tata Adani etc too keeps increasing every year. The government wants to save DISCOMS but why do so at the cost of solar entrepreneurs and the honest tax-paying citizens?” asked Bagadia who said the Confederation of India Industries (CII) and the National Solar Federation of India (NSFI) have already taken up with the matter with the Union Power Ministry.

“Today I employ 200 people directly or indirectly. If the 10kw restriction happens my staff will be cut to 10. Across Gujarat lakhs of youngsters will become jobless” said Bagadia.

Theory 2:

Big corporates have made huge investments in the solar businesses. Adani Solar (Mundra Solar PV Ltd.) has a 2GW cell and module expansion at its manufacturing facility in Mundra in Gujarat. It will make Adani Solar India’s largest and most technologically advanced player with a total capacity of 3.5 GW of high efficiency cells and modules.

A state like Gujarat which is leading India’s solar revolution has about 600 registered solar vendors and about 400 unregistered ones. “These small entrepreneurs have the potential to fulfill India’s target of achieving 40GW rooftop solar installations in the coming years. But if that happens who will our Adanis and Tatas and Ambanis sell their solar power to?” said an official.

Vinod Shirsat General Manager (solar) Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) said “Maharashtra has a target to set up 2000 MW solar capacity of which we have fulfilled only 350 MW so far. So gross metering will be introduced only after our target is met. Solar entrepreneurs need not worry now.” However the Union Power Ministry notification makes it mandatory for all states to ratify the decision by June this year. It remains to be seen how different states respond to the Centre’s diktat or the solar entrepreneurs succeed in pressurizing the government to withdraw the notification.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzA3L3doeS1zb21lLXNjaWVudGlzdHMtYmVsaWV2ZS1saWZlLW1heS1oYXZlLXN0YXJ0ZWQtb24tbWFycy1iZWZvcmUtbWlncmF0aW5nLXRvLWVhcnRoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why some scientists believe life may have started on Mars,"On February 18 NASA's Perseverance rover will parachute through thin Martian air marking a new era in red planet exploration. Landing on the Jezero Crater which is located north of the Martian equator will be no easy feat. Only about 40 percent of the missions ever sent to Mars succeed according to NASA. If it does Perseverance could drastically change the way we think about extraterrestrial life. That's because scientists believe Jezero a 28 mile-wide impact crater that used to be a lake is an ideal place to look for evidence of ancient microbial life on Mars.

Once it lands Perseverance will collect and store Martian rock and soil samples which will eventually be returned to Earth. This is known as a ""sample-return mission"" an extremely rare type of space exploration mission due to its expense. (Indeed there has never been a sample return mission from another planet.) And once Martian soil is returned to Earth in a decade scientists will set about studying the material to figure out if there was ever ancient life on Mars.

Yet some scientists believe that these samples could answer an even bigger question: Did life on Earth originate on Mars?

Though the idea that life started on Mars before migrating on Earth sounds like some far-fetched sci-fi premise many renowned scientists take the theory seriously. The general idea of life starting elsewhere in space before migrating here has a name too: Panspermia. It's the hypothesis that life exists elsewhere in the universe and is distributed by asteroids and other space debris.

To be clear the notion of life on Earth originating on Mars isn't a dominant theory in the scientific community but it does appear to be catching on. And scientists like Gary Ruvkun a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School say that it does sound ""obvious in a way.""

The evidence starts with how space debris moved around in the young solar system. Indeed we have evidence of an exchange of rocks from Mars to Earth. Martian meteorites have been found in Antarctica and across the world — an estimated 159 according to the International Meteorite Collectors Association.

""You can assign them to Mars based on the gaseous inclusions that they have that are sort of the equivalent of the gases that were shown by the Viking spacecraft"" to exist in Mars' atmosphere Ruvkun said. In other words small bubbles of air in these rocks reveal that they were forged in the Martian air. ""So there is exchange between Mars and Earth — probably more often going from Mars to Earth because it goes 'downhill' going to Mars is 'uphill' gravitationally-speaking.""

But for Ruvkun whose area of expertise is genomics it's the timing of cellular life that he believes makes a strong case that life on Earth came from somewhere else — perhaps Mars or perhaps Mars vis-a-vis another planet.

Ruvkun noted that our genomes reveal the history of life and provide clues about the ancestors that preceded us by millions or even billions of years. ""In our genomes you can kind of see the history right?"" he said. ""There's the RNA world that predated the DNA world and it's very well supported by all kinds of current biology; so we know the steps that evolution took in order to get to where we are now.""

Thanks to the advancement of genomics the understanding of LUCA (the Last Universal Common Ancestor) — meaning the organism from which all life on Earth evolved from — has greatly advanced. By studying the genetics of all organisms on Earth scientists have a very good sense of what the single-celled ancestor of every living thing (on Earth) looked like. They also know the timeline: all modern life forms descend from a single-celled organism that lived about 3.9 billion years ago only 200 million years after the first appearance of liquid water. In the grand scheme of the universe that's not that long.

And the last universal common ancestor was fairly complicated as far as organisms go. That leaves two possibilities Ruvkun says. ""Either evolution to full-on modern genomes is really easy or the reason you see it so fast was that we just 'caught' life it didn't actually start here."" He adds ""I like the idea that we just caught it and that's why it's so fast but I'm an outlier.""

If that's the case then Erik Asphaug is a professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona is also an outlier. Asphaug said that what we know about the oldest rocks on Earth — which have chemical evidence of carbon isotopes tracing back to nearly 4 billion years ago — tell us that life started ""started forming on Earth almost as soon as it was possible for it to happen.""

If that's the case it makes for an interesting precedent. ""Let's say you expect life to be flourishing whenever a planet cools down to the point where it can start to have liquid water"" Asphaug said. ""But just looking at our own solar system what planet was likely to be habitable first? Almost certainly Mars.""

This is because Asphaug said Mars formed before Earth did. Early in Martian history when Mars was cooling down Mars would have had a ""hospitable"" environment before Earth.

""If life was going to start anywhere it might start first on Mars"" Asphaug said. ""We don't know what the requirement is — you know if it required something super special like the existence of a moon or some factors that are unique to the Earth — but just in terms of what place had liquid water first that would have been Mars.""

An intriguing and convincing piece of evidence relates to how material moved between the two neighboring planets. Indeed the further you go back in time the bigger the collisions of rocks between Mars and Earth Asphaug said. These impact events could have been huge ""mountain-sized blocks of Mars"" that were launched into space. Such massive asteroids could serve as a home for a hardy microorganism.

""When you collide back into a planet some fraction of that mountain-sized mass is going to survive as debris on the surface"" he said. ""It's taken a while for modeling to show that you can have a relatively intact survival of what we call 'ballistic panspermia' — firing a bullet into one planet knocking bits off and having it end up on another planet. But it's feasible we think it happens and the trajectory would tend to go from Mars to the Earth much more likely than from Earth to Mars.""

Asphaug added that surviving the trip given the mass of the vehicle for the microorganisms wouldn't be a problem — and neither would surviving on a new hospitable planet.

""Any early life form would be resistant to what's going on at the tail end of planet formation"" he said. ""Any organism that's going to be existing has to be used to the horrific bombardment of impacts even apart from this swapping from planet to planet.""

In other words early microbial life would have been fine with harsh environments and long periods of dormancy.

Harvard professor Avi Loeb told Salon via email that one of the Martian rocks found on Earth ALH 84001 ""was not heated along its journey to more than 40 degrees Celsius and could have carried life.""

All three scientists believe that Perseverance might be able to add credibility to the theory of panspermia.

""If you were to go and find remnants of life on Mars which we hope to do with Perseverance rover and these other Martian adventures I would be personally surprised if they were not connected at the hip to terrestrial life"" Asphaug said.

Ruvkun said he hopes to be one of the scientists to look for DNA when the sample from Mars hopefully eventually returns.

""Launching something from Mars is a seriously difficult thing"" he said.

But what would this mean for human beings and our existential understanding of who we are and where we came from?

""In that case we might all be Martians"" Loeb said. He joked that the self-help book ""Men are from Mars Women are from Venus"" may have been more right than we know.

Or perhaps as Ruvkun believes we're from a different solar system and life is just scattering across the universe.

""To me the idea that it all started on Earth and every single solar system has their own little evolution of life happening and they're all independent — it just seems kind of dumb"" Ruvkun said. ""It's so much more explanatory to say 'no it's spreading it's spreading all across the universe and we caught it too it didn't start here"" he added. ""And in this moment during the pandemic — what a great moment to pitch the idea. Maybe people will finally believe it."""

One of the lawmakers freshman GOP Sen. Jerry Cirino last week cosponsored Senate Bill 44 legislation that would eradicate subsidies that would have been paid by electric customers across the state for the plants now owned by a privately held company called Energy Harbor.

The plants one of which is in Cirino’s district were operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. when the bill known as HB6 was approved in July 2019 and quickly signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.

Messages were left Friday with Energy Harbor spokespersons seeking comment about the company’s plans.

“I believe there is extremely broad support for Senate Bill 44 in the Legislature and broad external support as well” said Cirino who added that recent discussions with Energy Harbor officials lead him to believe they will not find any problems with SB44.

Rep. Bill Seitz a Cincinnati Republican who was a key player in pushing HB6 through the Legislature said an Energy Harbor lobbyist told him in December that the company would like the option to decline the subsidies.

Both Seitz and Cirino said Energy Harbor officials were concerned that accepting subsidies would put the company at a disadvantage competing with non-subsidized suppliers given priority on pricing in the 13-state PJM energy markets where electricity is bought and sold.

“You don’t have to be a genius to come up with some logical reasons for this” Seitz said.

Seitz also said early actions by the new administration of Democratic President Joe Biden taking aim at other energy sectors such as rescinding a permit for construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline project may have caught Energy Harbor’s attention because they could foster renewed interest in nuclear power.

Cirino signed on as a co-sponsor of SB44 after years of unflagging support to keep the Perry plant in Lake County and the Davis-Besse plant in Ottawa County open. He served four years as a Lake County commissioner before being elected to the Senate in November.

“This is part of an overall resolution a win-win for everybody” Cirino said during an interview Friday. “We have every reason to believe the plants will remain viable and continue to employ people and pay taxes communities have relied on.”

HB6 critics have questioned whether Energy Harbor needs financial help to keep the plants operating after buying back $800 million of company shares last year. Energy Harbor officially took ownership of the plants in February 2020 in a deal struck with a FirstEnergy subsidiary in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

“It’s quite a turnaround if Energy Harbor is now telling the legislature to repeal its billion-dollar corporate welfare subsidy from Ohioans” said Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Bruce Weston in a statement. “Questions that come to mind include: Did the two nuclear plants really need the subsidy that they got from Ohioans’ state government? And were the nuclear plants really going to be closed without the subsidy?”

Former PUCO Chair Todd Snitchler now president and CEO of the Washington-based Electric Supply Association on Friday called HB6 a “shameful piece of legislation.”

“Ohioans don’t need to pay more only to support struggling plants” Snitchler said in a statement. “Competitive power markets are delivering reliable power and billions in cost savings to electric customers while significantly reducing emissions and enabling new clean energy build — without subsidies and extra ratepayer charges.”

Cirino’s bill co-sponsored with Sen. Michael Rulli a Salem Republican would leave in place an HB6 subsidy that could provide a total of $20 million a year for large-scale solar projects. None of the five solar farms that qualified for the subsidy when HB6 was passed and quickly signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine are yet operational.

The Ohio Supreme Court in late December issued a temporary stay to stop collection of subsidies for the nuclear plants and the solar installations starting in January. The court’s ruling was made in response to a lawsuit filed by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s office to prevent electric customers from across the state from having to pay for the subsidies.

Yost last week announced that his office had reached an agreement with FirstEnergy to forgo collecting revenues from its customers another of the HB6 subsidies that has roiled critics. The provision would have guaranteed that FirstEnergy’s profits would match those from 2018 a year of weather extremes in its northern Ohio service areas.

HB6 has been under intense scrutiny since U.S. Attorney David DeVillers announced on July 21 that then-House Speaker Larry Householder and four others had been arrested for their involvement in a $60 million bribery scheme secretly funded by an unidentified company that clearly was FirstEnergy. Authorities have described it as the biggest bribery scheme in state history.

The five men and a dark money group were subsequently indicted on federal racketeering charges. Householder has pleaded not guilty and awaits trial. Two political operatives have pleaded guilty to charges. The dark money group called Generation Now filed a plea agreement on Friday.

Republicans who control both legislative chambers have not been able to reach a consensus so far on repealing or replacing the measure.

Sponsor testimony on the new bill eliminating the nuclear subsidies begins Tuesday.

The hub will strengthen the integration of Europe’s power grids and increase renewable electricity production necessary for a climate-neutral Europe.

About the hub:

The energy hub will serve as an offshore power plant gathering and distributing green electricity from hundreds of wind turbines surrounding the island directly to consumers in countries surrounding the North Sea. It is the long-term ambition to be able to store green electricity on the island convert it to liquid green fuel and send it via subsea cables to Denmark and neighbouring countries.

Facts about the energy islands:

The artificial island will offer the best opportunities to expand the project for example by building a harbour and facilities for storage and conversion of green electricity from the nearby wind turbines in the sea.

The first-of-its-kind giant island will be as big as 18 football pitches (120000sq m).

A broad coalition of Danish parties have decided to establish two energy hubs and associated offshore windfarms. One as an artificial island in the North Sea and one at the Danish island Bornholm.

An energy hub serves as a hub that collects electricity from the surrounding offshore windfarms and distributes the electricity between countries connected via the electricity grid.

Furthermore the abundance of offshore wind energy can be used to produce climate-friendly fuels for shipping aviation heavy industries or heavy-duty vehicles.

The two hubs initial capacity will be 5 GW triple the current installed offshore capacity in Denmark. Later they will be expanded to provide a capacity of 12 GW in total.

Then to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ford’s initial victory at Le Mans in 1966 Ford revealed the second generation of its GT.

A very special example of that second-generation Ford GT is on the docket for GAA Classic Cars’ upcoming auction scheduled for February 25-27 in Greensboro North Carolina.





Not only is this 2017 Ford GT presented in Heritage Edition livery inspired by that on the winning 1966 GT40 Mark II driven by Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon but the car also is serial number 50 which the consignor secured as a tribute to the 50th anniversary of that victory at Le Mans.

What makes the car even more impressive is that it has been driven only 12 miles since new barely enough to even accumulate any dirt on the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires which are held in place by titanium lug nuts.

Turning those tires is a 3.5-liter Ecoboost V6 engine linked to a 7-speed paddle-shifted dual-clutch automatic transmission. Stopping the wheels from turning are Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes.

The car is equipped with Advancetrac with electronic stability control electronic active suspension damping even a push-button system that lifts the front of the car so it doesn’t scrape a curb entering or leaving your driveway.

To enhance performance the car has a speed-activated splitter a keel-deployable rear wing and an airbrake.





The interior also in the black Heritage style has a Formula 1-inspired steering wheel and carbon-fiber Sparco seats with manual recline Alcantara-wrapped bolsters and dark stainless matte-painted X-bracing. The seats have 6-point harness anchors and blue Ford Performance seat belts. A tubular-steel roll cage is integrated into the cabin body shell.

The car’s exterior not only has a No. 2 hood and door graphics like the Le Mans-winning race car but an aero-optimized design featuring exposed carbon fiber and titanium exhaust.

The vulnerabilities range from Remote Code Execution (RCE) to SQL Injection to Denial of Service (DoS) and impact the FortiProxy SSL VPN and FortiWeb Web Application Firewall (WAF) products.

Some vulnerabilities reported 2 years ago

Multiple advisories published by FortiGuard Labs this month and in January 2021 mention various critical vulnerabilities that Fortinet has been patching in their products.

Some of these vulnerabilities shown below had been previously reported in other Fortinet products but were fixed only recently in FortiProxy SSL VPN versions shown below.

Of particular note is the vulnerability CVE-2018-13381 in FortiProxy SSL VPN that can be triggered by a remote unauthenticated actor through a crafted POST request.

Due to a buffer overflow in the SSL VPN portal of FortiProxy a specially crafted POST request of large size when received by the product is capable of crashing it leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Likewise CVE-2018-13383 is interesting in that an attacker can abuse it to trigger an overflow in the VPN via JavaScript's HREF content property.

Should an attacker-crafted webpage containing the JavaScript payload be parsed by FortiProxy SSL VPN remote code execution is possible in addition to DoS.

Whereas vulnerabilities made public in January 2021 make SQL Injection RCE and DoS possible in various ways.

Vulnerabilities in FortiWeb Web Application Firewall were discovered and responsibly reported by researcher Andrey Medov at Positive Technologies.

""The most dangerous of these four vulnerabilities are the SQL Injection (CVE-2020-29015) and Buffer Overflow (CVE-2020-29016) as their exploitation does not require authorization.""

""The first allows you to obtain the hash of the system administrator account due to excessive DBMS user privileges which gives you access to the API without decrypting the hash value.""

""The second one allows arbitrary code execution. Additionally the format string vulnerability (CVE-2020-29018) also may allow code execution but its exploitation requires authorization"" says Medov in a blog post.

Additionally Meh Chang and Orange Tsai of the DEVCORE Security Research Team have been credited for responsibly reporting the flaws in FortiProxy SSL VPN.

Whereas FortiDeceptor RCE vulnerability was reported by Chua Wei Kiat.

Critical vulnerabilities rated as ""Medium""

It is worth noting many of these vulnerabilities have been rated by the NVD as having a High or Critical severity rating in accordance with CVSS 3.1 scoring guidelines.

However it is not clear why these flaws are marked as posing a medium threat in advisories published by FortiGuard Labs.

For example the blind SQL injection security flaw in FortiWeb can be exploited by an unauthenticated actor to execute arbitrary SQL queries or commands via web requests that have malicious SQL statements injected in the Authorization header.

That is possibly why it was assigned a Critical severity with a CVSS 3.1 score of 9.8 by the NVD as opposed to a Medium (6.4) score reported by Fortinet.

BleepingComputer has observed similar scoring discrepancies for other Fortinet vulnerabilities as well.

Last year as reported by BleepingComputer hackers had posted a list of almost 50000 vulnerable Fortinet VPNs with a years old Path Traversal flaw.

Some of these VPNs were in active use by governments telecoms banks and financial organizations around the world.

As a result of this list having been made public the same week another threat actor had posted plain text credentials of these 50000 VPNs on hacker forums.

Fortinet customers are therefore advised to upgrade to fixed versions of their products as soon as possible to protect against such critical vulnerabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The cancellation reported by the LA Times on Friday comes just one day after voting software company Smartmatic filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox Corporation Fox News and three Fox anchors — including Lou Dobbs — over false claims that Smartmatic technology was used to commit voter fraud.

It’s not exactly clear why Dobbs’s show was canceled. Some media analysts including CNN’s Brian Stelter say that despite his ratings Dobbs was causing trouble for Fox Business even before his lawsuit reporting that his insistence on repeating Trump’s false claims about election fraud scared off major advertisers. Fox had previously announced that it had been considering changes to its lineups after the presidential election and said Friday that the cancellation was part of its planned changes.

“As we said in October Fox News Media regularly considers programming changes and plans have been in place to launch new formats as appropriate post-election including on Fox Business — this is part of those planned changes” a Fox News Media spokesperson said in a statement. “A new 5 p.m. program will be announced in the near future.”

Given these plans for new shows and the advertiser issues the emergence of the defamation lawsuit may have accelerated considerations that were already underway.

Dobbs is still on contract with Fox News Media but the company has no plans to put him back on the air according to the New York Times. It’s unclear what if any actions Fox might take regarding its two other star anchors named in the Smartmatic lawsuit Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro.

A right-wing populist who first rose to prominence on CNN Dobbs was an early backer of the racist birtherism conspiracy theory — which falsely claimed that former President Barack Obama was not born in the US — former President Donald Trump helped popularize. Dobbs later used his Fox Business show to defend the Trump administration and to influence its trade and immigration policies. He also boosted Trump’s disinformation campaign to cast doubt on the results of the 2020 election.

This support for Trump led the former president to release a statement backing Dobbs on Friday: “Lou Dobbs is and was great. Nobody loves America more than Lou. He had a large and loyal following that will be watching closely for his next move and that following includes me.”

But that support has also placed Dobbs and his employer in legal jeopardy. Smartmatic’s lawsuit alleges that Dobbs as one of Fox Business’ leading hosts ruined the company’s future earnings by accusing it of rigging the election. For example on one episode in November Dobbs responded favorably to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani who said during an interview that Smartmatic was founded by people close to the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez “in order to fix elections.”

In a statement sent to Vox a spokesperson for Fox News Media defended the company’s editorial choices and said “We are proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend against this meritless lawsuit in court.”

CNN’s Brian Stelter described the cancellation of a show as popular as Dobbs’s show as “exceedingly rare.”

“The closest thing to it is when Fox News fired Bill O’Reilly when his secret history of sexual harassment settlements was revealed” Stelter said on Friday. “There is no sign with that with Dobbs. Instead it’s Dobbs’s extreme content that is the issue and his weakness with advertisers. Of course he was a sycophant for President Trump one of Trump’s biggest boosters on TV and now there is less use for that.”

Fox News is rebuilding post-Trump

As Vox’s Aaron Rupar has reported Fox News Media’s channels — particularly its main Fox News Channel — have struggled to pivot to a post-Trump reality. While Fox News Channel was regularly the top news network during the Trump administration that is no longer the case. As Stelter recently wrote for CNN’s Reliable Sources:

Nielsen numbers for the month of January were released on Tuesday and Fox ranked third in the three-horse cable news race for the first time since 2001. Furthermore CNN was the No. 1 channel across all of cable.

It remains to be seen whether Fox News is able to rebound from these numbers. However it has made changes to do just that — in January Fox News announced a big shake-up of daytime and primetime lineups with anchors like Martha MacCallum Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer losing their slots and being pushed to shows earlier in the day. Insiders at the network described the moves as demotions and a sign that the network was scrambling to cope with a big post-election ratings slump.

As a channel with a specialty focus Fox Business never received the same sort of viewership that Fox News Channel did. At the end of 2020 it touted its top shows as having viewership that topped 300000 (compared to Fox News’ average of 1.53 million viewers in the post-election period). But like the main Fox News Channel Fox Business was known for besting its rivals like CNBC — and there is a focus on bringing new shows to the network that can do that. For instance Larry Kudlow Trump’s top economic adviser will soon have his own Fox Business show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9tZWRpYS9sb3UtZG9iYnMtZm94LW5ld3MtbGFzdC1zaG93L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L21lZGlhL2xvdS1kb2Jicy1mb3gtbmV3cy1sYXN0LXNob3c?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analysis: The end of the road for Lou Dobbs,"CNN —

Nothing unusual happened when Lou Dobbs hosted his Fox Business show on Thursday evening. His hour was full of Fox’s usual themes about “radical Dims” (Democrats) and Big Tech “abusing their power.”

“Join us here tomorrow” he said at the end of the show. “See you then.”

But that it turned out was his final broadcast. Fox pulled the plug on Friday in a cancellation so swift that it surprised even Dobb’s detractors. A day later TV insiders are still abuzz about why it happened and what the decision augurs about Fox.

Fox isn’t answering. But it seems to be an isolated incident not a signal of a broader editorial change of direction by the company. It is certainly not the start of a shift to the center.

Instead Fox may have soured on Dobbs long ago and used the post-election period to make a change. Thursday’s $2.7 billion lawsuit by Smartmatic may have been the final straw.

Employees at Fox are privately wondering if Dobbs had some sort of falling out with Rupert or Lachlan Murdoch the father and son pair who control Fox Corporation.

The people who would know are not talking. Officially Fox simply said that Dobbs’ banishment was part of a broader programming revamp. And Dobbs declined to comment. But he spent Friday night and Saturday retweeting messages from dozens of his fans including some who criticized Fox for the change.

Tensions with management

Dobbs was once “respected as a business journalist” former Fox News executive John Huddy said in an email message. But in recent years he had been “out of control reckless and bad tempered” Huddy said articulating some of the factors that may have weighed on management’s decision.

Indeed sources currently at the network said that tensions between Dobbs and management flared several times in 2019 and 2020. In one memorable episode a husband and wife pair of pro-Trump attorneys who were regulars on Dobbs’ show suddenly seemed to be blacklisted by the network.

Dobbs employed the same sorts of insults rhetorical techniques and right-wing embellishments as Fox’s other opinion hosts but took it to an extreme. On what turned out to be his final show he called the impending Senate trial of Trump a “venal and unconstitutional impeachment farcical fraud” led by a “sinister clown” in Congress.

This winter Dobbs’ promotion of President Trump’s desperate bid to stay in power prompted legal threats from two voting technology companies Dominion and Smartmatic. In December Dobbs’ show aired a surreal fact-check segment that refuted prior claims by his own guests.

As one insider put it Dobbs’ ratings didn’t justify the headaches. While he was the highest-rated host on Fox Business the network is relatively low-rated across the board. Dobbs averaged 300000 viewers on a typical day at 5 p.m. ET. The show reached smaller audiences when it re-aired multiple times later in the day.

The insider said that Dobbs’ history of incendiary segments and his show’s weak performance with advertisers were factors in the decision.

But the same things could be said about “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and other right-wing opinion offerings.

So what does Carlson have that Dobbs doesn’t? The ear of the Murdochs for one thing. Ten times the audience for another.

Dobbs 75 was named in Smartmatic’s blockbuster lawsuit against Fox. Two other Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo were named in the suit too but their shows do not appear to be on the chopping block. Pirro confirmed on Twitter that she will be on the air Saturday night as usual.

So that suggests that Dobbs was not a sacrificial lamb for the legal gods. In any case the Smartmatic lawsuit will proceed as-is.

Dobbs’ removal was certainly swift. Fellow Fox Business host David Asman filled in for Dobbs on Friday and made no mention of the impending shakeup. He said “Lou will be back on Monday.”

Ten minutes later the Los Angeles Times broke the news that Dobbs’ show had been canceled.

Dobbs still under contract to Fox

Trump along with Dobbs’ biggest fans on social media bemoaned the decision and said they hoped Dobbs would resurface soon.

Former Trump administration official Fred Fleitz a regular on Dobbs’ show tweeted that “I hope he finds a home on another network ASAP. Good luck Lou!”

But Dobbs is still under contract with Fox and the network is opting to pay him rather than letting him leave right away. It is unclear when the contract expires but it extends for at least several more months.

Starting Monday Asman will be one of the interim hosts of the 5 p.m. hour. Jackie DeAngelis will be the other host.

Dobbs will be relegated to tweeting. On Saturday several of his tweets and retweets raised eyebrows suggesting he wasn’t in on the joke.

He shared a post from Asawin Suebsaeng a reporter for The Daily Beast who occasionally posts in Trump’s voice as an inside-joke for his followers.

Suebsaeng playing Trump wrote “Fox Business has abandoned great warrior @LouDobbs (like a dog). Cancel Culture has turned the once great net. into a wannabe MSDNC (terrible ratings no clue!). Never would have happened on Roger’s or ‘Trump’s’ for that matter watch.

* 1:50 pm EST February 6th: This piece has been updated to include an additional statement from Fox News in regards to the Smartmatic lawsuit.





Welcome to cancel culture Lou Dobbs.

On Friday The Los Angeles Times reported that Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Network was being taken off the air. It will be replaced by Fox Business Tonight and for the time being will feature alternating guest hosts starting with Jackie DeAngelis and David Asman. Trump’s former economic advisor Larry Kudlow is reportedly being considered as a permanent replacement.

According to a statement given to multiple outlets the change in programming has nothing to do with a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit filed by the election technology company Smartmatic against Dobbs and other Fox hosts. ""As we said in October FOX News Media regularly considers programming changes and plans have been in place to launch new formats as appropriate post-election including on FOX Business” said a spokesperson for Fox. “This is part of those planned changes.” But media analysts and experts are skeptical of that explanation. In a conversation with The New York Times a person familiar with the matter said that while conversations about Dobbs’ future began before the lawsuit was announced the anchor’s relentless support of Trump’s false election claims aggravated an already tense situation.

Smartmatic an election technology company alleges that the Fox Corporation along with Dobbs Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo “knowingly violated generally accepted journalistic standards” and spread disinformation that “had a direct and harmful impact on Smartmatic’s ability to conduct business in the United States and around the world now and in the future.” Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell were also named in court documents. In the nearly 300-page lawsuit Smartmatic claims that Fox’s disinformation campaign “decimated” the company’s potential for future earnings citing a potential loss in profits of over $500 million.

Evidence of Lou Dobbs’ role in spreading disinformation is scattered throughout the lawsuit. In one particularly damning passage lawyers for Smartmatic cite a tweet posted by Lou Dobbs that describes the 2020 election as a “cyber Pearl Harbor” and refers to the CEO of Smartmatic by name. The lawyers also bring up a segment from Lou Dobbs Tonight in which Dobbs spoke about “foreign intrusion and interference” in the election next to a graphic that included the name of Smartmatic’s CEO.

In responst to the lawsuit a Fox News spokesperson told Esquire “FOX News Media is committed to providing the full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear opinion. We are proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend against this meritless lawsuit in court.”

In the decade that Lou Dobbs Tonight was on the air the show attracted a large audience that included former President Trump. Speaking to The New York Times  Trump said “Lou Dobbs is and was great. Nobody loves America more than Lou. He had a large and loyal following that will be watching closely for his next move and that following includes me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vb3BpbmlvbnMvMjAyMS8yLzcvZm94LW5ld3MtaXMtdGhlLXJlcHVibGljYW4tcGFydHnSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDIxLzIvNy9mb3gtbmV3cy1pcy10aGUtcmVwdWJsaWNhbi1wYXJ0eQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox News is the Republican Party,"Trumpism will endure because Murdoch’s Fox News made that choice on behalf of the Republican Party it commands.

“To see what is in front of one’s nose” George Orwell wrote “is a constant struggle.”

Orwell’s wise timeless counsel is often lost on writers who prefer to bury the plain truth beneath a blizzard of distractions and obfuscations.

The tendency of America’s punditocracy to miss the glaring point has once again been on grating display in the still smouldering residue of the mad January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill conceived planned and executed by thousands of Donald Trump’s rabid disciples who were on cue unleashed en foaming masse by the former president.

Beyond considering Trump’s political future the punditocracy was seized with debating the existential implications of the deadly mayhem for the Republican Party.

The quick consensus was that a “reckoning” was certainly in the offing. The Republican Party confronted an “inflection point” – the media-manufactured cliché du jour – that required either finally abandoning Trumpism in the wake of the bloody insurrection or continuing to embrace it.

The assumption was that the Republican Party including its congressional leadership would make that seminal choice. But who constitutes the Republican Party and its leadership and how would they go about deciding which path to take?

These questions were largely left adrift.

If the punditocracy had bothered to look the answers were right there neon-bright in front of its nose: Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News is de facto the Republican Party Sean Hannity and berserk company on cable TV are its erstwhile leaders.

As such there was never going to be a reckoning given that Murdoch Fox News Hannity and supplicant crew are not prone to introspection of any sort at any time for any reason.

The “news” organisation that happily gives vent and succour to every despicable aspect of Trumpism was never going to renounce Trump and his confederates since that would mean renouncing itself and its odious raison d’etre.

The storming of the Capitol by a murderous mob of Confederate-flag-waving white supremacists anti-government vigilantes lunatic conspiracy theorists and Christian fanatics was the predictable even necessary denouement of a decades-long near 24/7 Fox News diet of white supremacist anti-government vigilantism lunatic conspiracy theories and Christian fanaticism.

Fox News may have gingerly distanced itself from the violence perpetrated by its radicalised viewers but it has stood steadfast by the man who offered his followers giddy rhetorical licence to exact that violence to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory.

So Trump and Trumpism will not only survive the assault on the “citadel” of American democracy but endure because Murdoch’s Fox News made that choice on behalf of the Republican Party it commands.

Understood through this prism Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s pilgrimage to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach Florida to make amends was not so much a grovelling display of sycophancy but a recognition of who runs the show – Rupert Murdoch and his wind-up marionettes on Fox News.

The 45 senators who recently voted against pursuing Trump’s impeachment know who runs the show too. Despite his censure of Trump for “provoking” the sacking of the Capitol Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell like his supine colleagues inevitably returned home to the agreeable bosom of Fox News. To do otherwise would be a politically fatal act of heresy.

The swift Fox News-led excommunication of the 10 House Republicans who voted for impeachment was a blatant reminder to McConnell et al of where power lies inside the made-by-TV Republican Party.

Indeed the 89-year-old Melbourne-born bona fide boss of the Republican Party made a rare public appearance recently to accept a bauble for “life-time achievement”.

In an acceptance speech-cum-Fox-News-manifesto Murdoch complained of course about “woke orthodoxy” and a “wave of censorship that seeks to silence conversation to stifle debate and to ultimately stop individuals and societies from realising their potential”.

Yes I agree Mr Murdoch thousands of cosplay enthusiasts and wannabe special forces recruits turned rampaging seditionists who bludgeoned a policeman to death threatened to hang the vice president and shoot House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “in the friggin’ brain” are sure signs Fox News subscribers are “realising their potential”.

Still depending upon your perspective William Randolph Hearst’s Australian twin made a commitment to his hosts or warned a Republican Party at his mercy that he was “far from done”.

What a chilling prospect.

A Washington Post columnist thinks the best way to “get the Fox News monster under control” is not to appeal to Murdoch’s “conscience” but prevail upon the network’s loyal advertisers to boycott.

“The only answer is to speak the language that the bigwigs at Fox will understand: Ratings. Advertising dollars. Profit” the columnist wrote.

This Pollyannaish prescription assumes that businesses who have advertised on Fox News throughout Trump’s pestilential presidency will suddenly develop a conscience and belatedly choose truth over lies and civic responsibility over profit.

It is a silly almost comical suggestion.

Corporate America’s canonical devotion to the bottom line has always meant being wilfully blind to injustice and intolerance at home and abroad.

I doubt even an insurrection dismissed by Hannity as the work of Antifa or trivialised by Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy as the understandable expression of a handful of “frustrated” patriots is going to dissuade much of corporate America from continuing to make lots of money by continuing to sell lots of stuff to the insurrectionists and millions of like-minded brethren who watch Fox News.

The ascendency of Trump to the presidency and the violent attempt to thwart the will of more than 81 million Americans that wanted to be rid of him were not the deeds of a loony “fringe”.

They were the consequence of the considered deliberate designs of the population of “red state America” who religiously follow Murdoch’s cavalcade of charlatans on Fox News and its surrogate the Republican Party.

But Dobbs is still under contract with Fox and the network is opting to pay him rather than letting him leave right away. It is unclear when the contract expires but it extends for at least several more months.

Starting Monday Asman will be one of the interim hosts of the 5 p.m. hour. Jackie DeAngelis will be the other host.

Dobbs will be relegated to tweeting. On Saturday several of his tweets and retweets raised eyebrows suggesting he wasn’t in on the joke.

He shared a post from Asawin Suebsaeng a reporter for The Daily Beast who occasionally posts in Trump’s voice as an inside-joke for his followers.

Suebsaeng playing Trump wrote “Fox Business has abandoned great warrior @LouDobbs (like a dog). Cancel Culture has turned the once great net. into a wannabe MSDNC (terrible ratings no clue!). Never would have happened on Roger’s or ‘Trump’s’ for that matter watch.

* 1:50 pm EST February 6th: This piece has been updated to include an additional statement from Fox News in regards to the Smartmatic lawsuit.





Welcome to cancel culture Lou Dobbs.

On Friday The Los Angeles Times reported that Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Network was being taken off the air. It will be replaced by Fox Business Tonight and for the time being will feature alternating guest hosts starting with Jackie DeAngelis and David Asman. Trump’s former economic advisor Larry Kudlow is reportedly being considered as a permanent replacement.

According to a statement given to multiple outlets the change in programming has nothing to do with a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit filed by the election technology company Smartmatic against Dobbs and other Fox hosts. ""As we said in October FOX News Media regularly considers programming changes and plans have been in place to launch new formats as appropriate post-election including on FOX Business” said a spokesperson for Fox. “This is part of those planned changes.” But media analysts and experts are skeptical of that explanation. In a conversation with The New York Times a person familiar with the matter said that while conversations about Dobbs’ future began before the lawsuit was announced the anchor’s relentless support of Trump’s false election claims aggravated an already tense situation.

Smartmatic an election technology company alleges that the Fox Corporation along with Dobbs Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo “knowingly violated generally accepted journalistic standards” and spread disinformation that “had a direct and harmful impact on Smartmatic’s ability to conduct business in the United States and around the world now and in the future.” Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell were also named in court documents. In the nearly 300-page lawsuit Smartmatic claims that Fox’s disinformation campaign “decimated” the company’s potential for future earnings citing a potential loss in profits of over $500 million.

Evidence of Lou Dobbs’ role in spreading disinformation is scattered throughout the lawsuit. In one particularly damning passage lawyers for Smartmatic cite a tweet posted by Lou Dobbs that describes the 2020 election as a “cyber Pearl Harbor” and refers to the CEO of Smartmatic by name. The lawyers also bring up a segment from Lou Dobbs Tonight in which Dobbs spoke about “foreign intrusion and interference” in the election next to a graphic that included the name of Smartmatic’s CEO.

In responst to the lawsuit a Fox News spokesperson told Esquire “FOX News Media is committed to providing the full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear opinion. We are proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend against this meritless lawsuit in court.”

In the decade that Lou Dobbs Tonight was on the air the show attracted a large audience that included former President Trump. Speaking to The New York Times  Trump said “Lou Dobbs is and was great. Nobody loves America more than Lou. He had a large and loyal following that will be watching closely for his next move and that following includes me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vb3BpbmlvbnMvMjAyMS8yLzcvZm94LW5ld3MtaXMtdGhlLXJlcHVibGljYW4tcGFydHnSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDIxLzIvNy9mb3gtbmV3cy1pcy10aGUtcmVwdWJsaWNhbi1wYXJ0eQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox News is the Republican Party,"Trumpism will endure because Murdoch’s Fox News made that choice on behalf of the Republican Party it commands.

“To see what is in front of one’s nose” George Orwell wrote “is a constant struggle.”

Orwell’s wise timeless counsel is often lost on writers who prefer to bury the plain truth beneath a blizzard of distractions and obfuscations.

The tendency of America’s punditocracy to miss the glaring point has once again been on grating display in the still smouldering residue of the mad January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill conceived planned and executed by thousands of Donald Trump’s rabid disciples who were on cue unleashed en foaming masse by the former president.

Beyond considering Trump’s political future the punditocracy was seized with debating the existential implications of the deadly mayhem for the Republican Party.

The quick consensus was that a “reckoning” was certainly in the offing. The Republican Party confronted an “inflection point” – the media-manufactured cliché du jour – that required either finally abandoning Trumpism in the wake of the bloody insurrection or continuing to embrace it.

The assumption was that the Republican Party including its congressional leadership would make that seminal choice. But who constitutes the Republican Party and its leadership and how would they go about deciding which path to take?

These questions were largely left adrift.

If the punditocracy had bothered to look the answers were right there neon-bright in front of its nose: Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News is de facto the Republican Party Sean Hannity and berserk company on cable TV are its erstwhile leaders.

As such there was never going to be a reckoning given that Murdoch Fox News Hannity and supplicant crew are not prone to introspection of any sort at any time for any reason.

The “news” organisation that happily gives vent and succour to every despicable aspect of Trumpism was never going to renounce Trump and his confederates since that would mean renouncing itself and its odious raison d’etre.

The storming of the Capitol by a murderous mob of Confederate-flag-waving white supremacists anti-government vigilantes lunatic conspiracy theorists and Christian fanatics was the predictable even necessary denouement of a decades-long near 24/7 Fox News diet of white supremacist anti-government vigilantism lunatic conspiracy theories and Christian fanaticism.

Fox News may have gingerly distanced itself from the violence perpetrated by its radicalised viewers but it has stood steadfast by the man who offered his followers giddy rhetorical licence to exact that violence to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory.

So Trump and Trumpism will not only survive the assault on the “citadel” of American democracy but endure because Murdoch’s Fox News made that choice on behalf of the Republican Party it commands.

Understood through this prism Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s pilgrimage to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach Florida to make amends was not so much a grovelling display of sycophancy but a recognition of who runs the show – Rupert Murdoch and his wind-up marionettes on Fox News.

The 45 senators who recently voted against pursuing Trump’s impeachment know who runs the show too. Despite his censure of Trump for “provoking” the sacking of the Capitol Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell like his supine colleagues inevitably returned home to the agreeable bosom of Fox News. To do otherwise would be a politically fatal act of heresy.

The swift Fox News-led excommunication of the 10 House Republicans who voted for impeachment was a blatant reminder to McConnell et al of where power lies inside the made-by-TV Republican Party.

Indeed the 89-year-old Melbourne-born bona fide boss of the Republican Party made a rare public appearance recently to accept a bauble for “life-time achievement”.

In an acceptance speech-cum-Fox-News-manifesto Murdoch complained of course about “woke orthodoxy” and a “wave of censorship that seeks to silence conversation to stifle debate and to ultimately stop individuals and societies from realising their potential”.

Yes I agree Mr Murdoch thousands of cosplay enthusiasts and wannabe special forces recruits turned rampaging seditionists who bludgeoned a policeman to death threatened to hang the vice president and shoot House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “in the friggin’ brain” are sure signs Fox News subscribers are “realising their potential”.

Still depending upon your perspective William Randolph Hearst’s Australian twin made a commitment to his hosts or warned a Republican Party at his mercy that he was “far from done”.

What a chilling prospect.

A Washington Post columnist thinks the best way to “get the Fox News monster under control” is not to appeal to Murdoch’s “conscience” but prevail upon the network’s loyal advertisers to boycott.

“The only answer is to speak the language that the bigwigs at Fox will understand: Ratings. Advertising dollars. Profit” the columnist wrote.

This Pollyannaish prescription assumes that businesses who have advertised on Fox News throughout Trump’s pestilential presidency will suddenly develop a conscience and belatedly choose truth over lies and civic responsibility over profit.

It is a silly almost comical suggestion.

Corporate America’s canonical devotion to the bottom line has always meant being wilfully blind to injustice and intolerance at home and abroad.

I doubt even an insurrection dismissed by Hannity as the work of Antifa or trivialised by Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy as the understandable expression of a handful of “frustrated” patriots is going to dissuade much of corporate America from continuing to make lots of money by continuing to sell lots of stuff to the insurrectionists and millions of like-minded brethren who watch Fox News.

The ascendency of Trump to the presidency and the violent attempt to thwart the will of more than 81 million Americans that wanted to be rid of him were not the deeds of a loony “fringe”.

They were the consequence of the considered deliberate designs of the population of “red state America” who religiously follow Murdoch’s cavalcade of charlatans on Fox News and its surrogate the Republican Party.

Before I digress slightly let me state from the outset that the book by Greg Poulgrain that I am about to review is extraordinary by any measure. The story he tells is one you will read nowhere else especially in the way he links the assassination of President Kennedy to former CIA Director Allen Dulles and the engineering by the latter of one of the 20th century’s most terrible mass murders. It will make your hair stand on end and should be read by anyone who cares about historical truth.

About twelve years ago I taught a graduate school course to Massachusetts State Troopers and police officers from various cities and towns. As part of the course material I had created a segment on the history of the United States’ foreign policy with particular emphasis on Indonesia.

No one in this class knew anything about Indonesia not even where it was. These were intelligent ambitious adults eager to learn all with college degrees. This was in the midst of the “war on terror” – i.e. war on Muslim countries – and the first year of Barack Obama’s presidency. Almost all the class had voted for Obama and were aware they he had spent some part of his youth in this unknown country somewhere far away.

I mention this as a preface to this review of JFK vs. Dulles because its subtitle is Battleground Indonesia and my suspicion is that those students’ lack of knowledge about the intertwined history of Indonesia and the U.S. is as scanty today among the general public as it was for my students a dozen years ago.

This makes Greg Poulgrain’s remarkable book – JFK vs. Allen Dulles: Battleground Indonesia – even more important since it is a powerful antidote to such ignorance and a reminder for those who have fallen purposefully or not into a state of historical amnesia that has erased the fact that the U.S. has committed systematic crimes that have resulted in the deaths of more than a million Indonesians and many more millions throughout the world over innumerable decades.

Such crimes against humanity have been hidden behind what the English playwright Harold Pinter in his 2005 Nobel Prize address called “a tapestry of lies.” Of such massive crimes he said:

But you wouldn’t know it.

It never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even while it was happening it wasn’t happening. It didn’t matter. It was of no interest. The crimes of the United States have been systematic constant vicious remorseless but very few people have actually talked about them.

And when one examines the true history of such atrocities again and again one comes up against familiar names of the guilty who have never been prosecuted. Criminals in high places whose crimes around the world from Vietnam to Chile to Cuba to Nicaragua to Argentina to Iraq to Libya to Syria etc. have been – and continue to be – integral to American foreign policy as it serves the interests of its wealthy owners and their media mouthpieces.

In his brilliant new book on U.S./Indonesian history Dr. Greg Poulgrain unweaves this tapestry of lies and sheds new light on the liars’ sordid deeds. He is an Australian expert on Indonesia whose work stretches back forty years is a professor at University of the Sunshine Coast in Brisbane and has written four highly-researched book about Indonesia.

In JFK vs. Dulles he exposes the intrigue behind the ruthless regime-change strategy in Indonesia of the longest-serving CIA director Allen Dulles and how it clashed with the policy of President John F. Kennedy leading to JFK’s assassination Indonesian regime change and massive slaughter.

Poulgrain begins with this question:

Would Allen Dulles have resorted to assassinating the President of the United States to ensure that his ‘Indonesian strategy’ rather than Kennedy’s was achieved?

To which he answers: Yes.

But let me not get ahead of myself for the long intricate tale he tells is one a reviewer can only summarize so filled is it with voluminous details. So I will touch on a few salient points and encourage people to buy and read this important book.

Indonesia’s Strategic Importance

The strategic and economic importance of Indonesia cannot be exaggerated. It is the world’s 4th most populous country (275+ million) is located in a vital shipping lane adjacent to the South China Sea has the world’s largest Muslim population has vast mineral and oil deposits and is home in West Papua to Grasberg the world’s largest gold mine and the second largest copper mine primarily owned by Freeport McMoRan of Phoenix Arizona whose past board members have included Henry Kissinger John Hay Whitney and Godfrey Rockefeller.

Long a battleground in the Cold War Indonesia remains vitally important in the New Cold War and the pivot to Asia launched by the Obama administration against China and Russia the same antagonists Allen Dulles strove to defeat through guile and violence while he engineered coups home and abroad. It is fundamentally important in the Pentagon’s Indo-Pacific strategy for what it euphemistically calls a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” While not front-page news in the U.S. these facts make Indonesia of great importance today and add to the gravity of Poulgrain’s historical account.

JFK

Two days before President John Kennedy was publicly executed by the US national security state led by the CIA on November 22 1963 he had accepted an invitation from Indonesian President Sukarno to visit that country the following spring. The aim of the visit was to end the conflict (Konfrontasi) between Indonesia and Malaysia and to continue Kennedy’s efforts to support post-colonial Indonesia with economic and developmental aid not military. It was part of his larger strategy of ending conflict throughout Southeast Asia and assisting the growth of democracy in newly liberated post-colonial countries worldwide.

He had forecast his position in a dramatic speech in 1957 when as a Massachusetts Senator he told the Senate that he supported the Algerian liberation movement and opposed colonial imperialism worldwide. The speech caused an international uproar and Kennedy was harshly attacked by Eisenhower Nixon John Foster Dulles and even liberals such as Adlai Stevenson. But he was praised throughout the third world.

Poulgrain writes:

Kennedy was aiming for a seismic shift of Cold War alignment in Southeast Asia by bringing Indonesia ‘on side.’ As Bradley Simpson stated (in 2008) ‘One would never know from reading the voluminous recent literature on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and Southeast Asia for example that until the mid-1960s most officials [in the US] still considered Indonesia of far greater importance than Vietnam or Laos.

Of course JFK never went to Indonesia in 1964 and his peaceful strategy to bring Indonesia to America’s side and to ease tensions in the Cold War was never realized thanks to Allen Dulles. And Kennedy’s proposed withdrawal from Vietnam which was premised on success in Indonesia was quickly reversed by Lyndon Johnson after JFK’s murder on November 22 1963. Soon both countries would experience mass slaughter engineered by Kennedy’s opponents in the CIA and Pentagon. Millions would die.

While the Indonesian mass slaughter of mainly poor rice farmers (members of the Communist Party – PKI) instigated by Allen Dulles began in October 1965 ten years later starting in December 1975 the American installed Indonesian dictator Suharto after meeting with Henry Kissinger and President Ford and receiving their approval would slaughter hundreds of thousands East-Timorese with American-supplied weapons in a repeat of the slaughter of more than a million Indonesians in 1965 when the CIA engineered the coup d’état that toppled President Sukarno. The American installed dictator Suharto would rule for thirty years of terror. The CIA considers this operation one of its finest accomplishments. It became known as “the Jakarta Method” a model for future violent coups throughout Latin America and the world.

And in-between these U.S. engineered mass atrocities came the bloody coup in Chile on September 11 1973 and the ongoing colossal U.S. war crimes in Vietnam Laos and Cambodia.

Dulles’s Secret

What JFK didn’t know was that his plans for a peaceful resolution of the Indonesia situation and an easing of the Cold War were threatening a covert long-standing conspiracy engineered by Allen Dulles to effect regime change in Indonesia through bloody means and to exacerbate the Cold War by concealing from Kennedy the truth that there was a Sino-Soviet split. Another primary goal behind this plan was to gain unimpeded access to the vast load of natural resources that Dulles had kept secret from Kennedy who thought Indonesia was lacking in natural resources. But Dulles knew that if Kennedy who was very popular in Indonesia visited Sukarno it would deal a death blow to his plan to oust Sukarno install a CIA replacement (Suharto) exterminate alleged communists and secure the archipelago for Rockefeller controlled oil and mining interests for whom he had fronted since the 1920s.

Reading Poulgrain’s masterful analysis one can clearly see how much of modern history is a struggle for control of the underworld where lies the fuel that runs the megamachine – oil minerals gold copper etc. Manifest ideological conflicts while garnering headlines often bury the secret of this subterranean devil’s game.

The Discovery of Gold

His murder mystery/detective story begins with a discovery that is then kept secret for many decades. He writes:

In the alpine region of Netherlands New Guinea (so named under Dutch colonial rule – today West Papua) in 1936 three Dutchmen discovered a mountainous outcrop of ore with high copper content and very high concentrations of gold. When later analyzed in the Netherlands the gold (in gram/ton) proved to be twice that of Witwatersrand in South Africa then the world’s richest gold mine but this information was not made public.

The geologist among the trio Jean Jacques Dozy worked for the Netherlands New Guinea Petroleum Company (NNGPM) ostensibly a Dutch-controlled company based in The Hague but whose controlling interest actually lay in the hands of the Rockefeller family as did the mining company Freeport Sulphur (now Freeport McMoRan one of whose Directors from 1988-95 was Henry Kissinger Dulles’ and the Rockefeller’s close associate) that began mining operations there in 1966.

It was Allen Dulles Paris-based lawyer in the employ of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil who in 1935 arranged the controlling interest in NNGPN for the Rockefellers. And it was Dulles among a select few others who because of various intervening events including WW II that made its exploitation impossible kept the secret of the gold mine for almost three decades even from President Kennedy who had worked to return the island to Indonesian control. JFK “remained uninformed of the El Dorado and once the remaining political hurdles were overcome Freeport would have unimpeded access.” Those “political hurdles” – i.e. regime change – would take a while to effect.

The Need to Assassinate President Kennedy

But first JFK would have to be eliminated for he had brokered Indonesian sovereignty over West Papua/West Irian for Sukarno from the Dutch who had ties to Freeport Sulphur. Freeport was aghast at the potential loss of “El Dorado” especially since they had recently had their world’s most advanced nickel refinery expropriated by Fidel Castro who had named Che Guevara its new manager. Freeport’s losses in Cuba made access to Indonesia even more important. Cuba and Indonesia thus were joined in the deadly game of chess between Dulles and Kennedy and someone would have to lose.

While much has been written about Cuba Kennedy and Dulles the Indonesian side of the story has been slighted. Poulgrain remedies this with an exhaustive and deeply researched exploration of these matters. He details the deviousness of the covert operations Dulles ran in Indonesia during the 1950s and 1960s. He makes it clear that Kennedy was shocked by Dulles’s actions yet never fully grasped the treacherous genius of it all for Dulles was always “working two or three stages ahead of the present.” Having armed and promoted a rebellion against Sukarno’s central government in 1958 Dulles made sure it would fail (shades of the Bay of Pigs to come) since a perceived failure served his long-term strategy. To this very day this faux 1958 Rebellion is depicted as a CIA failure by the media. Yet from Dulles standpoint it was a successful failure that served his long-term goals.

“This holds true” Poulgrain has previously written “only if the stated goal of the CIA was the same as the actual goal. Even more than five decades later media analysis of the goal of The Outer Island rebels is still portrayed as a secession as covert US support for ‘rebels in the Outer Islands that wished to secede from the central government in Jakarta’. The actual goal of Allen Dulles had more to do with achieving a centralized army command in such a way as to appear that the CIA backing for the rebels failed.”

Dulles’ the Devil

Dulles betrayed the rebels he armed and encouraged just as he betrayed friend and foe alike during his long career. The rebellion that he instigated and planned to fail was the first stage of a larger intelligence strategy that would come to fruition in 1965-6 with the ouster of Sukarno (after multiple unsuccessful assassination attempts) and the institution of a reign of terror that followed. It was also when – 1966 – Freeport McMoRan began their massive mining in West Papua at Grasberg at an elevation of 14000 feet in the Alpine region. Dulles was nothing if not patient; he had been at this game since WW I. Even after Kennedy fired him following the Bay of Pigs his plans were executed just as those who got in his way were. Poulgrain makes a powerful case that Dulles was the mastermind of the murders of JFK U.N. Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold (working with Kennedy for a peaceful solution in Indonesia and other places) and Congolese President Patrice Lumumba the first president of a newly liberated Congo.

His focus is on why they needed to be assassinated (similar in this regard to James Douglass’s JFK and the Unspeakable) though with the exception of Kennedy (since the how is well-known and obvious) he also presents compelling evidence as to the how. Hammarskjold in many ways Kennedy’s spiritual brother was a particularly powerful obstacle to Dulles’s plans for Indonesia and colonial countries throughout the Third World. Like JFK he was committed to independence for indigenous and colonial peoples everywhere and was trying to implement his Swedish-style ‘third way’ proposing a form of ‘muscular pacifism’.

Poulgrain argues correctly that if the UN Secretary General succeeded in bringing even half these colonial countries to independence he would have transformed the UN into a significant world power and created a body of nations so large as to be a counter-weight to those embroiled in the Cold War.

He draws on documents from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and Chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu to show the connection between South Africa’s “Operation Celeste” and Dulles’s involvement in Hammarskjold’s murder in September 1961. While it was reported at the time as an accidental plane crash he quotes former President Harry Truman saying “Dag Hammarskjold was on the point of getting something done when they killed him. Notice that I said ‘When they killed him’.” Hammarskjold like Kennedy was intent on returning colonized countries to their indigenous inhabitants and making sure Papua was for Papuans not Freeport McMoRan and imperial forces.

And Dulles sold his overt Indonesian strategy as being necessary to thwart a communist takeover in Indonesia. Cold War rhetoric like “the war on terrorism” today served as his cover. In this he had the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his side; they considered Kennedy soft on communism in Indonesia and Cuba and everywhere else. Dulles’s covert agenda was to serve the interests of his power elite patrons.

While contextually different from David Talbot’s portrayal of Dulles in The Devil’s Chessboard Poulgrain’s portrait of Dulles within the frame of Indonesian history is equally condemnatory and nightmarish. Both describe an evil genius ready to do anything to advance his agenda.

Dulles and George de Mohrenschildt

Poulgrain adds significantly to our understanding of JFK’s assassination and its aftermath by presenting new information about George de Mohrenschildt Lee Harvey Oswald’s handler in Dallas. Dulles had a long association with the de Mohrenschildt family going back to 1920-21 when in Constantinople he negotiated with Baron Sergius Alexander von Mohrenschildt on behalf of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. The Baron’s brother and business partner was George’s father. Dulles’s law firm Sullivan & Cromwell was Standard Oil’s primary law firm. These negotiations on behalf of elite capitalist interests in the shadow of the Russian Revolution became the template for Dulles’s career: economic exploitation was inseparable from military concerns the former concealed behind the anti-communist rhetoric of the latter. An anti-red thread ran through Dulles’s career except when the red was the blood of all those whom he considered expendable. And the numbers are legion. Their blood didn’t matter.

Standard Oil is the link that joins Dulles [who controlled the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of JFK] and de Mohrenschildt. This connection was kept from the Warren Commission despite Dulles’ prominent role and the importance of the testimony of de Mohrenschildt. Poulgrain argues convincingly that de Mohrenschildt worked in “oil intelligence” before his CIA involvement and that oil intelligence was not only Dulles’s work when he first met George’s father Sergius in Baku but that that “oil intelligence” is a redundancy. The CIA after all is a creation of Wall Street and their interests have always been joined. The Agency was not formed to provide intelligence to US Presidents; that was a convenient myth used to cover its real purpose which was to serve the interests of investment bankers and the power elite or those I call The Umbrella People who control the U.S.

While working in 1941 for Humble Oil (Prescott Bush was a major shareholder Dulles was his lawyer and Standard Oil had secretly bought Humble Oil sixteen years before) de Mohrenschildt was caught up in a scandal that involved Vichy (pro-Nazi) French intelligence in selling oil to Germany. This was similar to the Dulles’s brothers and Standard Oil’s notorious business dealings with Germany.

It was an intricate web of the high cabal with Allen Dulles at the center.

In the midst of the scandal de Mohrenschildt suspected of being a Vichy French intelligence agent “disappeared” for a while. He later told the Warren Commission that he decided to take up oil drilling without mentioning the name of Humble Oil that employed him again this time as a roustabout.

“Just when George needed to ‘disappear’ Humble Oil was providing an oil exploration team to be subcontracted to NNGPM – the company Allen Dulles had set up five years earlier to work in Netherlands New Guinea.” Poulgrain makes a powerful circumstantial evidence case (certain documents are still unavailable) that de Mohrenschildt in order to avoid appearing in court went incommunicado in Netherlands New Guinea in mid-1941 where he made a record oil discovery and received a $10000 bonus from Humble Oil.

“Avoiding adverse publicity about his role in selling oil to Vichy France was the main priority; for George a brief drilling adventure in remote Netherlands New Guinea would have been a timely and strategic exit.” And who best to help him in this escape than Allen Dulles – indirectly of course; for Dulles’s modus operandi was to maintain his “distance” from his contacts often over many decades.

In other words Dulles and de Mohrenschildt were intimately involved for a long time prior to JFK’s assassination. Poulgrain rightly claims that “the entire focus of the Kennedy investigation would have shifted had the [Warren] Commission become aware of the 40-year link between Allen Dulles and de Mohrenschildt.” Their relationship involved oil spying Indonesia Nazi Germany the Rockefellers Cuba Haiti etc. It was an international web of intrigue that involved a cast of characters stranger than fiction a high cabal of the usual and unusual operatives.

Two unusual ones are worth mentioning: Michael Fomenko and Michael Rockefeller. The eccentric Fomenko – aka “Tarzan” – is the Russian-Australian nephew of de Mohrenschildt’s wife Jean Fomenko. His arrest and deportation from Netherlands New Guinea in 1959 where he had travelled from Australia in a canoe and his subsequent life are fascinating and sad. It’s the stuff of a bizarre film. It seems he was one of those victims who had to be silenced because he knew a secret about George’s 1941 oil discovery that was not his to share. “In April 1964 at the same time George de Mohrenschildt was facing the Warren Commission – a time when any publicity regarding Sele 40 [George’s record oil discovery] could have changed history – it was decided that electro-convulsive therapy would be used on Michael Fomenko.” He was then imprisoned at the Ipswich Special Mental Hospital.

Equally interesting is the media myth surrounding the disappearance of Michael Rockefeller Nelson’s son and heir to the Standard Oil fortune who was allegedly eaten by cannibals in New Guinea in 1961. His tale became front-page news “a media event closed off to any other explanation and the political implications of his disappearance became an ongoing tragedy for the Papuan people.” To this very day the West Papuan people whose land was described by Standard Oil official Richard Archbold in 1938 as “Shangri-la” are fighting for their independence.

The Sino-Soviet Split

While the gold in West Papua was very important to Allen Dulles his larger goal was to keep the Cold War blazing by concealing the dispute between China and the Soviet Union from Kennedy while instigating the mass slaughter of “communists” that would lead to regime change in Indonesia with Major-General Suharto his ally replacing President Sukarno. In this he was successful. Poulgrain says:

Not only did Dulles fail to brief Kennedy on the Sino-Soviet dispute early in the presidency but he also remained silent about the rivalry between Moscow and Beijing to wield influence over the PKI or win its support. In geographical terms Beijing regarded Indonesia as its own backyard and winning the support of the PKI would give Beijing an advantage in the Sino-Soviet dispute. The numerical growth of the PKI was seen by Moscow and Beijing for its obvious political potential. Dulles was also focused on the PKI but his peculiar skill in political intelligence turned what seemed inevitable on its head. The size of the party [the Indonesian Communist Party was the largest outside the Sino-Soviet bloc] became a factor he used to his advantage when formulating his wedge strategy – the greater the rivalry between Moscow and Beijing over the PKI the more intense would be the recrimination once the PKI was eliminated.

The slaughter of more than a million poor farmers was a trifle to Dulles.

The September 30 1965 Movement

In the early hours of October 1 1965 a fake coup d’état was staged by the CIA’s man Major-General Suharto. It was announced that seven generals had been arrested and would be taken to President Sukarno “to explain the rumor that they were planning a military coup on October 5.” Suharto declared himself the head of the army. Someone was said to have killed the generals. In the afternoon a radio announcement was made calling for the Sukarno government to be dismissed. This became Suharto’s basis for blaming it on the communists and the so-called September 30 Movement and he gave the order to kill the PKI leaders. This started the massive bloodshed that would follow.

With one hand Suharto crushed the Movement accusing the PKI of being the ultimate instigator of an attempt to oust Sukarno and with the other hand he feigned to protect the “father of the Indonesian revolution” while actually stripping Sukarno of every vestige of political support.

When the generals’ bodies were recovered a few days after Oct 1 Suharto falsely claimed the PKI women had tortured and sexually mutilated them as part of some primitive sexual orgy. This heinous perversion of power was the start of the Suharto era. In total control of the media he manipulated popular wrath to call for revenge.

If this confuses you it should because the twisted nature of this fabricated coup was actually part of a real coup in slow motion aimed at ousting Sukarno and replacing him with the CIA’s man Suharto. This occurred in early 1967 after the mass slaughter of communists. It was a regime change cheered on by the American mass media as a triumph over communist aggression.

New Evidence of U.S. Direct Involvement in the Slaughter

Poulgrain has spent forty years interviewing participants and researching this horrendous history. His detailed research is quite amazing. And it does take concentration to follow it all as with the machinations of Dulles Suharto et al.

Some things however are straightforward. For example he documents how during the height of the slaughter two Americans – one man and one woman – were in Klaten (PKI headquarters in central Java) supervising the Indonesian army as they killed the PKI. These two would travel back and forth by helicopter from a ship of the U.S. 7th Fleet that was off the coast of Java. The plan was that the more communists killed the greater would be the dispute between Moscow and Beijing since they would accuse each other for the tragedy which is exactly what they did. This was the wedge that was mentioned in the Rockefeller Brothers Panel Report from the late 1950s in which Dulles and Henry Kissinger both participated.

The hatred drummed up against these poor members of the Communist Party was extraordinary in its depravity. In addition to Suharto’s lies about communist women mutilating the generals’ bodies a massive campaign of hatred was directed against these landless peasants who made up the bulk of the PKI. False Cold War radio broadcasts from Singapore stirred up hostility toward them declaring them atheists etc. Wealthy Muslim landowners – the 1 per cent – made outrageous charges to assist the army’s slaughter. Poulgrain tells us:

Muhammadiyah preachers were broadcasting from mosques that all who joined the communist party must be killed saying they are the ‘lowest order of infidel the shedding of whose blood is comparable to killing a chicken.’

For those Americans especially who think this history of long ago and far away does not touch them its compelling analysis of how and why Allen Dulles and his military allies would want JFK dead since he was a threat to national security as they defined in it their paranoid anti-communist ideology might be an added impetus to read this very important book. Indonesia may be far away geographically but it’s a small world. Dulles and Kennedy had irreconcilable differences and when Dulles was once asked in a radio interview what he would do to someone who threatened national security he matter-of-factually said “I’d kill him.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed.

I would be remiss if I didn’t say that the introduction to JFK vs. Dulles by Oliver Stone and the afterward by James DiEugenio are outstanding. They add excellent context and clarity to a really great and important book.

GRMN,Garmin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc2luZ2xldHJhY2t3b3JsZC5jb20vdGVjaC8yMDIxLzAyL2dhcm1pbi1mZW5peC1wcm8tc29sYXItdGhlLWxhc3Qtc21hcnR3YXRjaC15b3VsbC1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar | The Last Smartwatch You'll Buy,"As a first time smartwatch user this review has been something close to a lifestyle change for me one that I resisted at first but now I can’t revert back.

To set the scene prior to using the Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar I did not record my rides I was not in tune with my heart rate and I always relied on my riding buddies to guide as they all have a GPS computer of some sort. I would under-fuel overtrain and act surprised that I was chronically fatigued. This was mostly down to a lack of knowledge on how much energy mountain biking takes having never measured my rides or calories in/out. I also just didn’t have an interest… I ride bikes to be outside I eat when I’m hungry. I live a simple life.

There are so many data measurements available that I couldn’t possibly cover them all so this review is written from the point of view of a new Garmin user focusing on the following activities:

Mountain biking

Road riding Trail running

Hiking/walking

Out of the Box

The model I have is the 47mm Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar with a Power Glass lens. The casing is a combination of Diamond-Like Carbon coated titanium fibre-reinforced polymer with metal rear cover and a 22mm silicone strap which seemed a better option than the titanium strap for my intended use.

Garmin fēnix 5 vs 6 Pro Solar

The watch is water resistant up to 100 meters has a 32GB memory is compatible with iPhone and Android devices offers a battery life of up to 16 days using the solar top up or a potential 80 days in power saver mode.

The first thing I noticed was the screen quality. Being a device designed for rugged activities and outdoor abuse I expected more function over form. In this case there is both. The backlight is bright the resolution is crisp and the contrast of colours is great making it really easy to just glance at your watch mid-activity and take in the information you need. The casing on the watch face is chunky solid and feels really durable as does the rubber strap. I could probably do to have a smaller model though sizes available are 42mm 47mm and 51mm.

Notifications

The Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar will mirror the notification settings on your phone meaning there is no option to deselect certain apps. At first I found this a complete nightmare during a ride when one of my group WhatsApp conversations fired up but I have since found that you can narrow down the notifications to ‘Calls only’ ‘Calls and texts’ or simply mute them all during activity.

Notifications themselves are quite smart. The Garmin doesn’t limit you to a snippet of information you can scroll through an entire text message or email. All apps have the relevant icon to make them easily identifiable apart from YouTube as far as I can tell. The watch has a sleep mode so you can keep it on day and night without having spam emails waking you up in the middle of the night.

Watch Face

You can customise pretty much every aspect of the Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar. The standard watch face layout options are vast and once you’ve chosen a face you have the option to edit the data fields units and colours. I felt overwhelmed with information at first so I selected the most basic face: Time date heart rate. As time went on I gradually added more fields. I think starting with a busy watch face full of information would have been very difficult to wrap my head around having gone from a Casio to this.

The turning point for me was finding the Garmin ConnectIQ App. It’s here I found unlimited watch faces apps and widgets. I spent some time with a familiar Casio watch face but I actually missed all the data fields I had got used to so I’ve settled on a Pip-Boy from Fallout as it’s familiar easy to read at a glance and I really enjoy his passive aggressive crutches if my activity levels are low.

You can choose a face that looks nice one that focuses on the data relevant to you or simply a regular analogue clock with no other info displayed. You can even have a photo of your choice in the background but it immediately makes the watch feel cheap.

Battery Life

As with any technology the more you use it the faster it runs out of juice. The obvious battery suckers are recording rides and having your notifications on. The battery level indicator is based on just having the watch on your wrist but not actually using it for anything but it’s smart enough to give an estimated adjustment based on the activity you select. As an example I had 6 days of battery life today but when I selected ‘MTB’ in the activity menu the watch advised I had 16 hours of battery in this mode. Fortunately I did not ride for 16 hours and have reverted back to a 5 day forecast of fuel.

Expedition mode will allow you to turn your Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar into a battery conscious multi-day GPX device. Heading out bike packing or entering a 4 day enduro? You’ll want this mode.

Solar Charging

I didn’t actually receive a charger with my watch (media sample not BNIB) and inevitably the battery drained with all my setting up and familiarising. The moment I got it down to a matter of hours until it would die I put it in the window. To my surprise I got it up to 2 days of charge (in idle mode I doubt I could record a ride on this level of charge).

Solar charging obviously relies on… the sun. So when you’re tucked into your jacket on a ride it’s not a feature we can benefit from in the UK. I imagine in summer the frequency of needing to charge this watch will reduce massively. One small annoyance with this watch is that (for me at least) if you manage to completely drain the battery it really doesn’t want to pair with your phone when you get it back on. I’ve had to delete the device and re-add it on the few occasions I have got down to 0% charge.

Heart Rate Monitoring

To accurately test the HRM on the Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar I’ve been wearing a Wahoo chest strap linked to a separate app. The Garmin fēnix 6 is about as accurate as you’d hope a wrist reading to be. Sedentary readings are actually quite accurate however during activity the wrist reading struggles to keep up with the rate of change and jumps around without a gradual increase/decrease whereas the chest strap updates continuously.

Photos taken a couple of seconds apart on a TT – Left reading is the wrist HRM right is my Wahoo chest strap.

Having my heart rate constantly monitored has had a positive effect on me. A high resting heart rate tells me I’m tired/in recovery so when I do ride on those days I don’t beat myself up for underperforming. It has also impacted my sleep habits on certain occasions. Since you can see the effect a glass of wine will have on your heart rate therefore the quality of sleep I tend to be kinder to my body when I plan to ask a lot of it.

The Body Battery feature works really well if you wear the watch day and night. It needs to know how restful your sleep was how active you are and how your heart is behaving. I didn’t pay close attention to it in my early days with this watch because I was annoyed about never having a ‘full battery’ but looking back I really wasn’t looking after myself and that data field was telling me so.

Activities – General Setup

Before getting into the specifics I’d like to cover how simple Garmin have made it to customise the watch for quick easy use. You select the activities you would like to appear in your activity list that is accessible with one button put them in order customise the data fields you want visible during each activity and you’re ready to go. It takes two clicks of the same button for me to set a mountain bike ride recording and that’s the kind of simplicity I like.

Customise your favourites Then customise the data fields and screens

Each activity can be customised to alter the way your watch works when in use. So you can completely mute notifications when MTBing but have them on during a hike for example. It can take some time to get the watch set up to work for you. For example if you’re in serious training the ClimbPro feature can make you aware of total elevation remaining distance and grade (when on a course) meaning you can monitor your intensity level.

Mountain Biking

Recording mountain bike rides is the main function I have used on the watch. After the initial setup of choosing the data fields I want visible it’s a really simple process. Press go and when the ride is finished it automatically uploads to Garmin/Strava/TrainingPeaks or wherever you choose and I get a summary of my performance. I have never experienced upload or connection issues after an activity but I have ridden with friends that have a frustrated half hour of trying to get their device to upload the ride.

You can program the watch to alert you of heart rate zones distance markers time lapsed… probably much more too. I really like heart rate alerts because I’m not in the habit of looking at my watch during a ride but I am supposed to be keeping an eye on my heart rate as it has an irregularity that often leaves me with blue lips and numb hands on/after a ride.

Recovery Time

Recovery Time is calculated using the training effect of your completed activity the amount of time remaining on your Recovery Time countdown (if you had 24 hours recovery time but did an activity after 18 hours the 6 would be added onto your following recovery time…) and the Firstbeat’s algorithm.

The fēnix 6 series feature an improved algorithm that can shorten the time estimate by taking into account stress levels quality of sleep additional training intensity and daily activity levels. At first I didn’t pay much attention to this feature it made for a good laugh on the days when I had ‘4 Days Recovery’ displayed but I payed no attention to the advice. However in time I have come to realise it is shockingly accurate. This may be because I’ve become more in tune with my body through analysing it so much or it might be smart enough to get familiar with the user’s habits. Either way when I’m on a short recovery time I feel good when it’s high I feel like curling up with a pizza.

Grit and Flow

Can I call shenanigans on this feature? From a data analysis point of view I honestly can’t see a benefit. It feels like a metric that has been dreamt up to appeal to mountain bikers. I understand how it is measured (I think though without an algorithm showing me exactly how it’s calculated it’s quite a loose understanding) but I don’t understand why. I’m inclined to suggest that this is a sales gimmick…

Cool. There were some flowy sections where I held speed there were some rough bits… is it confirming I was definitely on a mountain bike ride?

Ride Analysis and Data

The GPS is excellent. I have chosen a certain section of trail that I know well and I know exactly how I ride it and zoomed in to my ride map. It’s so precise I can spot where I ride up some banking to get a better line through the proceeding wet rock garden. I’ve noticed that my GPS finds signal immediately (providing I’m outside) but my partner’s fēnix 5 can take several moments to find signal. I haven’t got much experience with Garmin head units but he assures me that his Edge 520 finds signal much quicker than his fēnix 5 watch so that shows a great improvement in the watch GPS in my eyes.

The Garmin Connect app is available on your phone or browser and in my experience the browser seems to be for detailed ride analysis full sized charts and basically more information than I know what to do with. It does have a great map feature that allows you to replay your ride – but I never actually use this.

(I should have done a 0.04km lap of the car park…)

The Garmin Connect mobile app is a tidy user friendly summary of everything you want it to record. I’ll be honest – I don’t read all this data and take anything from it. There was a day I went for an 81km bike ride and the Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar had the cheek to tell me to go for a walk because my step count was low… I can see the appeal in having all this information available though.

Running & Trail Running

It’s worth a brief mention that this watch is a truly excellent companion for a run. The option to control your music be alerted of each kilometer ran view your average pace and keep an eye on the time if like me you like to keep your amount of running to a minimum. I’m actually willing to admit that if I didn’t have this watch I wouldn’t have bothered beginning to run. I wanted to try the feature out for this review and I think without it I would be aimlessly crippling myself with no record of achievements or progress.

Overall

With a battery life that can challenge any other smartwatch on the market a screen quality you wouldn’t expect from such a small device and so many activity fields it tempts you to try new sports just to make use of the price tag the Garmin fēnix 6 Pro Solar is a game changer if you’re new to the smartwatch market. I haven’t worried about impacts water resistance running out of charge or not being able to gain a GPS signal at any point during testing and I have become increasingly impressed with everything this watch has to offer. It’s user friendly records activities with no issues and it just works all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“This is a record breaking year for us because we actually have nine puppies out of the 71 that are participating so it’s really really exciting for us” said Jaclyn Gartner of the Danbury Animal Welfare Society.

And two dogs from Maine will also be spotlighted. Great Pyrenees/Poodle mix Duke and cattle dog mix Rumor will be making plays as well.

“Rumor is a special needs dog” said Patsy Murphy of the Animal Rescue League of Greater Portland. “She’s deaf and she responds to hand signals. so we’re super excited to see how she does on the field.”

All dogs in the Puppy Bowl are up for adoption and over the years the show has had a 100 percent adoption rate. Eleven dogs currently are still looking for forever homes and viewers will be able to adopt in real time tomorrow.

Murphy said the show was a big boost for pet adoption.

“This national stage really helps illustrate that shelter pets are worthy. they are desirable. they need to be loved and cherish and they all need homes” she said.

In a surprise to no one Schitt’s Creek‘s Dan Levy — in his glorious glittery suit — crushed it hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time last night. And two skits in particular still have us reeling: the all-too-relatable Zillow ad and the spot-on “we’re doing everything right” pandemic pod sketch.

Let’s start with Zillow — the new fantasy for people in their late-30s who dream of affording a home but just can’t.

“You’re in your late 30’s now. Sex isn’t doing it for you anymore. You need something new. Something exciting. Zillow dot com” Heidi Gartner opens the ad as we watch several other cast members — and Levy — put on their best seductive voice for a sultry ad… about Zillow.

“I’d never want to live in North Carolina. But if I did I could buy a big gross mansion” Levy says.

“The pleasure you once got from sex now comes from looking at other people’s houses” SNL cast member Ego Nwodim adds.

The ad was so good so painfully accurate that even Zillow the online real estate marketplace tweeted about it after the episode aired.

https://twitter.com/jetpack/status/1358299205056479232

Zillow was far from alone from loving the ad. Almost immediately after it aired fans flocked to Twitter to call out SNL on the assault.

“We may be a divided country but I think most of us can at least agree that the Zillow sketch on SNL hit way too close to home tonight…” tweeted Joy Ann Reid MSNBC’s The ReidOut host.

Next “Super Bowl Pod” tackles pandemic pods and the people in ’em who claim they’ve been doing everything right to meet up (tests distancing masks). But the sketch quickly unravels when each pod member reveals they’ve in fact been doing everything wrong leading up to meeting like taking part in a wrestling club and massaging the lips of total strangers.

And we couldn’t close out this recap without a nod the best cameo: Levy’s dad Eugene.

“I flew in to wish you luck tonight” Eugene said while contained in a transparent chamber as Dan gave viewers a very pandemic backstage tour. “But because I traveled I’m now in an isolation box. Could one of you turn me towards the stage so I could see the show?”

It was such a surprising moment even Emily Hampshire who played Stevie on Schitt’s Creek tweeted about it — in character.

“Mr. Rose!!?” she wrote. “omg I can’t believe you[‘re] on @nbcsnl tell them about the Motel!!”

Schitt’s Creek also joined in the Dan-on-SNL love-fest tweeting:

They also hit fans square in the feels with one single tweet:

“My 13-year-old self has fainted in a really needy melodramatic way” Dan said during his monologue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZmZpbmdoYW1kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvaGlzdG9yeS9oZWFsaW5nLWhlYXJ0cy10aGUtc3RhcnQtb2YtaW50ZW5zaXZlLWNhcmUtaW4tZWZmaW5naGFtL2FydGljbGVfZmZiNTVmZDYtNjk3Yy0xMWViLTkzZjEtNWI2NjI2NjA1Nzk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Healing Hearts: The Start of intensive care in Effingham,"Support local journalism

As the second decade of the 21st century has come to an end the world has experienced many immersive technological changes that transformed everyday life for the better. The emerging and young technologies have changed the way every sector functions by implementing advancements and digital transformation into the working system. But what lies ahead when another decade passes is far more fascinating than ever. Gartner has figured five technological trends that will pilot the tech innovations for the next decade. The things that we thought were impossible at the beginning of 2000s can be done in a minute now. People’s productivity has not changed for over twenty years not since email and internet services permeated the office. However the intrusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning coupled with collaborative systems signals the success of the digital transformation. This is where technological innovations have taken us to. With far more expectations people are stepping into the third decade of the century. Forrester has anticipated that the next decade will require CIOs to both respond to digital acceleration and proactively manage uncertainty. Rapidly evolving trends and behavioural changes in accordance with the ethical use of artificial intelligence will drive diverse industries to incorporate systemic risk into their long-term planning. The convergence of these technologies is unlocking the next wave of innovation yielding new solutions that are greater than the once we saw so far. Remarkably Gartner has put out 30 must-watch technologies represented on Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies. The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is the longest-running annual Gartner Hype Cycle providing a cross-industry perspective on the technologies and trends that business strategists chief innovation officers R&D leaders entrepreneurs global market developers and emerging technology teams should consider in developing the emerging technology portfolio. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for emerging technologies insights from more than 1700 technologies into a succinct set of 30 emerging technologies and trends.People are seeking out more digital stuff as technology grows. They are looking into digital representations of themselves such as digital passports and social distancing technologies. One of the far spoken technologies digital twin will get streamlined in the present decade as people prefer to use it in the physical and digital space. Gartner hints us to watch out for social distancing technologies health passports digital twin of the person citizen twin multi-experience and two-way BMI (brain-machine interface).A composite application orchestrates independently developed programs data and devices to deliver a new solution that none of the previously available applications could deliver on its own. Meanwhile composite enterprise responds to rapidly changing business needs with packaged business capabilities built upon a flexible data fabric. The composite architecture will be availed in order to decentralise and extend outward to edge devices and the end-users.Enabling artificial intelligence to react to the situation is becoming vital in the technology sector. Formative AI is a set of emerging AI and related technologies that are designed to react according to the situation. Even application developers and UX designers are working on creating formative AI solutions with the help of AI-powered tools. The most advanced formative AI is aimed at solving specific problems.Security of data source of assets and identity of individuals are critical in the AI industry. Encrypting these details is becoming the primary job of solution providers. Henceforth instead of using trust models based on responsible authorities the next generation will see high adoption of algorithmic trust models. These models aid organisations assure their customers that the data they contributed stays safe.For the past few decades Moore’s law has promoted the ideology that the number of transistors in a dense integrated (IC) doubles about every two years. However the increase in silicon computer chip usage has reached the physical limit in the IT industry. This will bring in new innovative substitutes like DNA computing biodegradable sensors and carbon-based transistors in place for silicon chips."
GE,GE Aerospace,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzA2LzMtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWhlbHAteW91LWpvaW4tMTAwLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLWNsdWIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks to Help You Join the $100 Billion Dollar Club,"A look at why three industrial giants are a great buy for investors right now.

It's not often when you can genuinely describe three of the highest profile stocks in the industrial sector as ""unloved"" or ""ignored"" but that's the case right now. In a nutshell there appears to have been a flight to quality in the sector and that's left some of the less-fancied names like General Electric (GE 0.90%) Raytheon Technologies (RTX -0.48%) and 3M (MMM 0.35%) looking undervalued relative to their growth prospects.

By a quirk of coincidence the stocks for all three companies currently trade on an individual market cap of around $100 billion. Here's why they are a good value for investors.

It's the free cash flow that matters

The thing that ties all three companies together is their future free cash flow (FCF). In layman's terms it's the flow of cash in the year that a company has left over from earnings after working capital and capital expenditures are taken out.

In a nutshell it's the ""free cash"" that a business has available to do all the value-enhancing things for shareholders like buying back stock paying dividends investing in acquisitions or paying down debt. As a rough guide a price-to-FCF multiple of around 20 is seen as a fair value for an industrial conglomerate growing revenue in line with the economy.

The case for why all three are good investments is based on their FCF valuations.

1. 3M

The business generates a lot of cash and currently trades at a significant valuation multiple to its peers. The chart below compares 3M to its closest peer Illinois Tool Works (ITW 0.78%). Both are multi-industry conglomerates with significant exposure to the auto industry. To be fair ITW is a great business and I'm the first person to argue that it deserves to trade at a premium to 3M.

Moreover 3M has potential liabilities from litigation over PFAS a group of chemicals the company produced that are believed to be hazardous. In addition 3M's execution and deliverance on guidance -- particularly in the healthcare segment -- has left a lot to be desired in recent years.

However the question is how much of a premium does ITW deserve and how much should one discount 3M's performance?

Let's put it this way. If 3M traded on a 10% discount to ITW and we use a price-to-FCF multiple of 21.9 then based on this year's adjusted FCF ($6.7 billion) 3M's market cap would be $147 billion. That's a figure nearly $46 billion above its current market cap. Alternatively using a multiple of 20 suggests that 3M is undervalued by $34 billion.

Frankly those are huge numbers to assume for PFAs liability and a valuation discount particularly as CEO Mike Roman is actively restructuring the company and reshaping the healthcare segment. Throw in a well-covered dividend (current yield 3.4%) and 3M stock looks like a good value.

2. General Electric

It's no secret that the commercial aviation market took a severe hit from the COVID-19 pandemic and most observers don't expect it to return to 2019 levels until 2023. Knowing that there's two ways to look at this. The first is to be wary of the lost revenue/FCF and the uncertain timeline of recovery -- something largely dependent on the subduing of the pandemic. The second is to look at it as a multi-year growth opportunity for companies like GE and Raytheon Technologies as they will start from ground zero in 2020.

The investment case for GE is based on a combination of recovery at GE Aviation ongoing solid FCF generation at GE Health Care and multi-year improvement in earnings margin and FCF generation at GE Renewable Energy and GE Power.

The evidence from the latest earnings report is that GE is making progress on these objectives. Consequently management guided toward FCF of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in 2021.

The midpoint of the range would put GE on a price-to-FCF multiple of around 27 times 2021 FCF. While this looks expensive readers should note that GE is set for a multi-year recovery in FCF and it won't be until 2023 at the earliest that GE Aviation can expect to get back to the kind of $4.4 billion in FCF generated in 2019 compared to zero in 2020.

3. Raytheon Technologies

A similar argument applies to GE's aviation rival Raytheon Technologies. The two compete with engines on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. In addition within commercial aviation Raytheon's Collins Aerospace also makes aerostructures avionics mechanical systems power systems and even cabins.

It's going to take time for Raytheon to recover but in the meantime it will receive solid support from its defense business (missiles defense systems radar intelligence systems and space solutions including satellites). In fact defense now makes up around two-thirds of total company revenue.

Management predicts a strong recovery in commercial aviation profitability beginning in the second quarter and is targeting $5 billion in adjusted FCF for 2021.

Mojave Airport had a year filled with new beginnings and aviation firsts in 1986 Aerotech News’ anniversary year.

Fourteen years earlier in 1972 the East Kern Airport District was formed with Dan Sabovich a flying rancher from Arvin as the first general manager.

“Friends call Dan Sabovich a ‘can-do guy’ because he transformed a deserted airstrip into a place that adventurous fliers can call home” says a quote from a Los Angeles Herald Examiner article.

Sabovich had a vision for the abandoned Marine Corps Air Station. He said “What I wanted to do was to have a civilian flight test center that was just like Edwards.” It was described as an airport where ‘dreams took flight.’

He worked with well-known aviation personalities like Darryl Greenamyer and Clay Lacy to bring air racing to Mojave beginning in 1969. Three long runways and lots of wide open spaces were appealing to the warbird crowd who wanted to deliver Reno-style unlimited class air racing to the public.

Sabovich believed it to be a great way to show off the attributes of this former military base and get people interested in his dream of turning it into a premier flight test center.

Air Races at Mojave lasted for 10 years from 1969 to 1979.

Aviator’s World an aviation memorabilia store operated in the main administration building where the Voyager Restaurant is now.

In an interview in 1986 store owner Lee Heron said “We’re like family out here.”

Heron also worked on the Voyager Aircraft and stated for a local newspaper “The airport is a magnet for people whose life is wrapped up in the dream of making new airplanes.”

Sabovich encouraged Hollywood film companies to come to the airport to make movies commercials and TV episodes.

Famous for being the first man to break the sound barrier Chuck Yeager made a commercial for Delco batteries in a hangar at Mojave Airport.

Also Cal Worthington a well-known local car salesman and World War II veteran stood on his head while riding on top of a biplane in the skies above Mojave Airport. “That was him doing it” said Sabovich. “He said if he didn’t do it people wouldn’t believe him.”

Early companies at Mojave Airport

General Electric Engine Test facilities and Flight Systems occupied buildings at Mojave Airport when Sabovich first arrived. GE came over from Edwards in 1967 with their Boeing 707 testbed aircraft. Flight Systems Inc. was founded in 1968.

GE Flight Test at Mojave

In the summer of 1986 GE was conducting flight test work on their GE36 Unducted Fan (UDF) engine. The testbed aircraft was a Boeing 727. It was an experimental aircraft engine a hybrid between a turbofan and a turboprop.

The engine had a pair of six-stage contra-rotating free turbines each with large diameters running at slow speeds and they were connected directly to a couple of eight-blade 12-foot diameter unducted fans which made for a very unusual sound as it flew past.

Later the testbed aircraft for the UDF was a McDonnell-Douglas MD-81.

Flight Systems Inc.

William R. “Bob” Laidlaw formed Flight Systems Inc. in 1968 and based the business in Mojave which has been a hub for experimental aviation for many years. The first aircraft used by Flight Systems was the Canadair F-86 Sabre. They were converted into unmanned drones to be used by the U.S. Army for targets.

The U.S. Army QF-86E drone program finished in June 1986 and the drone requirement was then filled by the QF-100. The first F-100 arrived at Mojave in early 1985 for conversion.

Gary Childress F-100 Crew Chief at Flight Systems said “There were only two F-100 aircraft assigned full time in Mojave —N404FS an F model and N405FS a D model.”

“Both of these aircraft were government leased. The company had several more F-100F aircraft that were purchased from Denmark they operated in Europe towing targets until they were returned to Mojave and sold off” Childress said.

Rutan Brothers Legacy at Mojave Airport

Rutan Aircraft Factory began business at Mojave Airport in 1974 developing the VariEze aircraft. Subsequent Burt Rutan designs made first flights at Mojave Airport including: the Quickie Defiant and Long-EZ prototypes and the one and only Voyager aircraft piloted by Rutan’s brother Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager which made the epic flight around the world in 9 days 3 minutes 44 seconds beginning on Dec. 14 1986 and ending on Dec. 23 1986.

The ‘round the world non-stop unrefueled Voyager flight put the eyes of the world on the Rutan Brothers and Mojave Airport.

Burt Rutan established Scaled Composites in 1982 and is now best known for the first privately-funded manned space flight with Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie winning the Ansari $10-million X-Prize on Oct. 4 2004 with Paul G. Allen’s SpaceShipOne.

National Test Pilot School

The National Test Pilot School was established in 1981 by Sean Roberts. In 1986 NTPS constructed a large hangar and classroom complex at the east end of Mojave Airport. Today NTPS trains military and civilian students from over 30 different countries around the world. Dr. Allen Peterson is the present president and CEO.

Aerotest Inc.

The company was founded by engineer and test pilot W.R. ‘Bob’ Laidlaw in 1986. He was the same person who started Flight Systems Inc. at Mojave in 1968.

The company maintained and repaired commercial aircraft including jumbo jets. Aerotest personnel maintained many of the airliners in storage at the airport.

More than 400 people were employed at Aerotest in 1986. A huge 120000-square-foot hangar was constructed at Mojave Airport in 1990. The company moved operations from Mojave to Santa Barbara in 1994.

Looking to the future

Today the tenants at Mojave Air and Space Port are thinking and acting far into the future — and the future is space.

Virgin Galactic’s Cosmic Girl The Spaceship Company Stratolaunch Masten Aerospace and Scaled Composites are all looking upward to the stars.

Over the course of Q4 2020 the company generated €1.22 billion in revenue 3% more than the €1.18 billion it reported in Q4 2019. This increase can largely be attributed to the firm’s recurring software revenue which generated €806 million and grew by 27% over the same period.

In terms of EPS Dassault Systèmes also outstripped the guidance it issued at the end of Q3 reporting a diluted net EPS of €0.77 for Q4 2020 a 2% jump compared to Q4 2019. The company’s better than expected results were well-received by investors and its shares have increased from €170.30 to €183.80 since they were published a rise of 8%.

“Through close engagement we have helped our clients to manage and reinvent their operations during the pandemic” said Bernard Charlès VP and CEO of Dassault Systèmes. “Our collaborative innovation platform has also enabled our clients to prepare for the future and advance their next generation portfolios for sustainable innovation.”

“During this unprecedented period we have revealed the critical importance of collaborative innovation as a strategic partner in value creation.”

Dassault Systèmes’ Q4 2020 results

Dassault mainly generates revenue from its 3DEXPERIENCE platform a 3D design and simulation engine that powers its software portfolio. As a result the company’s financials can largely be split across its three flagship programs: the SOLIDWORKS CAD application CATIA product design tool and ENOVIA modelling software.

During Q4 2020 CATIA remained Dassault’s highest earner generating €295 million a slight 1% increase on the €293 million reported in Q4 2019. The company’s SOLIDWORKS growth was similarly flat at 1% over the same period while its ENOVIA software revenue declined by 5% from €104 million to €99 million.

Dassault’s growth was driven by its Life Sciences segment which reported revenue of €218 million during Q4 2020 a 35% rise compared to the €134 million generated in Q4 2019. Elsewhere during the same period the company’s licensing revenue fell by 12% but its subscription revenue increased by 11% playing a key role in the firm’s overall annual growth.

In terms of geographical breakdown the company performed best in the Americas and its revenue there grew from €389 million in Q4 2019 to €438 million in Q4 2020. In Europe though Dassault’s revenue fell from €509 million to €496 million over the same period while revenue generated by its Asia-based business remained flat.

Dassault’s FY 3D printing activities

Earlier in FY 2020 Dassault made Xometry the first “prime partner” on its MAKE marketplace. Although the company doesn’t report directly on how this influences its revenue the on-demand manufacturing platform is an important part of its portfolio and the move could have indirectly impacted on its financial results.

On an earnings call with analysts and investors Charlès explained that elsewhere the company had also seen increased crossover between its SOLIDWORKS and ENOVIA users and that it was seeking to build on this. “We see a connection with ENOVIA project management in the SOLIDWORKS community” said Charlès.

“They also use the platform to do data analytics” he added. “We didn’t expect this to be happening in the mainstream innovation market and it’s happening with core business analysis on the platform. This was really visible in the fourth quarter so we expect to leverage that.”

Charlès provided an update on SOLIDWORKS too revealing that although its Q4 revenue was flat it had signed up 20000 new clients over the full year. In future Charlès committed to “expanding the platform’s portfolio” with a focus on providing users with integrated cloud analysis and native mobile browser support.

Continued revenue growth in 2021?

Moving into Q1 2021 Charlès explained that Dassault has a significant order backlog that should enable it to achieve sustained growth. For instance Aero structure manufacturer Spirit Aerosystems has already committed to expanding its use of 3DEXPERIENCE while Lithium Valley is set to adopt the platform for civil infrastructure applications.

The firm has projected constant currency revenue growth of 9-10% during FY 2021 with recurring revenue to increase by 8-9%. As the global pandemic continues Dassault also anticipates a move towards a more cloud and subscription-based model and has set its EPS range at €4.10 to €4.15 (growth of 8-10%) as a result.

“Looking forward we see a year of solid organic growth in 2020 and we are confident in our mid-term growth drivers” concluded Pascal Daloz COO and CFO of Dassault. “None of us could have imagined 2020 in advance but despite the increase of distances we became closer as a company.”

SmartBreast plans to sell the rebranded system as Eve Clear Scan e750 and it will support the existing installations of the system at scores of sites around the world.

The deal is part of SmartBreast's plan to become the leading provider of MBI technology. The company earlier this year announced its acquisition of Dilon Diagnostics another MBI manufacturer. That agreement included rights to Dilon's Dilon 6800 scanner as well as patents and other technology. With both deals combined SmartBreast has an installed base of 217 MBI systems worldwide.

GE first introduced Discovery NM750b at the RSNA 2010 meeting positioning the system as an adjunct to mammography rather than a screening tool. In 2016 GE signed a deal with Dilon Diagnostics to make that company the exclusive distributor of Discovery NM750b in North America.

A major distinguishing feature of Discovery NM750b is its cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) digital detectors which GE said it will continue to supply to SmartBreast after the sale.

MBI can provide a secondary imaging technique after an inconclusive primary examination with conventional mammography. In particular the technology can be useful for women with dense breast tissue which can cause difficulties for conventional x-ray-based imaging techniques.

As a sign of MBI's utility SmartBrief highlights a 2015 study in which researchers reported that mammography found 3.2 cancers per 1000 women with dense breasts; adding MBI increased the yield of cancers discovered to 12 per 1000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzA2LzMtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWhlbHAteW91LWpvaW4tMTAwLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLWNsdWIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks to Help You Join the $100 Billion Dollar Club,"A look at why three industrial giants are a great buy for investors right now.

It's not often when you can genuinely describe three of the highest profile stocks in the industrial sector as ""unloved"" or ""ignored"" but that's the case right now. In a nutshell there appears to have been a flight to quality in the sector and that's left some of the less-fancied names like General Electric (GE 0.90%) Raytheon Technologies (RTX -0.48%) and 3M (MMM 0.35%) looking undervalued relative to their growth prospects.

By a quirk of coincidence the stocks for all three companies currently trade on an individual market cap of around $100 billion. Here's why they are a good value for investors.

It's the free cash flow that matters

The thing that ties all three companies together is their future free cash flow (FCF). In layman's terms it's the flow of cash in the year that a company has left over from earnings after working capital and capital expenditures are taken out.

In a nutshell it's the ""free cash"" that a business has available to do all the value-enhancing things for shareholders like buying back stock paying dividends investing in acquisitions or paying down debt. As a rough guide a price-to-FCF multiple of around 20 is seen as a fair value for an industrial conglomerate growing revenue in line with the economy.

The case for why all three are good investments is based on their FCF valuations.

1. 3M

The business generates a lot of cash and currently trades at a significant valuation multiple to its peers. The chart below compares 3M to its closest peer Illinois Tool Works (ITW 0.78%). Both are multi-industry conglomerates with significant exposure to the auto industry. To be fair ITW is a great business and I'm the first person to argue that it deserves to trade at a premium to 3M.

Moreover 3M has potential liabilities from litigation over PFAS a group of chemicals the company produced that are believed to be hazardous. In addition 3M's execution and deliverance on guidance -- particularly in the healthcare segment -- has left a lot to be desired in recent years.

However the question is how much of a premium does ITW deserve and how much should one discount 3M's performance?

Let's put it this way. If 3M traded on a 10% discount to ITW and we use a price-to-FCF multiple of 21.9 then based on this year's adjusted FCF ($6.7 billion) 3M's market cap would be $147 billion. That's a figure nearly $46 billion above its current market cap. Alternatively using a multiple of 20 suggests that 3M is undervalued by $34 billion.

Frankly those are huge numbers to assume for PFAs liability and a valuation discount particularly as CEO Mike Roman is actively restructuring the company and reshaping the healthcare segment. Throw in a well-covered dividend (current yield 3.4%) and 3M stock looks like a good value.

2. General Electric

It's no secret that the commercial aviation market took a severe hit from the COVID-19 pandemic and most observers don't expect it to return to 2019 levels until 2023. Knowing that there's two ways to look at this. The first is to be wary of the lost revenue/FCF and the uncertain timeline of recovery -- something largely dependent on the subduing of the pandemic. The second is to look at it as a multi-year growth opportunity for companies like GE and Raytheon Technologies as they will start from ground zero in 2020.

The investment case for GE is based on a combination of recovery at GE Aviation ongoing solid FCF generation at GE Health Care and multi-year improvement in earnings margin and FCF generation at GE Renewable Energy and GE Power.

The evidence from the latest earnings report is that GE is making progress on these objectives. Consequently management guided toward FCF of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in 2021.

The midpoint of the range would put GE on a price-to-FCF multiple of around 27 times 2021 FCF. While this looks expensive readers should note that GE is set for a multi-year recovery in FCF and it won't be until 2023 at the earliest that GE Aviation can expect to get back to the kind of $4.4 billion in FCF generated in 2019 compared to zero in 2020.

3. Raytheon Technologies

A similar argument applies to GE's aviation rival Raytheon Technologies. The two compete with engines on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. In addition within commercial aviation Raytheon's Collins Aerospace also makes aerostructures avionics mechanical systems power systems and even cabins.

It's going to take time for Raytheon to recover but in the meantime it will receive solid support from its defense business (missiles defense systems radar intelligence systems and space solutions including satellites). In fact defense now makes up around two-thirds of total company revenue.

Management predicts a strong recovery in commercial aviation profitability beginning in the second quarter and is targeting $5 billion in adjusted FCF for 2021. That's a figure that would put Raytheon on a price-to-FCF multiple of 20 times projected 2021 FCF. That's a very good value for a company headed for ongoing recovery in FCF from commercial aviation. Throw in a 2.9% dividend yield and Raytheon is an attractive stock all round.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdW50bWlubmllLmNvbS9jbGluaWNhbC1uZXdzL3dvbWVucy1pbWFnaW5nL2JyZWFzdC9hcnRpY2xlLzE1NjI3NzYwL3N0dWR5LW1ha2VzLWNhc2UtZm9yLWJhc2VsaW5lLW1hbW1vZ3JhcGh5LWV4YW0tYXQtYWdlLTQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study makes case for baseline mammography exam at age 40,"A baseline mammography exam at age 40 for average-risk women to identify breast density appears to be cost-effective according to a study published February 8 in Annals of Internal Medicine.

The microsimulation modeling study evaluated various scenarios for mammography screening including baseline testing at age 40 and more intensive screening for those with breast density which is a known risk factor for breast cancer.

For women with average risk for breast cancer it makes clinical and economic sense to perform a baseline mammogram at age 40 followed by annual screening for those with dense breasts and biennial screening starting at age 50 for those who do not have dense breasts reported a team led by Ya-Chen Tina Shih PhD chief of cancer economics and policy at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

""Compared with other screening strategies examined in our study this strategy is associated with the greatest reduction in breast cancer mortality and is cost-effective but involves the most screening mammograms in a woman's lifetime and higher rates of false-positive results and overdiagnosis"" the authors wrote.

The findings are at odds with guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) which recommends screening starting at age 50 with biennial screening subsequently and the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS) which backs triennial screening starting at the same age. The USPSTF is currently performing a review of its guidelines.

The current study which was funded by a grant from the U.S. National Cancer Institute was aimed at evaluating the costs and potential harms associated with the identification of women with dense breasts at the age of 40.

Density which is discovered through mammography has been appreciated as a breast cancer risk factor since 1976 and in more recent years has gained attention from advocacy groups and legislators the authors noted. Since February 2019 providers have been required by federal law in the U.S. to notify patients of breast density but women who follow screening guidelines may not get that important information until the age of 50 the authors wrote.

Researchers used a microsimulation model informed by several data sources to assess screening strategies subsequent diagnostics and treatments diagnoses of breast cancer and deaths. They modeled outcomes for a population of 500000 women born in 1970 and with an average risk for breast cancer. Density was defined as BI-RADS categories C and D -- about 50% of women in the U.S. fit this description.

The preferred strategy turned out to be baseline screening at age 40 followed by annual screening between the ages of 40 and 75 for those with dense breasts with biennial screening from age 50 to 75 for those without dense breasts. This was based on an analysis showing a cost-effectiveness ratio of $36200 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with a biennial strategy from age 50 to 75 whereas a threshold of $100000 per QALY is generally considered acceptable in the U.S.

With baseline screening results available at age 40 patients and their physicians can decide on a lifetime screening strategy together the researchers suggested.

""This baseline assessment can be expanded to collect other information such as family history or polygenic risk scores to further develop a risk profile that allows more targeted and personalized screening"" Shih and colleagues wrote.

However the study findings may get some pushback based on an accompanying editorial also published February 8 in Annals. In the editorial University of California San Francisco (UCSF) epidemiologists Dr. Karla Kerlikowske and Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo PhD made the case for keeping the starting age of 50 with biennial screening to age 75 for women at average risk. In particular they flagged the high cost of annual breast screening and harms of overdiagnosis.

The modeling assumed a higher benefit for mammography screening than has been reported in other studies and magnified the number of deaths averted they suggested in the editorial. Furthermore only 24% of women with dense breasts are at high risk for a missed invasive cancer within one year of a negative mammogram and they can be identified without the need for more frequent mammography screening the authors wrote.

Kerlikowske and Bibbins-Domingo instead favored a focus on overall risk for screening including breast density in order to maximize benefits while minimizing harms. Aside from density risk factors include age a family history of breast cancer and a history of breast biopsy.",,,,,,

Back before the turn of the century all the way back in 1996 Honda released the fastest production motorcycle the world had ever seen: the CBR1100XX Super Blackbird. Hitting top speeds as high as 178.5 mph (287.3 km/h) the Blackbird was named for one of the world's fastest predators.

But it wasn't the fastest. One of the Blackbird's few superiors in the sky is the Peregrine falcon known as the Hayabusa in Japan and the world's fastest bird. And that's what Suzuki called the GSX-1300R when it launched in 1999 and instantly claimed a seat in the pantheon of the world's most extreme motorcycles.

It looked bulbous chubby and bizarre earning it the nickname ""eye abuser"" but those Botticellian aerodynamic curves were function over form. The single-minded function was pure velocity and powered by the largest engine ever seen in a production sportsbike to that time the original 'Busa left riders and reviewers stunned with an out-of-the-box top speed somewhere around 194 mph (312 km/h). Outrageous.

The Blackbird instantly started looking like a nice little touring bike. True maniacs were riding Hayabusas. And even though the Japanese manufacturers reportedly entered into a famous ""gentleman's agreement"" to electronically limit all bikes after 1999 to 299 km/h (186 mph) – thus making them totally safe right? – the 'Busa kept its reputation as the speed freak's bike of choice by proving itself vastly overengineered. You could turbo these babies up over 500 horsepower with the right tuner in charge.

The 2022 Hayabusa becomes the third generation of this extreme hypersports tourer Suzuki

And it wasn't just the fastest production bike of the 20th century; it handled well too by all accounts and despite its stretched-out stance it was surprisingly comfortable. You could take it across the country on tour or take it to a drag strip with the mirrors still on and run a sub-10 second quarter mile. Its prominent logo – a Japanese kanji character for the name – was seared into bikers' minds and custom builders understanding the 'Busa's cachet took to it with considerable fervor. It's a truly iconic motorcycle and unrestricted 1999 models still command good money on the used market.

After a fairly minor model update in 2007 Suzuki has been threatening a third-gen Hayabusa for what seems like forever now sparking all sorts of fevered speculation and it's finally pulled the trigger with a 2022 model released on Friday.

If you were afraid the new model wouldn't look like a Hayabusa well fear not. There are some new flashes of color highlighting some new vents around the sides of the engine around the slightly more angular tail section and beneath the headlight in a new nosecone that takes some design cues from late-model GSX-R sportsbikes. But the elongated silhouette and the hulking twin exhausts are unmistakeable and that prominent kanji character still slashes across the side fairings.

Fully adjustable KYB suspension and a host of electronic rider aids will improve the Hayabusa's thrashability on a twisty road Suzuki

So what are we looking at under the skin? Could it be a turbo? An inline six? Something to knock Kawasaki's bonkers supercharged H2 off its perch? Erm no. Suzuki says it tested all such ideas in prototypes over the last decade but ended up coming back to an inline four displacing 1340cc about a shot glass more than the old models at 1299cc. All the better apparently to preserve the spirit of the legend or something.

But let's not get too disappointed; this is an all-new ground-up engine overhaul. Okay then what about the power? Dazzle us guys! ""The new Hayabusa's power output"" says a test rider in the launch video ""is about the same as on its predecessor."" I'm sorry what? ""The new Hayabusa performs comparatively better at low speed and marginally outdoes the previous generation when opening the throttle from low speed in sixth gear."" So ... a very modest overhaul keeping peak outputs around 187 hp but adding a little extra midrange poke for street riding.

Well it's certainly lost its spec-sheet shock and awe factor but this is still a very fast bike. And the further we look into this third-generation model the more dare we say sensible an update it looks like. An overhaul was necessary to keep the 'Busa in the good book with Euro-5 emissions regulations and Suzuki has taken the opportunity to upgrade the bike with a full suite of electronics.

The tapered triangle section shape of the exhausts offers extra lean angle – and there's few bikes you'd want to be on more when the road opens out like this Suzuki

So despite the familiar-looking dash with its big analog needles you're now looking at a fully ride-by-wire machine with a six-axis IMU and what's called a ""Suzuki Intelligent Ride System"" between the rider's inputs and the road. Traction control. Wheelie control. Launch control. Engine brake control. Combined cornering ABS braking. A bidirectional quickshifter. And for the practically-minded street rider there's cruise control hill hold control multiple power modes and an active speed limiter that lets you nominate a speed past which the bike will only accelerate if you give it a bit of a handful.

The brakes are top-shelf Brembo Stylemas. The suspension is adjustable from KYB but not active or electronic. The weight is still a lot more than something racy: 582 lb (264 kg) fully fueled. And while this should be a much friendlier beast to ride with all those computers looking after you the price is downright standoffish bordering on rude: US$18599.

Cockpit and switchgear features big twin analog dials surrounding a small color LCD Suzuki

This will be an excellent sport-touring motorcycle. It'll be much better on the road where these beasts spend most of their time than the old 'Busas. In my opinion it's better looking and although it's speed limited it remains a ferociously fast bike for highly experienced riders.

But this update makes it clear: the word Hayabusa doesn't mean what it did back when we were partying like it was 1999. Suzuki has no interest in challenging the H2 for outright power speed and road-registered insanity. The new Hayabusa is a big powerful smart and daily rideable hypertourer that's more than fast enough for you or I to terrify ourselves all the way to heaven on but don't mistake it for the world's fastest motorcycle. Those days are long gone.

Enjoy a detailed launch video below.

Suzuki new model reveal - 5 Feb 2021 - 0700 GMT

Source: Suzuki",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjd29ybGQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMzk0MDUxL2ludGVsLWJlbmNobWFya3Mtc2F5LWFwcGxlcy1tMS1pc250LWZhc3Rlci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i7 vs. Apple M1: Let's reality-check Intel's new claims | PCWorld,"After months of silence about Apple’s impressive M1 chip Intel just clapped back with a carefully crafted takedown of the Arm-based chip. It isn’t pretty.

Intel said its testing shows:

An 11th gen Core i7-1185G7 can match or greatly exceed the M1’s performance in a MacBook Pro in both native and non-native applications.

In battery life it’s pretty much a wash.

The MacBook Pro wouldn’t pass muster to be certified as an Evo laptop.

The M1 just won’t run a lot of software.

The new MacBooks have a range of compatibility issues from multiple monitor to game controllers  as well as many documented software plug-in problems.

In the parlance of our time it’s “shots fired” yet again with Intel highlighting problems in competing products. In November Intel did the same with AMD’s Ryzen 4000 which it found to suffer degraded performance when running on battery in many situations.

The normal reaction from outside observers and die-hard Apple fanboys is to dismiss these challenges as sour grapes. Intel however says it has benchmark receipts. Since we enjoy a good reality TV fight we’ll detail Intel’s claims and tell you whether to believe them or not.

Intel

Claim: MacBook M1 is slower than Core i7

Intel says in the WebXPRT 3 test using the same version of Chrome for both the Core i7 system as well as the Arm-native MacBook Intel takes the lead. The Intel chip was largely ahead in WebXPRT 3 and the x86 chip was nearly three times faster in finishing the photo enhancement test.

Intel doesn’t just use WebXPRT 3 though. It also shows the Core i7 pummeling the M1 in a PowerPoint-to-PDF export and in multiple Excel macros by a factor of 2.3x. And yes Intel used the Arm-native versions of Office for its tests.

Our take: We’d really need to run similar tests but we don’t doubt the results. Yes you may think one multi-billion dollar company publicly beefing with another multi-billion dollar company means “it’s all fake benchmarks” but that’s probably not the case because of the huge liability risk Intel might face. That’s why Diet Coke doesn’t outright call Diet Pepsi undrinkable swill (even though it is.)

What you can question is whether Intel picked tasks that favor its own CPU design. But even if you believed that it doesn’t invalidate the testing because exporting to a PDF is about as real—albeit boring—as you can get.

We’d also be remiss if we didn’t point out that WebXPRT 3 gives home-field advantage to Intel as the benchmark developer (Principled Technologies) and Intel have long had a relationship. That however doesn’t necessarily mean the benchmark favors Intel as AMD’s Zen 3 currently has the lead over Intel’s mobile CPUs. Nonetheless Apple fans are certain to say some fouls got missed by the refs here.

Intel

Claim: Core i7 Crushes M1 in AI

For content creation tasks Intel showed the Core i7 to be about 1.12x faster than the M1 in performing a 4K AVC-to-HEVC/H.265 file conversion. In this benchmark they had the MacBook using the M1-native version of Handbrake.

But the real destruction happens once you get to Topaz Lab’s Gigapixel AI and Denoise AI with the Intel Core chip crushing the M1 in AI-based noise removal and enlargement. Or maybe “crushing” is too nice a term as it’s more like the Core i7 outpaces the M1 by so much the M1 wishes it had never been designed.

Our take: As far as the video conversion goes we think it’s too close to call between both platforms and probably not something we’d gloat about if we were Intel. However on the AI features we think the results are pretty real because we have witnessed it ourselves with our own M1 vs Core i7 and Ryzen tests. The 11th gen Core i7-1185G7 so thoroughly thrashes AMD’s Ryzen 4000U and Apple’s M1 we thought about calling 911 for someone to go out to the house and do a welfare check.

We should point out that Topaz Lab’s apps are among the few (but nonetheless impressive) apps that were designed to take advantage of the hardware acceleration inside of Intel’s CPUs. When you have optimization for your hardware you get tons of performance gains. This is the same magic that’s made Apples phones shine for so long.

Claim: M1 doesn’t support all the features

Intel also gives itself the lead in Adobe Premiere Pro using the beta M1 native version in Auto Reframe exporting to H.264 and H.265. They’re decent wins but come on the code is still in beta for the Mac. That said Intel points out that important features like Content Aware Fill are outright disabled on the beta version and that’s a concern. If the native version of Photoshop comes out and there are critical features missing from it that’s a huge problem for Apple (and Adobe).

Intel

Gaming: You can’t be faster if you can’t run it

For gaming we see a bit of a back and forth between the Apple M1 and Core i7 in games that actually work on the MacBook. Intel doesn’t let it end there though and decides to embarrass Apple further by showing the numerous games where the MacBook scores a 0 because game support just doesn’t exist. Intel points out that “countless more” games “don’t run on the M1” and then for good measure it rushes Apple’s bench with a list 10 more games you can’t play on the M1 MacBook:

Overwatch Crysis Remastered Halo MCC Red Dead Redemption 2 PUBG Monster Hunter World Doom Eternal Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 Apex Legends Rainbow Six Siege.

Our take: OK we get it. Macs suck for gaming. All we can is say no rational person would disagree. For gaming the M1 Mac is actually about 10 feet below inferior as a gaming platform compared to the PC—unless maybe you count running GeForce Now cloud gaming on it?

Claim: MacBook wouldn’t win Evo certification

You know that fancy Intel Evo program that tries to improve laptop performance in key areas that annoy consumers? Well Intel pretty much says that if Apple submitted the M1 MacBook to the same program that Asus Dell HP Lenovo MSI Acer and others go through it would be rejected.

The reason? Intel says the M1 MacBook is too slow in doing things that anger consumers such as “switch to Calendar” in Outlook “start video conference Zoom” and “select picture menu” in PowerPoint.

Our take: We know of no AMD-based laptops with Evo certification either. So while Intel might think it’s an insult to Apple to deny Evo certification we suspect Apple won’t care about one less badge on its laptops.

Intel

Great battery life?

Perhaps the most shocking claim Intel showed deals with battery life. While performance tests can be cherry picked by those looking to prove an outcome battery life usually can’t be disputed.

Apple’s official claim gives the M1 MacBook up to 18 hours of battery life using Apple TV app to watch a 1080p video with the brightness set to “8 clicks from the bottom.” Apple also claims up to 15 hours browsing 25 “popular” websites with the same “8 clicks” criteria.

When Intel pitted a MacBook Air M1 against an Acer Swift 5 with a Core i7-1165G7 however it found both basically dead even. The MacBook Air came in at 10 hours and 12 minutes and the Acer Swift 5 lasted 10 hours and 6 minutes.

The difference? Intel said it used Safari to watch a Netflix stream with tabs open with the screen set to a relatively bright 250 nits. On the Acer Safari was subbed out for Chrome but the brightness and Netflix remained the same.

Intel did add that Apple’s “8 clicks up” is about 125 nits of brightness on the MacBook Air which is pretty dim.

Our take: We agree 125 nits is a pretty silly brightness to use for video testing. After all who wants to “watch” a movie on a laptop but then dims the screen so much you can’t actually see most of it?

Probably the largest disconnect here might be the difference between the Apple TV app which could possibly be highly optimized instead of Safari but it’s hard to believe Safari would not be heavily optimized already. We’d really want to do additional testing of our own here.

Intel

All kinds of things just don’t work on the M1

Intel didn’t just get into the performance of the M1. It also said it found the MacBook Pro had serious shortcomings such as an inability to use more than one display with a Thunderbolt dock.

And while the PC can use gaming headsets eGPUs a third-party finger print reader Wacom Drawing tablet and Xbox Controller Intel said it found the MacBook Pro simply doesn’t work with eGPUs and had multiple issues with other devices.

That’s just hardware incompatibility. Intel’s rap battle with Apple also highlights issues with plug-ins for Ableton Bitwig Studio Avid Pro Tools FL Studio Motu and many others.

Our take: The fact that the MacBook can only use a single external display is a big problem. We’d want to verify that ourselves but it’s a serious weakness in this multi-monitor world. Hopefully it’s just a bug from the new platform but for all we know it’s a limitation of the hardware too.

We’ve long said lack of eGPU is a major weakness because who doesn’t want more performance for gaming? But to be fair: We’ve already stressed the Mac is pretty worthless for gaming so what exactly do you need that eGPU for?

Intel’s take on the software issues is a little less problematic we think. When you pull up stakes and tell all of your developers to yet again rewrite software for yet another new architecture… well things will break.

The good news for M1 MacBook users is these applications and plugins will likely get fixed eventually. Mind you this doesn’t mean it’ll all get fixed for free. We’ve seen developers use the opportunity (which might be justified) to fix issues in the next version which by the way you have to buy again.

Intel missed acoustics

One point Intel didn’t cover and we know why is acoustics. One of the singular amazing features of the new MacBook M1’s is the near lack of fan noise (it’s there and you can kick it off by using Topaz Lab’s products) but every review has properly praised Apple’s dead silent operation. That’s something current PCs lose hands down.

Conclusion

While some will tut-tut that Intel’s digs at Apple are undignified we disagree. Apple is the one who first flung mud when it unceremoniously dumped Intel overboard so it’s within Intel’s right to fling mud back. Nonetheless we would want to test out some of Intel’s more serious hardware compatibly and battery life claims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL291dGRvb3JzL3plYnJhLW5mbC1yZmlkLW5leHQtZ2VuLXN0YXRzL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL291dGRvb3JzL3plYnJhLW5mbC1yZmlkLW5leHQtZ2VuLXN0YXRzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the NFL’s on-player RFID tags are quietly revolutionizing football,"The amount of data that gets captured during an NFL game these days is absolutely mind-blowing.

Recommended Videos

There’s so much that it’s almost hard to comprehend. But John Pollard vice president of business development for Zebra Technologies the official on-field player-tracking provider of the NFL paints a pretty good picture:

“Every player that participates in a game whether they’re on the sidelines or on the field has RFID tags in their shoulder pads.” he explained in an interview with Digital Trends. “Most players have two tags — one on each shoulder pad sometimes with a third one between the shoulder blades. All the field officials are also tagged as well as things like the pylons and the yardsticks on the field. The ball itself has an RFID tag as well. And all these tags communicate with a series of receiver boxes that are permanently installed around the perimeter of all the stadiums in the NFL.”

“The player tags send a signal to the receiver boxes 12 times per second.” he continues. “The ball itself blinks 25 times a second. And so with that information we can find out where they are on the field within a couple of inches of accuracy. From there we can tell a player’s proximity from their own teammates and the opposing players and we can also capture their speed for an independent play or a series of plays. On the ball we’re tracking velocity and rotational information as well which allows us to mathematically determine the height of throws punts and kicks.”

Stories from the Edge: NFL Bets Big on RFID IoT

In other words the NFL tracks real-time location speed and acceleration data for every player every object and every play on every inch of the field — and it’s been doing so for every regular season football game for the past seven years.

But here’s the kicker: Despite the fact that the league has been capturing this data for the better part of a decade we’re only now starting to see how it’s changing the game.

Deep stats deeper strategy

All this data collection has unlocked a completely new generation of stats. It’s far beyond the basic stuff you’re probably used to like touchdowns rushing yards and completed passes. Nowadays they track all that stuff plus speed acceleration location and time. But really those raw measurements are just the tip of the iceberg. There’s a whole host of derivative statistics that can be calculated by combining and correlating all these data points — things like Average Intended Air Yards Expected Completion Percentage and Completion Percentage Above Expectation. It’s a football nerd’s dream.

It also allows the NFL to measure things that were previously impossible to quantify — like aggressiveness. Prior to all this sensor-driven data a quarterback’s aggressiveness was a completely subjective quality with no real significance. Now it has a clear-cut definition: It’s “the amount of passing attempts a quarterback makes that are into tight coverage where there is a defender within one yard or less of the receiver at the time of pass completion or incompletion.” Such a stat would be impossible to define without exact time location and distance information but thanks to Zebra’s sensor tech this is being tracked and updated on every passing play a QB makes.

“It’s being incorporated into not only the strength and conditioning component of our training but also for coming back from injury.”

It doesn’t take a big leap of the imagination to see how this data might affect certain aspects of the game. For example it’s easy to see how deeper more granular and more abundant statistics on player performance might change what scouts look for in prospective recruits or help a coach make better decisions on what to focus on during practice.

But as New England Patriots linebacker Brandon Copeland explains training and scouting are merely the most obvious uses of data. Teams and players are using it for far far more than just performance tracking.

“It’s being incorporated into not only the strength and conditioning component of our training but also for coming back from injury” he tells Digital Trends. “That’s another thing that’s really big. Let’s say I just tweaked my hamstring. When I feel like I’ve recovered and I’m getting back up to speed I can literally go do a sprint to test that. When I walk off the field there’s somebody sitting there that can tell me exactly how fast I was going. So if they say ‘Oh well you’re a little slower than you were two weeks ago when you had no hamstring injury’ then I know there still may be something there that we need to to address. That kind of information is definitely vital from a player’s perspective.”

“So this information doesn’t just serve one purpose” he continues. “Guys pick and choose; they use all this data for different reasons. For some guys it’s more of an injury-prevention/maintenance thing. For others it’s a training thing. For other guys it’s more of a ‘hey let’s compete! I’m faster than you!’ kind of thing.”

A new dimension of play

Perhaps the most profound change of all though isn’t how data is altering the routines of players coaches and teams. It’s how data literacy — the ability to access interpret understand and apply data-driven insights — is quickly becoming a make-or-break skill for players. Much like tackling or kicking field goals using data is a skill that can be learned and improved on and the more adept a player is at leveraging data the more likely they are to succeed. Increasingly it’s what separates the rookies from the veterans.

“Rookie year is a whirlwind” says Copeland “especially as an undrafted free agent. There’s a lot of stuff going on. You’re trying to develop a routine learn the playbook and really just make the team. And there are so many resources out there that you could just swim in over your head. At first you’re just kind of going with the flow but at a certain point you figure things out and start to really understand the data. You realize that this resource exists in practice it exists in spring training and all the different things that we’re doing. A lot of veteran players take it into account.”

Copeland expects this to get easier as the technology matures. It’s taken the NFL years to build up not only the technological infrastructure to capture the data but also the distribution pipelines — which are still being figured out. The league hasn’t quite found its footing when it comes to making all this data accessible and easy to understand for players.

“Right now you have to go ask for that information.” says Copeland. “It’s always in the coach’s hands. But if we can encourage the coaches and staff to try to deliver that information to the players if we can continue to withdraw the barriers of access to the information I think that will be revolutionary in the long run.”

“I think this is the next evolution” adds Pollard. “The players in the NFL now they’re fluent in technology. They’re fluent in information. And they take care of the bodies like athletes have never before.

The recent trials “are producing truly impressive results” said Panasonic Avionics VP of connectivity solutions Jeff Sare in an interview with Runway Girl Network.

Being able to support a satcom-based streaming class of Internet service for passengers requires high-throughput connectivity hardware and ample satellite capacity. In recent years Panasonic Avionics grappled with a choke point in its network – that of a legacy modem which could not take full advantage of the spot beams on high throughput satellites (HTS).

Migration to the Gen-3 network has involved installing a new Newtec modem on aircraft fitted with Panasonic’s eXConnect-branded Ku IFC solution. Panasonic which counts Aer Lingus Emirates Etihad Airways American Airlines and United Airlines among its customers is set to complete the upgrade of the 2544 aircraft installed with its Ku connectivity service to Gen-3 within the next month.

Sare explained the upgrade process to RGN: “It wasn’t a difficult upgrade from a technical perspective it was effectively changing a server and a software load on an airplane. The bigger part was the upgrade of all of our teleports and making sure the infrastructure was there to support all our airplanes.

“We pushed forward and with a minor exception for one customer on a dedicated piece of the older network that was isolated already. [Outside of that] we have shut down the Gen-1 network and everyone is working on our Gen-3 network. It’s all good news. It has provided us with tremendous efficiency gains and probably more important tremendous reliability gains so we’re feeling very good about our network right now hence some of those streaming trials I referred to.”

Panasonic’s Gen-3 network supports faster Internet as well as improved video streaming VoIP applications 4G phone services and greater bandwidth for crew applications. Live TV picture quality and broader channel choice are also supported by the network.

Panasonic’s IPTV service which features Sport 24 and Sport 24 Extra channels – and is showcasing the Super Bowl today – was part of the airline trials. Sare said data from the tests will be shared with the market in the coming months.

Panasonic also reported last week that it is now availing of capacity on the “extreme throughput” APSTAR-6D satellite from APT Mobile Satcom (APSATCOM).

The satellite which Panasonic helped to design has entered service over the Asia-Pacific region including covering “a big chunk” of the gap in Ku coverage over the Pacific.

“It better manages the peaks it better manages the valleys” said Sare of the satellite.

Panasonic also has Ku HTS partnerships in place with Intelsat SES Eutelsat and others. Sare said it is now viable for Panasonic to “put a full streaming service out not only in terms of capacity and capabilities but also in terms of cost”.

The U.S. Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber could fly as early as 2021. And at least one Air Force general believes the new Northrop Grumman-made bomber could gain air-to-air capabilities in order to help it fight its way to its target.

There is some precedent for a bomber aircraft with a secondary air-to-air mission. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the U.S. Navy paid General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas billions of dollars to develop the A-12 Avenger II a stealthy carrier-launched medium bomber that was supposed to replace the Navy’s A-6 Intruders.

The A-12 was designed to carry two AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles in addition to air-to-ground weaponry. But the U.S. Defense Department canceled the A-12 in 1991.

What went wrong? For one the world changed -- and the secrecy surrounding the A-12 didn’t help either according to James Stevenson former editor of the Navy Fighter Weapons School’s Topgun Journal.

“After the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989 pressure for a ‘peace dividend’ increased” Stevenson wrote.

In July 1990 one month before Iraq invaded Kuwait Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney asked Congress for more A-12 money but his request was rebuffed — an indication that the military budget decline was serious. After Iraq invaded Kuwait the budgeteers had to scramble for even more money. This fight for funds combined with the impending military action guaranteed that some programs would be radically slowed reduced or eliminated. The A-12 ended up as one of those terminated programs. Cheney withdrew his support for the A-12 contract on Jan. 5 1991 freeing more than $500 million for the impending war effort that began 10 days later. On the other hand the F-22 squeaked through even though the Air Force did not procure its original requirement of 750 F-22s. It eventually managed to squeeze 187 of them out of the budget. In this case when black and gray programs competed the gray program — a lighter shade at that — survived in Darwinian fashion. Even though the A-12 was predicted to cost much less Congress bankrolled the F-22 while the Navy watched in tears as its A-12 program was carted away. And since the A-12 was secret the branch couldn’t mount a public defense.

Which is not to say the A-12 program was in good shape otherwise as David Montgomery explained in Air Force magazine in 1991. In fact workers were having a hard time building the prototypes.

“The biggest problem say officials stemmed from the difficulties of creating and applying highly advanced composite material in the radar-evading stealth plane” Montgomery wrote.

The two contractors had inadequate experience with this material to carry out the project smoothly and with a minimum of delay.

Evident mutual suspicion between the two contractors compounded the problem. One Pentagon analyst who studied the issue said the two A-12 contractors appeared loath to share sensitive technology to further the A-12 program. The reason: They were competitors on another project -- the program to build the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter. ""There were technologies that could have helped in the overall [A-12] effort but they weren't willing to share those"" said the analyst. ""If you have a technological advantage how willing are you to share that if ... it could help you in some other program?"" An overly ambitious schedule exacerbated the problem. Under the original timetable the contractors planned first flight for June 171990. They mapped out a design-to-assembly schedule of only nine months far shorter than the fourteen months normally allotted for such an effort. Workers in top-secret areas of plants operated by General Dynamics in Fort Worth Texas and by McDonnell Douglas in Saint Louis Missouri would spend four and a half months on subassembly. Sections would be shipped to Tulsa Oklahoma for final assembly. According to the report the manufacturers were only feeling their way along. They lacked proper tooling missed key target dates at various steps in the development process and were forced to issue ""stop work orders"" because of engineering problems. Delays in the arrival of parts further delayed production.

By contrast the Air Force insists that B-21 development is proceeding without any major complications. Of course the B-21 program also is highly secret meaning it’s impossible for outsiders to verify the Air Force’s sanguine claims.

But if the B-21 does fly in 2021 as planned and ends up including the air-to-air capabilities that have been proposed it could finally fulfill the A-12’s multi-role promise from nearly 30 years ago.

This is achieved through a combination of features usually including a monocoque design incorporating the cockpit and passenger sections and sometimes the engine compartment; underbody and side armour (which also provides protection against conventional threats such as small arms ammunition and rocket-propelled grenades); high ground clearance; a v-shaped underbody to deflect the energy of mines and explosive charges; and blast attenuating seats outfitted with five-point harnesses.

Birth of a New Vehicle Class

Development of the MRAP class of vehicles has its roots in the post-invasion occupation of Iraq. US Army and US Marine Corps (USMC) patrols in particular began incurring significant casualties when buried and roadside charges destroyed unarmoured and conventionally armoured light tactical vehicles such as HUMVEES. By late 2003 the Pentagon began looking for vehicles designed to meet the new threat.

As early as the 1970s the Rhodesian and South African armed forcers had introduced mine resistant vehicle designs. These became the basis for the MRAP vehicle concept. San Diego based Force Protection Inc. (FPI acquired by General Dynamics Land Systems or GDLS in 2011) presented the first MRAP design dubbed the COUGAR to the USMC in 2004. Results were impressive. By the end of that year the Marines reported over 300 IED incidents involving COUGARS; not a single service member was killed. Soon several variants were introduced based on both 4×4 and 6×6 chassis optimised for roles such as engineering Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) protected patrol and fire support.

By 2007 the US Department of Defense initiated a joint-service MRAP programme to develop and procure a greater variety of protected vehicles. The programme officially ran through 2012 and resulted in the procurement of nearly 28000 units with the majority going to the land forces. The vehicles fell into three categories based on size and function:

MRAP-MRUV (Mine-Resistant Utility Vehicle) the smallest and lightest category which included the COUGAR 4×4 NaviStar MaxxPro and BAE Systems CAIMAN 4×4 procured for urban operations;

MRAP-JERRV (Joint EOD Rapid Response Vehicle) which despite the designation was also used for convoy duty troop transport engineering and field ambulance service. Procured models included the GDLS RG-31E and the COUGAR 6×6 variant;

The third and largest category included only one type the GDLS – Force Protection BUFFALO MRV used for IED and mine-clearing.

Son of MRAP

While MRAPs were largely deemed successful in protecting occupants from IEDs (which may have ultimately discouraged IED deployment) they had drawbacks. They were much larger and heavier than conventional vehicles of similar capacity limiting mobility on damaged roads and bridges; the high centre of gravity increased the risk of rollover; and high fuel consumption imposed logistical burdens.

For this reason US forces began to significantly reduce their MRAP inventories when forces were drawn down in Iraq and Afghanistan while retaining a sufficient inventory to meet future requirements. The US Army for its part currently maintains two MRAP variants the MaxxPro family of vehicles and the Oshkosh MRAP All-Terrain vehicle (M-ATV). Both variants are 4×4 configurations with circa 1800 kg payload capacity and circa 500-600 km range. Combat weight without add-on armour runs between15000-22000 kg. Both variants have been upgraded since 2017 to extend service life and enhance performance. The MaxxPro family includes a stretched-wheelbase variant used as an ambulance and the MaxxPro Dash a lighter smaller and more mobile variant of the MaxPro family. The M-ATV is available in five mission-optimised configurations: armed assault special forces command vehicle engineering vehicle and utility transport.

Meanwhile the US Army and the USMC are procuring the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) in large numbers. They will eventually replace a major percentage of the current HUMVEE fleets (100 per cent in the USMC’s case). The JLTV is a direct derivative of the Oshkosh L-ATV the lighter-weight sister of the M-ATV. The JLTV itself incorporates major aspects of the MRAP concept including the TAK4i independent suspension system and a v-shaped hull to deflect blast energy from mines or IEDs. Oshkosh states that the multi-mission vehicle which comes in a number of configurations offers the same level of protecting as the MRAP while exceeding the manoeuvrability of the HUMVEE.

European MRAP Success Stories

Of course MRAPs are not only a US phenomenon. European partners – especially those engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq – soon recognised the utility of the new vehicles. By 2006 the UK was procuring COUGAR variants dubbed the RIDGEBACK and MASTIFF for service as protected patrol vehicles. Seven more European partners and Canada also procured the COUGAR and other MRAP models in the following years. Increasingly these were European-designed and produced vehicles.

These include the lightweight OCELOT MRAP (fielded in 2012 by the British Army as the FOXHOUND) which has been marketed by GDLS-UK since 2011. The dismountable crew pod enables the vehicle to be optimised for multiple tasks including troop carrier armed reconnaissance command and control and utility cargo carrier. The UK armed forces are exploring upgrades and innovations to keep the FOXHOUND relevant in years to come. In August 2020 GDLS-UK announced a contract by NP Aerospace under the UK Ministry of Defence Protected Mobility Fleet Vehicle Programme to demonstrate an electric-drive (e-drive) FOXHOUND vehicle. According to the firm the base vehicle already features an architecture that enables electrification; demonstration of the e-drive FOXHOUND is expected in early 2021.

Another European success story is the KMW DINGO. The heavily armoured 4×4 DINGO 2 MRAP is based on a Unimog chassis but adds a v-shaped underbody. Depending on configuration it can accommodate up to eight troops. The DINGO 2 was introduced as a demonstrator in 2003 and entered service with the German armed forces (Bundeswehr) in late 2004. It has been used extensively in Afghanistan where according to the German armed forces the DINGO has saved more service members’ lives than any other tactical vehicle in the Bundeswehr inventory. Building on this positive experience KMW has designed a larger heavier 6×6 variant designated the DINGO 3. This 20 tonne 6×6 vehicle boasts an additional five tonnes in payload capacity and accommodates up to 12 troops.

KMW introduced an even heavier MRAP the 25 tonne GFF4 (Geschütztes Führungsfahrzeug Protected Command Vehicle) in 2007. The vehicle was designed in cooperation with Italy’s IVECO which supplied the chassis. Also available as an ambulance and as an emergency and utility vehicle the GFF4 combines excellent mobility with a very high level of occupant protection. It remains in service with the German armed forces and as the VTMM (Veicolo Tattico Medio Multiruolo; Medium Multirole Tactical Vehicles) with the Italian Army.

Export Potential

MRAPs are in demand globally including in nations without the requisite production base.

North American and European manufacturers have developed steady export opportunities.

Globally NaviStar Defense’s MaxxPro family of vehicles is one of the most successful MRAP series with vehicles acquired by the armed forces in 28 European Asian or Middle Eastern nations. General Dynamics Land Systems’ international marketing includes the BUFFALO Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV). Widely regarded as the leading protected vehicle for route clearance missions the BUFFALO MRAP is fielded by the United States Canada the UK France and Italy.

GDLS also internationally markets the South African designed RG-31 family of vehicles which includes numerous variants including the AGRAB 120mm mortar carrier operated by the UAE. The versatile RG-31 Mk5 can be configured for seven different applications including combat engineering surveillance vehicle ambulance or armoured personnel carrier (capacity 4-10 depending on configuration). The RG-31 family is operated by 15 nations roughly half of them in Africa.

French producers are also strongly represented on the global export market. The Arquus BASTION to name just one vehicle has been sold to 17 nations mostly in Africa. The BASTION’s heavier sister the 14.5 tonne FORTRESS Mk 2 armoured personnel carrier was launched in 2020 and is also expected to perform well on the international market. In Europe it is under consideration for a major Polish Army acquisition programme.

Expanded Horizons

In addition to military applications MRAP vehicles are used by humanitarian organisations to protect relief workers from mines and other forms of attack. They also serve with law enforcement and domestic security agencies. This trend began in the United States where surplus military equipment is frequently transferred to federal state and local police agencies. Here MRAPs are most often used by anti-terrorism /hostage rescue/SWAT (Special Weapons And Tactics) teams. The formerly military vehicles normally require a refit to eliminate purely military features such as weapon turrets. US civilian federal agencies have also deployed MRAPs to rescue hurricane and flood victims who could not be reached by conventional vehicles.

Some European manufacturers are also offering MRAP variants to domestic security and police agencies. The newest capabilities package for the British Army’s FOXHOUND MRAP enables its deployment in the public order role. France’s Nexter for its part is offering the 6×6 TITUS (Tactical Infantry Transport & Utility System) – which comes in an impressive variety of military configurations including as a counterinsurgency vehicle and 120mm mortar carrier – and in several civilian variants as well. These include a homeland security/police assault model currently used by the French national police’s RAID (Recherche Assistance Intervention Dissuasion or “Search Assistance Intervention Deterrence”) special tactics unit and the TITUS WCT “Water Cannon Truck” for riot control.

The Renault (now Arquus) HIGUARD also serves with French police units as well as with internal security forces of two Middle Eastern nations.

Overall given the continued military requirement and the evolution of alternative civilian applications continued development and production of MRAPs seems assured for years to come.

Here is a rerun of our column on Heck — a tri-captain for Notre Dame's 1988 national champions — after last year’s victory by Kansas City versus San Francisco.

Fifty years ago in January 1970 linebacker Jim Lynch became the first Notre Dame football player to win both a national title with the Fighting Irish and a Super Bowl achieving the latter with the Kansas City Chiefs. On that Golden Anniversary in February 2020 Andy Heck became the most recent former Irish player to join that unique company (see below)— and likewise with the Chiefs as their offensive line coach. How fitting the symmetry is between Lynch and Heck. Lynch’s freshman year in 1963 saw the Fighting Irish finish 2-7 yet his senior year in 1966 when he was the lone team captain they were consensus national champs. Likewise Heck’s first two seasons in 1985-86 were the school's first back-to-back losing campaigns in the 20th century (5-6 both times) but as a senior captain he helped steer a 12-0 finish and most recent national title. Lynch and Heck were real-life versions of the mythical Jack Armstrong All-American Boy fashioned in days of yore by General Mills. They especially embodied Notre Dame with their natural leadership traits skill determination scholarly demeanors and immense pride in the school they represented. At both Notre Dame and Kansas City Heck said becoming No. 1 went beyond talent. “For me it’s more about seeing the similarities of what separates a good team a really good team and then a championship team” Heck said. “Our championship team at Notre Dame was talented — but maybe not as talented as the next two years. But there was some magical if you will combination of leadership chemistry grit and certainly we had to have some breaks go our way. “Similarly we had talent here at Kansas City but also football guys who created the right leadership and chemistry. It’s a terrific culture we got going. We also had to have some breaks go our way and they did. That sure reminded me of ’88. “Just one bad bounce of the ball and you don’t end up undefeated or you don’t end up coming back from 24 points down in a playoff game [24-0 versus Houston before winning 51-31]. It was very special that way.” Lynch played 11 years in the NFL and started each of his final 140 games (including playoffs) while Heck played 12 seasons with 164 starts along the offensive line. Incidentally both also had brothers who played football at the Naval Academy.

THE RISE TO GLORY

A member of head coach Gerry Faust’s final recruiting class at Notre Dame in 1985 the Fairfax Va. native Heck’s affinity for the school — his other official visits were to Stanford and North Carolina — outweighed the football program’s struggles on it. The Irish posted a modest record of 25-20-1 from 1981-84 and Faust was on the hot seat during Heck’s freshman year as a tight end. A 5-6 finish in 1985 culminated by a 58-7 defeat at Miami resulted in a coaching change to Lou Holtz. Personnel shortages and an extremely arduous schedule produced another 5-6 outcome in 1986. However the 1986 season that saw Notre Dame lose five games by 14 points — including 24‑23 to Big Ten champ Michigan 21‑19 at SEC champ LSU and 24‑19 to national champ Penn State — ended with a dramatic 38-37 victory at archrival USC after trailing 37-20 in the fourth quarter. Heck scored his first career touchdown in that game and later bulled through several would-be tacklers for a crucial two-point conversion that cut the deficit to 37-35. Improvement continued the next season with an 8-1 start in which Heck became the full-time starting tight end and a prolific blocker while finishing with five catches for 59 yards and a touchdown. Alas the Irish lost their final three games while getting outscored 80-30 and the staff was shaken up again with several new assistants hired most notably esteemed offensive line coach Joe Moore. Still the consecutive No. 1-ranked recruiting classes in 1987 and 1988 that included the top-rated tight ends in Frank Jacobs (1987) and Derek Brown (1988) fueled optimism about the future. “I’m sure they had talked about it as a staff but Joe Moore first approached me and said ‘Hey would you like to play in the NFL?’” the 6-6 Heck recalled. “I said ‘Yeah that’s definitely a dream of mine.’ Then he said ‘You should think about coming into my room because you’re not going to make it as a tight end but you have a shot as a tackle.’”

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

Heck changed his jersey number from 88 to 66 and that winter began a process of caloric intake that elevated his playing weight by about 30 pounds to 265 (“267 at the NFL Combine” Heck said) — a runt by today’s standards but large enough back then when sophomores Mike Heldt and Tim Ryan (a converted linebacker) were listed at 258 and 245 as the starting center and guard respectively. Among the 1988 team members there has been a universal theory that the unit had the ideal balance of swagger tempered by humility. Sophomore stalwarts Chris Zorich (nose tackle) the late George “Boo” Williams (defensive tackle) Todd Lyght (cornerback) Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks among others — plus freshmen such as Brown wideout Raghib “Rocket” Ismail and drop end Arnold Ale — provided a powerful infusion of talent. They combined with the superb and steadfast leadership of upperclassmen such as Heck Mark Green Ned Bolcar Tony Rice Anthony Johnson linebackers Frank Stams Wes Pritchett Ned Bolcar and Michael Stonebreaker and safeties George Streeter and Pat Terrell etc. — all of whom had experienced the throes of losing seasons and kept the team grounded with supreme dedication and focus. Only four career starts (all by guard Tim Grunhard) returned along the 1988 Irish offensive line — but Heck uplifted everyone on the unit with positive but firm standards. “You can’t say enough about what he did for us that year” Moore said several years later. En route to the national title Notre Dame became one of a handful of teams in history to defeat four teams that finished in the Associated Press top 10: No. 2 Miami (31‑30) No. 4 Michigan (19-17) No. 5 West Virginia (34-21) and No. 7 USC (27-10). Heck ended up earning first-team consensus All-America honors and was the No. 15 overall pick in the 1989 NFL Draft.

LIFE IN THE NFL

After his 12th season as a starter in the NFL Heck knew the direction of his next chapter. “I was ready to leave the game physically because of the toll it took on my body but I was not ready to leave the competition the feeling you have after a well-earned win — there’s no feeling like it” Heck said. “The preparation the practice … the best part is that satisfaction and great feeling you have of a group of guys in this sport pulling together and earning a win.” While breaking into the coaching world at Virginia from 2001‑03 as a graduate assistant the thought of returning to Notre Dame in a coaching capacity was a viable goal but not after he was hired by the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars as an assistant and gradually rose the ladder. The reason was simple: the grind of recruiting. “I have so much respect for what those college coaches do” Heck said. “If you want to be good in recruiting there’s no free time. If you have free time you better be recruiting writing a kid somehow someway regardless. To me it just doubled the job. “In the NFL it’s more about strictly the coaching. I liked being more focused on that especially as I was starting a young family. It’s awfully challenging to be a college coach these days.” He feels especially blessed to have been at only two locations the past 17 years: Jacksonville (2004-12) and Kansas City since 2013. “That doesn’t happen very often” Heck said. “I love being in an NFL stadium on Sunday. I still get chills during The Star-Spangled Banner. I feel like it’s an honor and privilege to be competing at the highest possible level.” Now in his third decade of marriage to his wife Jennifer who he met at a freshman mixer at Notre Dame they are the parents of four — son Jon and triplets Charlie Molly and Evelyn. Jon was a four-year starting offensive tackle (50 career starts) for the North Carolina Tar Heels (2013-16) and is now a strength coach there. Charlie who as a 150-pound high school freshman was a soccer goalie started 34 games also at offensive tackle at North Carolina from 2017-19 and is an NFL prospect. Both were offered opportunities as preferred walk-ons at Notre Dame — a la current Colin Grunhard son of Heck’s former teammate. (Grunhard has graduated and is now a graduate transfer at Kansas.) “On some level it was disappointing” Heck said of neither son getting a scholarship offer by the Irish “but both were late bloomers. I’m not sure I would have offered them myself at Notre Dame when you look at the type of talent Notre Dame brings in. “On the other hand I thought the University of North Carolina was a great fit for both of them. I sure would have loved for my boys to play at Notre Dame but I couldn’t be prouder of what they accomplished at North Carolina.” Meanwhile Molly and Evelyn graduated from Notre Dame in the spring of 2019. One can’t spell Andy without ND.

Co-Ordinate Earth Tones

Trav takes a page out of his contemporary Mr West’s book when it comes to earth tones. Kayne has made a living off selling shades of brown green and black and the 90210 rapper looks to do the same. For the average styler earth tones can be easily achieved with some simple oversized tees. Alternatively you can turn things all the way to the max with Stone Island cargos a white Visvim shirt and some ‘Stussy’ Nike Dunks. Ultimately to get to Mr Lit’s level you’ll need to dress your Lamborghini Aventador SV and Range Rover Sport in similar garms.









Oversized Coats and Jackets

In the eyes of Travis Scott the best type of outerwear is a jacket that simply doesn’t fit. Which is lit if you’ve got the budget to flex a $40k down Louis Vuitton puffer. If you want a word of advice from us we recommend rocking one size up at most. That is unless of course you’ve got the big kahunas for a Dior or LV silhouette. For a good well and truly over-fitted fit we recommend looking at logo based designer outwear from the likes of Louis Vuitton Burberry Dior and Undercover.









Pull out ALL the sneakers

La Flame has pulled out some of the rarest and absurdly expensive sneakers in the game. Unfortunately we’ve never had the chance to see inside the collection but thankfully he’s got no issue putting the rarest sneakers in the world on foot. While his sneakerhead legitimacy is regularly questioned one could easily argue Trav might have the most influence in the sneaker game. “For the next generation of consumer he has a tremendous influence” StockX CEO Scott Cutler told Forbes.

The ‘Pick Up the Phone‘ rapper has an addiction to rare Nike Dunks. In fact he might’ve started the Dunk train that we’re riding today. While there’s little to no chance you’ll ever even find a pair of these shoes for sale we can at least marvel in the rarity and price. In 2020 Trav collaborated with Nike on a pair of 4 Elevated Outfits to Nail Warm Weather Transitional Dressing but if you’re looking to get your hands on a pair you’ll have to fork up over $2k. That’s still a fraction of the cost of the $30k ‘Freddy Kruger’s‘ in the image above.









Japanese Over Everything

Trav loves pulling out the lesser-known brands from Japan. Well they were lesser-known before he put them on. He’s found “swag in Tokyo” from some of the most influential artists and designers including Nigo and Takashi Murakami. As such his style has shifted to incorporate patchwork and cut and sew pieces. The move presents a blessing and a curse for the fashion savvy. Whenever Travis puts together an outfit literally everything he wears sells out. If you’re looking to get these Japanese garms most brands can be found online through the likes of Farfetch. Do you want some rarer pieces? Well you’ll have to travel to Japan for that. Unless of course you’re best friends with Nigo. Looks for brands such as Visvim Kapital Needles Junya Watanabe and Engineered Garments for a start.









Vogue Vintage Flair

The rapper loves super-rare vintage tees and if we’ve learnt one thing you simply don’t go and buy these pieces. To understand how rare these pieces are take one look at the price. A 1980s Akira t-shirt printed on a ‘Fashion Victim’ blank will likely set you back upwards of AU$1000. Flame has an entire wardrobe of vintage t-shirts and he loves to pair them with skinny jeans fitted tracksuit pants and Rick Owens sweats. To finish off the Travis Scott vintage outfit you can rock a pair of Style Guide: How to Dress Like Donald Glover or something a little more pricey such as the rappers own Jordan 1.









Finesse High Fashion

Mr Maison Margiela blunts Louboutin double cups are always going to be wearing the “highest in the room”. Trav doesn’t just wear high fashion he lives it. The “high fashion” rapper will occasionally pull out some of the rarest and most expensive garments in existence. He finesses high fashion he’s able to expertly pair rare pieces that cease to flaunt logos and tags. This form of curation is at the upper echelons of style you show those who know and interest those who don’t. Take this Celine Silk Shirt from S/S 2011 this runway shirt is so rare it lacks a care tag.

If you’re looking to rock this Travis Scott look on a budget just remember that logos aren’t everything. You must be selective with prints and patterns. Look for more affordable garments from the likes of Universal Works Our Legacy and Dries van Noten.

Here are seven ways to think about that.

1. Here is what happens in the ad that General Motors will air during the Super Bowl: Standing in a garage inspired half by the storage unit in True Detective and half by the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia conspiracy meme Will Ferrell announces that the United States has not adopted electric cars as quickly as Norway. He punches a globe. He fetches his friends Kenan Thompson and Awkwafina (he is on a first-name basis with both as celebrities always are); they set off for Norway. Along the way Ferrell describes GM’s new EV fleet. “GM’s Ultium battery is made for all types of vehicles so soon everyone can drive an EV” he says.

2. It is a normal Super Bowl ad: oversaturated slightly self-aware blandly patriotic. The setting a luxe subdivision is normal. The interactions are normal. (The pandemic appears not to exist.) And triumphantly the cars are normal. Ferrell is driving a silver luxury crossover which is as much the iconic family car of this decade as the station wagon was the iconic family car of the 1970s. Awkwafina and Thompson are driving GM’s new Hummer.

The only twist is that both cars—Ferrell’s Cadillac Lyriq and his friends’ Hummer EV—have electric motors. Gone are the humpty-dumpty lines of older GM electric vehicles such as the Chevy Bolt. Gone is the playboy sensuality of the Tesla Model 3. These are normal American cars being driven in a normal American Super Bowl ad. Since the modern era in American climate politics began in 1988 when the NASA climate scientist James Hansen informed a U.S. Senate committee that the long-hypothesized threat of global warming had begun to make itself felt 33 years of effort—from environmentalists scientists activists engineers bureaucrats politicians the whole societal caboodle—have gone into this moment of making electric cars seem normal.

3. The point of the ad isn’t Norway. Norway is the MacGuffin the foil for Will Ferrell’s hapless masculinity. The point of the ad is that America has lagged behind other rich countries in adopting an important piece of consumer technology which is (1) correct and (2) partially GM’s fault.

Read: Why Biden is buying 645000 new cars

Like it is GM’s fault recently. Ferrell was an inspired choice because there’s a certain type of Will Ferrell character—the flabby guy misled by his vanities who eventually winds up in the right place partly because of others’ love—that mirrors GM’s past few years. Because GM has had a change of heart on EVs and it has had it since October.

4. Which is why it’s noteworthy that GM is running this ad—because GM has lately lagged behind its crosstown rival Ford. In 2017 Mary Barra GM’s CEO sat next to Donald Trump when he announced a rollback of climate-pollution rules. Ford’s executive chairman Bill Ford opposed that rollback the next year. When the Trump administration sought to strip California of its power to regulate vehicle pollution GM joined in the lawsuit. Ford and four foreign automakers took California’s side.

GM in fact continued to argue that California did not have the power to regulate vehicle pollution until November 23. Then it abruptly announced that after thinking about it—and perhaps after reviewing the election results—the company had decided that California did have that power all along. A pre-Thanksgiving miracle!

This final misery capped four years of defeats. The American public has never seemed to absorb how completely the car industry—and how much GM specifically—fumbled under Trump.

Read: An inside account of Trump’s fuel-economy debacle

In 2016 the industry celebrated Trump’s win: Finally here was a pro-business president that it could really work with! What it got instead was a parade of expensive inconveniences. The Obama administration had for instance put in rules meant to decrease the carbon pollution that cars emit from their tailpipes; automakers wanted those rules weakened; the Trump administration froze them entirely—a drastic change that had more costs than benefits. Trump harangued GM on Twitter without warning and threatened to impose new tariffs on its supply chains. And the White House declined last year to extend the federal tax credit for EVs a move that harmed Tesla and GM specifically while helping foreign automakers.

Federal support for these kinds of policies matters. EVs command 54 percent of the market share in Norway not because Norwegians love Tesla but because Norway has thrown a small fjord’s worth of incentives and mandates behind them. It is safe to say that had Trump won 81000 more votes across four states we would not be talking about this ad at all.

5. Ferrell really should have carpooled with Thompson and Awkwafina. They would have prevented more emissions that way. (And to be clear: EVs alone won’t eliminate carbon pollution from the transportation sector—we also need electric buses better trains and more public transit—but they’re much better than gas-powered cars.)

6. In the future Americans’ mass adoption of electric vehicles will seem inevitable. After all EVs cost less to run than gas-powered cars (because electricity is cheaper than gas); they require cheaper maintenance; they break less; they are quieter. For many types of drivers—daily commuters for instance or errands-around-towners—they are already preferable to gas-powered cars.

But their triumph was never written in stone. Last September California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered that by 2035 all new cars and light trucks sold in the state had to be emissions-free. That goal was “ambitious but feasible” pronounced one clean-energy analyst. And this was remember a goal of California a state that has always led the country in air-pollution control. Yet in late January GM announced that it wouldn’t have any gas-powered cars to sell by 2035—because that was its deadline for going all electric.

To repeat: 20 or 30 years from now Americans’ mass adoption of electric vehicles will seem like something that was always going to happen. I can tell you from where I’m sitting it’s never felt inevitable before. It feels inevitable now.

7. GM is still a profit-driven company so regulators should seize this moment. Now that the company has demonstrated such deep and sincere concern for America’s rate of EV adoption regulators should bind it—and every other automaker—to even more ambitious schemes. After all that’s what Ferrell Thompson and Awkwafina would want.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvZ20tc3VwZXItYm93bC1hZC13aWxsLWZlcnJlbGwtbm9yd2F5LWV2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM's Super Bowl ad finds Will Ferrell challenging US to out-EV Norway,"General Motors just aired its first ad during Super Bowl 55 and we now have the answer about why Will Ferrell dislikes Norway so much. If you watched the teaser you'll know the theory I put forth was correct.

Ferrell teams up with fellow comedians Kenan Thompson and Awkwafina (Nora Lum) to journey to Norway in an effort to give the country a piece of his mind when it comes to the Scandinavian country's wild adoption of electric cars . Ferrell and GM think the US can do so much better. Over in Norway over half of all cars sold are electric. Here in the US that figure is just 4% according to GM's data. Essentially GM wants to rally the troops back home to get them pumped for a slew of new EVs coming by 2025. You'll also spy shots of the Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer EV throughout -- just two of the 30 models coming by the automaker's current count.

GM pushes the message with Ferrell's signature brand of goofy comedy that's hard not to enjoy though the fact none of the crew actually ends up in Norway seems to sort of defeat the message a tiny bit. Nevertheless it's a Super Bowl-appropriate chuckle that further extends the automaker's latest ""Everybody in"" marketing message. The automaker promises it's serious about putting more Americans into electric cars and it comes on the heels of the Biden administration tossing its weight behind zero-emissions powertrains too.

As states around the world pile on debt to combat the coronavirus pandemic and bolster flagging economies fears of such possible seizures have only amplified.

Seen this way China’s internationalization—as laid out in programs such as the Belt and Road Initiative—is not simply a pursuit of geopolitical influence but also in some tellings a weapon. Once a country is weighed down by Chinese loans like a hapless gambler who borrows from the Mafia it is Beijing’s puppet and in danger of losing a limb.

The prime example of this is the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota. As the story goes Beijing pushed Sri Lanka into borrowing money from Chinese banks to pay for the project which had no prospect of commercial success. Onerous terms and feeble revenues eventually pushed Sri Lanka into default at which point Beijing demanded the port as collateral forcing the Sri Lankan government to surrender control to a Chinese firm.

The Trump administration pointed to Hambantota to warn of China’s strategic use of debt: In 2018 former Vice President Mike Pence called it “debt-trap diplomacy”—a phrase he used through the last days of the administration—and evidence of China’s military ambitions. Last year erstwhile Attorney General William Barr raised the case to argue that Beijing is “loading poor countries up with debt refusing to renegotiate terms and then taking control of the infrastructure itself.”

As Michael Ondaatje one of Sri Lanka’s greatest chroniclers once said “In Sri Lanka a well-told lie is worth a thousand facts.” And the debt-trap narrative is just that: a lie and a powerful one.

Read: What happens when China leads the world

Our research shows that Chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country much less the port of Hambantota. A Chinese company’s acquisition of a majority stake in the port was a cautionary tale but it’s not the one we’ve often heard. With a new administration in Washington the truth about the widely perhaps willfully misunderstood case of Hambantota Port is long overdue.

The city of Hambantota lies at the southern tip of Sri Lanka a few nautical miles from the busy Indian Ocean shipping lane that accounts for nearly all of the ocean-borne trade between Asia and Europe and more than 80 percent of ocean-borne global trade. When a Chinese firm snagged the contract to build the city’s port it was stepping into an ongoing Western competition though one the United States had largely abandoned.

It was the Canadian International Development Agency—not China—that financed Canada’s leading engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin to carry out a feasibility study for the port. We obtained more than 1000 pages of documents detailing this effort through a Freedom of Information Act request. The study concluded in 2003 confirmed that building the port at Hambantota was feasible and supporting documents show that the Canadians’ greatest fear was losing the project to European competitors. SNC-Lavalin recommended that it be undertaken through a joint-venture agreement between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and a “private consortium” on a build-own-operate-transfer basis a type of project in which a single company receives a contract to undertake all the steps required to get such a port up and running and then gets to operate it when it is.

The Canadian project failed to move forward mostly because of the vicissitudes of Sri Lankan politics. But the plan to build a port in Hambantota gained traction during the rule of the Rajapaksas—Mahinda Rajapaksa who served as president from 2005 through 2015 and his brother Gotabaya the current president and former minister of defense—who grew up in Hambantota. They promised to bring big ships to the region a call that gained urgency after the devastating 2004 tsunami pulverized Sri Lanka’s coast and the local economy.

We reviewed a second feasibility report produced in 2006 by the Danish engineering firm Ramboll that made similar recommendations to the plans put forward by SNC-Lavalin arguing that an initial phase of the project should allow for the transport of non-containerized cargo—oil cars grain—to start bringing in revenue before expanding the port to be able to handle the traffic and storage of traditional containers. By then the port in the capital city of Colombo a hundred miles away and consistently one of the world’s busiest had just expanded and was already pushing capacity. The Colombo port however was smack in the middle of the city while Hambantota had a hinterland meaning it offered greater potential for expansion and development.

Read: The undoing of China’s economic miracle

To look at a map of the Indian Ocean region at the time was to see opportunity and expanding middle classes everywhere. Families in India and across Africa were demanding more consumer goods from China. Countries such as Vietnam were growing rapidly and would need more natural resources. To justify its existence the port in Hambantota would have to secure only a fraction of the cargo that went through Singapore the world’s busiest transshipment port.

Armed with the Ramboll report Sri Lanka’s government approached the United States and India; both countries said no. But a Chinese construction firm China Harbor Group had learned about Colombo’s hopes and lobbied hard for the project. China Eximbank agreed to fund it and China Harbor won the contract.

This was in 2007 six years before Xi Jinping introduced the Belt and Road Initiative. Sri Lanka was still in the last and bloodiest phase of its long civil war and the world was on the verge of a financial crisis. The details are important: China Eximbank offered a $307 million 15-year commercial loan with a four-year grace period offering Sri Lanka a choice between a 6.3 percent fixed interest rate or one that would rise or fall depending on LIBOR a floating rate. Colombo chose the former conscious that global interest rates were trending higher during the negotiations and hoping to lock in what it thought would be favorable terms. Phase I of the port project was completed on schedule within three years.

For a conflict-torn country that struggled to generate tax revenue the terms of the loan seemed reasonable. As Saliya Wickramasuriya the former chairman of the SLPA told us “To get commercial loans as large as $300 million during the war was not easy.” That same year Sri Lanka also issued its first international bond with an interest rate of 8.25 percent. Both decisions would come back to haunt the government.

Finally in 2009 after decades of violence Sri Lanka’s civil war came to an end. Buoyed by the victory the government embarked on a debt-financed push to build and improve the country’s infrastructure. Annual economic growth rates climbed to 6 percent but Sri Lanka’s debt burden soared as well.

In Hambantota instead of waiting for phase 1 of the port to generate revenue as the Ramboll team had recommended Mahinda Rajapaksa pushed ahead with phase 2 transforming Hambantota into a container port. In 2012 Sri Lanka borrowed another $757 million from China Eximbank this time at a reduced post-financial-crisis interest rate of 2 percent. Rajapaksa took the liberty of naming the port after himself.

By 2014 Hambantota was losing money. Realizing that they needed more experienced operators the SLPA signed an agreement with China Harbor and China Merchants Group to have them jointly develop and operate the new port for 35 years. China Merchants was already operating a new terminal in the port in Colombo and China Harbor had invested $1.4 billion in Colombo Port City a lucrative real-estate project involving land reclamation. But while the lawyers drew up the contracts a political upheaval was taking shape.

Rajapaksa called a surprise election for January 2015 and in the final months of the campaign his own health minister Maithripala Sirisena decided to challenge him. Like opposition candidates in Malaysia the Maldives and Zambia the incumbent’s financial relations with China and allegations of corruption made for potent campaign fodder. To the country’s shock and perhaps his own Sirisena won.

Steep payments on international sovereign bonds which comprised nearly 40 percent of the country’s external debt put Sirisena’s government in dire fiscal straits almost immediately. When Sirisena took office Sri Lanka owed more to Japan the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank than to China. Of the $4.5 billion in debt service Sri Lanka would pay in 2017 only 5 percent was because of Hambantota. The Central Bank governors under both Rajapaksa and Sirisena do not agree on much but they both told us that Hambantota and Chinese finance in general was not the source of the country’s financial distress.

There was also never a default. Colombo arranged a bailout from the International Monetary Fund and decided to raise much-needed dollars by leasing out the underperforming Hambantota Port to an experienced company—just as the Canadians had recommended. There was not an open tender and the only two bids came from China Merchants and China Harbor; Sri Lanka chose China Merchants making it the majority shareholder with a 99-year lease and used the $1.12 billion cash infusion to bolster its foreign reserves not to pay off China Eximbank.

Before the port episode “Sri Lanka could sink into the Indian Ocean and most of the Western world wouldn’t notice” Subhashini Abeysinghe research director at Verité Research an independent Colombo-based think tank told us. Suddenly the island nation featured prominently in foreign-policy speeches in Washington. Pence voiced worry that Hambantota could become a “forward military base” for China.

Yet Hambantota’s location is strategic only from a business perspective: The port is cut into the coast to avoid the Indian Ocean’s heavy swells and its narrow channel allows only one ship to enter or exit at a time typically with the aid of a tugboat. In the event of a military conflict naval vessels stationed there would be proverbial fish in a barrel.

The notion of “debt-trap diplomacy” casts China as a conniving creditor and countries such as Sri Lanka as its credulous victims. On a closer look however the situation is far more complex. China’s march outward like its domestic development is probing and experimental a learning process marked by frequent adjustment. After the construction of the port in Hambantota for example Chinese firms and banks learned that strongmen fall and that they’d better have strategies for dealing with political risk. They’re now developing these strategies getting better at discerning business opportunities and withdrawing where they know they can’t win. Still American leaders and thinkers from both sides of the aisle give speeches about China’s “modern-day colonialism.”

Over the past 20 years Chinese firms have learned a lot about how to play in an international construction business that remains dominated by Europe: Whereas China has 27 firms among the top 100 global contractors up from nine in 2000 Europe has 37 down from 41. The U.S. has seven compared to 19 two decades ago.

Chinese firms are not the only companies to benefit from Chinese-financed projects. Perhaps no country was more alarmed by Hambantota than India the regional giant that several times rebuffed Sri Lanka’s appeals for investment aid and equity partnerships. Yet an Indian-led business Meghraj joined the U.K.-based engineering firm Atkins Limited in an international consortium to write the long-term plan for Hambantota Port and for the development of a new business zone. The French firms Bolloré and CMA-CGM have partnered with China Merchants and China Harbor in port developments in Nigeria Cameroon and elsewhere.

The other side of the debt-trap myth involves debtor countries. Places such as Sri Lanka—or for that matter Kenya Zambia or Malaysia—are no stranger to geopolitical games. And they’re irked by American views that they’ve been so easily swindled. As one Malaysian politician remarked to us speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss how Chinese finance featured in that country’s political drama “Can’t the U.S. State Department tell the difference between campaign rhetoric that our opponents are slaves to China and actually being slaves to China?”

The events that led to a Chinese company’s acquisition of a majority stake in a Sri Lankan port reveal a great deal about how our world is changing. China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another. And it would be a shame if the U.S. fails to learn alongside them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFzY2llbmNlY2VudHJhbC5jb20vNC1idXNpbmVzcy1tb2RlbHMtb2YtcDJwLW1vYmlsZS1wYXltZW50cy1hbmQtc3VjY2Vzcy1mYWN0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Business Models of P2P Mobile Payments and Success Factors - DataScienceCentral.com,"The increasing penetration of smartphones across the world combined with the high-speed & reliable internet connectivity that is now available has made it possible for financial service providers to enable payments via mobile devices. The mobile payment apps are here to create a world where the cashless economy shines.

E-wallet apps available in current times not only allow users to make payments effortlessly but they also offer several other financial services i.e. book movie tickets savings recommendations buy bonds and securities et cetera.

Most developed as well as developing economies are distancing themselves from using physical currency. The developed economies in particular are very committed to this culture shift of utilizing payment technologies. For instance in the United Kingdom NFC technology is used to enable contactless payments at bus and tube stations.

The e-wallet trend grew further while the entire world was locked down due to the pandemic. To be precise many countries across the world realized a decrease of 80% in the use of ATMs. Even the ‘grey’ and ‘black’ markets saw a downfall in the cash usages. A cashless society has many advantages such as transparent financial status and taxation crime reduction convenience and hygiene.

Indeed the cashless society is a nearby reality and the usage of e-wallets and peer-to-peer mobile payment apps will continue to rise. While you might already know what e-wallets are the peer-to-peer mobile payment might seem a new term to you. Hence let’s dig further into the rabbit hole of mobile payments:

What are P2P Mobile Payment Apps

Peer-to-peer mobile payment apps are designed to enable individuals to make instant payments to friends relatives contractors shopkeepers and many others. We consider them modern e-wallets if they incorporate features among mobile recharges movie ticket booking and also offer virtual credit/debits cards.

The p2p mobile payment apps allow users to transfer funds to the receiver’s wallet or bank account. The wallet to wallet transfers are instantaneous but if there is any bank included in the transaction it can take between seconds to days to transfer the funds.

4 Business Models for P2P Mobile Payment Apps

Currently the FinTech ecosystem has four business models for p2p mobile payment apps. These are Bank-Centric Standalone Payment Services Social or Messaging Platforms and Mobile Device or OS Manufacturers. Let’s find out more about the top three in detail:

Bank-centric p2p mobile payment apps

Apps like Dwolla Zelle clearXchange are built on the bank-centric business model. Instead of storing money into the app these p2p mobile payment apps directly draw money from the user’s bank account and make payment to the merchants.

Standalone payment services

The most popular examples of standalone payment services are Ant financial PayPal Vodafone M-Pesa Airfox and Square Cash. Many countries worldwide allow these standalone payment services providers to officially mediate in financial transactions. This allows standalone payment service providers to offer both online and in-person p2p and c2b payments.

Standalone mobile payment apps often have a digital wallet that enables seamless payments without requiring users to draw money from bank accounts. Considering low penetration of conventional banking services in many underdeveloped and developing nations standalone payment services are the best way to bank the unbanked.

Social and messaging platforms

Payment platforms like Square Cash Snapchat G Pay WeChat Facebook Messenger and the most popular one Whatsapp operate under this business model. As social platforms have gained popularity among the majority of the population worldwide social platforms have seen a huge potential in introducing payment features into their social apps.

What made them Successful? – PayPal and Alipay

The pioneer and #1 – PayPal

Elon Musk was very quick to anticipate and respond to the potential of money transfer through the internet. Earlier Elon Musk founded x.com an online bank which later bought PayPal and gained more board members who cumulatively paved the way for a successful online payment industry.

The most crucial success factor for PayPal was its timely acquisition of rising companies in its ecosystem. They acquired Braintree Venmo Xoom Modest VeriSign and Paydiant and also tied up with MasterCard which established them as a successful player in the online payment industry.

PayPal’s critical success factors were:

Blue ocean business strategy

Early anticipation of internet potential

Timely acquisition and partnership within the ecosystem

Harnessing network intelligence

Focusing on standing as a credible business on an international level

The critical success factors that paved success for Paypal are:

Alipay: Chinese PayPal… quite better

Recently the global FinTech market was in shock when the world’s biggest IPO (potentially $34.5 billion) got canceled. Alipay is a subsidiary of the same company Ant Group. Although the USA may brag about its success in financial technology implementations China has proved to be the largest market for P2P mobile payments.

During the first ten months of 2020 Mobile payment transactions in China reached a record $12.8 trillion which clearly is far greater than the $49.3 billion of transactions for the USA in the same period.

The following are the success factors for Alipay:

Good Artists Copy – Alipay had the advantage of Alibaba’s ecosystem and Ant Group’s financial core. The mobile payment solution was launched in 2004 to provide online payment and escrow services in the market. It all began with a similar feature and business model as PayPal but later on Alipay expanded its reach and became a one-stop solution for online payments.

Leveraged versatility – Alipay provided the escrow service almost free of cost. With more and more businesses utilizing their escrow services (as they were very inexpensive) Alipay started having a bulk of funds in their working capital. Alipay utilized these billions of dollars to offer credit and money-market funds to earn interest. All of this was supported by the sister companies – Ant Cash Now and Ant Credit Pay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9ucmkvbWlncmF0ZS93aHktaXMtaXQtc28tYW5ub3lpbmctdG8tc2VuZC1tb25leS1hYnJvYWQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODA3MzI5NjIuY21z0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25yaS9taWdyYXRlL3doeS1pcy1pdC1zby1hbm5veWluZy10by1zZW5kLW1vbmV5LWFicm9hZC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODA3MzI5NjIuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is it so annoying to send money abroad?,If you have ever spent significant time abroad or tried supporting family overseas you know that the process of sending money internationally can be stressful. It costs time and money — often too much of both. There’s hope that global crypto currencies will make this process easier but until those become more accepted you’ll have to find other ways to save.I remember returning to New Delhi after a semester at Yale University in Connecticut some years back and trying to move what I had in U.S. dollars to my bank account in India. The process of remitting these savings was so clunky – involving applications in banks in both countries — that I just used my U.S. debit card until the account ran dry. I’m sure I paid a bunch of fees and got short-changed on currency conversion costs but I found it easier to spend this money rather than spending time trying to find a cheaper way.Although the costs of remitting have fallen in recent years they’re still above the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of 3% per transaction by 2030. A world bank study shows that the overall average costs of transmission were 6.5% in 2020 with sending money digitally costing slightly less and sending via bank transfer slightly more.That means for every $100 you want to remit abroad you really only send around $93 on average. This varies depending on how you move your money and by where you’re sending money to and from. For example remitting from a Group of Twenty ( G20 ) country will on average cost just more than 3% if it’s going to India but more than 6% if it’s going to South Africa. When money is sent within Sub-Saharan Africa fees can into as much as 20% of the amount.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)That’s a heavy cost for what should be a simple transaction. According to the World Bank global citizens sent and received more than $650 billion in personal remittances in 2019. That means we lost around $45 billion to costs alone.Fortunately there are a few things you can do to lower your own costs when trundling money around the world. But keep in mind that exact costs will depend on where you are and where you’re remitting to.First it helps to know that there are two main components of the cost in sending money abroad: the fees of the bank or transmitting entity you use and the foreign exchange margin they make when they buy at the lower end of the currency exchange rate and sell at the higher end. You should check both before you move any money. You’re getting a good deal if your total cost — fees plus the currency exchange margin — is lower than 5% of the transaction amount. If you’re being offered 8% of the amount that’s generally too much.You should also consider where you go. There are four entities that will do the job: banks credit and debit cards traditional money transfer firms and fintechs. No surprises here that the banks and cash transfers cost the most and fintech firms the least.If the country you’re remitting to allows for exchanging mobile money through e-wallets then that’s likely to be the cheapest way to send and receive money. Find a licensed regulated entity that works between the geographies you want to move money between and check if the total cost is less than 5%. But keep in mind that certain places don’t have wallets that work with each other and that there may be country specific rules around the movement of money.Cost isn’t the only consideration either. Perhaps it’s worth paying the higher bank transfer fees because you get the greatest sense of security from going through that institution. It usually helps to find others you who have made similar payments and see what worked best for them.Of course what you decide to use will ultimately depend on your goals. Are you trying to set up a child who’s just moved abroad? If so going through a bank is still your best bet. And you’ll want to make sure they have at least two months of rent food and other expenses in cash since setting up cross-border bank accounts takes time.Are you sending money back to your family on a regular basis? Then you’ll want a cheaper fintech solution if possible otherwise a bank will remain your friend. If you’re just traveling for a short period (once we’re traveling again) you can simply use your debit or credit cards to get access to your own money — check with your card company though about any foreign transaction fees — or you can use mobile money in the form of e-wallets.No these solutions aren’t perfect and yes the remittance system remains a headache. We can only hope that as crypto currencies gain acceptance moving money across countries will become as fast easy and cheap as moving money within them.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnZlbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTMyMzcvbWlzc2luZy1wYXltZW50cy1yZWdpb24tbG9ja2luZy1hbmQtbG93LXBheS1jYXN0ZXJzLWZlZC11cC13aXRoLXVuZmFpci1wYXktaW4tdmFsb3JhbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missing payments region locking and low pay: Casters fed up with unfair pay in VALORANT,"Source: Proving Grounds

At the end of January VALORANT casters found out they were region locked and then all hell broke loose. Because that was nowhere near the end of it.

After finding out that VALORANT Champions Tour will have region locked casting — at least for the first stage — many casters became vocal about this disruption in their plans for 2021. One of those casters was Dustin ""dusT"" Mouret and Vincent ""Zescht"" Talmon-Gros. It was looking like the duo wouldn't be able to cast together for VCT after doing so at Nerd Street's First Strike NA Qualifiers and Winter Championship.

""Nerd Street was interested in continuing to work with us as a duo but I was recently told since Vince is from the UK he can't work on NA VCT"" dusT wrote on Reddit. ""This really hurts as I felt Vince and I were starting to really find our footing in commentating VALORANT and were keen on staying consistent and continuing to work on our craft. Working VCT together would have given us a lot of reps AND the VCT takes up a huge chunk of the overall competitive calendar generally.""

dusT added that he's not sure where this leaves either of them now as well as other casters from various regions that also can't be a part of the NA VALORANT Champions Tour. This includes Kevin ""AVRL"" Walker a caster from New Zealand who has almost exclusively commentated for the North American VALORANT scene.

The issue was discussed on a recent issue of VALORANTING hosted by Mitch ""Uber"" Leslie Alex ""Vansilli"" Nguyen and Loviel ""Velly"" Cardwell all professional casters. The three commentators debated why Riot would region lock casting for the VALORANT tournament with Vansilli pondering if Riot wanted each region to ""build local talent."" But this concept didn't sit well with the panel.

""There's a lot of big casters in NA from Overwatch and stuff. The VALORANT casting pool in NA is insane. It's really rough"" Velly said.

Uber noted it may be a budget issue. He said he's ""too expensive"" for Nerd Street's events. He said it may also be an immigration issue and not wanting to deal with visas and other complications. Vansilli wondered if it was the logistics of flying out casters.

""If you're splitting up these duos they are going to have to find works in their region. Look at me for an example. I've done First Strike and everything but it doesn't mean I'm going to do all the events. I don't even know if I'm doing upcoming events or not"" Vansilli said.

That brought up an entirely different issue. The three casters admitted they had all been undercut by Riot and other tournament organizers many times. Exasperated Uber wondered who was deciding the casting budget for these events.

It seemed that there was no available budget for casters at Nerd Street Gamers when the TOs decided to hold a casting challenge. Uber explained that the duo that won would get to cast the Closed Qualifiers for no payment.

""This is not okay"" Uber ranted. ""If you don't have the budget for a broadcast don't fucking broadcast the game. Do not cheapen the value of esports broadcasting talent. Do not for one minute think I can't see through the fact that you just couldn't afford to pay people to broadcast those games. This is no substitute for developing talent.""

In the comments on YouTube one of the amateur casters that took part in the Closed Qualifiers corrected Uber by noting that they were paid by Nerd Street Gamers although it ""wasn't the industry standard."" The casters took it because it was their first opportunity to cast a Riot event.

Valorant event organizers step up after callout

While the three casters hosting VALORANTING agreed that they believe in VALORANT the way that casters are constantly being ripped off is unacceptable. And it wasn't just Nerd Street Gamers.

After expressing concern over his future as a caster due to region lock dusT admitted that he also hadn't been paid by Pulse Arena nor had any other casting talent five months after the tournament broadcast. He hadn't even received an update since September.

Other casters from the event decided to put pressure on the unresponsive TOs by making their similar situation public as well. And nobody would have ever expected who stepped up to try and make things right for the casters. It was Nerd Street Gamers.

The same day that Vansilli had called out Nerd Street Gamers on VALORANTING he received an invoice from the TOs so they could pay Vansilli what Pulse Arena owned him. The same request was given to the other casters and observers from the Pulse Arena tournament.

""My biggest and humblest thanks"" Vansilli said admitting that this would prevent him from ""eating ramen noodles for the duration of my casting grind.""

It's safe to say that the esports community quickly changed their mind about the tournament organizers. C9 White player Mel even called them the ""real deal"" on Twitter.

Other casters like dusT also shared the news. dusT has also been consistently sharing his excitement over covering Nerd Street Gamers' NA VALORANT action. While it's disheartening that his usual duo can't be with him it seems that dusT's outlook on 2021 has definitely improved. And it seems that many casters' outlook on Nerd Street Gamers' and other TOs has improved as well.

While dusT and many other casters are still hoping that Pulse Arena will be ""brought to justice"" this step up by Nerd Street Gamers has sweetened the once sour attitude that many casters had for the Riot scene going into this already tumultuous year.

Maybe casters are not being as undervalued as they think. Or maybe they were — and tournament organizers have recognized that and want to change it going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3doeS1wYXlwYWxzLWRlY2lzaW9uLXRvLWNhbGwtaXQtcXVpdHMtaW4taW5kaWEtZG9lc250LWNvbWUtYXMtYS1zdXJwcmlzZS9hcnRpY2xlMzM3NjE4MDMuZWNl0gGQAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvd2h5LXBheXBhbHMtZGVjaXNpb24tdG8tY2FsbC1pdC1xdWl0cy1pbi1pbmRpYS1kb2VzbnQtY29tZS1hcy1hLXN1cnByaXNlL2FydGljbGUzMzc2MTgwMy5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why PayPal’s decision to call it quits in India doesn’t come as a surprise,"PayPal’s decision to shut down domestic payment operations in India at a time when digital transactions are hitting new records every month may come as a surprise but it was just a matter of time.

While PayPal did not give the reasons for existing the booming Indian market experts who have been tracking the company in India say that the existing business model based on UPI and regulations around it was not in sync with the American company’s ambitions.

Troubles with RBI

The company which has been offering cross-border payments in India for over a decade had launched its domestic operations in India in 2017. But its troubles with RBI had begun in 2011 when the company was forced to suspend personal payments to and from India and transfers to local banks in India. This came after the RBI asked the company to comply with Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999. PayPal remained in the cross-border transaction business for several years after that until 2016 when the company appointed Anupam Pahuja as the country head for India. Pahuja’s mandate was to expand PayPal’s operations in India. In 2017 the company took a bunch of Indian journalists to its headquarters in San Jose California where the company showcased its services in the US market indicating that some of the services could make their way to India.

In an interview with BusinessLine  PayPal’s President and CEO Dan Schulman said that after giving merchants the opportunity to grow their businesses by connecting with customers outside of India PayPal wants to give Indian merchants an opportunity to grow domestically as well. There were also reports about the company acquiring a stake in Indian payment company but that it never fructified. In 2019 Pahuja identified travel sector as one of the key areas for the company in India. “It is high up on the priority list. We are dominant in most of our core developed markets thus we started looking at other markets. We saw a layer of growth that India provides. Our expectation is to be one of the top three players in India in the travel segment in the coming year or so” Pahuja had said then. Then the Covid pandemic happened and the travel industry came to a standstill.

Legal battle

Meanwhile Delhi High Court issued a notice over a petition filed by Abhijit Mishra alleging that the global payments major had violated Section 4(1) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007. Amid this legal battle other global players including Google launched payment services in India and cornered a large share.

In the middle of 2020 Paypal realised that it will have to link up with UPI if it wants to offer a meaningful service in India. “If it had a choice PayPal would have wanted to roll out payment services on its own. It wasn’t comfortable with the UPI model. This is one of the reasons why it delayed the launch even as other players got into the market quickly” said an executive who worked with PayPal earlier.

Final nail

Just when it was planning to roll out its UPI platform the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) came up with a new set of rules in November 2020 that imposes a cap on the share of Unified Payment Interface transactions that a single payment application can process. NPCI said that third-party applications providing payments services via UPI can process a maximum of 30 per cent of the transaction volumes starting Jan. 1 2021. This seems to have been the final nail in PayPal’s plans for India.

“From 1 April 2021 we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses and shift focus away from our domestic products in India” PayPal said in a statement without giving a reason for its decision.

Now he’s leaving the only home he’s known in big league baseball and for Oakland no less.

This will take some getting used to.

Trading Elvis for former Rangers killer Khris Davis was anti-climactic and probably the best of outcomes for all parties. Elvis had already lost his job at shortstop to Isiah Kiner-Falefa and faced the unseemly prospect of playing third until Josh Jung’s ready. Or worse the ignominy of sitting next to Roogie Odor instead of playing next to him.

Now Elvis gets a shot at replacing the departed Marcus Semien on a potential playoff team.

But it marks the end of an era nonetheless not to mention the six degrees of Elvis Andrus in Rangers lore.

“On behalf of the Texas Rangers I want to thank Elvis Andrus for the tremendous impact he has made on our organization over the last 12 years” said Ray Davis the Rangers’ chairman and managing partner. “His play on the field his connection to our fans and his work in the community have played an integral part in shaping our franchise.

“He will forever be a member of the Texas Rangers family. We wish him the very best.”

He was a key piece of the blockbuster 2007 trade with Atlanta — Neftali Feliz Matt Harrison Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Beau Jones were the others — that sent Mark Teixiera to the Braves pushed the Rangers over the hump and the monkey off Jon Daniels’ back at least temporarily. Less than two years later Elvis was the Rangers’ starting shortstop and the juice of back-to-back World Series teams.

He made Michael Young a third baseman and Adrian Beltre a big brother. He was at the heart of Rangers’ franchise highlights. He scored ahead of Josh Hamilton after the latter’s 10th inning home run that briefly hauntingly gave Texas the lead in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series.

He was also the crux of a lowlight: Two inexplicable errors in the seventh inning of Game 5 of the AL Division Series in Toronto.

No matter what happened on the field Elvis remained remarkably unchanged and forever young. Even now at 32 after 12 seasons as a Ranger he doesn’t seem much different from the 20-year-old kid who made the jump to the big leagues in 2009 and held up his end on two World Series teams. If he only briefly lived up to that early promise he remained a fixture in the Rangers’ infield and clubhouse.

If he failed to measure up to the great shortstops of his generation he gave the club energy and led the league in smiles.

Not that it probably matters much to fans but Elvis also was the consummate pro when it came to the media. Win or lose he stood in front of his locker ready to answer for himself as well as his team. Even if it’s supposed to be part of the job description not everyone gets it.

Elvis had his faults but I’ll miss him. It’ll be strange seeing him in green and gold.

I mean Joey Gallo was a gold glove winner in 2020 and it’s clear he gets the nod on opening day. However noise kicks every day wondering if and when the Rangers will push the trade button on Joey Gallo. Talks are that it’s not “if” the Rangers trade Joey Gallo but “when” will the Rangers trade him? Well there’s another aspect to that. What happens in right field “if” and “after” the club deals Gallo. Here are some thoughts if the club looks internal or external.

David Dahl

The Rangers acquired David Dahl in December thanks to Joey Gallo’s sales pitch. Dahl will turn 27 come opening day and was an All-Star for the reeling Rockies in 2019. In his career Dahl played sixty games in right field and twenty-four back in 2019 (two last year). Sure David’s primary position is left field but switching him over to right is a viable option. Though I’ll say it’s awkward for Dahl to take over Joey Gallo’s spot a fellow friend and a reason why Dahl went to Texas.

Eli White

The Rangers got the first look at Eli White in 2020. While Eli’s luck on the offensive side didn’t look great (had many bad luck at-bats) the club got a look at some excellent defense. White’s work consisted of left field with the other outfield spots sprinkled in. Eli didn’t commit an error in his 128 innings of work in the outfield. It’s curious to speculate what the Rangers’ eventual plans are for Eli White but the club got some cheerful looks last season though it’s doubtful he’ll be up in the first portion of the year.

Willie Calhoun

If Willie can duplicate his 2019 performance the Rangers will have to look at numerous ways to give Calhoun some playing time. After the season Jon Daniels said he didn’t want Willie to get comfortable as an everyday designated hitter. In my honest opinion I don’t see that happening before or after the trade deadline. Calhoun is working on improving his defense and the Rangers are taking notice. Is Willie the defensive answer for Gallo? Not really but from a lineup perspective I can see Willie being a dangerous middle of the order guy similar to Joey (if he continues his 2019 trend).

Keep Joey Gallo?

Let’s look at the opposite side of the spectrum. The Rangers could keep Joey Gallo and get an extension done and there you have your franchise player. I mean think about it the club drafted him he wants to be a Texas Ranger the fans love Joey and he made his initial mark on Globe Life Field. In 2021 Joey Gallo is the first name many think of when thinking Texas Rangers. Is keeping him a possibility? Well of course but remember where the club is at the moment. The Rangers are in a rebuild mode and likely out of contention for this year and next year. Joey’s small salary at the moment could be digging gold for other teams but the key is how the market will operate at the trade deadline. It’s a slippery slope and gets more slippery as time passes.

Courtney Denard and her husband Rob Kirkconnell were gathered with family at Christmas a few years back when a weird feeling came over Ms. Denard.

The pair along with Mr. Kirkconnell’s parents operate Valleykirk Farms Ltd. a dairy farm with around 60 milking cows. For decades that meant planning life around morning and afternoon chores. But earlier that year on Halloween Valleykirk fired up its new robotic milking system. And with that the cows no longer dictated when Christmas dinner – or any dinner – is served.

“I looked at Rob and said: ‘Oh my gosh we don’t have to go home and milk cows’” Ms. Denard said. “‘We can stay at Christmas the whole time.’”

Valleykirk’s 2017 renovation project cost $1.3-million and roughly doubled the farm’s debt which spooked Ms. Denard when it came time to sign the loan. But the robotic milking and feeding systems freed up time made chores less strenuous and reduced the need for hired help. Ms. Denard and Mr. Kirkconnell have more time to rest spend time with their three-year-old daughter and manage their herd near Owen Sound Ont.

“The biggest epiphany for me that our life has changed is we can eat family dinner” Ms. Denard said. “There is a direct line between automation and our improved happiness on the farm.”

Ms. Denard is not alone. While farmers are at higher risk for stress anxiety and depression compared with the general population researchers have linked automation and technology to improved quality of life in agriculture. A new study out of the University of Guelph goes further connecting farmers’ well-being to the welfare of their animals.

Meagan King shaped the study which included 28 dairy farms in Ontario and about 2100 cows in all and was published in Animal Welfare a peer-reviewed journal. The farms all had robotic milking systems and some like Valleykirk had a second layer of technology: automated feeding systems. Farmers in the latter category reported better mental health and their cows were in better shape the study found. Investigators however have not determined whether healthier farmers raise healthier animals or whether healthier animals make farmers healthier. They suspect it goes both ways.

“Whether it is a positive or negative situation how a farmer is doing will impact their ability to manage their cows’ health” Prof. King now at the University of Manitoba said. “They really see how their herd is doing as a reflection of their work and so if their cows are healthy they feel a lot of pride in that.”

Automation can increase profit which may lead to happier farmers. But Trevor DeVries a professor at the University of Guelph who holds a Canada Research Chair in dairy cattle behaviour and welfare said research shows money is not the primary reason farmers are automating.

“The greater reason is typically associated with the quality of life – both of themselves and their cows” he said.

Morgan Overvest grew up on a farm in Ontario and moved home four years ago to get more involved. Her family’s operation has a robotic milking system but not automated feeding. Her days revolve around feeding cattle which drives anxiety. She said automated feeding would save their operation known as Overdale Farms roughly three hours of labour each day.

“That would definitely take some pressure off” said Ms. Overvest who studied at the University of Guelph and participated in the study as a farmer. (A new feeding system on their farm however would mean revamping their storage system creating other headaches.)

But even switching to robotic milking made life better on Overdale Farms she said. “Your day becomes so much more flexible” she said. She and her husband do not have children but she can see how automatic feeding would make it easier to expand their family. “You can go to your kid’s soccer game or you have dinner with your family at five o’clock rather than eight o’clock.”

Yonhap



By Lee Min-hyung



Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have reportedly abandoned their position as large short-selling holders of shares of Celltrion and HLB two Korean stocks most vulnerable to the trading practice amid an escalating fear that they could end up mired in a possible Korean version of the GameStop saga.



According to the Korea Exchange the two major investment banks were excluded from a list of ""large short-selling holders"" for Celltrion and HLB respectively as of Feb. 1.



Officials from Credit Suisse declined to comment on details over the issue saying that they were not authorized to speak on market issues.



Investors with the position refer to those whose short-selling balance exceeds 0.5 percent of outstanding shares of a listed firm here.



The move is seen as part of their movement to hedge risks amid concerns over the possibility of heavy losses as in the recent ""stock war"" between U.S. hedge funds and retail investors surrounding GameStop.



This is the first time since January 2018 that Goldman Sachs has been excluded from the list. It also marks the first time for Credit Suisse since April 2019.



For now only two companies ― Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley ― retain the status for Celltrion. Three global investment banks ― Merrill Lynch Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Global Market Securities ― also have more than 0.5 percent of shares for short-selling in HLB.



But with Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse abandoning the position the balance of short-selling for the two Korean biopharmaceutical firms has declined by a huge margin. As of Feb. 1 Celltrion's short-selling balance reached 4.92 million shares up 1 million from the previous trading day. The portion of the short-selling balance out of outstanding shares reached 3.65 percent. This is the first time in more than four years that the figure dropped to the 3-percent range.



The short-selling balance of HLB also came in at 2.77 million shares down by 520000 during the same period. The short-selling balance portion also dropped to 5.24 percent from the previous 6.22 percent. This is the lowest in more than two years since October 2018.



On the same day foreign investors engaged in a mass buying spree of Celltrion and HLB proving that the two investment banks launched a massive short-covering campaign to prevent them from being stuck with huge losses.



""Chances are that the investment banks' decision to reduce their short-selling balance of the two Korean companies was due to escalating worries of a Korean version of the GameStop saga"" an official from the investment industry said explaining why the two banks took preemptive measures.



""Retail investors are asked to remain thoughtful before purchasing bio shares vulnerable to short-selling disputes"" the source said.



In January Melvin Capital a hedge fund based in the U.S. is known to have lost around 53 percent of its total capital by betting against retail investors in GameStop. The estimated loss from for investors ― including Citron Research another big hedge fund along with Melvin ― betting GameSaga would fall is known to reach $5 billion.



A dispute surrounding short-selling is a major talking point here after the financial authorities decided to extend a ban on short-selling until May 2. This came in response to a growing call from retail investors that the resumption of the practice only favored foreign and institutional investors.

Now the brothers are graduating from Yale University.

The 22-year-old “Quad Squad” from Ohio decided to go to the same university while choosing different majors because they were determined to be apart while staying together.

""We lived on four different corners of campus so sometimes we would go weeks or a month or I’d run into my brother and go 'Oh yeah you go to school here too” Aaron said according to Today.

Nick graduated with a degree in political science with a minor in Arabic; Zach double majored in chemical engineering and economics; and Nigel received his degree in molecular cellular and developmental biology. Aaron double majored in computer science and psychology — and graduated with his brothers — but will spend one more semester at Yale to finish his senior thesis.

“Zach will be out in San Francisco at Goldman Sachs and Nick is at Goldman in New York City but living in New Jersey and Nigel is doing research in New Haven"" Aaron said according to Today. ""It feels like an extension of our Yale experience so I imagine that the frequency with which we see each other will be the same.""

Once Aaron is done with his senior thesis in December he’ll be moving to New York City to work for Google.

""To know no matter what I’m going through I have three siblings who are in the exact same place in their lives"" Aaron said. ""It’s really special to know I have these three other people who know me better than anyone in the world."""

According to Zanesville High School Principal Chad Grandstaff that's OK. In fact it's preferred.

“It’s not so much finding what you want to do it’s eliminating what you don’t want to do"" he said. ""Once you eliminate that you find out what’s sitting out there in front of you — that’s what you want to do.”

He said the prospect of a career can be overwhelming for students of any age. With a growing emphasis on a credential society Grandstaff said school officials don't want to leave any students without resources who may not want to go to college.

But going to college isn't the only way to be successful he said which is why educators have put students on the ground at all types of local businesses exposing them to occupations ranging from to manufacturing and welding to law offices and retail.

They can test the waters with job shadowing field trips and one-on-one meetings with business leaders to help them find a way to what they want to do someday.

By putting successful local companies like Halliburton and others in arm's reach of the students the goal is to provide concrete examples of where they could be in a number of years.

It's part of what Zanesville educators call the Life Plan program.

But as interests evolve through their teen years as often happens with teenagers that plan will never be set in stone Grandstaff said. That's a strength not a weakness.

""We want to encourage that. It's OK to change your mind"" he said.

Students can choose their own paths

In recent years the high school has started implementing more hands-on real-world programs. The goal is to help students directly translate what they're doing in the classroom to what they can someday do for a living.

A lot of that has stopped during the pandemic and the school is offering virtual options like videos but the hope is to keep morale up once students can start visiting businesses again in person.

While there's always time to prepare students for a post-secondary education college prep isn't the only thing students have access to. Even as a traditional high school educators try to make vocational careers visible to students as options.

""We wanted to make sure we matched that same intensity and focus for those kids that aren't going to go to college — because it's just not something they want to do — but they are great with a lot of other skills that will benefit them"" Grandstaff said.

Students can start meeting with counselors in middle school and discuss interests and talents.

But how do you get a teenager to think about their woodworking hobby or journaling in terms of a career? Concrete examples are a good place to start Grandstaff said which is why local businesses are brought into the equation.

One student interested in a certain university program may want help setting up a college visit.

Another may want to see certain occupations up close with a day of job shadowing meeting with local business leaders to build connections or taking group field trips to companies.

When students come into the shop suddenly abstract concepts like ""manufacturing"" start to make sense Stewat-Glapat CEO Bill Stewart said.

Pre-pandemic students could tour the a Zanesville engineering and manufacturing company specializing in conveyor belt systems and see what goes into making the 95-foot machines.

""As in most businesses there is a continuum of skills and work environment you an explore"" he said.

Stewart once taught the robotics program at the high school but he still takes an interest in guiding ZHS students.

The school has taken numerous field trips to the plant through the years. Stewart will take them around and introduce to them to different employees.

Although he said many of the young people are timid a number of them become enthusiastic when immersed in the plant.

""The thing I always say is there’s no one in our business who doesn’t do an important job"" he said.

Duncan Yarnall was a student of his. After finding a knack for robotics and receiving encouragement from Stewart he participated in Zane State's Pathways to Engineering program something encouraged for students who want to get a headstart on college.

That allowed him to obtain an associate degree at the same time he got his high school diploma. Stewart later hired him to work in assembly and Yarnall later transitioned to electrical helper although Yarnall said he initially was more interested in the mechanical side.

""That's the cool thing about the Pathways to Engineering program it's such a broad program. That's how I got in here with electrical (work)"" he said. ""It really opens up your options.""

Translating academics to the future

Making companies visible to students is part of the equation but educators still want enthusiasm in the classroom.

So local companies are getting involved to get children excited about hitting the books.

Halliburton Zanesville has participated in what is known at the high school as the Challenge Program.

Students have to meet certain academic marks and winners are selected in five areas — attendance STEM community service academic improvement and academic excellence — for a $500 scholarship.

It's an event Halliburton district manager Clayton Dupree looks forward to every year.

Dupree climbed the company ranks with only a high school diploma and entry-level experience working in oil fields in the beginning. It's a story he likes to share with the winners of the Challenge Program.

""When you're 18 19 20 years old you don't need to have a 35-year plan for your career because you're constantly finding new things"" he said. ""An entry-level job may not be all that appealing to them ... (but) it's not about that job it's about the next job you want to get.""

The high school offers 15 dual-enrollment courses through Zane State College and Ohio University Zanesville. Courses in pre-engineering biomedical and computer science with curricula from national nonprofit Project Lead the Way are also offered.

Also on the horizon are several programs that Grandstaff said will help students directly translate the classroom to a career.

The district is implementing a solar energy array that will power some of the schools but there will also be a curriculum surrounding it. Students can learn hands-on how their clean energy system works.

Superintendent Doug Baker has said a goal is for students to learn skills that can someday be translated in the advanced energy and solar energy sector.

Graduates face a massive workforce so the school acknowledges how daunting it can be for young people to make those decisions on their own.

""Our goal is when the student here receives their diploma the next day when they wake up they know exactly what they're doing"" Grandstaff said.

HARTFORD Conn. — Family and community leaders gathered in a vigil on Webster Street after one man was gunned down at the end of last month.

Emotions were still high during the vigil as the family of Dudley honored his memory.

Kearnan Collins said ""Michael was not another statistic he was not another person that lived in the streets or anything like that he was just a great person that like to look out for his friends and his family and he died doing exactly that.""

Collins is Dudley’s cousin and says Dudley died protecting his friend during an altercation this past month.

Hartford police have not released why the altercation started but sent out a statement announcing the arrest of Register.

Police have charged Jordan Register with murder going on to say they found Register in Springfield Massachusetts and took him into custody without incident.

Community leaders say they hope this arrest brings the family peace.

During the vigil Rev. Henry Brown said ""So many families don't have the closure that you have so many people who don't know who killed their son.""

Dudley's family say they are still hurting but they will always remember the good times spent with Michael.

Collins said. ""His laugh I love his laugh... It could light up a room it was amazing.""

Dudley’s younger brother Aneudi Suarez said ""His smile his laugh he was always happy; there was never a dull moment there was never a dull moment with Michael.""

Suarez says he's still trying to cope with this loss.

Suarez said ""At first when I found out I shut my phone off... I couldn't even like... I started panicking because I read one little sentence and I shut my phone right off. I called my brother my brother started freaking out and that just made me freak out and eventually I had to deal with it.""

The family may be hurting but say they will get through this together.

Collins said ""It's really bad right now but that's because he touched so many people. He was so close with everybody and was so loved other than that everybody has each other and we know that so we are going to get through it.""

Two of the minority council members who — unsuccessfully — pushed to rule out lawyers with past ethical problems said they’d heard rumors Rosado was planning to hire John Kennelly an attorney and former city councilman who’s been disciplined twice by the Connecticut bar.

Months later that’s precisely what Rosado did. The city has paid Kennelly nearly $6700 to date for providing legal and legislative advice to the Court of Common Council according to the mayor’s chief of staff Vasishth Srivastava.

“He’s on an as-needed basis” Rosado said. “I had conversations with my [Democratic] council colleagues and that’s what we agreed on.”

Kennelly said this week another $6097.50 has not yet been paid for services he rendered to city council. The numbers differ significantly from what’s reported in the city’s online public ledger and Srivastava confirmed there are potential errors in the database.

Back in June Councilman John Gale of the self-created Hartford Party and Councilmembers Wildaliz Bermudez and Joshua Michtom of the Working Families Party criticized the Democratic majority for fighting measures of accountability and transparency around the issue.

“We’re up here basically setting it up so we can throw money at some friend of ours” Michtom said at the time.

On Friday he said he wasn’t previously aware that Kennelly had done any work for the council but that it didn’t look good considering Kennelly’s political ties to the Democratic Party in Connecticut. Michtom said he planned to ask Rosado to share what Kennelly has produced for the Democrats.

“It still feels like cronyism and now also it feels like city funds advancing the political ends of one party” Michtom said. “I guess it’s a small drop in the grand scheme of the budget but it’s not nothing. Yeah it feels a little dirty.”

On Friday Gale said he still doesn’t think there’s enough work to warrant a council attorney let alone one who only works with the Democratic caucus. However he said Kennelly hasn’t gotten enough business from the council to demonstrate corruption.

“I would certainly have much stronger objections if Mr. Kennelly had been paid tens of thousands of dollars” Gale said. “Then that would appear like it was more of a political payoff.”

Kennelly hails from one of the most prominent political families in the Connecticut Democratic Party and in Hartford. He is the son of former U.S. Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly and former speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives James J. Kennelly.

But Kennelly has hit a number of stumbling blocks in his own political and professional career. He received a court reprimand in 2005 was charged with drunken driving in 2012 — while he was running for a 1st District seat on Hartford’s Democratic town committee — and was suspended for one month from the Connecticut bar in 2017.

Rosado said in June that she was not considering hiring Kennelly at that time. He said differently that he and Rosado had previously discussed the position and that he hoped to be hired and understood that he was one of multiple people being considered.

This week Rosado explained that she selected Kennelly for as-needed legal advice because he is already a registered vendor with the city having represented a city employee in a lawsuit and “he has saved the city a lot of money.”

In the past Kennelly represented former city council aide Kelly Kirkley-Bey when she was sued in federal court for allegedly inappropriate treatment of Kenneth Blue a supervisor in the Department of Public Works. A federal judge ultimately removed Kirkley-Bey and other city employees as defendants in the case.

At the time of the lawsuit Kirkley-Bey worked for then-Councilwoman rJo Winch. Later she briefly served as council aide to Rosado.

Rosado added that her Democratic council colleagues feel comfortable calling attorney Kennelly for advice and it was not her decision alone to pick him for work.

In one instance Kennelly prepared a statement for the body’s Democrats in December that condemned a Hartford police detective’s text proposing a “dead pool” bet on the location of the first homicide in 2021 according to Rosado.

“Some of the times other council members call upon attorney Kennelly for legal advice on some issues” Rosado said.

She would not give other specifics on work Kennelly has done.

Gale said the Democratic caucus also worked with Kennelly to draft its proposed ordinance reforming the Civilian Police Review Board. The draft Kennelly produced was a source of consternation to Gale because it was missing several elements he’d worked on with the council Democrats.

“My recollection of that is that his help just caused a lot more chaos” Gale said Friday.

Michtom said regardless of who’s doing the work it doesn’t make sense for council Democrats to seek legal advice from anyone other than the city’s corporation counsel unless there’s a clear conflict of interest.

“We all knew that [Kennelly] was the guy that this job so to speak was created for” Michtom said. “But even if it weren’t him I would want to know why we’re spending city money to pay for something that we’re already paying highly competent lawyers a salary to be able to do.”

The postcard was undated and conflicting details in the picture made it difficult to estimate its age.

Michele Vogelsang pinpointed the location on Hartford Avenue by pointing out a detail visible next to the wheeled vehicle in the background: to the right of the vehicle is a set of stairs which go up on both sides reaching a platform which is a side door way into that building.

Michele said that this distinctive feature is seen on only one building in Centerburg. That building is the Centerburg Savings Bank which was the site of the events we talked about in the 1931 embezzlement scandal article in 2018.

The bank sits at the corner of Main Street and Hartford Avenue. Julie Pruett Bishop noted the photographer must have been standing about where Church Street intersects with Hartford Avenue looking back toward Main Street.

Centerburg history maven Gloria Parsisson contributed a photograph of a Civil War reunion parade in Centerburg from 1909 just six years after the Savings Bank was built. The pyramidal steps are there third tree in confirming the bank connection. But Gloria points out that a comparison of the trees in the 1909 photo to our mystery postcard shows that the trees have grown considerably in our postcard picture.

John Deever Michelle Italia Walker Jeff Kettell and Joe Forster examined the picture closely for signs of electricity and/or light posts though the focus is grainy enough that literally nothing is clear though the apparent glint of sunlight off wires does align with the wires seen on poles in a second picture that Gloria contributed.

This picture which dates from somewhere between 1909 and 1917 is centered on the Livery and Feed store which is the building the woman in our mystery photo is passing as she walks north toward Main Street. Whether the lines are power lines or telegraph/telephone wires I don’t know but they are definitely there in there in this photo.

In 1917 a two-story house was moved to the spot between the livery store and the bank. It appears to be there in our postcard picture confirming a date after 1917.

Don Hilton was of the opinion that the vehicle was a wagon citing the diagonal line in front of it as a possible tongue waiting for a horse or horses to be hooked up. Gloria thought it was a Model T truck and that the diagonal line was its hand crank.

I think Don may be correct though because a comparison with the Google Maps image of the same spot today confirms that the vehicle is sitting some distance down the street. The hand crank would be virtually invisible from this distance. Additionally it looks like the back wheels of the vehicle are larger than the front something often seen on wagons but not as often on early vehicles.

Don also pointed out that the man’s clothes — belt attached shirt collar — strongly places him in the 1920s or later. His proud smile suggests to me that he was the proprietor of the shop. An earlier shopkeeper wouldn’t have allowed himself to be photographed in such clothes.

Meanwhile the woman in the background is definitely wearing an old-fashioned long dress that may simply reflect her age and/or taste.

Sue VanWinkle Mattinson pointed out that the tracks of unpaved Hartford Avenue are considerably wider than the narrow wheel width of our vehicle. That leads toward the assumption of a latter date where cars with tires would have broadened wagon ruts.

Wagons were still used in the era before World War II and only became rare relics of the past after the war when the United States’ expanded manufacturing capabilities made automobiles trucks and tractors affordable replacing horses in rural life.

All these clues point to a date somewhere around 1930 for the postcard image. Google Maps is still using a street view from 2008 where there is a grand old tree in front of the building (26 S. Hartford Ave.) that was once the livery store. In the postcard our woman in the long dress has just walked past that tree which while younger was already well established.

A current satellite image of Centerburg shows that the tree is now gone having had a good run of over a century.

Oh and last but not least Sandi Dunphy pointed out that I completely blew the headline by omitting the ‘t’ in “Hartford.” A swing and a miss! Thanks for the correction which we promptly updated.

But thanks to all for these contributions have helped us narrow down the timeframe of this image. Unfortunately either the numbering of Centerburg’s streets has changed between 1930 and now or no one resided at the business where the man is standing (36 S. Hartford Ave.) for nothing is listed on the 1930 census.

So for now the mystery of who he is remains just that: a mystery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9qLW1vbnRnb21lcnktb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzIwNTE0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J.

If you ever thought Megatron was the only vile villain against the Autobots you’re absolutely wrong because in contrast to Unicron Megatron was fun-sized.

Unicron or the many epithets he goes by Lord of Chaos Planet Eater or Chaos Bringer was introduced in the 1986 animated film The Transformers: The Movie and he’s probably still the most terrifying figure in the Transformers universe.

[embed]https://youtu.be/JYkC8R-BH4c[/embed]

Be sure to watch till to end of the video for some painful heart-stopping bloopers!

The Transformers: War for Cybertron Unicron is probably Hasbro’s most ambitious toy venture thus far. This is not the first Unicron toy of course but it’s the biggest. Under Haslab Hasbro’s crowdfunding platform the inception of the Planet Eater started back in 2019 and had a bit of a rough start due to the hefty price tag of $799.90.

The announcement took many by surprise because it is their largest Transformer which boasted over 50 points of articulation and what’s more? He transforms into his planet form…

The Planet Eater is a monster of a toy standing 27” tall in Robot Mode and 30” in diameter in Planet Mode. It also includes two miniatures of Galvatron and Rodimus Prime (or maybe it’s Hotrod it’s too tiny to tell for sure) and the Autobot shuttle the Ark.

Of course we’d have a go at this magnificent iconic villain although we’d like to admit it gave the team quite a challenge.

“You underestimate me Galvatron.”

The same goes for poor Galvatron we took the ungodly behemoth way too lightly and took approximately an entire afternoon to get him to transform.

Consisting of tricky hinges and tough clasps that gave us plenty of grind and sweat we believe this figurine is definitely not for the kids or the faint-hearted.

The details that comes with the price tag is worth every dollar spent though. The paint job is extremely clean and Hasbro definitely nailed Unicron’s terrifying essence down to every detail.

From pulling off intricate cybernetic architectures on its surface to its remarkable 15 point articulation on his hand and a methodical transformation from Planet Mode to Robot Mode Haslab performed.

Watch how Haslab brought the chaos together perfectly with their latest update in this manufacturing process video despite having to spray paint and assemble most of the parts manually. The end product looks incredibly amazing and we’re proud to be the first to open up this massive work of art!

Transformers: War of Cybertron Unicron in comparison with Transformers Generations War for Cybertron Earthrise Titan WFC-E25 Scorponok and Transformers Earthrise War for Cybertron Optimus Prime.

Hasbro’s Transformers: War for Cybertron Unicron is a crowdfunded product and thus is no longer available and will likely see a price hike in the retail or pre-owned market due to its impressive quality.

So for those who unfortunately missed out on it chaos shows no grace.

Transformers Beast Wars Transmetal Figures Rumoured for Reissue

If the rumours are true these should be coming out later this year. With the Kingdom line giving us most of the Beast Wars season 1 bots many were wondering if Hasbro would redo the Transmetals next and the point that always comes up is that those toys still hold up. They are show accurate (unlike most of the season 1 toys) and have articulation/complexity that would satisfy fans today. Reissues may be easier than redoing them completely in this case.

While first coming out in the mid 90s the last time these molds were used was in the Armada line. All I can think of right now is the prospect of finally having a Transmetal Megatron that won't crumble in my hands. Let us know what you think and of course please remember this is just a rumour.





Transformers Armada Predacon Gallery While no direct sources can be given we wanted to let you all in on the latest Transformers toys rumour. The last reissue we got of an older toy was Blaster and since then fans have been wondering what's next. Well two different sources have brought up reissues of figures from the 90s with further clarification from one source that these would be the Beast Wars Transmetal figures.If the rumours are true these should be coming out later this year.

Hopefully this is trueespecially for Transmetal Megatron.

Maybe even this eventually lead to other lines getting reissues!

I would love to see some of the GPS prone figures get reissued for sure. I don't dare to touch my TM Megatron or Torca for fear of breaking and my Magnaboss Silverbolt crumbled in my hands only a few years ago. My Grimlock's legs started falling apart only a couple years after I got him but he wont get reissued so I have to wait for the Dinobot repaint.



Likewise it would be nice to have some figures with good non-flakey chrome.

Yeah fix all the longevity issues they mentioned and special attention to Rampage:

He's one of the most tragic cases of red-chrome flaking I've heard reports of his legs inexplicably shattering and those rubber treads you have to fold up into his claws then stretch around his wheel assembly ain't gonna' last forever either. Maybe they could even retool him so all his crab legs end up on his shoulder pads like on the show.



I haven't handled Magnaboss in years but out of curiosity do the Japanese and Korean releases of BWII Skywarp have GPS too?



At least with Transmetal Megs you have the Metals option. Since my rare-ish pinkish-purple-chrome variant broke I've regretted not buying that Easter basket with the chrome-swap TM Primal vs. Megatron KO in Kmart 15+ years ago. Posted by Bumblevivisector on February 7th 2021 @ 12:25am CST

The GPS and chrome flaking are big issues that dogged this line. If they are remedied then all is good. Also a couple of quality of life changes would help but it is doubtful these would happen IE increasing the size of Terrorsaur's shoulder ball joints to cope with the extra weight of his arms.

If this happens it'll likely just be kept to a small handful Optimus Megatron Cheetor Rattrap and Tarantulus. I can't see re-issues of Depth Charge or Rampage happening at any point unfortunately. While the Transmetaltoys I've had since I was seven are still in good shape and haven't had the GPS issues that I've heard about on here re-issues would still be nice for those who don't have the originals.

Megatron and Rampage were my only GPS casualties. Each losing a leg. In contrast Tarantulas and Waspinator haven't even lost a flake of chrome. One of the pegs on Primal's forearm also snapped at some point in storage. I don't really feel the need to buy any of these again though to be fair.

Thinking in broader terms this line isn't very big. Twelve figures (thirteen with OpOp). So maybe that was the rationale behind the potential reissues? Posted by AllNewSuperRobot on February 7th 2021 @ 5:30am CST

Transformers Armada Predacon Gallery All I can think of right now is the prospect of finally having a Transmetal Megatron that won't crumble in my hands.

...this YES.

BUT Transmetals Megatron is pretty much the only Transmetals figure that needs a re-do for the new Generations Beast Wars figures as he is not in scale with what we have gotten so far and he hasn't been in scale with what we had gotten back then. I'm also curious if they will reissue all TM figures or only the ones that appeared in the show. I have gotten all of the old TM figures I wanted with Cheetor being the last one I got last year. The only other one I might still be interested is Airazor.

But especially some more foot articulation and accurate accessories for these figures would be nice.

And I really hope they remake the TM2 characters. I want a Voyager Dinobot 2 and maybe a Leader or even Commander class TM2 Megatron with a great robot mode to display next to my original TM2 Megs in dragon mode . ...this YES.BUT Transmetals Megatron is pretty much the only Transmetals figure that needs a re-do for the new Generations Beast Wars figures as he is not in scale with what we have gotten so far and he hasn't been in scale with what we had gotten back then.

Remakes are doubtful as Japan didn't care for the Transmetals. Reissues would be more likely as they come from Hasbro.



Tigerhawk's main issue was a completely lack of a paintjob. Although his show model wasn't exactly awash with colour to begin with. I hope not.

Wishful thinking aside. The Japanese fanbase is the primary focus of HasTak. There is a reason the Beast Wars Masterpiece line was given a fixed end point of Season One. Why both Cyberverse and WFC Kingdom focus on Season One designs of Beast Wars. Because those designs were liked the Transmetals were not. So in that respect nothing has changed.



It is a bit of a stretch to link those figures with TM2. Especially considering Japan didn't even get all of that line.

The only true BW character in Cyberverse was Cheetor. Maybe Sky-Byte if you include base molds. And Kingdom is kind of a test run of how much interest is still there in American Beast Wars stuff.

Of course something else I wanted to address it was said that because the ultra class no longer existing that a theoretical tm2 megs reissue would be knocked to Leader Class...the reissues don't stick to size classes as such like normal releases as seen by the Walmart Reissues if anything the proce will be higher I wouldn't say Hasbro are fixated on the Japanese Marketing given their domestic market is much larger. So just because the Japanese didn't care for anything after season 1 doesn't mean that Transmetals remakes won't be remade at some point. So yes a Transmetals 2 Dragon Megs could happen. After all they already did Optimal OptimusOf course something else I wanted to address it was said that because the ultra class no longer existing that a theoretical tm2 megs reissue would be knocked to Leader Class...the reissues don't stick to size classes as such like normal releases as seen by the Walmart Reissues if anything the proce will be higher Posted by ZeroWolf on February 7th 2021 @ 9:19am CST

You said the Japanese market is the primary market of HasTak...which it isn't as both companies have their own to please (hence why the Transformers Movie Masterpiece Series is

Hasbro initiative and not Takara's)



I do think nothing more can really be said at this point in time till more information is gleamed. Posted by ZeroWolf on February 7th 2021 @ 9:30am CST

He's one of the most tragic cases of red-chrome flaking I've heard reports of his legs inexplicably shattering and those rubber treads you have to fold up into his claws then stretch around his wheel assembly ain't gonna' last forever either. Maybe they could even retool him so all his crab legs end up on his shoulder pads like on the show.



I haven't handled Magnaboss in years but out of curiosity do the Japanese and Korean releases of BWII Skywarp have GPS too?



At least with Transmetal Megs you have the Metals option. Since my rare-ish pinkish-purple-chrome variant broke I've regretted not buying that Easter basket with the chrome-swap TM Primal vs. Megatron KO in Kmart 15+ years ago.



I'd love it if we could get a Rampage reissue with some chrome that won't die (a Shokaract that won't cost me an arm leg and both kidneys just to shed its chrome like a tree sheds leaves would be nice too). Skywarp has the same plastics as Silverbolt unfortunately. Posted by Wireless_Phantom on February 7th 2021 @ 10:01am CST

Remakes are doubtful as Japan didn't care for the Transmetals. Reissues would be more likely as they come from Hasbro.

I guess I was lucky with transmetals. Normally I am the guy that gets every factory defect that makes it to the shelf. But with BW transmetals I had almost none of the issues other people had. The oy chrome flaking I had was transmetals Rhinox and Beast Machines mega Jetstorm. In fact the only paint issues I had was the orange chipping off TM Primal's robot mode chest some of the orange and yellow paint rubbing off leaving the shiney silver chrome underneath on Cheetor and Tarantula respectively. Now TM2 Megatron absolutely suffered crotch rot as did Depth Charge's pin joints. Same with the pin joints on my TM2 Blackarachnia. Too thin of a plastic that required too much force. Once oxidation started on the pins it was over. Now as for gps ya the Magnaboss Silverbolt and Rampages robot legs both crumbled. Guessing the flecks in Rampages legs are to blame there. Not transmetals but my Inferno came with every ball socket cracked in the package.

Something did occur to me recently though. My Rampage lost a leg from the knee down unlike TM Megs that lost it from the hip pin. I could just look for a new leg and Rampage is complete once more. But as I mostly have figures on display these days he is too top heavy to be practical.



I also recently looked at Magnaboss in storage and was really surprised that Silverbolt's entire backpack was just detached at the hinge. Like it just eroded. I had no idea Silverbolt suffered from GPS until then. Posted by AllNewSuperRobot on February 7th 2021 @ 10:32am CST

The only Transmetal I ever picked up is Optimal Optimus so I'd be fine with this but I'd temper expectations. I suspect if they do this it will probably be similar to the 10th anniversary reissues. It's going to be really limited and likely only show characters. Something like 6-8 bots tops.



2-4 deluxes (some combination of Rattrap one of the Cheetor's Tarantulas Dinobot 2 and maybe Silverbolt) a couple of Mega's (likely Optimus and Megatron) and if we're REALLY lucky 1-2 Ultras.



Edit: That said if this gives us another chance to pick up that Trans-Mutate build-a-figure they put in those 10th anniversary figures I'd be interested. Posted by Spider5800 on February 7th 2021 @ 11:44am CST

By Rampage do you mean his chrome flaking off?

Totally cool with this I'd love to get TM Cheetor and Tarantulas. Reissued or otherwise I think they're the most likely to be revisited. Perhaps Rattrap too but I feel like they'd try to even the faction representation and there were no other in-show Predacon Transmetals besides Megatron. But TM Megatron ought to get a new toy that is as big as or larger than the new Kingdom leader to scale better (and would bypass the issue of GPS entirely).



I wouldn't hold my breath for TM2's just yet beyond maybe a Dinobot II retool of Dinobot. It wouldn't be entirely screen accurate but I don't think Dinobot II is popular enough a character to warrant his own new mold and we know that most molds are made with alternate toolings from the get go and there's not many retool potentials for Dinobot.

As for Transmetals I would guess they'd do whoever got the upgrade in the show and no one above Mega/Voyager. I could see them adding Silverbolt as a line filler but that's it.

OK... if you ask me I'd only expect the Deluxes here: Cheetor Rattrap Tarantulas and maybe Silverbolt. Why? Possible successor for the Walmart Retro Headmasters line. BW Rampage has no metallic plastic so GPS isn't a factor in his breaking. However his upper legs are two parts: a shell on the hip joint and a purple core attached to the knee NO joint between the two parts if I may add. So twist it the wrong and snap. That's especially dangerous for the Japanese Metals version as it switched out the opaque orange plastic for translucent red. And as we all know translucent plastic has less ""give"" so it breaks with less force.OK... if you ask me I'd only expect the Deluxes here: Cheetor Rattrap Tarantulas and maybe Silverbolt. Why?

I wonder if they ever found it? They had only used it five years prior so it couldn't have been that lost. They moved factories at least once maybe twice since then so there's a chance it turned up at some point in the last 15 years.



Let's also keep in mind that lost molds don't really mean anything anymore when Hasbro rebuilt the combining dino tapes just for a few exclusives. Where there's a will there's a way.

Miley Cyrus wows health care workers in Tampa before the Super Bowl,"If you were paying attention the Miley Cyrus social media signs were clear. We knew she was in tip-top condition for Sunday’s performance in Tampa. Four days earlier she posted a video of herself running on the treadmill and belting Rebel Girl by Bikini Kill. An hour before the show she shared a moment with Billy Idol chilling on a motorcycle. Casual!

She brought Big Treadmill Energy plus guest stars Joan Jett and Billy Idol to the TikTok Tailgate for 7500 vaccinated health care workers from Tampa Bay and the country. She heaped praise noting the sacrifices they made to “get back to doing what we love being who want want to be fulfilling our purposes.”

“This is my first show in about a year” she told the crowd. “I could not image a better way to do this than here in Tampa with all these healthcare heroes surrounded by the people that are making this show possible. We are so appreciative of you and all your diligence and for that we’re gonna rock hard.”

Steve Harvey hosted the show before the show streaming on TikTok and CBS. “This is not any old tailgate” he said. “This is the best tailgate you’ve ever been to in your life.”

Okay! Probably not since it’s COVID times and most of us were behind screens at home but okay!

TikTokers predicted the winning team. Most said Kansas City which honestly rude. TikTok showed celeb videos recipes for Rotel cheese dip and Huli Huli wings a tutorial to make a planter out of a football while everyone in the comments demanded to see Miley.

Eventually Harvey came back and it was time!

“Let’s take one last look at some TikToks from the season while we wait for Miley to take the stage” he said draining everyone of life. After 10 more minutes of TikToks people got what they wanted.

She delivered the 80s rock promise from the first beats. “Oh Miley you’re so fine you’re so fine you blow my mind. Hey Miley!” She ran onstage outside Raymond James Stadium wearing a black and pink leather cheerleading outfit that read FTW (”for the win”) backed by a giant gumball machine and megaphone.

Idol appeared looking exactly the same as he did in the 80s. They paired up for Night Crawling and White Wedding. A side note: TikTok’s vertical format is not the best for getting two people in frame. At times we at home were staring at a sparkly wagon wheel.

Miley has reinvented herself a million times but her current Joan Jett vibe might be her best. She killed Heart of Glass by Blondie and took a break to gyrate on the motorcycle before launching into Nine Inch Nails’ Head Like a Hole. She wove her hits into covers wrapping Nothing Breaks Like a Heart with Jolene by her real-life godmother Dolly Parton. She delivered an Edge of Seventeen medley she called “blessed by Stevie Nicks herself.”

Football weekend isn’t usually about strong women she said but maybe now it would be. She changed into the prerequisite sparkly football jersey and welcomed Jett who has the same exact haircut. They did Bad Karma Bad Reputation and I Hate Myself for Loving You. And Miley eventually gave us Rebel Girl that screaming anthem of females inspiring females. She brought out a stool with photos of her face on it and said “If someone doesn’t leave a seat for you at their table just bring one of your own.”

Miley shouted out Tampa General Hospital AdventHealth Bayfront Health Moffitt Cancer Center BayCare Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital HCA Healthcare Florida Cancer Specialists James A Haley Veterans’ Hospital and Sarasota Memorial Hospital. She dedicated her song Angels Like You to them.

You never know what to expect with Miley but in this context she was kind of... therapeutic? She talked about patience being kinder to each other. She told everyone to leave their masks on but “underneath there put on the biggest smile that you’ve ever had. We’re together listening to live music. Can you believe it?”

After an hour she did what she had to do. She ended with an emotional encore of Wrecking Ball and The Climb about “never giving in never giving up.” But the peak was a few minutes earlier when she gave the people what they wanted — Party in the U.S.A. momentarily sending the crowd into fits by joking that Jay-Z was coming out. They sang and danced the way they did in a previous life.

For the first time in a while a party in the U.S.A. felt like something we could picture again.

Read more

It was telling that for his recent GQ Sports photo shoot Christian Pulisic the squeaky clean 22-year-old phenom from famously happy Hershey was posed like some heroin-chic ’90s model reclining languorously on a beaten-up sofa in a pair of vintage jeans and a tank top his face — the face of American soccer — unshaven and brooding.

That new edgy image heralded the commercial maturation of a major figure in the lucrative world of sports marketing one whose appeal both here and abroad is already deeper than any previous U.S. soccer player’s.

Once a shy teenaged prodigy whose endorsement reach didn’t go far beyond candy bars made in his Pennsylvania hometown Pulisic has promotional clout that has grown in tandem with his development from boy wonder to full-blown soccer stud.

That commercial promise along with his athletic prowess explains why a top English soccer club Chelsea of the English Premier League paid a $73 million transfer fee — a record for an American player — in 2019 to get Pulisic from a German club. It’s why such companies as Nike EA Sports and Gatorade have brought him on board.

“He’s got so much marketing potential” said Mike Koeshartanto marketing manager for Chicago-based Gilt Edged Soccer Marketing. “He’s attractive. He fits the mold of the modern young engaged athlete. It’s easy to see why he’s picked up so many endorsements.

“From Chelsea’s perspective he’s helped on the field helped with their marketing and helped capture the U.S. audience. And he’s done it at a time when soccer interest is at an all-time high here.”

With the sport making steady headway among mainstream American fans Pulisic’s ascension to a star both on the pitch and as a pitchman has been as well-timed as any of the slick passes he makes as one of Chelsea’s primary weapons.

Last year after decades when you had a better chance of finding a marbles competition on TV there were more than 3000 soccer matches broadcast in the United States an average of more than eight a day. Merchandise sales are soaring here. Interest in the 25-year-old MLS (Major League Soccer) has increased 27% since 2012 according to Nielsen Sports Sponsorlink. In a 2018 Gallup poll of 18-to-34-year-olds soccer tied with basketball as the second favorite sport behind only football.

Those trends plus Pulisic’s ability to capitalize on them financially should only intensify as the U.S. Men’s National Team likely with him as its captain tries to get back to the World Cup next year and four years after that when North America hosts the event.

Other U.S. stars — Tim Howard Clint Dempsey — have played in England and enjoyed commercial success. But Pulisic the son of two college soccer players may already have eclipsed them. Some marketers compare him to Yao Ming whose signing by the Houston Rockets in 2002 helped the NBA boost its popularity in the lucrative Chinese market.

Chelsea hopes its substantial investment in Pulisic — in addition to the transfer fee they signed him to a five-year $49 million deal in 2019 — will deepen its footprint in America where Manchester United Liverpool and Arsenal have long been the most popular clubs. And companies on both sides of the Atlantic see the young star as a way to tap into the U.S. soccer awakening.

“The average age of U.S. soccer fans is among the youngest for any sport somewhere around 34-35” said Koeshartanto. “They have spending power. They’re tech-savvy. And with globalization everything is now at their fingertips.”

In Pulisic those fans also now have an authentic homegrown star to cheer. He’s already a two-time U.S. player of the year. And the Pennsylvanian’s 2019 Chelsea debut against Manchester United set an NBCSN ratings record for soccer. He’s the youngest-ever captain of the U.S. men’s national team; the youngest player to record a hat trick in Chelsea’s 115-year history; and the youngest foreigner to score a goal in Germany’s Bundesliga soccer league where he played for Dortmund as a 17-year-old.

“He can change a game instantly” said Gregg Berhalter the men’s national team coach. “He can split the defense make the big pass.”

The talent he displayed early on and the American hunger for that first homegrown superstar have burnished his social-media chops. In 2018 in perhaps the ultimate on-line compliment Lebron James who has 86.7 million Twitter followers posed for an Instagram photo wearing a Pulisic jersey. Pulisic though he rarely Tweets has 3.4 million followers.

Although he can’t yet demand the money that such established superstars as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo can it’s estimated that Pulisic’s endorsements added at least $5 million to his income last year.

“In an era where individual player personality is so impactful he’s clearly the top guy to connect with both soccer fans and the mainstream sports fans who will tune in for the World Cup in 2022 and of course 2026 when that tournament come to North America” said John Guppy Gilt Edge’s owner.

In addition to his deals with Nike EA Sports and Gatorade Pulisic also has agreements with Chipotle Tag Heuer (watches) Panini America (cards and collectibles) and – least surprisingly — hometown Hershey’s for whom he helped launch Reese’s Outrageous bar in 2018.

“It’s not very often that a superstar hails from your own backyard” said Suzanne Jones a Hershey vice president

Reserved good-looking with what GQ described as “the fulsome chin of an Action Man figurine” Pulisic who stands 5-foot-8 and weighs 155 pounds is as tough and fearless on the field as he is magnetic off it — a combination that has many marketers drooling.

“He’s from Hershey Pa.” said Koeshartanto “and he’s almost exactly what I would expect every person from Hershey to be like.”

Pulisic lives alone in the tony London suburb of Wimbledon. When he’s not practicing or playing he’s likely to be at home on the video-game console or eating a burrito. In fact it was his cravings for their burritos that led to the Chipotle’s deal.

“That was one he manufactured himself” said Koeshartanto whose company counts Chelsea among its clients. “There are only about 40 Chipotle’s outside the U.S. mostly in Europe but he would always find one and post pictures of himself while at Chipotle’s. He’s their first international endorser.”

Chelsea awarded him the No. 10 jersey that traditionally goes to the team’ top offensive player. And in 2020 the only jersey that sold more than that one in the U.S. was Messi’s.

Pulisic is also someone who interacts on-line with athletes from different sports. Among them is the Utah Jazz’s Donovan Mitchell to whom Pulisic sent a jersey helping to convert the NBA star into a soccer fan.

Research that Gilt Edge conducted in 2020 revealed that Pulisic was by far the most popular player among American fans 10 times more so than Jozy Altidore or Michael Bradley. Among that same group his popularity also exceeded that of such familiar international superstars as Mo Salah Kylian Mbappé and James Rodriguez.

“He’s the most popular U.S. player no doubt about that” said Koeshartanto “and he’s probably top five across the world. It was always going to take a generation or two for soccer to take hold in America. Now thanks in no small part to Christian we’re seeing that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8yMDIxL2ZlYi8wNy9oZXJzaGV5cy1jaG9jb2xhdGUtd29ybGQtbmV3LXlvcmstbmV3LXlvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feel like the king of candy at Hershey's Chocolate World in Las Vegas,"Willy Wonka once said “Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker.” Anyone can agree with that statement and it’s especially true for the Vegas vacationer.

School For Early Learning Named After City Native,"HERSHEY Pa. — Jamestown native Catherine Hershey’s legacy of philanthropy and commitment to education will continue far into the future thanks to the recently-announced Catherine Hershey Schools for Early Learning.

The Milton Hershey School revealed in January that the new school will be part of a cost-free early childhood education initiative which will bear the name of Catherine Hershey and continue the goal of helping young people break the cycle of poverty by providing a holistic pre-K through 12th grade education and home to students facing extreme economic hardship.

Catherine Hershey Schools for Early Learning will allow MHS to expand the impact of Milton and Catherine Hershey’s vision to serve more children from economically disadvantaged and at-risk backgrounds through education.

“Catherine was a trailblazer” said Peter G. Gurt ’85 Milton Hershey School President and himself an alumnus. “At a time when women had little involvement in business and legal affairs Catherine was an equal partner to her husband in founding and growing MHS. When asked years later why he founded MHS Milton Hershey answered ‘It was Kitty’s idea.’ As we embark on this exciting and unprecedented expansion of our mission to help children from poverty reach their full potential it was an easy decision to name this initiative in Catherine’s honor. Catherine Hershey Schools for Early Learning is her legacy.”

On Nov. 19 1909 Milton and Catherine Hershey signed the Deed of Trust establishing the Hershey Industrial School (now Milton Hershey School) a home and school for orphaned children.

MHS is now investing $350 million to fund the development of up to six cost-free Early Childhood Resource Centers (ECRCs) in Pennsylvania for children from birth to age 5 from economically disadvantaged and at-risk backgrounds.

According to hersheyarchives.org Catherine Elizabeth Sweeney was born on July 6 1871 in Jamestown to Irish immigrant parents.

Sweeney attended Jamestown High School but did not graduate instead entering the labor force where found a job as a clerk in a jewelry store.

In 1897 Milton Hershey already a successful businessman stopped in Jamestown to visit A.D. Work’s Confectionery where he met Sweeney and the two began their relationship.

Sweeney would move to New York City to work in Altman’s Department Store during their courtship which was concluded by a wedding on May 25 1898.

While the ventures have gotten larger his goal has always remained the same: Give customers what they want when the want it — or put another way help remove obstacles that prevent them from getting what they want. While trying to fulfill that goal he has become one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the Colorado Springs area.

Last month Ciabarra took a giant step in that journey: Quantum Metric landed $200 million in venture capital in a deal that values the company at more than $1 billion making it the first technology ""unicorn"" (a company valued at more than $1 billion) in Colorado Springs. The transaction also was the largest investment ever in a local startup.

Ciabarra got his start in business by buying candy in bulk at the grocery store and selling individual packages to classmates for a profit following in the footsteps of his older brother Chris who had done the same. Doing so launched a lifelong effort to top each other with their latest venture whether the scorecard was how much money they raised or what the company fetched when sold.

""I had a thirst for entrepreneurship and success. I knew that if I bought a 10-pack of candy for a dollar and sold each candy bar for 50 cents I would make a good profit"" Mario said. ""Every venture became bigger and the lesson is that there is demand and I can create supply. Any kid could have bought the 10-pack but there is something about the convenience — people will pay for it. That has continued through life — finding needs that we could meet.""

While in high school Mario landed his first job in the industry that employs many teenagers — retail — by working in a clothing store and for the health and nutrition chain GNC. His job at GNC would give him an idea for his next step — selling dieting supplements by direct mail in a venture that would teach him a valuable lesson: Learn to stay grounded or in other words don't overestimate the market for your product.

He formed a partnership with a GNC co-worker and they calculated they needed 1% of the people who received their mail offer to actually buy their American Dieting Association supplements. They spent several months on the project but just 0.9% of their target customers actually bought the supplements and the partners lost the entire $300 they had invested in the company — a tiny fraction of what Mario would invest in subsequent ventures.

""That was the difference between success and failure. If we got a 1.5% response we would have been massively successful"" Mario said. ""You have to shoot for the stars to be successful but you also have to think of what could happen if you don't make that 1%. It took two or three months for me to realize it wasn't going to work and I didn't have the cash or passion to keep doing it.""

Upward path

Mario's college businesses were both much more successful — a T-shirt venture call Deez Teez that helped to pay for his bachelor's degree at Pennsylvania State University and a note-taking business that paid students to take notes from popular classes and made money from advertising. The note-taking business broke even but also taught him how to manage people and lead which Ciabarra said was his first ""real"" experience as an entrepreneur.

While at Penn State Mario received his degree in biochemistry and microbiology with an emphasis in computer science. That meant he wasn't ""classically trained in computer science and I didn't fully embrace it so I think about it differently. It has allowed me to take on projects that don't fit the computer science persona and solve problems in different ways.

""If you are at the intersection of various functions that is where innovation happens. It has helped me in my (entrepreneurial) journey.""

Chris would follow a similar path to entrepreneurship financing his college education with a business that built and fixed websites. He would eventually start Revel Systems an iPad-based point-of-sale system that eventually landed $125 million from private equity investors. He gave up control of the company in the deal — an experience Mario said taught him a lesson in how to structure investments in his companies. Chris recently secured a $5.5 million investment in his latest company Athena Security which uses artificial intelligence to analyze security camera images to report crimes in progress.

""We have always been competitive with each other our whole lives in sports school and business"" Chris said of his brother. ""He started a company and sold it for millions then I started a company that sold out for millions more. He apparently needed to start another company because he can't have me selling my company for more. We will do another round of financing soon for Athena but I don't need $200 million. He (Mario) is in a great niche with a great product and is doing a great job.""

While in college Mario completed internships with IBM NCR and consulting giant Accenture. He learned the most at Accenture by working with senior executives and watching how they faced the daily challenges. That led to his first job as a technology management consultant at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers in San Francisco where he worked with AT&T to launch its 3G wireless network including systems for billing customer management and provisioning new service.

After nearly three years he moved to Virgin Mobile which Mario credits with setting him up for success in the rest of his career by tasking him with leading a web team. He had a desk across from a member of the information technology operations team and could see coding errors on his co-worker's computer screen. The co-worker was unaware of the errors showing Mario that poor communications between teams can hurt the product the company and customers.

""If you don't tell the operations team what the errors mean no one knows there is a problem and tries to fix it. It was a problem of the operations and the development team not working together"" Mario said. Months later he began developing a product that inspired him to work with the operations team to solve problems a product he would eventually build a company around.

By the time Mario started developing the product he had moved onto Hewlett-Packard . He spent 11 months working at HP during the day and spending the rest of his time on DevStream his first major startup which he sold to Compuware for so much that he would never work for someone else again.

""It was very consuming and stressful and when I looked back it was stressful for no reason. I made it stressful. I learned I needed not to go through the ups and downs"" Mario said. ""Quantum is many times more successful but many times less stressful. Each of my next three startups were progressively less stressful because you read about the $200 million financing round and it is all about hearing yes. What you don't hear is the story of the hundreds of no's we got on the way to success. When you get those no's it is not that you have a bad idea that you're doing it wrong or are a bad person or leader. You just need another at bat.""

Lessons learned

Many startups fail Mario said because entrepreneurs stop trying and don't learn from their failures. He is thankful for ""all the things that weren't necessarily good outcomes because the failures led me to where I am today.""

After selling DevStream Mario spent the next six months traveling to 27 counties. He realized he couldn't retire at 26 but had the financial security to ""do what I love and didn't need to work anymore."" About that time Ciabarra became a father for the first time and was exhausted after the first two weeks of parenting. He set out to develop a baby monitor to keep track of pulse oxygen level and temperature to give parents peace of mind so they could get some sleep.

He quickly discovered that developing computer hardware was much more difficult than software but became distracted by his new mobile phone — the first edition of the iPhone. He quickly realized he wanted the iPhone to do things Apple hadn't included in its capabilities — become a Wi-Fi hotspot and include key notifications on the opening screen. He started Intelliborn to design and develops applications for the iPhone to offer those capabilities.

Apple would become a major obstacle to those plans — the company insisted that any applications be sold through its own app store. Instead Mario became part of a movement to offer apps outside of Apple's store and enable the iPhone to use them a process called jailbreaking. He later started Rocky Your Phone as an alternative to Apple's app store. He eventually sold it to a larger competitor.

""It was all about finding a need — I had a need and felt the pain of not being able to use my iPhone as a hot spot so I created one and other successful apps"" he said. ""We sold more software than all of the other app developers in the alternative market. We made money in the first year but we sold 50 times more on the marketing platform we developed to amplify our reach. We had 4 million users in our independent app store.""

Eventually Apple started developing its own free apps to replace those Intelliborn was selling prompting Mario to wind down the company and begin working on Quantum. He created Quantum in 2015 to help companies find their best online revenue opportunities using real-time customer feedback to more quickly build and improve digital products. He named the new company Quantum Metric because quantum is the smallest of things and metric is a form of measurement.

To learn how to build the company into a technology unicorn Mario set out to find a mentor who could show him the path he needed to follow. He aimed high seeking out longtime Cisco Chairman John Chambers by crashing a party he was hosting in Portugal. Chambers told Mario at the party to call him the next day which led to quarterly then monthly and now almost daily phone calls among friends.

""I never have been afraid to ask great leaders to be my mentor"" Mario said. ""I joined him last year on trip to Alaska and every morning he would go to the kitchen and talk to the staff about their hopes dreams and aspirations — that is amazing leadership. Everyone is equal in his eyes. I want to grow up to be like him.""

The company started selling its software in 2016. It landed $1 million from Boston private equity giant Bain Capital Ventures in 2017 and another $25 million from Insight Partners a year later. Last year the company borrowed another $25 million from Silicon Valley Bank to finance its growth for a few months before getting another $200 million in January from Insight that will help the company keep up with the surging growth stemming from consumers turning to online purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding will help the company expand its staff from 225 to 400 by year's end.

Quantum Metric's 120 major customers include 3M Alaska Airlines Bass Pro Shops FanDuel Lenovo Lululemon and Western Union. In one example clothing manufacturer Carhartt uses Quantum Metric's software to identify and fix issues with its customer website including a box in a form for post office boxes that could not be clicked frustrating customers. Another customer Canadian Tire used Quantum Metric's software to find that up to 20% of its customers were trying to use expired coupons prompting the company to allow those coupons so it could complete more online sales.

Lonne Jaffe managing partner of Insight Partners said his fund looks for investments that can double or triple sales annually. He believes Quantum Metric fits that mold. He said Insight backed Mario because he had a track record of previous successes and has a broad set of skills that span from writing code for the company's software to selling the company and its product to both customers and investors and recruiting talent.

Quantum's product is attractive Jaffe said because ""it bundles capabilities that in the past had been separate markets and integrates them into a single platform. It puts together a lot of data does sophisticated analysis and gives the customer the top 20 things they could do to improve their website or app. It allows you to look at the (website or app) user's experience and see where they are having issues and even large companies have those issues.""

Jaffe said Quantum's biggest challenges will be continuing to attract top-level talent and expanding internationally but he believes the company has ""enormous"" potential .

Mario wants to take the company public so he is adding high-profile finance and sales executives as well as bringing back a veteran of one of his previous startups David Wang as chief architect. Wang helped Mario come up with the idea for Quantum Metric and co-authoedr its software before moving to Oregon to work in the cybersecurity and intelligence industry.

""When I hired him the first time I hired someone smarter than me and it was so enjoyable. I just had to get out of his way. He was so smart I had to find something big to do"" Mario said. ""I found out how to harness enthusiasm and motivate another human being to achieve a common goal. That is the biggest challenge of any leader to unlock that.""

Wang said he and Mario work well together because they have completely different personalities — Wang focuses on the technology while Mario excels at building a top-level team. They will both face the same challenge in the next phase of Quantum Metric's growth — Wang must enable the company's software to handle billions of bits of data while Ciabarra must find the talent to complete that task.

Before Quantum Metric Mario had focused on building products but he learned that the success of his new company depended on finding the right talent.

Still skeptics rightly point out that plenty of other places have made a bid to become the new Silicon Valley and never come close.

Texas though may be different and not because of the recent high-profile relocations. Unlike other would-be innovation hubs the state has been quietly nurturing high-tech industry for decades.

Hilton Valentine The Animals’ original guitarist and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee died on January 29 2021 at his Connecticut home. He was 77 years old.

Born on May 21 1943 near Newcastle England Hilton first picked up a guitar after being caught up in the skiffle craze that was spearheaded by Lonnie Donegan whose cover of “Rock Island Line” became a Top 10 hit in both England and America.

Hilton soon formed a skiffle band called The Heppers that ultimately abandoned the genre in favor of more straight-ahead rock and roll adopting the name The Wildcats. Working in the clubs of Tyne and Newcastle Hilton was recognized as a flashy guitarist.

Within a year The Wildcats attracted the attention of Chas Chandler bassist for The Alan Price Combo who offered Hilton the guitar slot. Shortly afterwards rechristened as The Animals the 5-piece group recorded their first single “Baby Let Me Take You Home” propelled by Hilton’s cool aggressive guitar and set out on a tour of the UK. Later that year the band would further bolster the British Invasion with their cover of “House of the Rising Sun” which spent three weeks at the top of the American charts in September 1964. In fact Hilton’s arpeggiated guitar intro on “House” became a rite of passage for guitarists who came of age in the 1960’s.

Said Eric Burdon to VG collaborator Tom Guerra in 2003 “In those days Hilton wasn’t just playing rock ‘n’ roll he looked rock ‘n’ roll. Here was a guy with the greased mop of hair combed back cheap leather jacket winkle picker shoes black jeans and a smile on his face playing through an echoplex which was a secret weapon back then.”

As The Animals continued their string of hit singles it would be Hilton’s unique playing that anchored such songs as “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” “Don’t Bring Me Down and “We Gotta Get Outta This Place.” The original band ultimately broke up in 1966.

In recalling the high points of his career Hilton said “The first time we came to New York playing the Paramount Theatre in Times Square five shows a day for 10 or so days during school holidays was just amazing as was getting to meet our heroes like Chuck Berry.”

After the band’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 Hilton lived a quiet life in Southern Connecticut releasing a number of well-received skiffle albums which he promoted at pub gigs around the area. He is survived by his wife Germaine Valentine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaG93LWxvbmctd2FzLXBhcmlzLWhpbHRvbi1hY3R1YWxseS1pbi1qYWlsLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Long Was Paris Hilton Actually in Jail?,"Paris Hilton an actress entrepreneur DJ model and actress has built a brand of her own over the years.

However she didn’t receive prison time but she received a fine community service and years’ probation. In 2007 Hilton was sentenced to a probation violation and ordered to serve jail time.

Hilton being the granddaughter of a wealthy tycoon became an heir to his fortune. She was a privileged kid and managed to attend top schools live in lucrative mansions and enjoy her vacations in exclusive vacation homes.

Hilton lived a glamorous lifestyle and participated in high-end parties in New York. Her lifestyle managed to get her A-list connections which brought her to the limelight. The recognition she attained for herself has helped build her brand.

When Hilton was in her early 20s she debuted in a reality TV series called The Simple Life. In the show she starred alongside Nicole Richie where they illustrated the working life of two socialites’ women who were doing regular jobs for a living.

Did Paris Hilton become famous after the release of the infamous sex tape?

In 2007 Hilton was arrested for drunken driving where she pleaded no contest to the charges. The judge sentenced her to a probation sentence of three years and a suspension of her driving license.

However later she was caught by authorities driving using a suspended license. Her judge ruled it as a probation violation.

Hilton was arrested on a Thursday shortly after leaving the MTV Movie Awards where she addressed the press and was the primary subject of the host’s jokes Sarah Silverman.

Judge Michael Sauer who was in charge of her hearing had explicitly banned any house arrest pleas. Before the hearing Hilton had requested to participate in the hearing via her phone but Judge Michael denied the request and demanded that she physically attend the hearing.

The judge sentenced her to 45 days jail time but would be reduced to 23 if she behaved appropriately. However due to undisclosed medical considerations a new arrangement was made.

In the arrangement Hilton would serve her sentence under house arrest. She was required to wear an ankle bracelet with a tracker for the remaining 40 days. TMZ had earlier stated that Hilton had refused to eat the jail meals served to her.

Ideally she only remained in jail for five days for what was to have been 45 days of jail time. Despite the judge resisting a house arrest he later agreed after consultations and concerns regarding her medical condition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vcGVyZXpoaWx0b24uY29tL2plbm5pZmVyLWxhd3JlbmNlLWluanVyZWQtc2V0LWV4cGxvc2lvbi_SAURodHRwczovL3BlcmV6aGlsdG9uLmNvbS9qZW5uaWZlci1sYXdyZW5jZS1pbmp1cmVkLXNldC1leHBsb3Npb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Lawrence Injured During Filming In Set Explosion Gone Wrong,"Yikes…

A controlled glass explosion during the filming of Adam McKay‘s comedy Don’t Look Up has gone TERRIBLY wrong. On February 5 production called it temporary quits in Boston after star Jennifer Lawrence wound up injured. Apparently the glass from the stunt hit her right in the face and nearly missed one of her eyes! AHHH! That’s SO scary!

According to sources who were reportedly on scene at the time:

“An explosion was set up for a stunt in which glass shatters. It was a stunt in which the glass was supposed to shatter — but it injured her.”

Whoa. Can you imagine being on a set where that happens?

Actors and crew put their trust into the safety of these props and special effects — and this sounds like way too close of a call even though we’re hearing that JLaw only suffered minor injuries. Still it wasn’t JUST the Silver Lining’s Playbook star in this scene and so many people could’ve gotten seriously hurt.

Lawrence had been filming at the time in question with Dune actor Timothée Chalamet. Reports allege that the two actors along with a ton of background actors were seated inside a restaurant during a scene being shot around 1 am. From what we’re learning the crew created the effect for a moment that called for an exploding window. Per sources the Oscar-winning actress got hit in the face after a trashcan went through the glass and she could be seen holding her face while leaving the filming site.

Clearly none of it went as planned. Hopefully moving forward they get their act together.

As of now Lawrence is apparently expected to return to set on Monday. But we’re also seeing reports which state it may not be until later in the week.

In the film which will be released on Netflix in 2021 the 30-year-old plays a lower level scientist alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. It sounds like our favorite Titanic heartthrob wasn’t on scene during the disastrous explosion — and neither were the other A-list cast involved in the project (such as Cate Blanchett Jonah Hill Ariana Grande and Matthew Perry). Now the incident Friday marks yet another time the film production has been delayed; it was originally delayed substantially due to the worldwide pandemic that’s affected everything for the last year.

ANYWAY what do YOU all think? Are you surprised when you hear about freak disasters like this one on set?

Let’s hope production gets their stuff together… and let’s really hope that Jennifer Lawrence gets better soon and comes out fine!

For more information about the Graton Day Labor Center go to gratondaylabor.org .

Most mornings Anayeli Guzman is up before the sun.

She arrives at the Graton Day Labor Center as early as 5 a.m. and then she waits with dozens of others to see if there’s any work.

Guzman specializes in lawn care. Before COVID-19 finding full-time daily work through the center was nearly automatic.

Now 11 months into the punishing pandemic that has crippled the economy Guzman usually makes the return trip to her home where she lives with her husband and their 9-year-old daughter with nothing to show for her efforts.

“It’s very common to not have work (now)” said Guzman speaking through a translator Sunday morning outside the Home Depot store in Rohnert Park.

Hundreds of local day laborers many of whom who are undocumented immigrants and don’t have access to unemployment benefits or coronavirus relief funding have seen their ability to earn a living evaporate amid the pandemic due to sickness and a slowdown in daily hiring.

On Sunday Guzman joined dozens of fellow workers who held signs and handed out informational brochures along Redwood Drive in Rohnert Park with a simple message: Hire us.

“Members of the Graton Day Labor Center wanted to be able to send a message to the community that the best way to support them during the pandemic is to hire them” said Renee Saucedo an organizer with the center.

I’m in front of the Rohnert Park Home Depot where workers with the @gratondaylabor are bringing attention to a sort of unseen unemployment where many are getting less than half the work they typically do each week amid the pandemic. Their message: “Hire us.” pic.twitter.com/cOxhOtwFKF — Tyler Silvy (@tylersilvy) February 7 2021

Saucedo said this was the first such event since the coronavirus made its way into Sonoma County last March hitting members hard on a variety of fronts. Some have lost work due to the sickness which has disproportionately impacted the county’s Latino community. Latinos account for 27% of the county’s population but 67% of the coronavirus cases in which race and ethnicity are known according to county public health statistics.

The Graton Day Labor Center since 2007 been a rallying point for Mexican immigrants seeking work in Sonoma County carrying on a Graton tradition of work via street corner that goes back 70 years. Along with aid in finding work the worker-owned cooperative nonprofit provides advocacy and training in leadership and civics among other services.

The center’s workers on Sunday sought to curb fears that have caused some members of the public to stop hiring day laborers.

“There’s nothing to fear” Porforio Vasquez one of the workers present for Sunday’s rally said through an interpreter. Contact is kept to a minimum Vasquez said workers wear masks and maintain social distance.

But the decline in demand for their labor is real said Vasquez who specializes in carpentry. He said he’s lucky to find work three days per week.

“Right now we’re going through a very tough time; not just myself but many of us” said Vasquez who works to support his wife and two children.

There is little safety net for day laborers who don’t get hired. Many including Vasquez and Guzman who declined to disclose their citizenship status are unable to access unemployment benefits. Some undocumented families have been able to obtain state payments but none have been able to receive federal stimulus checks Saucedo said. Sonoma County too has offered direct payments to people impacted by the pandemic regardless of citizenship status.

“I think there’s a lack of political will to aid everyone who is impacted by this pandemic” Saucedo said. “If they were smart they wouldn’t make a distinction between those who have documents and those who don’t. If this community is suffering that means their extended families are suffering and their entire community.”

Its share price hit an all-time high and its stock jumped 37% on revenue and earnings momentum.

The company reported $124.6 million in the first-quarter revenues this year up from $98.5 million during that same period in 2020. That year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased demand for products linked to renovation trends associated with the pandemic.

WD-40 Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Garry Ridge is optimistic 2021 will be another record-breaking year as ‘isolation renovation’ will continue.

“We offer a variety of maintenance and cleaning products that have been in very high demand during these highly unusual times” said Ridge. “Our sales increased 26% compared to the first quarter of last year due primarily to increased demand for our products linked to renovation trends associated with the pandemic. We call this phenomenon ‘isolation renovation’ and we are experiencing it in nearly all of our direct markets around the world.”

More notably WD-40 Company’s market value surpassed $4 billion for the first time and now trades at more than 9 times its estimated sales in fiscal 2021.

The lubricant and cleaning product manufacturer now has a bigger market value than iconic department store Macy’s Inc. and a richer valuation than Shake Shack Inc. according to Bloomberg.

Wide Product line

Founded in 1953 the formula for WD-40’s product lineup was developed by a fledgling enterprise called Rocket Chemical Company. It took 40 tries to get the water displacement (WD) formula right — hence its name.

Headquartered in Scripps Ranch and with roughly 525 employees globally its products are currently available in more than 176 countries and territories worldwide. A publicly-traded company shares of company stock trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “WDFC.”

Its flagship product WD-40 Multi-Use Product is a renowned and useful lubricant and rust remover. But the namesake brand is not the company’s sole product. It also sells well-known household and cleaning brands Spot Shot 2000 Flushes X-14 1001 among others.

Selling Memories

Roughly 83% of the company’s revenue comes from the namesake product line according to Ridge adding that the company offers a “wide variety” of maintenance and cleaning products which have been in very high demand throughout the pandemic.

WD-40 Company is the market leader among its peers in the Chemicals-Specialty industry group. Other competitors in the space include Koppers Rayonier Advanced Materials and Albermarle.

“For diehards WD-40 is more than just a lubricant spray in a can — it’s an essential item” said Ridge. “We’re dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products that solve problems in workshops factories and homes around the world.”

Doug Cyphers vice president of information technology at WD-40 Company said WD-40 doesn’t have many competitors noting that if you walk into a Home Depot likely 80 percent of the shelf space has WD-40.

“We are the industry leader. It largely has to do with our history we’ve been around a long time” said Cyphers. “It’s less about what’s in our product and how people use it. For example people will purchase WD-40 because it reminds them of when they first worked on their car or because they saw their dad fix a bike with it.”

“There’s a huge memory component and we believe we’re helping create those lasting memories with our products” he added.

Aims to Reach $700M

As of now around half of the company’s revenue comes from the Americas segment which includes the US Canada and Latin America.

The company plans on growing its business by expanding the product lines abroad. It also has a long-term goal of reaching annual sales of $700 million however no timeline has been associated with this goal.

In particular the company plans to reach this by increasing the WD-40 Multi-Use Product line to $530 million and the WD-40 Specialist product line to $100 million.

WD-40 Company declined to give earnings guidance citing the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic but it did forecast total sales in fiscal 2021 of between $435 million and $470 million.

“We are off to a very strong start in the fiscal year 2021. However due to the fluidity with which the pandemic continues to evolve it is very difficult for us to estimate how the pandemic might impact our sales results for the remainder of the fiscal year” said Ridge.

“Looking ahead we will continue to be focused on accelerating our e-commerce business while also raising our digital IQ” he added."

That's pretty much what United Parcel Service Inc. is doing to squeeze two more decades of life from dozens of aging Airbus freighters by revamping their cockpit computers. It's all part of new Chief Executive Officer Carol Tome's strategy to ""sweat the assets"" by increasing efficiency while reducing investment.

The 52 Airbus A300-600 jets were purchased beginning in 2000 and the flight computer has such limited memory that it can't store full navigational maps forcing UPS to divide the U.S. into five regions to hold the information. Each update takes 45 minutes and has to be done each time a plan needs to fly to a different area.

""This is a huge productivity improvement for us"" said Ed Walton director of engineering for UPS's aircraft maintenance unit. ""We had a 1970s-generation flight management system that only had 200K of memory. It's kind of shocking that we were able to stretch it out this long.""

The upgrades use a Honeywell International Inc. system and are a less-expensive alternative to purchasing replacement cargo jets. One drawback is that keeping old planes in service means burning more fuel. But Tome is under pressure to bolster profit margins and reduce capital spending which will drop to $4 billion this year from $5.6 billion last year and more than $6 billion in each of the previous two years as UPS invested heavily to boost efficiency.

UPS declined to detail how much it's spending or saving on the avionic overhauls. The A300 is no longer in production but a new Boeing 767 Freighter a slightly larger plane that UPS has bought recently has a market value of $80.8 million according to aviation consulting firm Avitas.

The new Honeywell system will hold worldwide navigational maps and take about two minutes for updates. It also will have larger displays than the old screens and tools such as a central maintenance system and improved weather radar that enables pilots to avoid storms.

The Atlanta-based courier plans to purchase 11 new aircraft this year down from 16 in 2020 as air-cargo volume surges during the pandemic because of growth in online retail and covid-19 vaccine distribution. Couriers are also hauling some freight that would have been carried by passenger jets had the pandemic not forced airlines to slash their schedules.

Airbus completed the upgrade and flight testing of the first A300. UPS is looking to choose two companies to do the modifications which take about three weeks on the remaining 51 aircraft. The company expects to have them all retrofitted and flying by next year.

For Honeywell the contract is its first complete avionics replacement on a cargo plane said Mike Madsen chief executive officer of the company's aerospace unit. Doing such work for freight companies is a huge potential market.

""Most of them operate the older aircraft because it's economically attractive"" Madsen said. ""There are easily a thousand aircraft that could take advantage of this system.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNS91cy9jb3VudGVyZmVpdC1tYXNrcy1ob3ctdG8tc3BvdC10cm5kL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzAyLzA1L3VzL2NvdW50ZXJmZWl0LW1hc2tzLWhvdy10by1zcG90LXRybmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fake N95 masks have flooded the market. Here's how to tell the difference,"CNN —

There’s one mask guideline that hasn’t changed throughout the pandemic – you definitely should be wearing one.

But what happens when you’re not sure if your mask is real?

These photos were from a CBP seizure of 400 counterfeit 3M N95 respirators at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington DC in April 2020. U.S. Customs and Border Protection

Between the time the pandemic began and the year ended US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized over 14.6 million counterfeit face masks entering the US the agency told CNN.

N95 masks are considered the gold standard for mask usage but counterfeit doppelgängers may threaten Americans’ safety. Not meeting US safety standards means they may not filter out airborne particles effectively the agency said.

N95 masks can also be mistaken with KN95 masks which meet standards in China yet are not certified by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Here’s how you can spot a fake N95 mask.

The most important thing: NIOSH approval

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is a part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that focuses on worker safety and health.

Before filtering facepiece respirators – a fancy term that includes N95 masks – can be used in any workplace they must be certified by NIOSH.

For an N95 mask to get a NIOSH stamp of approval it needs to filter at least 95% of airborne particles.

When finding out if an N95 mask is fake or not NIOSH markings are your compass. But there’s some vetting you can do before you even have a mask in hand.

What to consider before you buy

When buying masks online there are a few things you can ask yourself according to CDC guidance on spotting fake PPE.

If you’re buying directly through a website:

Are there typos bad grammar or other errors on the site?

Are there website flaws like unfinished or blank pages dummy text broken links and misspelled domains?

If you’re buying through a third-party marketplace:

Does the listing call the product “genuine” or “real”? Legitimate companies don’t need to tell buyers their products are real – at least not in the product name.

at least not in the product name. Have reviews been left on the product or on the seller? Buyers unhappy with the product may reveal that it is poorly made or illegitimate.

Is the price too good to be true? It probably is.

It probably is. Is the seller selling the same items over time or keeping with trends? Legitimate businesses tend to stay consistent.

Does the seller put their contact information in images? If so they may be skirting around marketplace policy to keep interactions between buyers and sellers on the site.

How to check if your mask is real

Okay but what if you’ve already bought masks off a website or marketplace and don’t know if they’re the real deal?

Here’s your rule-of-thumb: No markings means no approval.

NIOSH-approved masks have an approval label on or within the mask packaging – either on the box or in the users’ instructions. The mask should also have an abbreviated approval marking.

The approval number on your mask should begin with “TC.” The mask should also have a NIOSH logo printed on it. This image from the CDC can help you identify your mask’s markings.

Then you can check for the approval number on NIOSH certified equipment list.

Some other red flags to look out for include:

Any decorative elements like sequins.

Ear loops instead of head bands. Head bands are crucial to the N95’s tight fit.

Claims for the approval for children. NIOSH does not approve masks for children.

Got a real mask? Share these resources

The CDC and NIOSH have resources to help you in spotting counterfeit masks or even other PPE and medical gear. You can start here and get more tips on vetting masks. You can also look through photos of non-NIOSH-approved masks.

Then you can read about how to protect yourself from buying counterfeit goods.

Got a fake mask? Report it

Fake masks aren’t the only counterfeit products being sold nor the only scam to capitalize on the pandemic.

Criminal organizations are also trying to sell counterfeit pharmaceuticals other PPE and medical devices to “unsuspecting American consumers” CBP Executive Director for Trade Policies and Programs John Leonard told CNN.

Covid-19 has been a fertile time for other scams of all kinds to proliferate – most recently regarding vaccines.

While staying aware and keeping up-to-date you can report any counterfeit masks to CBP through their reporting system or by calling 1-800-BE-ALERT.

You can also report to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center online or by telephone at 1-866-IPR-2060.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXRpemVuc3ZvaWNlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvc2VuaW9yLWRheS1tZW1vcmFibGUtZm9yLXphYm9za2ktbGFrZS1sZWhtYW4vYXJ0aWNsZV80NjM0MWQzZi1iMjMxLTViM2UtYTcyYS02NDc5ZWI0OWI3ZjkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senior Day memorable for Zaboski Lake-Lehman | Varsity Voice | citizensvoice.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The lawsuit was filed at the end of January by the Center for Food Safety an advocacy group seeking alternatives to industrial food processing.

The CFS alleges that insufficient testing has been done on soy leghemoglobin also known as heme which has an effect of making Impossible Burgers look like they're bleeding akin to real meat.

'FDA approved soy leghemoglobin even though it conducted none of the long-term animal studies that are needed to determine whether or not it harms human health' said Bill Freese who is a science policy analyst at the CFS.

The Impossible Burger is facing new scrutiny over its use of soy leghemoglobin

A new lawsuit alleges more testing needs to be done on the safety of soy leghemoglobin found in Impossible Foods

'We find this to be all the more troubling because a number of potential adverse effects were detected in a short-term rat trial: disruption of reproductive cycles and reduced uterine weights in females and biomarkers of anemia reduced clotting ability and kidney problems.'

'FDA's failure to require Impossible Foods to conduct long-term tests called for in the agency's own authoritative guidelines means it does not have 'convincing evidence' that this color additive consumed by millions is safe' said Ryan Talbott who is an attorney at CFS.

Heme for Impossible Foods is produced in yeast that is genetically engineered and contains at least a dozen yeast proteins according to Fox News.

Food Safety News reports this is done by extracting DNA from the roots of soy plants and inserting that DNA into the genetically-engineered yeast.

Then it is fermented so that the heme can be mass produced.

Soy leghemoglobin also known as heme is the additive that makes Impossible Burgers 'bleed'

Impossible Burgers are widely available in the United States including at Burger King

The CFS is an advocacy group that seeks alternatives for industrial food processing

Heme can also be found naturally in plants and animals.

The FDA authorized the use of heme as a color additive in July 2019 after a petition was filed by Impossible Foods.

CFS submitted objections to that approval at the time but they were stayed by the FDA.

'The FDA reviewed the information and data submitted by the firm as well as other relevant information and concluded that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from this use of soy leghemoglobin as a color additive' they determined.

'Impossible has worked closely with the FDA the nation’s food-safety guardian and has shared both extensive test data and commercial plans with the government body' a spokesperson of Impossible Foods said to Fox News.

'We’ve gone above and beyond all regulatory requirements' they added.

Impossible Foods also called the Center for Food Safety an 'anti-GMO anti-science organization that has been spreading lies about Impossible Foods for years.'

According to Fox Business Impossible Foods recently cut its U.S. retail prices in grocery stores by 20 percent in an attempt to improve sales against meat products.

'With economies of scale we intend to keep lowering prices until we undercut those of ground beef from cows' CEO Patrick Brown said of the move.

Impossible Burgers are available in nearly 17000 retailers and supermarkets around the country including Trader Joe's and Walmart.

The company also has prominent partnerships with national restaurant changes including White Castle and Burger King.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vYWNjZXNzbmVwYS5jb20vZWFybHktYWNjZXNzL3BsYW50ZXJzLXJldml2ZXMtbXItcGVhbnV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Planters revives Mr. Peanut,"Mr. Peanut is back to his old self … er shell.

And yes his trademark monocle top hat and cane are back as well.

Planters Peanuts founded in 1906 in Wilkes-Barre has revived its iconic mascot which was killed off around this time last year and replaced by “Baby Nut.”

The company recently revealed Mr. Peanut’s return in a “How it started. How it’s going.” meme that is currently popular online showing a photo of Baby Nut in February 2020 next to a picture of the resurrected Mr. Peanut today.

Local businessman Thom Greco an avid Planters Peanut memorabilia collector who is trying to bring a museum to Mr. Peanut’s birthplace said he always believed Mr. Peanut would be back and was happy to hear the news.

“We thought that was going to happen” Greco said. “In our opinion Baby Nut was brought along to give attention to Planters Peanuts to a younger generation.”

Greco said he recently purchased a significant amount of Planters memorabilia — including an antique peanut roaster with Mr. Peanut sitting on top — during an auction in Alabama following the death of one of the best known Peanut Pals a group dedicated to Planters memorabilia.

He hopes to one day showcase the items in a visitor center and museum in Wilkes-Barre which remained Planters’ home in a South Main Street building until 1961.

“The more the city embraces Planters Peanuts the better” Greco said.

In a commercial before last year’s Super Bowl Planters killed off its beloved mascot in a fiery crash of his NUTmobile.

The tragic death of one of the world’s most recognizable brand characters was designed to build anticipation for Planters’ $5.6 million Super Bowl ad of Mr. Peanut’s funeral — attended by a host of other notable company mascots such as Mr. Kool Aid and Mr. Clean. At the funeral a tear from Mr. Kool Aid dropped on Mr. Peanut’s grave. Baby Nut soon sprouted up.

Instead of spending that kind of money again on a Super Bowl ad Planters this year is donating $5 million to reward people who have gone “A Nut Above.”

“This year instead of spending $5 million dropping me off a cliff again — please don’t — I’m spending it on the people who helped make the world a little less nutty” Planters wrote on Mr. Peanut’s Twitter feed.

The return of Mr. Peanut is the mascot’s fourth transformation in a year. Within seven months of the Super Bowl Baby Nut became Peanut Junior — a 21-year-old adult nut minus Mr. Peanut’s famous top hat monocle and cane. In December the nut transformed again into a 50-year-old named Bartholomew Richard Fitzgerald-Smythe or Bart for short.

Through it all the mascot retained the @MrPeanut handle on Twitter.

Last week Planters hinted at a return to the traditional Mr. Peanut by tweeting “Found my monocle. See you soon.” It was accompanied by a video that said “He’s back with a bang.”

On Wednesday the new and improved Mr. Peanut was revealed.

The return of the original Mr. Peanut comes at a time when Planters’ parent company Kraft Heinz is in talks to sell Planters to Hormel Foods Group for $3 billion.",,,,,,,,,

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands. Despite a slight decrease in net income from $291 million in Q1 2023 to $272 million in Q1 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc demonstrated a 6.5% increase in total revenues reaching $1471 million. Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures along with other U.S. properties reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

Updated 1:15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time 17 December 2013 with deal confirmation and comments from Sean Hennessey of Lodging Advisors.



NEW YORK—After leasing the hotel since it was constructed in 1982 Host Hotels & Resorts has purchased the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square for $19.9 million.



Host had been leasing the property from Empire State Development until 10 December when it exercised its option to buy according to a spokesperson for Empire State Development who confirmed the sale but declined additional comment.



“I think it’s a great deal for everyone” said Michael H. Sonnabend managing member of the Hotel Finance Group at PMZ Realty Capital a New York-based real estate investment firm which was not part of the deal. “The seller got a great price for their asset and the buyer got one of the most visible and consistent assets in NYC.”



Sonnabend noted that Empire State Development sold the retail portion of the property earlier this year.



At the time of the building’s construction New York was attempting to redevelop Times Square considered a risky location to travel and invest. Therefore the government provided several tax breaks and other incentives to encourage development.



Empire State Development signed a 75-year lease with Marriott Corporation in 1982 that provided many of those incentives reports show one of which was the option to buy the land for “fair market value” after paying all deferred rent and repaying a low-interest federal loan.



Marriott later split its operations into two separate companies forming Host Marriott Corporation in 1993. This ownership arm later became Host Hotels & Resorts as it began diversifying its assets.



A Host spokesperson declined to comment on the Marriott Marquis transaction.



In 1998 Marriott and the city revised the terms of its lease so it could comply with requirements for forming a real estate investment trust which became Host Hotels & Resorts.



In February New York comptroller John C. Liu conducted an audit on the Marquis valuing it at $193 million. At the time he told The New York Daily News that the contract amendment including an option for Host to purchase the property for a fixed $19.9 million was “one of the worst deals since Manhattan was sold for $24.”



“From what I have been able to glean it appears the property was having difficulties at some point back then (in 1998)” said Sean Hennessey founder and CEO of Lodging Advisors a New York-based consulting firm. “There’s no reason to believe or indicate that it was anything other than an arm’s length deal at the time.”



John A. Fox senior VP at PKF Consulting USA said Host should be able to reap the benefits of what at the time was considered a highly risky investment.



“It’s great to sit here in hindsight and say ‘That was such a bargain deal that shouldn’t have been made’” Fox said. “But if you look back to where things were when that hotel was conceived a lot of people were questioning whether it should’ve been done. Let’s not forget (Marriott) put in the money to build the building.



“Even well after the hotel opened the area was still pretty seedy” Fox continued. “But (the Marquis) was the lynchpin to revitalization.”



Hennessey said the growth of New York’s east side can be attributed to the redevelopment of Times Square. Today the city government is mulling development incentives to build up certain parts of the east side.



“Not only were they (Marriott) taking a chance building a 1900-room hotel but they were building a property with a huge amount of meeting space” Hennessey said. “It was a major major commitment to the area. A 400-room Hilton or Hyatt wouldn’t have had the same impact.”



Fox acknowledged that a deal between the city and Host “could have been structured differently” to include a buyout option that centered more on fair market value but to cast judgment on that “is total hindsight.”



The Marquis has more than 1900 rooms a ballroom exhibition and meeting space shops and a theater.



“It’s an iconic hotel that should do well no matter the market conditions” Sonnabend said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyNC8wNS8wMS8yODczNjg2LzAvZW4vSG9zdC1Ib3RlbHMtUmVzb3J0cy1JbmMtUmVwb3J0cy1SZXN1bHRzLWZvci10aGUtRmlyc3QtUXVhcnRlci0yMDI0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels & Resorts Inc.

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

Fayé,"Born and raised in Norway H. P. (Hans Peter) Fayé (1859-1928) arrived in the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1880 and soon after leased land at Mana from his uncle Valdemar Knudsen and settled there.

Born and raised in Norway H. P. (Hans Peter) Fayé (1859-1928) arrived in the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1880 and soon after leased land at Mana from his uncle Valdemar Knudsen and settled there.

He then cleared the plain at Mana of giant lava rocks obtained seed cane from Otto lsenberg of Kekaha Plantation and from Meyers & Kruse who farmed land between Waiawa and Pokii west of Kekaha and planted his first crop.

It was during this time also that H. P. became a friend to many Hawaiians living at Kekaha and in the now vanished west Kauai villages of Mana Pokii Kaunalewa and Kolo.

In fact H. P. spoke practically nothing but Hawaiian in those early days and nearly all his friends were Hawaiians.

In the winter rainy season he would sometimes travel with them in low-bottomed canoes upon the inland sea that stretched at that time from Kekaha nearly to Mana.

And when he fished with Hawaiians at sea he became fascinated by their intimate knowledge of the ocean and fishing and all things related to nature.

While building his plantation H. P. asked these Hawaiians where he might find good irrigation water and they in turn took him to a kahuna a blind Hawaiian who could find water by feeling.

The blind man found a place where H. P. dug his first artesian well and for many years subterranean water from that well and other artesian wells was all the water H. P. needed to irrigate his cane fields.

In 1886 when H. P.’s first crop was ready to harvest rice farmer Leong Pah On rented H. P. his Chinese laborers to harvest the cane and the cut cane was sent by bullock teams into Kekaha where it was processed at the Kekaha Plantation mill.

H. P. married Margaret Lindsay in 1893 and they would have eight children.

When H. P.’s Mana sugar company consolidated with Kekaha Sugar Company in 1898 he became its manager a position he held for thirty years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi9jbGFzc2ljLXJlY3JlYXRpb25zLXNoZWxieS1tdXN0YW5nLWd0NTAwLWNyLWlzLWFuLTgxMC1ocC1jYXJib24tZmliZXItYmVhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Classic Recreations' Shelby Mustang GT500 CR Is An 810 HP Carbon Fiber Beast,"The carbon fiber-bodied Mustang starts at $265000 and is powered by a 5.2-liter Coyote V8

Saving weight is very hard to do. Yet Classic Recreations has managed to save a whole wack of it thanks to a full carbon fiber body.

The company is the only one licensed to make Shelby continuation cars and it partnered with SpeedKore for its carbon-fiber know-how. Together they’ve made a Shelby GT500 CR that weighs 600 lbs less than steel-bodied cars.

In order to make it the company first scanned a real Classic Recreations 1967 GT500CR and designed a carbon fiber body in CAD. Once molded the carbon body panels were autoclave-cured. That means that they can be exposed (they’ll also paint them if you want) so the company was sure to make the weaves match from panel to panel.

As a result of the lower weight the “Carbon Edition” GT500 comes with a Detroit Speed suspension JRI Coilovers and a quadralink rear suspension. It also features high-performance Wilwood brakes to make sure it stops as quick as it scoots.

Under the carbon hood there’s a 5.2-liter Gen3 Coyote V8 with stainless steel headers and a Ford 10R80 10-speed automatic transmission. The one in these pictures makes 810 hp but the carbon-fiber upgrade is available on GT500CR 900C 900S and 545 models as well.

Inside you get an Alcantara headliner Kicker audio system a Kenwood media system ProCar leather seats and custom red gauges.

The company unveiled the images of the first completed production car at Motorsport Ranch in Texas on February 2. The location was a reference to Carroll Shelby’s lineage and the date a reference to when he started building the first Cobra in 1962.

Carroll’s grandson Aaron Shelby was on hand to observe the latest iteration of the car his kin launched.

“Shortly after my grandfather beat Enzo on the track at Le Mans Carroll and Ford engineered the all-new 1967 Shelby GT500 as a ‘Ferrari killer’ for the street” said Aaron Shelby. “Fifty-five years later this car has new life with the capabilities to take on Europe’s biggest names once again. I’m proud of Classic Recreations’ efforts to keep Carroll’s dream alive.”

Prices for the carbon fiber-bodied Shelby GT500CR start $265000 but the Carbon Edition is priced at $298000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLWF1ZGktcnMzLWxtcy1ib2FzdHMtMzQwLWhwLWFuZC1sb3RzLW9mLW5ldy10ZWNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Audi RS3 LMS Boasts 340 HP And Lots Of New Tech,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLWF1ZGktcnMzLWxtcy1ib2FzdHMtMzQwLWhwLWFuZC1sb3RzLW9mLW5ldy10ZWNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbWUucGNtYWcuY29tL2VuL29sZC1kZXNrdG9wLXBjcy8xMjkwNi9ocC1hbGwtaW4tb25lLTIyLWRkMDAxMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP All-in-One 22-dd0010 - Review 2021,"Table of Contents Thin Bezels on a Wiry Stand A 1080p Panel Bolstered by Big Sound Testing the AIO 22: Athlon Silver Barely Bronze Performance Productivity Storage and Media Tests Graphics Tests Sensible Perhaps as a Space-Saving Second PC

When we reviewed the $799.99 HP Pavilion 24 All-in-One last year we declared it the all-in-one PC for the rest of us for whom a spendy Apple iMac is out of reach. If a 24-inch model at $800 is for the rest of us then the HP All-in-One 22 is the all-in-one PC for all of us. (Models start at $399.99 with our 22-dd0010 test configuration coming in at $429.99.) This entry-level all-in-one offers a leaner price and a smaller display than its 24-inch sibling. The low price levies its own cost though: You get an underpowered mobile-grade AMD Athlon processor and just 4GB of RAM behind its 21.5-inch display. Its low-end components make the HP 22-dd0010 a better fit for consuming media than creating or editing it but this undersize all-in-one boasts an attractive modern design that belies its very entry-level status. It's satisfactory as a second PC a kitchen info-station or a school companion for a younger student.

Thin Bezels on a Wiry Stand

The HP 22-dd0010 borrows the cloud-white color scheme from the Pavilion 24 All-in-One but it’s not simply a smaller replica. This 22-inch model lacks the diamond-shaped pattern across the speaker bar below the display and the stands are different. Thankfully the HP 22-dd0010 offers the same slim bezels as its pricier sibling. Many budget models saddle you with thick bezels that add to a system’s footprint while giving it the opposite of a sleek modern appearance.

With thin bezels on the top and sides the HP 22-dd0010 measures 19.3 inches wide by 15 inches high and weighs only a hair over 16 pounds. Still for such a small system the HP 22-dd0010 takes up a lot of space. Unlike the rectangle base and simple neck of the Pavilion 24 All-in-One the HP 22-dd0010 uses a wire-frame stand that touches down in four corners covering a rectangle that’s 14.2 inches wide by 8 inches deep. That’s a large footprint for a 22-inch all-in-one. Worse the stand doesn’t provide any room to stow the keyboard under the display when it’s not in use.

Plus with the bundled wired pair of peripherals your options are limited in terms of where you can stash the keyboard when you aren’t using it and want to move it out of the way. A wireless keyboard and mouse combo is greatly preferred for any all-in-one but you rarely get one on a budget model and never on an entry-level model.

A 1080p Panel Bolstered by Big Sound

At the center of the HP 22-dd0010 is a 21.5-inch display with a full HD (1920-by-1080-pixel) resolution. The display is a bit dull (rated for only 250 nits at max brightness) and its off-axis viewing angles are poor. For watching Netflix YouTube or a DVD—yes you read that right a DVD—when you are seated squarely in front of the system the display is more than adequate. HD videos looked crisp and exhibited fairly accurate colors with decent contrast.

It’s only when you are seated closer and viewing text can you begin to see the individual pixels of the display. This screen-door effect isn’t as evident on this 21.5-inch display as it would be stretched across a 24- or 27-inch 1080p panel. For a 27-inch display and up I’d look for a 2K or 4K resolution but 1080p suffices here especially since the HP 22-dd0010 doesn’t have the muscle for any creative work.

Behind the display the HP 22-dd0010 pairs a low-end mobile CPU with a meager 4GB of RAM. The processor is the AMD Athlon Silver 3050U which is a dual-core chip that operates at a base frequency of 2.3GHz and a max of 3.2GHz. (It doesn't support multi-threading so two threads on two cores is all the muscle you get.) For storage it offers a 256GB SSD of which 207GB was free out of the box on our test system.

Most laptops and PCs offer more capable quad-core CPUs at a minimum with eight processing threads along with 8GB of RAM. At the bottom rung of the all-in-one ladder however you are forced to make do with fewer cores and the bare minimum of RAM. As you’ll see in the next section the HP 22-dd0010’s performance failed to set our labs aflame.

The system’s stereo speakers are a pleasant surprise. They emit powerful sound that’s much bigger than a laptop’s audio output. They’ll fill a small room and I found I needed to keep the volume at the 50 percent level or lower when seated in front of the system. The speakers deliver more than enough oomph for Netflix movies and YouTube videos but you’ll begin to hear the lack of a big bass response and some muddied middle and high tones during spirited music playback.

Hidden behind the display is a pop-up webcam that you will not want to use for business Zoom meetings if you can help it—or even video calls with your family. It’s a low-quality camera that can capture only noisy 480p video well short of anything approaching high definition.

All of the system’s ports are located somewhat inconveniently in the center of the back panel. You get no easy-access ports on the side but the HP 22-dd0010 is small enough that it doesn't take too great an effort to get to the ports around back. (You do get a near-invisible SD-card slot on the bottom edge though.)

In a single row on the back panel you’ll find two USB 3.0 ports two USB 2.0 ports an HDMI port headphone and Ethernet jacks and the power connector. All four USB ports are of the Type-A variety which means you’ll need an adapter to connect any of your USB-C devices. In addition to Ethernet the system supplies 802.11ac Wi-Fi which is a generation behind the current 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) specification.

While you won’t find any ports located on either side of the HP 22-dd0010 there is a surprise hiding on the system’s right edge. Like Taylor Swift singing ”I come back stronger than a '90s trend” in her song Willow the HP 22-dd0010 offers a tray-loading DVD burner the first such drive I’ve seen on an all-in-one PC in years. If you’ve got a DVD library collecting dust since you replaced the DVD player with a media streamer in your TV cabinet years ago the HP 22-dd0010 gives you a small screen to get reacquainted with your DVDs. (It’s a DVD+/-RW drive if you want to burn a disc or two for old times' sake.)

The Windows 10 Home software preload provides a McAfee LiveSafe trial and some bloatware that’s not uncommon on budget PCs including promos for Dropbox LastPass Skype WildTangent and Utomik. HP backs the system with a one-year warranty with phone support during the first 90 days.

Testing the AIO 22: Athlon Silver Barely Bronze Performance

Between the underpowered unthreaded AMD Athlon CPU and meager 4GB allotment of RAM the HP 22-dd0010 is limited in terms of what it can and cannot do. It couldn’t for example complete our Photoshop or one of our Superposition benchmark tests. The dearth of RAM was the culprit for the system failing to run our Photoshop test and its mobile AMD Radeon integrated graphics lacked the muscle to power through the high-end Superposition test. (See more about how we test desktops.) What the HP 22-dd0010 can do however is juggle a dozen or so Chrome tabs at once smoothly stream HD video and run Word Excel and other basic office apps. And burn DVDs!

We have not reviewed an all-in-one as inexpensive as the HP 22-dd0010 for years so we had to pit it against other budget all-in-ones that cost considerably more. The AMD Ryzen 5-based HP Pavilion 24-k0220z cost $799.99 when we reviewed it and the Core i5-based MSI Pro 24X 10M AIO cost $899. Those are the closest in price we have to the $429.99 HP 22-dd0010. As a result the charts below include a pair of budget desktops in the Dell Inspiron Small Desktop 3471 and the Acer Aspire TC-885-UA92 which is our current Editors' Choice award winner among budget-desktop small towers. You can see the systems' basic specs stacked up in the table below.

Productivity Storage and Media Tests

PCMark 10 (Productivity Test) and PCMark 8 (Storage Test)

PCMark 10 and 8 are holistic performance suites developed by the PC benchmark specialists at UL (formerly Futuremark). The PCMark 10 test we run simulates different real-world productivity and content-creation workflows. We use it to assess overall system performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing spreadsheet work web browsing and videoconferencing. The test generates a proprietary numeric score; higher numbers are better.

PCMark 8 meanwhile has a Storage subtest that we use to assess the speed of the storage subsystem. This score is also a proprietary numeric score; again higher numbers are better.

The nearest competitor to the HP 22-dd0010 on PCMark 10 is the Core i3-based Dell Inspiron 3471 and even then the Dell was more than 1000 points better. A score that fails to surpass the 3000 threshold indicates the HP 22-dd0010 is limited to the most basic tasks and minimal multitasking.

Cinebench R15

Next is Maxon's CPU-crunching Cinebench R15 test which is fully threaded to make use of all available processor cores and threads. Cinebench stresses the CPU rather than the GPU to render a complex image. The result is a proprietary score indicating a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads.

The HP 22-dd0010 finished dead last by a considerable margin on Cinebench which is this first clue that this system is not intended for any task that multiple processing cores and threads would make easier.

Handbrake 1.1.1

Cinebench is often a good predictor of our Handbrake video-editing trial another tough threaded workout that's highly CPU-dependent and scales well with cores and threads. In it we put a stopwatch on test systems as they transcode a standard 12-minute clip of 4K video (the open source Blender demo movie Tears of SteelTears of Steel) to a 1080p MP4 file. It’s a timed test and lower results are better.

Even versus the rest of this humble bunch the HP 22-dd0010 took anywhere from twice as long to more than four times as long to get through our Handbrake test. Video editing on this system will require patience and lots of it.

Graphics Tests

3DMark Sky Diver and Fire Strike

3DMark measures relative graphics muscle by rendering sequences of highly detailed gaming-style 3D graphics that emphasize particles and lighting. We run two different 3DMark subtests Sky Diver and Fire Strike which are suited to different types of systems. Both are DirectX 11 benchmarks but Sky Diver is more suited to laptops and midrange PCs while Fire Strike is more demanding and made for high-end PCs to strut their stuff. The results are proprietary scores.

The HP 22-dd0010’s basement-dweller scores on 3DMark will vanquish any dreams you might harbor of playing 3D games on this all-in-one. The combination of Athlon Silver and AMD's integrated graphics even underperformed Intel's light-hitting UHD Graphics.

Unigine Superposition

Next up is another synthetic graphics test this time from Unigine Corp. Like 3DMark the Superposition test renders and pans through a detailed 3D scene and measures how the system copes. In this case it’s rendered in the company’s eponymous Unigine engine offering a different 3D workload scenario than 3DMark for a second opinion on the machine’s graphical prowess.

The HP 22-dd0010 eked out a measly 13 frames per second on the Low Preset test and was unable to complete the High Preset test again lending proof that this system is not capable of running 3D games particularly at its native 1080p resolution.

Sensible Perhaps as a Space-Saving Second PC

Having just read about the HP 22-dd0010’s showing in the labs—if you skipped past the performance section to the end of the review I will summarize its benchmark results as ""uninspiring""—you might be wondering what kind of user would purchase this undersize underpowered all-in-one?

Well obviously someone with a tight budget. But more than fitting just a cash-strapped buyer the HP 22-dd0010 is a pick for someone looking for an inexpensive all-in-one as a second or third system in the home. It lacks the punch to act as your primary PC day in and day out but its low-end mobile CPU and pittance of RAM will suffice for browsing the Web working on the occasional office document and watching Netflix YouTube or—gasp!—a DVD.

The advantage the HP 22-dd0010 has over an entry-level laptop at or near its price is a roomier display and bigger audio. What you sacrifice in portability you gain in screen real estate and better sound for movies and videos—and maybe even music playback as long as your tastes don’t tend toward bass-heavy genres. As long as you keep your expectations in check the HP 22-dd0010 will make an easy addition to any room with its stylish space-saving design and rock-bottom price."

The Information Age was not born in Silicon Valley but in Berlin in 1933.

Twenty years ago IBM and the Holocaust exposed with crystal clarity—backed up with a literal tower of physical documentation—that IBM knowingly organized all six phases of the Holocaust: identification exclusion confiscation ghettoization deportation and even extermination all under the micromanagement of its celebrated CEO Thomas J. Watson Sr. operating from his New York office on Madison Avenue and later through European subsidiaries.

Without IBM there would have always been a Holocaust of hundreds of thousands. Einsatzgruppen murder squads and their militia cohorts would still have heinously murdered East European Jews bullet by bullet in pits ravines and isolated clearings in the woods. But it was IBM that helped the Third Reich create the industrial high-speed six-million-person Holocaust metering ghetto residents out to trains then carefully scheduling those trains to concentration camps for murder and cremation within hours thus clearing the way for the next shipment of victims—day and night.

Custom IBM programs controlled the census and registration processes organized the pauperization and ensured that the trains ran on time. There was an IBM customer site—the Hollerith Abteilung—in almost every concentration camp—some with tabulating machines and some with card organizers. IBM even engineered Germany’s odious extermination-by-labor campaign where skills were matched to slave labor needs and Jews were called up to be worked to death. IBM’s code for a Jewish inmate was “6” and its code for gas chamber was “8.” The evidence indelibly proves that IBM was an indispensable and pivotal partner in the greatest crime in history: The Holocaust. But to IBM it was just another business project.

Watson was no stranger to crime in pursuit of his business aims. He had been convicted of extortion in the infamous National Cash Register scandal before he was ever handed the reins of IBM. An evidence technicality allowed his conviction to be overturned and Watson to escape prison time.

Watson received a percentage of every Reich transaction and in 1937 was honored by Hitler in Berlin at a grandiose award ceremony.

How did IBM get involved? When Hitler came to power he wanted to locate and destroy the Jews of Germany Europe and the world. That of course required the resources of a computer. But in 1933 there was no computer. What did exist however was the IBM punch card. The punch card was invented at the end of the 19th century for the U.S. census bureau from where IBM stole the technology. The punch card was a people tracker from its inception.

It was the IBM punch card in Nazi Germany that gave birth to “information technology.” Invented by a German American named Herman Hollerith this card about the size of a dollar bill could store for retrieval any information about a person place or process depending upon how the holes were punched into various rows and columns. The punched card would then be fed into a high-speed reader and out would come something which had never existed before—information.

Prior to the invention of the punch card you could count on your fingers and toes or an abacus but you could not derive any information about the people processes or places you counted. However with those punch cards and the information that was punched into them you could not only count the people in a room but also count how many men how many women how many Jews how many Christians how many had blonde or black hair how many were bankers or tailors how many were born in Westphalia or Warsaw—every trait.

In other words IBM punch cards not only delivered total counts but they also delivered personal information about those counted. It was the start of the Information Age: the individualization of statistics—identifying and quantifying a specific person within an anonymous count.

The IBM alliance with the Third Reich was no rogue corporate operation run out of a basement. Day in and day out it was Watson who personally micro-managed all aspects of the 12-year Nazi relationship which began in the first moments of the Third Reich just after January 30 1933 and ended in the last gasp of Hitler’s monstrous regime in the first week of May 1945.

Under Watson IBM eagerly contacted the Hitler regime and made it clear that the company was “the solutions company.” Indeed IBM would offer any solution the Nazis needed—including the Final Solution.

The first thing Hitler wanted to know was exactly how many Jews actually resided in Germany. IBM hired thousands to execute a door-to-door racial census. Now Hitler had the Jewish names and locations. Then IBM created systems to tabulate that personal data against professional and employment databases as well as financial institutions to help Germany systematically pauperize the Jews. Then location data was used to organize the mass transfer of Jews from their homes into ghettos. Ghetto residents were then systematically forced onto trains. Those trains ran on IBM punch cards—they owed their punctual timetables to special IBM scheduling programs. All the work and prisoner data from all concentration camps was fed into a central nerve center in the T-Building at Oranienburg known as Section D-II and powered by custom-wired IBM machines. Everything IBM did was custom specific and tailored to the precise Nazi need.

All IBM machines in Nazi Europe were leased with monthly payments insured by American and German insurance companies at their known Reich locations and serviced by repairmen twice-monthly on-site whether the noisy syncopating machines were located in downtown Berlin or Auschwitz II. Moreover Hollerith machines olleithHollwere incapable of operating without IBM’s irrepressible stream of custom Hollerith punch cards which were produced only by IBM. Each input card could only be used once. Without a continuing card supply the machines would be like rifles without bullets.

Twenty years after the publication of IBM and the Holocaust … after hundreds of unrequited requests for comment by media and organizations … notwithstanding several negative book reviews by historians which were found so fallacious that they were retracted by their authors or publications with jaw-dropping public apologies … after hundreds of by-lined articles public lectures and interviews … after dozens of new expanded editions … and after many awards not one word has been changed in the book. After endless requests by so many to apologize IBM has not asked for a single change in the text of IBM and the Holocaust or rebutted a single fact. Indeed not a comma has been deleted. The continuing documentation has only deepened the company’s guilt.

Today public fear of what big tech can do to surveil censor and control our lives—from China to California—has ignited heightening interest in this book and its detailed revelations. In January 2021 IBM and the Holocaust hit Amazon’s top 10 books in any category #1 in WWII History #1 in Military History #1 in Company Profiles and #1 in Jewish History. At the same time Barnes & Noble reported the book as its number two most purchased.

IBM has proven that some corporations can get away with murder and still function with impunity.

To peer into our perilous future we need only look back and see what IBM helped Hitler do during the Holocaust in the era before computers existed. Now is the time to ask what could a Hitler-type regime do today and how quickly with today’s high-speed hand-held technology? But first pause to ask why IBM would ever engage in this genocide? The still bloodcurdling answer: It was never about the Nazism; it was never about the antisemitism—it was always about the money. Business was its middle name.

The department has teamed up with IBM to accelerate it Digital Transformation and paperless strategy resulting in government service integrations that saved approximately three million dirhams and helped to reduce paper usage.

The Department of Digital Ajman has announced a collaboration with IBM to accelerate its Digital Transformation and paperless strategy using IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. The move was designed to simplify and enhance citizen experiences in Ajman United Arab Emirates (UAE) through the integration of services across different government entities in the emirate.

To date Digital Ajman’s paperless strategy has brought savings of approximately three million dirhams (US$816726) and helped reduce paper usage saving nearly 200 trees.

Digital Ajman was establised in 2017 with the mission of: “Together with our society we build the digital services ecosystem that drives Ajman’s competitiveness.”

“Digital Ajman launched the Digital Transformation plan over three years ago with the aim of leading the Digital Transformation across the emirate and developing digital channels that are capable of providing smart and proactive government services to the citizens and residents of Ajman. A key priority for Digital Ajman was to connect local federal and private entities in Ajman and across the UAE in order to streamline existing government services improve efficiency and cross-functional collaboration and reduce operational silos” said Ohoud Shehail Director General Department of Digital Ajman. “To achieve this goal we knew that we would require a strong technology partner to help us tackle an enormously complex web of integrations between and among local federal and private entities. IBM was the chosen partner to work with us to solve this challenge and help in achieving the set objectives and benefit from savings in the process.”

IBM Cloud Pak for Integration

Using IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Digital Ajman was able to create a centralised hub based on a hybrid cloud environment which supports integrations between various private and public entities and their data sources. To date Digital Ajman connected around 200 integration points enabling them to bring about financial savings and reduce the amount of paperwork required for government services.

“Digital Ajman has been leading efforts to encourage Digital Transformation across the public and private sectors using the latest of what technology has to offer” said Hossam Seif El-Din General Manager IBM Middle East and Pakistan. “Over the years it’s been evident that citizen experience is at the heart of every transformation project Digital Ajman spearheads. Through their selection of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration they were yet again able to take the emirate’s digital government services to the next level.”

Benefits

Reaping the benefits of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration include Ajman Pay Bait Amer and Bashr.

Ajman Pay an official payment gateway developed by the Ajman Department of Finance used the capabilities on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration for integrating all local government and semi-government entities in the emirate to simplify the process of paying for fees and services. In the past implementing such a project would have required the Ajman Department of Finance to go to each entity check its capabilities integrate point-to-point and overcome legacy system barriers. Through this project Digital Ajman was able to integrate all engaged partners with Ajman Pay and connect them to the dedicated local banks for settlements and reconciliations.

Bait Amer an integrated digital government service which simplifies the process citizens must follow in order to build a house and then move into it. In the past building and moving into a new home involved 17 customer facing touchpoints with government entities. Through IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Digital Ajman was able to connect Ajman’s planning sewerage telecommunications electricity and water departments among others and reduce customer facing touchpoints to only five. Bashr an integrated electronic service which allows investors to establish companies in the UAE within just 15 minutes without the need to visit any government entity. Onboarded onto IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Ajman’s Department of Economic Development was able to smoothly connect with Bashr platform. The platform connects local and federal government departments along with various bodies concerned with licensing economic activities in the country.

Donovan Obituary 2021,"Frank M. Donovan age 86 passed away peacefully on Saturday February 6 2021 with his loving family by his side.

Born in Boston Massachusetts Frank grew up in the nearby town of Dedham. Adventurous and entrepreneurial as a child he worked hard throughout his school years at a variety of seasonal jobs that spanned everything from golf caddy to snow shoveler to road construction. When school was in session he was also a dedicated football and hockey player. This work ethic carried over to his studies and after graduating from Dedham High School he went on to earn degrees from both Boston College (B.S. Magna Cum Laude 1956) and Temple University (MBA 1970).

After earning his degree from Boston College Frank was hired by the Ford Motor Company in Detroit Michigan. From this point forward he would embark on a career that included projects ranging from working with Walt Disney planning exhibits for the 1964 New York World’s Fair to the Space Shuttle Program while working at Aerojet General Corporation. He retired from Illinois Tool Works Inc. where he had guided the property investment group.

In his spare time even though he was a Boston College alumni Frank passionately followed the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team and was rarely seen without his beloved Notre Dame hat. He was an avid reader particularly current events and could often be found reading the Chicago Tribune front to back.

Frank always found himself returning to his love of gardening and enjoying time outdoors. Accompanied by his cat he would often spend time observing the activities of the birds squirrels and deer that visited the backyard.

Good natured and kind he will be missed by all those blessed to call him a friend.

He is survived by his beloved wife of 56 years Barbara Donovan (nee Siemion); loving children Carolyn Donovan James (Nicole) Donovan MD. Brian (Ellen) Donovan; dear granddaughters Keeley and Emily; and siblings Charles Donovan Mary Sweeney Eleanor Palma and Kathleen Feldmann.

The Intel NUC 9 Pro offers something exciting in the mini PC world with a potent workstation crammed into one of the smallest desktop designs you'll ever see with a discrete graphics card inside. The mini PC category is defined by small sizes and Intel's Next Unit of Computing (NUC) has generally followed the basic template of tiny systems but the NUC 9 Pro (starting at $1305 $2868 as tested) steps things up in a big way with Intel Xeon processing Nvidia Quadro P2200 graphics and room for storage and expansion cards.

Not everyone will need the professional-grade power of a workstation desktop – these systems are best suited to users doing professional work in engineering finance medicine and animation – but our Intel NUC 9 Pro review makes it clear that the latest NUC is a compact powerhouse and one of the best mini PCs for power users that's worth the investment.

Intel NUC 9 Pro (Quartz Canyon) review: Price and configurations

The NUC 9 Pro is generally sold as a kit by Intel but you can also buy it as a preconfigured system with all of the necessary components and software to get started. The Quartz Canyon configuration we used for our review – with an Intel Xeon E-2286M processor 32GB of RAM the Nvidia Quadro P2200 graphics card and 1TB of SSD storage with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed – sells for $2868 .

The NUC 9 Pro is available as a barebones kit with no RAM no storage and no operating system. Equipped with a less powerful Intel Core i7-9850H processor and integrated graphics it sells for $1305 . With the same Xeon E-2286M processor as our review model it sells for $1640 .

Other non-Pro versions of the NUC 9 are also out there like the gaming-oriented NUC 9 Extreme (Ghost Canyon) which starts at $999 with an Intel Core i5 9th Gen i5-9300H processor but scales up to a potent Intel Core i9-9980HK system for $1649 .

Finally if you want to put the Intel Compute Element into your own case of choice it's available as a standalone product in both the Intel Core i7 and Xeon versions offered in the NUC kits selling for $1153 and $1473  respectively.

Intel NUC 9 Pro (Quartz Canyon) review: Design

The Intel NUC 9 Pro is substantially bigger than previous NUC designs with a boxy mini tower setup that toes the line between mini PCs and small form factor desktops – much like we saw in last year's Asus ProArt PA90 workstation review. With grills on both sides of the compact chassis this 9.4 x 8.5 x 3.8-inch desktop is made for performance.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

However where many of the smallest desktop PCs rely on mini-ITX motherboards The Intel NUC 9 Pro uses Intel's new Compute Element a cartridge-like enclosed board that contains the motherboard processor and other internal components. (More on that below.)

But where the NUC 9 really diverges from previous models is the ability to add a discrete graphics card. In our case that's an Nvidia Quadro P2200 a workstation GPU that offers plenty of muscle for things like media editing and rendering complex models.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

It also features a case that can be fairly easily opened provided you have a screwdriver. Remove a couple small screws in the back and you can slide off the top cover and then remove the vented side panel for access to all of the internals.

Additional storage can also be accommodated in the larger case – the NUC 9 Pro has both dual M.2 slots for drives – and PCIe connectivity for a discrete graphics card up to 8 inches in length. Like a traditional desktop tower the NUC 9 has most of its ports on the back of the system complete with slots for the additional ports afforded by the GPU.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The Intel NUC 9 Pro seems less like Intel's take on the Apple Mac mini – which is what defined many of the early NUC designs – and instead looks like an attempt to wed the NUC concept with the most extreme small form factor systems. The result is a potent workstation class desktop crammed into 4.92 liters of physical space offering more power per cubic inch than any other desktop we've seen.

That said the Intel NUC 9 Pro case is really only suitable to the NUC and it would take a dedicated enthusiast builder to assemble the same components in such a compact case. If you're more interested in owning a tiny but powerful PC than building one this is definitely the better way to go.

Intel NUC 9 Pro (Quartz Canyon) review: Ports

On the front and back of the NUC 9 Pro you'll find a good number of ports. A total of 6 USB 3.1 Gen 2 slots offer plenty of connectivity for peripherals as well as two Thunderbolt 3 connectors and two USB 2.0 ports. On the front is also an SD card slot and a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

On the back you'll also find one HDMI port coming off of the main board along with two 1 Gigabit Ethernet ports. The Nvidia Quadro P2200 graphics card also provides a total of four DisplayPort connections.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Wireless capability is also built in with 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax wireless supporting up to Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth v5 for connecting wireless headphones keyboards and mice and whatever else.

Intel NUC 9 Pro (Quartz Canyon) review: Intel Compute Element

The latest version of the NUC is built around the Intel Compute Element a modular system that is essentially a small motherboard packaged more like a graphics card with the CPU soldered to the board thermal management built in and an enclosed design that keeps everything safe and secure. Our unit came equipped with an Intel Xeon processor packing some intense power into an extremely compact design. Inside the Compute Element you'll also find a pair of SO-DIMM RAM slots as well as two M.2 slots for storage.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The modular design of the Compute Element means it can even be slotted into a separate PC connecting with a PCIe slot on an existing motherboard. There's no data transfer between the two but it provides an independent full-powered PC small enough to slot into another desktop tower. With the Intel Compute Element available with processors ranging from a Core i5 up to the Xeon we see in our own test unit the NUC 9 Pro offers a huge range of power. The Compute Element runs with a TDP of 95 watts and is even available as a standalone unit separate from the NUC housing.

Intel NUC 9 Pro (Quartz Canyon) review: Performance

Our unit is outfitted with an Intel Xeon E-2286M processor a potent 8-core CPU capable of handling 16 discrete processing threads. Paired with Nvidia Quadro P2200 graphics that puts the NUC 9 Pro firmly in the workstation category packing the sort of power you might need for engineering and other professional 3D applications. If you need to design a bridge or a new hip replacement joint or need to edit lots of high-resolution video this is the sort of tiny PC you'll want.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

While the processor itself can handle up to 128 GB of RAM the NUC and the Intel Compute Element inside are limited to 64 GB. Our own unit boasts an respectable 32 GBof RAM but while that offers plenty of memory for smooth operations it's nowhere near as impressive as either the board or processor should be able to handle.

In our testing of the NUC 9 Pro we were easily able to stream 4K video while simultaneously browsing on more than a dozen open Chrome tabs at once without a hint of slowing down. Even as we expanded this to 20 30 and up to 50 individual chrome tabs the system handled it all without any noticeable lag.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

In Geekbench 5.0 the Intel NUC 9 Pro had a category-leading score of 7985 easily outpacing the likes of the new Apple Mac mini with the M1 processor  which scored 6005 points and blowing the doors off of low-powered mini PCs like the Lenovo ThinkCentre M90N Nano which managed 3265 with an Intel Core i5-8365U processor.

For a more real-world example of performance we also ran the NUC 9 Pro through our Handbrake test testing how quickly a system can transcode a 4K video clip to 1080p. The Intel NUC 9 Pro offered speedy results completing the test in 8 minutes 23 seconds. The Mac mini was just a hair faster (8:11) when using the Apple-optimized version of the test (and only 12:38 when running the standard version via Rosetta 2) but both were well ahead of the Lenovo ThinkCentre M90n (20:23). That said other mini PCs that offer workstation-grade performance have done better – the Asus ProArt PA90 did the same task in 5 minutes 48 seconds.

To get another real-world measure of the system capabilities we use PugetBench's scripted Photoshop test which chews through a number of resource intensive tasks and produces a final score. The Intel NUC 9 Pro produced a blistering 849 points beating out both the Mac mini (566) and the Lenovo M90n Nano (390).

Intel NUC 9 Pro (Quartz Canyon) review: Graphics

With the workstation-grade Nvidia Quadro P2200 graphics card inside the NUC 9 Pro is outfitted with some serious firepower for professional users doing everything from complex financial modeling to engineering and design. With 1280 CUDA Cores and 5GB of dedicated VRAM the Quadro P2200 has the power to drive up to four 5K displays and offers real rendering muscle for pros. It's also certified on dozens of professional applications with independent software vendor certifications for tools as varied as design and engineering applications like Dassault Systèmes SOLIDWORKS architectural software like Nemetschek Vectorworks animation and VFX tools like Maxon CINEMA 4D video editing programs like Magix Vegas Pro and Adobe Premiere Pro CC and image editors like Adobe Photoshop.

In the graphics-oriented 3DMark Pro Fire Strike the NUC 9 Pro scored 9944 points putting it ahead of other workstation mini PCs like the HP Z2 Mini G4 (4609) but falling behind the Asus ProArt PA90 (13897) which leads the category. The Apple Mac mini couldn't run this Windows-only test. Regardless this score makes the NUC 9 Pro one of the more powerful mini PCs we've seen.

The same thing was seen when we tested the NUC 9 Pro's gaming capabilities. Though it's not built to be a gaming machine the combined processing power and graphics muscle let it notch 100 frames per second in the Civilization VI benchmark test when running at 1080p resolution. Compared to the Lenovo M90n (73.6) and the Mac mini (31.5 fps) the NUC 9 Pro is in a different league entirely than most mini PCs we review – which is to be expected.

Intel NUC 9 Pro (Quartz Canyon) review: Verdict

When it comes to the Intel NUC 9 Pro this is one mini PC that offers a ton of power but the real trick is fitting all of that power into such a small space while still offering some upgradability a feature rarely seen in the mini PC world. But fitting a much bigger workstation desktop's might into a mini PC doesn't come cheap and the $2800 price tag of our review model is steep indeed.

Compared to the Apple Mac mini or the Lenovo ThinkCentre M90N Nano which sell for $699 and $449 respectively the Intel NUC 9 Pro is absurdly expensive. And for the vast majority of shoppers those more affordable models will be the better choice. But Intel didn't make the NUC 9 Pro for the average shopper and we aren't recommending it for them.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

For a certain segment of professionals the powerful capabilities offered by the NUC 9 Pro as a compact workstation desktop are more than worth the price. And while you can probably find a standard tower desktop design that offers similar specs and power for less you're also paying for the compact design and here is where Intel's tiny project really pays off. Getting a desktop with a Xeon processor and Quadro graphics is one thing but getting them into the 5-liter case that defines the new NUC desktop? Well that's something kind of special.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjd29ybGQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMzk0MDUxL2ludGVsLWJlbmNobWFya3Mtc2F5LWFwcGxlcy1tMS1pc250LWZhc3Rlci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i7 vs. Apple M1: Let's reality-check Intel's new claims | PCWorld,"After months of silence about Apple’s impressive M1 chip Intel just clapped back with a carefully crafted takedown of the Arm-based chip. It isn’t pretty.

Intel said its testing shows:

An 11th gen Core i7-1185G7 can match or greatly exceed the M1’s performance in a MacBook Pro in both native and non-native applications.

In battery life it’s pretty much a wash.

The MacBook Pro wouldn’t pass muster to be certified as an Evo laptop.

The M1 just won’t run a lot of software.

The new MacBooks have a range of compatibility issues from multiple monitor to game controllers  as well as many documented software plug-in problems.

In the parlance of our time it’s “shots fired” yet again with Intel highlighting problems in competing products. In November Intel did the same with AMD’s Ryzen 4000 which it found to suffer degraded performance when running on battery in many situations.

The normal reaction from outside observers and die-hard Apple fanboys is to dismiss these challenges as sour grapes. Intel however says it has benchmark receipts. Since we enjoy a good reality TV fight we’ll detail Intel’s claims and tell you whether to believe them or not.

Intel

Claim: MacBook M1 is slower than Core i7

Intel says in the WebXPRT 3 test using the same version of Chrome for both the Core i7 system as well as the Arm-native MacBook Intel takes the lead. The Intel chip was largely ahead in WebXPRT 3 and the x86 chip was nearly three times faster in finishing the photo enhancement test.

Intel doesn’t just use WebXPRT 3 though. It also shows the Core i7 pummeling the M1 in a PowerPoint-to-PDF export and in multiple Excel macros by a factor of 2.3x. And yes Intel used the Arm-native versions of Office for its tests.

Our take: We’d really need to run similar tests but we don’t doubt the results. Yes you may think one multi-billion dollar company publicly beefing with another multi-billion dollar company means “it’s all fake benchmarks” but that’s probably not the case because of the huge liability risk Intel might face. That’s why Diet Coke doesn’t outright call Diet Pepsi undrinkable swill (even though it is.)

What you can question is whether Intel picked tasks that favor its own CPU design. But even if you believed that it doesn’t invalidate the testing because exporting to a PDF is about as real—albeit boring—as you can get.

We’d also be remiss if we didn’t point out that WebXPRT 3 gives home-field advantage to Intel as the benchmark developer (Principled Technologies) and Intel have long had a relationship. That however doesn’t necessarily mean the benchmark favors Intel as AMD’s Zen 3 currently has the lead over Intel’s mobile CPUs. Nonetheless Apple fans are certain to say some fouls got missed by the refs here.

Intel

Claim: Core i7 Crushes M1 in AI

For content creation tasks Intel showed the Core i7 to be about 1.12x faster than the M1 in performing a 4K AVC-to-HEVC/H.265 file conversion. In this benchmark they had the MacBook using the M1-native version of Handbrake.

But the real destruction happens once you get to Topaz Lab’s Gigapixel AI and Denoise AI with the Intel Core chip crushing the M1 in AI-based noise removal and enlargement. Or maybe “crushing” is too nice a term as it’s more like the Core i7 outpaces the M1 by so much the M1 wishes it had never been designed.

Our take: As far as the video conversion goes we think it’s too close to call between both platforms and probably not something we’d gloat about if we were Intel. However on the AI features we think the results are pretty real because we have witnessed it ourselves with our own M1 vs Core i7 and Ryzen tests. The 11th gen Core i7-1185G7 so thoroughly thrashes AMD’s Ryzen 4000U and Apple’s M1 we thought about calling 911 for someone to go out to the house and do a welfare check.

We should point out that Topaz Lab’s apps are among the few (but nonetheless impressive) apps that were designed to take advantage of the hardware acceleration inside of Intel’s CPUs. When you have optimization for your hardware you get tons of performance gains. This is the same magic that’s made Apples phones shine for so long.

Claim: M1 doesn’t support all the features

Intel also gives itself the lead in Adobe Premiere Pro using the beta M1 native version in Auto Reframe exporting to H.264 and H.265. They’re decent wins but come on the code is still in beta for the Mac. That said Intel points out that important features like Content Aware Fill are outright disabled on the beta version and that’s a concern. If the native version of Photoshop comes out and there are critical features missing from it that’s a huge problem for Apple (and Adobe).

Intel

Gaming: You can’t be faster if you can’t run it

For gaming we see a bit of a back and forth between the Apple M1 and Core i7 in games that actually work on the MacBook. Intel doesn’t let it end there though and decides to embarrass Apple further by showing the numerous games where the MacBook scores a 0 because game support just doesn’t exist. Intel points out that “countless more” games “don’t run on the M1” and then for good measure it rushes Apple’s bench with a list 10 more games you can’t play on the M1 MacBook:

Overwatch Crysis Remastered Halo MCC Red Dead Redemption 2 PUBG Monster Hunter World Doom Eternal Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 Apex Legends Rainbow Six Siege.

Our take: OK we get it. Macs suck for gaming. All we can is say no rational person would disagree. For gaming the M1 Mac is actually about 10 feet below inferior as a gaming platform compared to the PC—unless maybe you count running GeForce Now cloud gaming on it?

Claim: MacBook wouldn’t win Evo certification

You know that fancy Intel Evo program that tries to improve laptop performance in key areas that annoy consumers? Well Intel pretty much says that if Apple submitted the M1 MacBook to the same program that Asus Dell HP Lenovo MSI Acer and others go through it would be rejected.

The reason? Intel says the M1 MacBook is too slow in doing things that anger consumers such as “switch to Calendar” in Outlook “start video conference Zoom” and “select picture menu” in PowerPoint.

Our take: We know of no AMD-based laptops with Evo certification either. So while Intel might think it’s an insult to Apple to deny Evo certification we suspect Apple won’t care about one less badge on its laptops.

Intel

Great battery life?

Perhaps the most shocking claim Intel showed deals with battery life. While performance tests can be cherry picked by those looking to prove an outcome battery life usually can’t be disputed.

Apple’s official claim gives the M1 MacBook up to 18 hours of battery life using Apple TV app to watch a 1080p video with the brightness set to “8 clicks from the bottom.” Apple also claims up to 15 hours browsing 25 “popular” websites with the same “8 clicks” criteria.

When Intel pitted a MacBook Air M1 against an Acer Swift 5 with a Core i7-1165G7 however it found both basically dead even. The MacBook Air came in at 10 hours and 12 minutes and the Acer Swift 5 lasted 10 hours and 6 minutes.

The difference? Intel said it used Safari to watch a Netflix stream with tabs open with the screen set to a relatively bright 250 nits. On the Acer Safari was subbed out for Chrome but the brightness and Netflix remained the same.

Intel did add that Apple’s “8 clicks up” is about 125 nits of brightness on the MacBook Air which is pretty dim.

Our take: We agree 125 nits is a pretty silly brightness to use for video testing. After all who wants to “watch” a movie on a laptop but then dims the screen so much you can’t actually see most of it?

Probably the largest disconnect here might be the difference between the Apple TV app which could possibly be highly optimized instead of Safari but it’s hard to believe Safari would not be heavily optimized already. We’d really want to do additional testing of our own here.

Intel

All kinds of things just don’t work on the M1

Intel didn’t just get into the performance of the M1. It also said it found the MacBook Pro had serious shortcomings such as an inability to use more than one display with a Thunderbolt dock.

And while the PC can use gaming headsets eGPUs a third-party finger print reader Wacom Drawing tablet and Xbox Controller Intel said it found the MacBook Pro simply doesn’t work with eGPUs and had multiple issues with other devices.

That’s just hardware incompatibility. Intel’s rap battle with Apple also highlights issues with plug-ins for Ableton Bitwig Studio Avid Pro Tools FL Studio Motu and many others.

Our take: The fact that the MacBook can only use a single external display is a big problem. We’d want to verify that ourselves but it’s a serious weakness in this multi-monitor world. Hopefully it’s just a bug from the new platform but for all we know it’s a limitation of the hardware too.

We’ve long said lack of eGPU is a major weakness because who doesn’t want more performance for gaming? But to be fair: We’ve already stressed the Mac is pretty worthless for gaming so what exactly do you need that eGPU for?

Intel’s take on the software issues is a little less problematic we think. When you pull up stakes and tell all of your developers to yet again rewrite software for yet another new architecture… well things will break.

The good news for M1 MacBook users is these applications and plugins will likely get fixed eventually. Mind you this doesn’t mean it’ll all get fixed for free. We’ve seen developers use the opportunity (which might be justified) to fix issues in the next version which by the way you have to buy again.

Intel missed acoustics

One point Intel didn’t cover and we know why is acoustics. One of the singular amazing features of the new MacBook M1’s is the near lack of fan noise (it’s there and you can kick it off by using Topaz Lab’s products) but every review has properly praised Apple’s dead silent operation. That’s something current PCs lose hands down.

Conclusion

While some will tut-tut that Intel’s digs at Apple are undignified we disagree. Apple is the one who first flung mud when it unceremoniously dumped Intel overboard so it’s within Intel’s right to fling mud back. Nonetheless we would want to test out some of Intel’s more serious hardware compatibly and battery life claims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS1ibGFjay1vcHMtY29sZC13YXItZmlyZWJhc2Utei1pbnRlbC1ndWlkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Zombies - Firebase Z Intel Guide,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS1ibGFjay1vcHMtY29sZC13YXItZmlyZWJhc2Utei1pbnRlbC1ndWlkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJvb2tlY3JvdGhlcnMvMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9tYWNib29rLWFpci1tMS1pbnRlbC1yZWFkaWVzLXJlc3BvbnNlLWZvci13aW5kb3dzLWxhcHRvcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MacBook Air M1: Intel Readies Response For Windows Laptops,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2021/02/06/macbook-air-m1-intel-readies-response-for-windows-laptops/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJvb2tlY3JvdGhlcnMvMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9tYWNib29rLWFpci1tMS1pbnRlbC1yZWFkaWVzLXJlc3BvbnNlLWZvci13aW5kb3dzLWxhcHRvcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTE5MDBrLXJvY2tldC1sYWtlLWNwdS1mbGFnc2hpcC1nZWVrYmVuY2gtZmFzdGVzdC1zaW5nbGUtY29yZS1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1ldmVyLXJlY29yZGVkL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTE5MDBrLXJvY2tldC1sYWtlLWNwdS1mbGFnc2hpcC1nZWVrYmVuY2gtZmFzdGVzdC1zaW5nbGUtY29yZS1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1ldmVyLXJlY29yZGVkL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-11900K Rocket Lake Flagship Scores Huge In Geekbench Fastest Single-Threaded CPU Performance Ever Recorded & 13% Faster Than AMD’s Zen 3,"The latest benchmarks of Intel's Core i9-11900K Rocket Lake flagship CPU have leaked over at Geekbench. The numbers show a record-breaking performance for the upcoming chip which is going to feature a brand new core architecture on an Intel Desktop platform for the first time in more than 6 years.

Intel Core i9-11900K Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Decimates All of Its Rivals in Single-Threaded Benchmark Performance 13% Faster Than AMD Ryzen 9 5950X

The Intel Core i9-11900K with its multiple Cypress Cove core will bring the biggest CPU architectural upgrade in over 6 years. This is because ever since the 6th Generation Skylake CPUs all Intel CPUs up till the 10th Generation Comet Lake CPUs have used the same identical chip architecture based on the 14nm process node.

Intel Core i9-11900K Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Specifications:

The Intel Core i9-11900K will be the flagship 11th Gen Rocket Lake Desktop CPU. The chip is going to feature 8 cores and 16 threads. This will result in 16 MB of L3 cache (2 MB per core) and 4 MB of L2 cache (512 KB per core). In terms of clocks the CPU runs at base frequencies of 3.5 GHz but as for boost the CPU will feature a maximum boost clock of 5.2 GHz (1-core) while the all-core boost frequency will be maintained at 4.8 GHz.

The chip will also feature Thermal Velocity Boost which should deliver a 100 MHz jump in the max clock frequency. This should lead to a single-core boost clock of 5.3 GHz making it the first CPU to ever hit such a high frequency out of the box. However do remember that regardless of using the Cypress Cove cores the Core i9-11900K will feature lower cores and threads than the Intel Core i9-10900K. This is partially due to the backporting of Cypress Cove on the refined 14nm process node. The CPU is said to feature a 1st stage power limit of 125W which is standard for a flagship Intel SKU and the 2nd stage power limit or PL2 is rated at 250W.

Coming to the benchmark the CPU was tested at least three times on the same configuration that consists of a Gigabyte Z490 AORUS Master motherboard and 32 GB of DDR4-3600 MHz memory. A maximum single-threaded score of 1905 points & a multi-threaded score of 10994 points was seen during the tests. This puts the Intel Core i9-11900K Rocket Lake CPU as the fastest single-threaded chip ever created. Compared to AMD's fastest Zen 3 chip the Ryzen 9 5950X the Intel CPU is 13% faster.

2 of 9

At the same time it loses in multi-threaded tests due to a maximum of 8 cores and 16 threads whereas AMD's Ryzen 5000 family scales up to 16 cores and 32 threads which is twice as much as the Intel Rocket Lake flagship. The Intel Core i9-10900K scores an average of 1402 points in single-core and 10924 points in multi-core tests. Despite having more cores and threads the 11900K in fact beats its predecessor with a slight performance advantage which is very impressive.

However we must remember that this is an overclocked result. Sure the Core i9-11900K can operate at 5.3 GHz at stock but that's only valid for a single-core. The chip here can be seen running at an all-core boost of 5.3 GHz which is 500 MHz higher than its standard all-core boost of 4.8 GHz. So the stock multi-core score would be lower but even then not by a huge margin. But with that said we have seen that the Rocket Lake CPU is very hard to chip to cool with the AIDA64 FPU stress test pushing it to 98C even while using a 360mm AIO liquid cooler.

While this is a nice showcase for Intel do note that the Rocket Lake CPUs won't be hitting retail till late March 2021. This puts them close to AMD's next answer which should be either in the form of an enhanced Zen 3+ 'Warhol' or a Zen 4 based next-generation Ryzen lineup. Intel also plans to get its 12th Gen 'Alder Lake' Desktop CPU lineup out by 2H 2021 or Q3 2021 which means that Rocket Lake CPUs will be replaced within 1 or 2 quarters giving them an even shorter lifespan than Kaby Lake which was also replaced by Coffee Lake CPUs a few quarters later.

Bill Smead is fed up with it all.

All of the euphoria. All of the monetary easing. All of the eye-popping price-multiple expansions at the top of the market. All of the SPAC hype. All of the stay-at-home stocks' continued returns despite the ongoing vaccine rollout. All of it.

The chief investment officer at $2.3 billion Smead Capital Management says all of these things are adding up to form a perfect storm that will ultimately send the market tumbling in one of its biggest-ever crashes.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""There's multiple financial euphoria episodes combined in here"" Smead said in an interview with Insider on Tuesday. ""There's the bond episode there's the FAANMG episode the stay-at-home episode.""

He continued: ""Everything is turned completely upside down. This is a stupidity episode among the most legendary of all-time."" He added that the crash he is predicting ""might end up going into second place"" behind 1929.

Smead is calling for a minimum 40% drop in the S&P 500 and a five-to-ten year period of negative returns before the market recaptures its old highs similar to the 2000 and 2008 crashes. He declined to give a timeline for the drop but alluded that it could happen at any moment and recited the adage that ""tops are processes.""

He blames central bank policies for the current environment and warns that a massive wave of inflation could be on the horizon and be the catalyst for a crash amid an exploding money supply.

The Federal Reserve has indeed pledged to allow inflation to run hot over the next decade. Unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus from Congress increase the odds of such a scenario unfolding though it remains to be seen if meaningful levels of inflation can take hold.

Heightened levels of inflation would mean price-earnings multiple contraction as earnings figures would balloon. But it would also lead to higher government bond yields and therefore an exodus of investors from the riskier growth stocks that lead — and make up such a large percentage of — the S&P 500 he said.

Even though cyclical stocks would fare better under inflationary pressures and even as an economic recovery lies ahead Smead said the outperformance of these stocks wouldn't make much of an impact in terms of the market's overall performance as they make up a relatively small proportion of the S&P 500.

""There's what like 12% or 14% of the S&P market cap in the 250 smallest companies? A great deal of success could come out of the bottom 250 and it can't possibly make any money for the people that own the index"" he said.

""Over 5-10 years there is zero room for anything but losses"" he added.

Though Smead argues the broader market will see muted returns he is bullish on recovery-oriented stocks. He said people should be buying these securities now in anticipation of the economy reopening.

While he shook his head at the euphoric frenzy that shot shares of AMC into the stratosphere last week he said there was some irony because he thinks it will do well in the months and years ahead as vaccines are distributed.

""The best investments are in what you haven't been able to do not in what you have been able to do"" Smead said. ""So the irony is not where they took AMC but AMC going up actually makes some sense because the cases are falling off a cliff and the vaccines are super successful.""

Smead's views in context

Smead's bullishness on the recovery trade and concern for potential inflation aren't necessarily outliers of opinions.

A lot strategists see gains in the mid-to-long term for cyclicals as the economy recovers. And the Fed itself is signaling higher inflation ahead.

But Smead's call for a drastic 40% decline is toward the margins of market outlooks. Though some like Morgan Stanley's Chief US Equity Strategist Mike Wilson have said recently that markets are due for a brief period of underperformance he and most others see an upward path in the year ahead.

And even if inflation comes it isn't expected this year with wages unlikely to grow as the job market recovers losses.

""I do think you'll see inflation tick higher in the future I don't think inflation is forever gone out of style. I just don't think it happens this year and so that's why we have a positive outlook for the remainder of the year"" Northwestern Mutual's Chief Strategist Brent Schutte told Insider in January.

Still predicting the market's future can be a futile exercise. Though Smead's views may not be widely shared and may not come to pass he builds a case worth paying attention to as investor sentiment and valuations sit at heightened levels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy9pY29uaWMtaWNlLWxha2VzLWxvZGdlLWxpc3RlZC1mb3Itc2FsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iconic Ice Lakes Lodge listed for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sierrasun.com/news/iconic-ice-lakes-lodge-listed-for-sale/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy9pY29uaWMtaWNlLWxha2VzLWxvZGdlLWxpc3RlZC1mb3Itc2FsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldHN1cnJleS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3N1cnJleS1uZXdzL3RyaXAtZG93bi1zdXJyZXlzLW1lbW9yeS1sYW5lLTE5NzI3NjE30gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2V0c3VycmV5LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc3VycmV5LW5ld3MvdHJpcC1kb3duLXN1cnJleXMtbWVtb3J5LWxhbmUtMTk3Mjc2MTcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A trip down Surrey’s memory lane: 9 nostalgic ‘old favourites’ that no longer exist,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Our county has evolved over the decades and we asked Surrey residents to reveal their “old favourites” that no longer exist.

Here are some of the responses we had on SurreyLive’s Facebook page.

The Upper Deck East Molesey

“The Upper Deck swimming pool East Molesey. Richmond Ice Rink was once Surrey. Too many pubs to count.” Eran Adin

The open-air Upper Deck swimming pool in East Molesey was popular with local residents and boasted views over the former Hurst Park racecourse. When it closed an indoor pool was built nearby as a replacement. Upmarket flats now sit on the site of the former outdoor pool.

Richmond Ice Rink

Back in the day this ice skating rink in Twickenham was considered a “premier” rink and when it opened in 1928 it had the longest ice surface in any indoor rink across the globe. It closed in 1992 and the building was demolished.

The Walton Hop Walton-on-Thames

“The Walton Hop the old Walton swimming pool the Embassy Nightclub in Weybridge the Upper Deck in East Molesey and Richmond Ice Rink were our favourite places.” Debbie Ankrah

The Walton Hop was located at the Playhouse and was a “teen disco” started by Deniz Corday in 1958 reportedly the first disco venue in the UK. It was known as the Hi-Fi Hop during 1964-65 before being renamed Walton Hop in 1967.

Stanwell Moor Spelthorne

“Stanwell Moor in 1967 before the M25 was built and when hardly anyone went there. As a kid I would spend all day over there with the wildlife and fishing. Peace and quiet and long summer days.” Robert Osmond

A village in the borough of Spelthorne 17 miles west of central London. It was “transferred” to the county of Surrey in 1965 having been a part of Middlesex. It is within close proximity to the M25 which was opened in 1975 and completed in 1986.

Woking outdoor swimming pool

“Woking outdoor swimming pool. It was so popular and a great way to spend time after school or during the holidays with friends. Being outdoors meant it was very busy on hot days and less fun on cool days but it was such a mecca for families.” Sally Paine

The popular open-air swimming pool was closed in 1984 and replaced by Woking Pool in the Park which is now a favourite with local residents.

Mississippi Exchange Ladymead Guildford

“Guildford Lazerquest in town and the Mississippi Exchange diner at Ladymead.” Anneka Hawkes

Many may remember birthdays spent in childhood at the American-style diner about two decades ago where you got to stand on a chair and have Happy Birthday sung to you by the waiters while they held a giant foam pointing hand in your direction… The building has now been knocked down and is now a large Comet superstore.

Anchor Pub Godalming

“The Anchor Pub in Godalming. The greatest pub there has ever been.” Nick Dunn

The historic pub in Godalming was rebuilt in 1911 before being closed and converted into an Indian restaurant in 2011.

Slyfield Market Guildford

“Slyfield Market! Our dad used to take us all the time.” Kelly Elkins

In 1972 Guildford’s historic livestock and cattle market moved to Slyfield where it remained until 2013 when it was forced to close. The town had historically held a livestock market for over 700 years.

Lowfield Heath formerly Surrey

“Lowfield Heath. Just the church is left now.” Gary Lynch

In the 1970s almost the whole village of Lowfield Heath was demolished to make way for Gatwick Airport. Both Lowfield Heath and Gatwick were in the county of Surrey back then. Only a few landmarks including the village church and some road names now remain.",,,,,,

IFF may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.



That is because International Flavors is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IFF in this report.



In fact the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 97 cents per share for IFF compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IFF giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +15.59% heading into earnings season.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Why is this Important?

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).



Given that IFF has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



Clearly recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for International Flavors and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

Mark Ramseyer that claims sex slaves taken by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II were actually recruited contracted sex workers generated international controversy academic criticism and student petitions at Harvard this week.

The paper “Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War” made headlines across South Korean media and was met with widespread public anger. Ramseyer’s work is set to be published in the March issue of the International Review of Law and Economics. Korean outlets picked up the news after Ramseyer’s paper was featured in a Jan. 28 press release in Sankei Shimbun a Japanese newspaper.

Well-known worldwide for its conservative nationalist bent Sankei shared Ramseyer’s abstract with his permission while adding that memorials to “comfort women” across Asia have spread a “false image” of Japan.

“Comfort women” — a loose translation of a Japanese euphemism for “prostitute” — refers to women and girls forced into sex slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army. Comfort women were held at brothels or “comfort stations” adjacent to Japanese military facilities to serve soldiers. The number of women enslaved from Japan’s occupied territories is disputed but estimates range from the tens of thousands to up to 410000 with many being of Korean descent.

Since World War II Japan has propped up and dissolved compensation funds dealt with lawsuits and investigations and issued and walked back apologies to comfort women. Of the few surviving comfort women today many have said they are still waiting for justice.

The U.N. Commission on Human Rights Amnesty International and many notable scholars in Korea Japan the United States and other countries have published extensive reports documenting the explicit sexual slavery of comfort women.

Ramseyer argues in his paper that comfort women were not coerced but voluntarily employed under the terms of a contract.

Based on the title of Ramseyer’s professorship — the Mitsubishi Professor of Japanese Legal Studies — many Korean media outlets and scholars suspected that he may be sponsored by the Japanese corporation.

Yuji Hosaka — a political science professor at Sejong University in Seoul often cited in Korean press — suggested in an interview the possibility that Mitsubishi donated money to the University to establish the professorship and give Ramseyer this role.

In an interview with The Crimson Friday Ramseyer said he is not aware of the precise origin of the endowed professorship but believes that Mitsubishi Group made an approximately $1.5 million donation to Harvard in the 1970s to back the position. He said however that there are “no strings” or money from Mitsubishi attached to his professorship today.

Spokespeople for the University and the Law School did not respond to a request for comment.

Hosaka also said he suspected Ramseyer’s work was influenced by his connections with the Japanese government. Ramseyer who was raised in Japan was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun in 2018 a Japanese government distinction for those who promote Japanese culture abroad.

Ramseyer acknowledged that he has friends who work for the Japanese government but “absolutely” denied that those connections or the award had any influence on the paper.

Academics Question Paper’s Reasoning and Sources

Legal scholars and historians from South Korea and the United States said Ramseyer’s paper had several flaws in its reasoning and raised questions about the sources he used to back up those arguments.

Harvard Professor of Korean History Carter J. Eckert wrote in an emailed statement that Ramseyer’s article is “woefully deficient empirically historically and morally.”

Eckert added that he and fellow Harvard History professor Andrew Gordon ’74 are preparing a critical response to Ramseyer’s article at the request of the journal.

University of Connecticut professor of Japanese and Korean history Alexis Dudden — who said she took a class taught by Ramseyer at the University of Chicago in the 1990s — said she was “shocked” when Ramseyer emailed her the article in December.

“It is a poorly resourced evidentially fatuous piece of scholarly production” she said. “It is conceptually misguided because he’s not understanding not only the context but what actually happened.”

Dudden said after reading the article she wrote to Ramseyer responding to inaccuracies she noticed in his logic.

Among the first things she noticed she said was that Ramseyer omitted “an intense body of scholarly archival Government of Japan evidence.”

Pyong Gap Min — a sociology professor at Queens College City University of New York who has researched comfort women — said that Ramseyer based his claims solely off of Japanese “neo-national arguments.”

“He has the burden to refute previous studies that have demonstrated the comfort women system as sexual slavery” he said.

Ramseyer said an early version of his paper included “disputes with historians” but those sections were cut from the final version at the request of the journal in order to focus the article on the contracts.

The journal’s editors did not respond to a request for comment Saturday.

Several scholars also said they took issue with two of Ramseyer’s main arguments in the article.

The first is his claim that recruiters and brothel operators rather than the Japanese government or military were responsible for forcing women to work at the comfort stations.

“Ramseyer made the error of completely ignoring the fact that these recruiters were working under Japanese military or government orders” Hosaka said in an interview conducted in Korean.

Japanese government documents provide evidence that the Japanese military secretly selected independent recruiters and forced them to operate comfort stations Hosaka added.

Professor Seo Kyoung-duk who teaches at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul said he agreed with Hosaka citing a 1938 Japanese ministry notice on recruiting women to comfort stations.

Responding to the evidence that Hosaka Seo and other scholars have cited in their research Ramseyer said the notion that there are documents confirming Japanese government involvement is “just wrong.”

“I don’t see anything that indicates that the Japanese government dragooned people into doing it” he said.

Asked why he did not cite any Korean sources in the paper Ramseyer said he is “very upfront” about the fact that he does not read Korean.

Several academics also disputed another one of Ramseyer’s claims in the paper: that comfort women willingly entered brothel contracts from which they financially benefited and after which they were able to return home.

“The comfort women system that the army was using is essentially an extension of the licensed prostitution system that was in effect in Japan” Ramseyer said in the interview.

Hosaka argued however that the “comfort stations” that accompanied the Japanese military during WWII and the licensed brothels in Japan are entirely different.

Harvard Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 who has studied comfort women and contract theory also said Ramseyer’s claim is incorrect.

“The economic relationship that was deployed even according to Ramseyer’s own research is very close to what we would ordinarily call debt slavery” Feldman said comparing it to sharecropping contracts in the Jim Crow American South. “Such arrangements are designed to and do exploit the vast power discrepancy between different actors and institutions.”

Katharine H.S. Moon a professor of Asian studies and political science at Wellesley College wrote in an emailed statement that Ramseyer’s claim ignores the context in which women entered into contracts.

“How do we explain whether a 14- or 16-year-old girl knew what she was signing even if she signed it especially in a Korean society at the time that was not accustomed to contracts and related legalism and didn’t grant such agency to girls and women?” Moon wrote.

Students React with Anger Petitions

The Korean Association of Harvard Law School led by law students Gabrielle J. Kim and Kikyung “Kik” Lee released a statement Thursday condemning Ramseyer’s article as “factually inaccurate and misleading.” As of Saturday morning the statement garnered more than 800 signatures many from law students across the U.S.

The Harvard College Korean International Student Association also sent a press release to Korean newspapers Friday morning criticizing Ramseyer’s paper and laying out actions the organization plans to take in protest.

KISA also plans to send out a petition to Harvard affiliates according to Yumi Lee ’21 one of its co-presidents.

Lee said the petition will contain a list of demands to Ramseyer University administrators and the academic journal publishing Ramseyer’s article. It will request that Ramseyer apologize “to comfort women for whom his claims may have reinforced painful trauma” and “to the Harvard University community for injuring the institution’s reputation and standards for academic soundness” she said.

Lee also said KISA will demand that University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 condemn Ramseyer’s research and that the journal apologize for not upholding a rigorous peer review process and withdraw the article from its upcoming issue.

In a separate email to members Friday KISA wrote that the Korean Consulate General in Boston is “aware of the situation” and may use KISA’s statement in an official communication. The consulate did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

Several Harvard undergraduates said they reacted with disbelief and disappointment when they first encountered news of the article in South Korean media.

“It was all over the news” Alyssa Suh ’25 who currently resides in Seoul said. “I was extremely angry and upset when I first saw that. We were colonized and they don’t acknowledge that.”

“No one really knows about this piece of history in the States. The amount of Korean history that we learn is literally a paragraph” Suh added.

Ike Jin Park ’20-’22 said if the history surrounding comfort women was more well-known in the U.S. there would be a greater outcry from students.

“As a Korean citizen myself I was very uncomfortable” Park said. “Imagine this was another issue that a lot of people in the West cared about. It simply wouldn’t be okay.”

Park also said he believes the University “needs to make a statement” and that he would like to see the paper taken down.

Esther E. Kim ’23 said she believes the article will damage Harvard’s reputation among Koreans.

“Especially because there is a lot of respect afforded to institutions like Harvard by the Korean community by the Korean-American community it is devastating to see that this could be accepted and published by a Harvard Law School professor” she said.

Responding to student backlash Ramseyer said he has a “responsibility to the students at the Law School” and is willing to speak with them about the paper.

Ramseyer also said he does not intend to pursue further research on this topic.

Though many scholars said they disagree with Ramseyer’s claims several noted Ramseyer is protected by academic freedom to promote his opinions.

“His academic freedom entitles him to express whatever views he wishes without any form of university-based sanction” Feldman said.

Law School professor Jeannie Suk Gersen wrote in an emailed statement that she was “proud” that HLS student organizations had released the statement “affirming the need to be historically accurate.”

“They have refrained from petitioning for measures that would impair my colleague’s academic freedom and I would of course disapprove of any such calls” she wrote.

“He has every right to his opinions and viewpoint and we all equally have every right to criticize his reasoning and logic” Gersen added.

Ciaran Mallon and James Goldstone were asked jointly to take over the reins at Invesco Income and Invesco High Income last May after former manager Mark Barnett was sacked after a woeful six-year period at the helm of the two multi-billion pound funds.

Under Barnett's stewardship both funds shrank in size by an alarming 75 per cent as a result of a double whammy – poor stock selection and thousands of investors heading for the exit doors as performance deteriorated.

Under former manager Mark Barnett's stewardship both funds shrank in size by 75%

Barnett had taken over the running of the funds from Neil Woodford in the spring of 2014 after the latter (much lauded at the time) jumped ship to set up his own investment business Woodford Investment Management.

It no longer exists after a string of disastrous investment decisions which resulted in the break-up of master fund Woodford Equity Income triggering big losses for thousands of investors.

Given Barnett was dubbed 'Son of Woodford' for his close working relationship with the disgraced fund manager Mallon and Goldstone could mischievously be called 'Sons of Barnett' as a result of working for the former head of UK equities at Invesco.

Mallon 49 has been at Henley-on-Thames based Invesco for 16 years and also runs investment trust Invesco Growth and fund Invesco Income and Growth. Goldstone seven years his junior manages investment trust Keystone.

But in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday the managers say they are determined to stamp their mark on the funds – now relabelled Invesco UK Equity Income and Invesco UK Equity High Income.

No one can accuse the joint managers of sitting on their hands since taking command last May. Despite working remotely for the entire time they've overhauled both portfolios.

Clean sweep: Ciaran Mallon is shaking up Invesco funds together with James Goldstone

On the £3.3billion High Income fund they've sold 30 quoted stocks while buying 23. On the £1.5billion Income fund they've sold 30 and added 26. Over half of both portfolios have been changed.

So out have gone the likes of BT British Land Card Factory and IP Group. In have come Ashtead Bunzl Barrick Gold Croda RELX and Vodafone. Stocks such as BP BAT Legal & General National Grid Next PureTech Health Tesco and Whitbread have been kept – and in some cases added to.

The two funds' portfolios are very similar with seven of the funds' top ten holdings common to both. The main difference is that as the name suggests High Income has a greater emphasis on generating an attractive income for investors that it pays quarterly.

In contrast Income is run on a more total return basis with the scope to invest in smaller listed companies. So for example Income holds shares in FTSE 250 stock Coats Group while High Income doesn't.

'It's been a joint process' says Goldstone in explaining the overhaul of the portfolios 'a partnership of equals'. He adds: 'It's involved a lot of change and although it's still early days we're really pleased with the results. The performance so far has been encouraging.'

Mallon adds: 'If you look at the performance of the two funds since we took over and look at all the portfolio changes we have made – changes that have involved costs – we think it is quite creditable.'

It's not flannel. The numbers back them up. Since getting their hands on the portfolios the two funds have registered returns in excess of 20 per cent. Both have outperformed the FTSE All-Share Index.

Hold buy or sell? What the experts are saying... DARIUS MCDERMOTT Chelsea Financial Services: 'They are still a watch or hold. It's early days but since taking on the funds the managers have done a decent job and started to turn things around. 'Invesco is undergoing some quite big changes as a company and we'd like to see this settle down. We would also want to give the managers more time to adjust the portfolios and show continued outperformance before we'd consider making them a buy again.' JASON HOLLANDS Tilney Wealth Management: 'I wouldn't advocate new investment in these funds at the moment. Turning them around is still work in progress but it is clearly underway. 'If you are an existing investor there is a case for hanging on. A lot of the pain on the rump of unquoted holdings has already been taken and these funds are now more liquid in profile. 'Also the funds are still managed with a 'value' approach – picking shares that are relatively cheap in the expectation their price will rebound. Value investing has been out of favour as markets have favoured growth companies such as tech and online businesses. But there have been the inklings of a shift over the last few months as investors start to look again at out-of-favour sectors with recovery potential. 'Alternative UK income funds worth considering include Threadneedle UK Equity Income Jupiter Income and Evenlode Income.' BRIAN DENNEHY Fund Expert: 'Investors must switch to vastly superior income funds.'

Yet the long-term numbers still look horrendous. Over the past one three and five years the two funds have recorded double-digit losses.

Over the past year both have registered losses of 20 per cent – compared with an 8 per cent loss for the FTSE All-Share Index. The funds continue to shed investors.

'What do we want to own in the portfolios has been our approach' says Mallon. 'As a manager you can either look back and find error or be more positive and say 'What should the portfolios be built on? What will make a fantastic investment?' '

Goldstone admits the changes have been dramatic but was keen not to appear to be 'conducting a fire sale of assets' adding: 'We're at the point where we can say they are our funds substantially ours.'

Barnett had taken over the running of the funds from Neil Woodford in the spring of 2014 after the latter jumped ship to set up his own investment business

One hangover from the Woodford era is the funds' exposure to unquoted and illiquid smaller listed firms that should never been in an income oriented fund.

As one fund manager said: 'One of the reasons for the massive underperformance of the two funds in the past four to five years is that they were weighed down by the dross Woodford bought and Barnett could not sell.'

As at the end of last year Income and High Income had 1.4 and 1 per cent exposure to unquoteds respectively both spread across 13 companies and 20 holdings. They also had nearly 10 per cent and just over 8 per cent respectively of their assets in listed smaller companies.

Overall Mallon believes the pair have started well at the helm of Income and High Income. Goldstone agrees. 'Every decision we are making is a joint decision. We challenge each other. So far one plus one is more than two.'

Though investment advisers are impressed they are not yet ready to recommend the funds to investors.

For now one plus one means two managers desperately trying to rectify the errors of the past.

Lawyers at Leigh Day are a step closer to seeking redress for investors who lost money in the break-up of Woodford Equity Income.

DENVER — At last years of long discussion as to whether John Lynch was a Hall of Fame player has been silenced.

Lynch is a Hall of Famer once and forever.

On his eighth consecutive try as a top 15 modern-era finalist Lynch was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame after the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Denver Broncos safety received at least 80 percent of the tallies from a committee of 48 voters it was announced Saturday night. Lynch learned of his election back on Sunday January 24 as his family was gathered to watch the NFC Championship Game pitting Tampa Bay against Green Bay at his offseason San Diego home.

""I saw my neighbor later and he said 'You must have got into the Hall of Fame'"" Lynch said in an interview with 9NEWS. ""I said 'How’d you know?' And he said 'Because why else would you have a camera crew at your house during quarantine?'""

Hall of Fame president David Baker notified Linda Lynch of her husband’s election on Friday January 22. She made sure their four children and John’s mom and dad were at the Lynch home on Sunday afternoon – although she told them the purpose of the gathering was the conference championship games.

""Linda was the only one who knew"" Lynch said. ""She didn’t tell anyone and it was perfect because we had gone to church and then the games were on so it’s plausible that everybody would be there. I mean that’s normal for us. But she hadn’t told any of them.""

Then came Baker’s knock on the Lynch’s door.

""It was a surprise for everybody"" Lynch said.

Oh and one more thing before Baker left. The Hall of Fame made the entire Lynch clan sign non-disclosure agreements.

Lynch who is now general manager of a San Francisco 49ers team that won the NFC Conference Championship Game a year ago played 11 seasons for Tampa Bay where he was named to the NFC Pro Bowl team five times and helped the Bucs win the 2002-season Super Bowl. He then played four seasons with the Broncos and was named to the AFC Pro Bowl team all four times.

The only other Hall of Fame-eligible players who had four-plus Pro Bowls with multiple teams – Champ Bailey Reggie White Willie Roaf Tony Gonzalez and Ken Houston– all had their busts bronzed in Canton.

Lynch’s 9 Pro Bowls are tied for second with Ed Reed and Brian Dawkins among safeties trailing only Houston’s 12. Reed and Dawkins had previously joined Houston in the HOF.

With Lynch and Bailey anchoring the Denver D from 2004-07 the Broncos were 4th in total defense in 2004 and ranked 3rd in scoring defense in 2005 when the Broncos went 13-3 during the regular season beat Tom Brady and the Patriots in a second-round playoff game at Mile High and reached the AFC Championship Game.

Lynch was more than just a four-time Pro Bowler in his four years with the Broncos. He and Linda gave out more than $1 million in college scholarships to local high school scholar-athletes through their John Lynch Foundation for 14 years from 2004-17.

Lynch first became a top 15 HOF finalist in 2014 his second year of eligibility. It appeared to be his turn to get elected into the class of 2017 his fourth year as a finalist but he split the safety vote with first-ballot candidate Dawkins. The next year Dawkins who played three of his 16 seasons with the Broncos catapulted Lynch into the Hall.

Lynch again appeared to be on the verge to join the Centennial Class of 2020 but he was jumped by Broncos’ safety Steve Atwater who was elected 20 years after his final game and in just his third year as a finalist.

Lynch vs. Atwater was a fervent debate among the Hall of Fame voters last year – ""I didn’t like that because Steve is a good friend of mine"" Lynch said. -- and Lynch’s HOF case drew considerable discussion again this year when voters met by Zoom on January 19 to elect the class of 2021. With Super Bowl 55 and the NFL Honors show in Tampa – where Lynch spent the bulk of his playing career – it would have been almost cruel for voters to not give Lynch one of the five modern-era spots this time.

The lot can be tough maybe but not don’t call them cruel. Lynch who was previously inducted into the Broncos’ Ring of Fame and the Bucs’ Ring of Honor will now get his bust bronzed and placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame museum in Canton Ohio. The induction ceremony for the Class of 2021 is scheduled for Sunday Aug. 8 in Canton providing the event receives health officials’ clearance from COVID. The Hall of Fame Class of 2020 that features Atwater – which did not get its ceremony last summer because of the COVID shutdown -- will be inducted the day before on Saturday August 7 virus permitting.

""A pretty good year for the Broncos because of the two classes"" Lynch said. ""Atwater Peyton and myself all there so a good representation.""

Indeed the Broncos are on a Hall of Fame roll with an NFL-most six elected in the past five years -- Terrell Davis (2017) Bailey (2019) owner Pat Bowlen (2019) Atwater (2020) and now Manning (2021) and Lynch (2021) and five in the past three.

Entre el 80% y 90% de los medicamentos consumidos en México son genéricos y similares; un estudio destaca que el uso de genéricos es fundamental para la salud de los mexicanos

Entre el 80% y 90% de los medicamentos consumidos en México son genéricos y similares convirtiéndose nuestro país en el segundo consumidor de estos fármacos en el hemisferio después de Brasil revela un estudio del Instituto Belisario Domínguez (IBD) del Senado.

Menciona que la consultoría especializada en la industria de salud IQVIA estima que nueve de cada diez medicamentos que se venden en México son genéricos mientras que la Asociación Nacional de Fabricantes de Medicamentos (ANAFAM) señala que son ocho de cada diez dentro de un mercado donde se comercializan anualmente alrededor de 3 mil 200 millones de unidades.

Detalla que al ser México uno de los países con mayor penetración de genéricos a nivel mundial los cambios legislativos que tuvieron que realizarse para la implementación del Tratado entre México Estados Unidos y Canadá (T-MEC) tuvieron que conciliar posturas entre la industria farmacéutica y las agrupaciones de productores de genéricos.

El estudio titulado “La cuestión de las patentes en el Tratado México-Estados Unidos-Canadá: ¿un obstáculo para el desarrollo de medicamentos genéricos en México?” elaborado por Ernesto David Orozco destaca que el uso de genéricos es fundamental para la salud de los mexicanos.

El documento apunta que a nivel regional México es el segundo mercado más grande de América Latina en la industria farmacéutica y es un importante productor de medicinas de alta tecnología incluyendo antibióticos antinflamatorios y tratamientos contra el cáncer entre otros.

De las 15 principales empresas a nivel internacional 14 tienen presencia en el país por lo que se ha posicionado como uno de los principales centros manufactureros del sector a nivel mundial.

En términos económicos la industria farmacéutica representa en promedio 1.2% del PIB nacional y 7.2% del PIB manufacturero refiere el estudio.

Legislación secundaria del T-MEC tuvo que conciliar posturas entre la industria farmacéutica y agrupaciones productoras de medicamentos genéricos.



Al ser México uno de los países con mayor penetración de genéricos a nivel mundial los cambios legislativos que tuvieron que realizarse para la implementación del Tratado entre México Estados Unidos y Canadá tuvieron que conciliar posturas entre la industria farmacéutica y las agrupaciones de productores de genéricos según una investigación de la Dirección General de Investigación Estratégica del Instituto Belisario Domínguez (IBD).

El estudio titulado “La cuestión de las patentes en el Tratado México-Estados Unidos-Canadá: ¿un obstáculo para el desarrollo de medicamentos genéricos en México?” elaborado por el investigador Ernesto David Orozco Rivera destaca que en la discusión de la Ley Federal de Protección a la Propiedad Industrial ambas partes buscaron promover sus posturas durante el proceso de discusión legislativa mediante activas estrategias de cabildeo en ambas Cámaras del Congreso y la difusión de noticias y artículos periodísticos sobre las presuntas implicaciones del T-MEC para el sector farmacéutico en general y para la producción de medicamentos genéricos en particular

La investigación del IBD concluye que el T-MEC no representa por sí mismo un obstáculo para la producción de genéricos y son las legislaciones nacionales las que pueden aumentar o reducir los periodos y/o criterios de protección.

En ese sentido sostiene que la Ley Federal de Protección a la Propiedad Industrial no supone un obstáculo para el desarrollo de medicamentos genéricos aunque todavía hay algunos temas pendientes entre los que se encuentran modificaciones a los reglamentos de Insumos para la Salud y de procedimientos de notificación y audiencia.

It would join a parade of electric vehicle makers and infrastructure companies getting their businesses funded by eager investors.

SPACs sometimes are called blank-check companies because investors pile in money without knowing the merger target.

Hyzon is a spinoff of Singapore’s Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies which has sold thousands of fuel cells in Asia over nearly 20 years.

That was true for Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) which on Thursday announced a 128% quarter-over-quarter sales growth for its fiscal Q2 2020 and earnings per share of 18 cents versus an expected 9 cents. Revenue surpassed $1 billion reaching $1.06 billion versus $466.3 million a year before.

But port congestion and skyrocketing sales overwhelmed the company’s supply chain. Despite the record earnings results Peloton’s stock dropped 6% in after-hours trading Thursday.

Peloton’s supply chain is broken and its customers are angry.

CEO John Foley announced on the earnings call the company would invest $100 million to speed up delivery for its connected products acknowledging continued problems with delivery delays that are stretching into months rather than weeks. Foley noted port congestion on the West Coast as a significant problem.

“West Coast port delays and COVID-related delivery challenges have prevented us from returning to our normal order-to-delivery wait times and unfortunately forced us to reschedule many deliveries” Foley said on the call. “To address this issue we will continue to invest heavily in systems teams and manufacturing capabilities to ensure we don’t disappoint our customers going forward.”

Part of the $100 million will go to expediting shipping for products from Asia. In an update to customers on the Peloton website Foley noted the expense will include shipping products by air instead of by ocean.

“On average in the coming months we will be incurring a transportation and delivery cost that is over 10 times our usual cost per Bike and Tread including in many cases shipping them by air instead of by sea. We are making this investment because we are as frustrated as you are that you don’t have your Peloton Bike or Tread yet. We are (and always have been) a company that is deeply committed to your happiness and we’ve fallen short of that in this regard” Foley wrote.





The port congestion has been a major headache for companies of all shapes and sizes. At the end of January FreightWaves’ Greg Miller wrote about the impact the West Coast port congestion was having on trans-Pacific trade.

“On average in the coming months we will be incurring a transportation and delivery cost that is over ten times our usual cost per Bike and Tread including in many cases shipping them by air instead of by sea.” John Foley Peloton CEO in note to customers

“Massive port congestion in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is forcing ocean carriers to take extreme measures. Sailings are now being ‘blanked’ (canceled) not because of lack of demand but because of lack of tonnage as ships are stuck awaiting berths” Miller wrote.

Peloton is but one example of this but it was not an unforeseen one. FreightWaves’ Andrew Cox a research analyst and author of the Point of Sale newsletter wrote about Peloton’s issues in November.

“One of the first [newsletters] I wrote was titled ‘Can Peloton avoid disaster this holiday season?’ and I was questioning that because there were already mounting delays back then and people were starting to complain but the situation has gotten much worse since then” Cox said on a Jan. 20 edition of Great Quarter Guys.

Joining Cox on the episode was Seth Holm senior research analyst for FreightWaves. Holm’s comments on the situation were more pointed.

“Peloton didn’t have enough bikes and treadmills in inventory to meet demand so they had to run factories 24/7 and a lot of this stuff is produced in Asia” Holm explained. “It was then placed on container ships and it goes across the ocean to LA or Long Beach.”

Foley said Peloton has ramped up production 6X in the past 12 months and it was now producing more bikes on a monthly basis than it did in all of 2018.

“They were already so backed up over the past three to six months that it was taking three months call it 10 to 12 weeks to get your Peloton” Holm continued. “What’s been happening lately is capacity has gotten so tight and bottlenecks [are happening] all over the place from the ports to the rails to trucks … that people all over the place are getting notified often on the day they were [expecting delivery] that their delivery is being delayed a month or two months.”





Holm added that Peloton has been deflecting blame suggesting that final-mile transportation providers like XPO (NYSE: XPO) and J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT) are part of the problem.

“It’s likely a combination” Holm said. “Some of the fault probably lies with the manufacturers back in China. Some of it probably lies with the ocean container lines — [there] have been labor shortages at the ports — and then it goes to Peloton for not being able to coordinate this whole process and get products delivered to their customers. And they clearly don’t have the technology on the back end to get visibility into the status of their freight.”

FreightWaves’ request for comment to Peloton had not been returned as of publishing time.

In the earnings call Foley said Peloton will incur costs for expedited air and ocean shipments and some products will be redirected to less congested ports.

“We will continue making significant investments to get our products to the U.S. with more certainty and with greater speed. We have also significantly lowered marketing spend even during our typical peak selling periods. We are determined to do what it takes to reduce our delivery times and get certainty for customers on the delivery dates we offer” Foley said.

Peloton reported it added 333000 net Connected Fitness subscriptions in its fiscal Q2 and it has over 4.4 million global members overall.

Jill Woodworth chief financial officer said the impact of the added cost will be mostly felt in Peloton’s Q3 earnings. Air shipping expenses are elevated she said and Port of Los Angeles unloading times are currently four times normal both of which will be reflected in a compression of Q3’s margin with a “more muted” impact in Q4.

Woodworth added that “outside shipping costs will largely abate by June as we build up significant inventory stateside in the coming months.”

Peloton reduced its full-year margin guidance to 39% from 41% due to the supply chain investments.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

And if all the praise is to be believed the author of the L.A. Times bestseller “Arroyo: A Novel” — Jacobs’ first crack at historical fiction after producing an impressive array of non-fiction works — has another hit on his hands.

In his soon-to-be-released “The Darkest Glare: A True Story of Murder Blackmail and Real Estate Greed” “Jacobs’ ear for a good story is pitch-perfect and he tells it with all the smoggy pastel colors of post-noir LA. ‘The Darkest Glare’ isn’t an old song in a new key but an entirely new song about crime fear and a weird kind of redemption that could only happen in the general vicinity of Hollywood” says fellow writer Ron Franscell author of “The Darkest Night.”

Said Steve Hodell author of “Black Dahlia Avenger: A Genius for Murder” a former LAPD detective who believes his father was responsible for that gruesome historic slaying “This is not just another Hollywood Whodunit. In the end we find it is really about one man’s search and struggle to find his own personal truths and redemption. Well written and highly recommended.”

And in the opinion of Stephen Jay Schwartz author of “Boulevard” “Jacobs delivers a seductive tour of an L.A. rife with murder-for-hire plots political corruption and sociopathic schemes. … I couldn’t put it down!”

In his own words Jacobs’ introduction to his latest work describes his main characters among them Jerry Schneiderman a man he met as a news reporter and once wrote another book about in 2012 titled “The Ascension of Jerry: Murder Hitmen and the Making of L.A. Muckraker Jerry Schneiderman.”

Of his latest work Jacobs writes that “in 1979 the City of Angels had its fair share of devils. Howard Garrett was one of them. His contractor’s license bought him an entrée into Space Matters a real estate development company run out of a hip mansion on the edge of LA’s Miracle Mile district.

“The company’s owners debonair slick-talking Richard Kasparov and self-conscious nerdy Jerry Schneiderman were L.A.’s Young Turks of interior architecture. When Richard interviewed the quiet buzzard-faced Howard he figured he’d found the perfect supervisor to oversee construction for a firm hungry to expand. What neither he nor his partner Jerry

knew was that by hiring Howard they’d unloosed a monster into their midst.”

As a bonus Jacobs has included with the book a short true-crime yarn called “Paul & Chuck” about crusading L.A. attorney Paul Morantz who in the late 1970s battled Synanon one of America’s most dangerous and violent cults.

Other books by Jacobs include “Smogtown: The Lung-burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles” with William J. Kelly 2008; “Strange As It Seems: The Impossible Life of Gordon Zahler” 2008; and “The People’s Republic of Chemicals” with William J. Kelly 2014.

“The Darkest Glare” published by Rare Bird Books goes on sale March 9. — Kevin Uhrich

In a recent interview with Jessica Fitzpatrick Jacobs an award-winning investigative journalist who had written for L.A.’s top daily newspapers The New York Times as well as the L.A. Weekly and the Pasadena Weekly talks about his latest book his L.A. Times bestseller “Arroyo” and what lies ahead.

Q: How did you come across the history of protagonist Jerry Schneiderman?

A: I first met Jerry in the mid-1990s when he was flowering into a civic activist targeting chaotic subway construction and Hollywood’s self-dealing politics. Back then I was an investigative journalist at the Los Angeles Daily News and Jerry was unlike any gadflies I’d ever encountered. He wasn’t scruffy or manic or holed up in a rickety apartment like your typical pot-stirrer. He was a suit-wearing real estate developer with property holdings a used Rolls Royce and a mischievous sense of humor. While he tipped me off to probably a half-dozen stories that led to front-page exposes he kept totally silent about his terrifying past until three years into our reporter-source relationship. Then one day completely un-prompted he asked

‘Did you know I had a double-murderer chasing me?’ Initially I figured he was trying to impress me with some cloak-and-dagger tale hard to verify. Boy was I wrong. The plot into which he was sucked was much bigger – and scarier – than he even realized. After piecing it together I saw the outlines of an entertaining if frightening drama. In it we have the collision of a leathery-faced predator who knew how to get away with murder; a Beverly Hills-area slick talker able to lie his way out of almost any mess; and a young frizzy-haired protagonist who let his ambition outpace his caution by partnering with these two until it put his life in jeopardy as well as his family. It was a morality tale wrapped up in a plot that seemed like it could only happen in a freeway-strewn glamour-fueled place like Los Angeles. …

The book features several characters including Howard Garrett and his associates — Jerry Schneiderman and Richard Kasparov. Can you tell us a little about each character and how they got involved with each other?

Sure. Jerry and Richard were running an upstart Los Angeles space-planning firm near hip Miracle Mile when Richard sweet-talked Jerry into expanding into suite construction and luxury home remodeling. Think shortcut-to-riches scheme. Jerry the youngest person at his own company was dorky but had this genius for interior architecture that put a premium on efficiency. Richard who Jerry recruited as a partner was this dashing charismatic space-planner who could sell ice to the Eskimos. To make their new enterprise work they needed a construction veteran who knew his way around blueprints and sawdust-filled worksites. Howard who was older than both of his college-educated associates fit the ticket even if his buzzard-y face and quiet demeanor set him apart from the white-collars at the company. At Richard’s urging he soon agreed to put up his California contractor’s license so their jobs would be legit. They really should’ve conducted a background check on him. They wouldn’t like what they found.

The book is in Southern California in the late 1970s at a time when the L.A. murder rate was the highest in recorded history and amidst the rise of violent cults. Tell us about the research you conducted on the time period.

My first dab of research was actually my own memory: of being a teenage driver terrorized by a road-raging motorist on a misty day in 1979. It’s in the prologue of the book both as an era table-setter and because the incident seared into me. When I burrowed into the Jerry-Richard-Howard murder triangle America’s cantankerous period pre-resonated. Next I channeled the old journalist in me. I contacted every single person involved in the case by networking and scouring courthouse and other records. Nearly everyone spoke to me. Those who refused I found were either too damaged by what happened had something to hide or were too peripheral to recall much. From there I read up in newspapers and magazines and books about late-seventies America. I also re-watched the classic movie “Network” that typified this stretch of disillusionment that America had gone off the tracks; that the ‘system’ had betrayed blue collars who built this land. Sound familiar?

Born in Pasadena you are a native to the L.A. area. How did your local roots inform the story and your research?

I adore this question. As a recovering metro reporter I was always fascinated by the sociology of local freeways – their public health implications the democratic nature of them the mathematics of traffic. ‘The Darkest Glare’ gave me another prism by which to study them: their conduciveness to killers who travel across county lines to destroy and how they set up Southern Californians from wildly different backgrounds to collide and clash. In this story Richard hailed from affluent privileged West Los Angeles. Jerry came from nondescript unglamorous North Hollywood most outsiders couldn’t pick out on a map. Howard though he lived in Pasadena and neighboring Arcadia during the time I spotlight associated with criminal elements from the rough-and-tumble eastern areas specifically Ontario. When these three personalities joined together at the company known as Space Matters it was like distinct breeds trying to coexist. It didn’t exactly work out because none of them had any shared experiences — or common morality.

This is not your first foray into investigative stories. How did ‘The Darkest Glare’ differ from your earlier books such as ‘Strange As It Seems” and the L.A. Times bestseller ‘Arroyo’?

‘The Darkest Glare’ required by far the most journalistic techniques to capture. Constant interviews. Hunting for documents. Sitting back to see how the puzzle pieces fit together. By the end I thought I had a bird’s eye perspective up there with some of the grizzled LAPD detectives and prosecutors. The story that morphed into my first book ‘Strange As It Seems’ was a personal journey rediscovering that the deceased uncle I once hated was this miraculous figure who survived a catastrophic injury to live hard play harder and make a big name for himself in Hollywood and beyond. While unearthing his life which I left daily journalism to write took plenty of old-fashioned digging and interviewing the narrative emerged straight from my heart. It was a book that also connected me to the incredible number of showbiz and literary figures on my mother’s side of the family. Not only did I take such pride in that it freed my own imaginative side filling me with confidence that I could pen a novel even though I’d never typed a single word of fiction before. Drawing on that and other experiences I used what I learned about Progressive Age Pasadena and its daring Colorado Street Bridge invented characters and a universe for them and let it rip in ‘Arroyo.’ I never expected it’d be the success it was. Doing a historical novel dashed with humor and magical realism wasn’t exactly a sure bet. Still I sincerely believe it’s what the stars wanted me to be doing for my own arc.

‘The Darkest Glare’ includes a bonus original true crime short story called ‘Paul & Chuck.’ Can you tell us about the protagonist LA attorney Paul Morantz and his case against the violent cult Synanon?

Definitely. Los Angeles — make that the world — owes Paul Morantz a monster debt of gratitude. In the late seventies he could’ve continued practicing law while freelancing magazine features that continued attracting Hollywood interest. But Paul had this strain in him going way back that detested injustice be it a corrupt judge or a human trafficking ring. He never planned a career battling dangerous cults. As I learned destiny continually brought them into contact with him. His crusading against Synanon which had started off as cold-turkey drug rehab before warping into a violent alternative society began when a desperate husband asked him to free his wife from its clutches. In a pre-Twitter flash everyone discovered what the cult did to pay him back notably grooming reptiles into murderers to silence him. Paul’s world would never be the same as he later contested brainwashing groups up and down the West Coast learning that heroism can be a lonely profession.

Grifters are incredibly popular in the media now. ‘The Darkest Glare’ features real-estate grifter Richard Kasparov. His grifts notoriously fail. How does he compare to infamous grifters such as Anna Delvey and Elizabeth Holmes?

Every con of course has its own peculiarities but Richard shared one attribute with the folks you mentioned above: he was not always the person he presented to the world. Now he never woke up one day deciding he’d become a con man who stole from his own partners or commit other shady acts. He did it I believe because of two factors: he was bipolar subject to dizzying highs and lows that impaired his judgment; and because of unrelenting self-loathing that he failed to live up to the great expectations heaped on him because he was talented devilishly handsome and from West L.A. where so many are rich and famous. The proverb about lies begetting lies caught up with them when he hoodwinked someone who wouldn’t let it pass. I sympathize with him even if he had plenty of time to learn to fly straight and make amends. Sometimes though there’s just this grave momentum to tragic events that’s impossible to reverse.

What’s next for you?

A bunch. I’m gearing up to write my second novel which like ‘Arroyo’ will be Pasadena-centric just without the heavyweight of history or so much tongue-in-cheek. It’ll based on a true story of a brilliant dying friend who came to me to help him compose an apology letter to a fellow classmate who ended up with a bullet through his living room window. I’m also at work on a non-fiction book about the history of America’s longest freeway-construction battle. It’s an incredible tale that you can either spin as David vs. the California Freeway Industrial Complex or a small town’s tyranny of the minority when it comes to resisting a superhighway threatening to carve it in two. As well as those I’m working to develop two of my earlier books into entertainment projects and letting my brain ferment new ideas.

(Image courtesy of Jacobs Engineering Group and the City of Oak Ridge)

Construction of the new water plant at the city’s water intake on the Clinch River could start in May and be complete in December 2022 according to a proposed schedule presented to Oak Ridge City Council.

The Council on Monday will consider a construction administration contract for the new water plant which would be south of Bethel Valley Road. It would be able to treat 16 million gallons of water per day.

If approved Monday the professional engineering services agreement would be with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. of Knoxville. The contract would be valued at up to about $1.88 million. It would be for construction administration and observation of the construction of the new water treatment plant and a main transmission line.

Approval of the agreement with Jacobs Engineering on Monday could be contingent upon the city’s ability to use Drinking Water State Revolving Funding which is pending approval according to the resolution to be considered by Council.

More than four years ago Council adopted an evaluation report from Jacobs that recommended a new water plant as a cost-effective alternative to upgrading the existing plant which is on Pine Ridge above the Y-12 National Security Complex.

Council later approved a contract with Jacobs for the design of the new plant.

The water plant could reportedly cost more than $40 million. According to Jacobs the new plant would improve water treatment use a new membrane filtration system provide a new water transmission line to replace aging infrastructure and upgrade the existing raw water pump station screens and pumps at the Clinch River. The new plant would provide capacity for future growth Jacobs said.

A proposed schedule included in the Council agenda packet said awards for the water treatment plant and transmission line could be made in April and construction of the plant could start in May and be complete by December 2022. Construction of the transmission line could start in June and be complete by June 2022 Jacobs said.

The water plant provides water to both the City of Oak Ridge and to U.S. Department of Energy sites including Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex.

The current water plant is on a ridge top above the main entrance to Y-12 on Bear Creek Road. But there have been concerns about slope instability near the ridge top water plant and thatâ€™s one reason that city officials have wanted to replace the 70-year-old facility. There was a landslide near the access road to the current water plant above Y-12 in February 2019.

Hailing from a family of female engineers I have always loved science and more specifically have always dreamt of being an engineer. However I noticed that most girls aren't encouraged to dream big and the male engineer stereotype prevails. Clearly this is an issue that needs to be investigated and addressed.Â

My Research

Despite the significant progress that has been made in bridging the gap between men and women in the workplace women are overlooked in the field of engineering. According to the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) globally only 13 per cent of engineers are women and more disquieting female engineers are generally paid 10 per cent less than men (SWE Research Update: Women in Engineering by the Numbers (Nov. 2019) - All Together 2021).

What does this say about us supposedly living in a progressive society? Are we truly being inclusive?

It is evident however that each country needs to step up. According to the graph above NO country is achieving gender equality with a 50-50 participation of both genders. This is where one begins to ponder upon the possibility of the empowerment of women being just a faÃ§ade.

My Initiative

I thus decided to do my part and in September 2020 I successfully organised a global ""Women in Engineering (WiE)"" webinar themed 'inclusivity' featuring 4 renowned female engineers as guest speakers - Dr Theresa Ann Saxton-Fox an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Mariane Kurban a Regional Solutions and Technology director at Jacobs for Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Sally Barakeh a mechanical engineer at Jacobs and Sakhi Satkar a design engineer at Lera Structural Consultants Mumbai.

They shared their stories ranging from how they had been denied opportunities solely based on their gender to how global experiences helped them gain perspective and further respect for women in engineering from around the world. With 62 attendees this webinar not only provided the audience with valuable insight into the technical knowledge required to pursue engineering but it also taught them the soft skills that would help them excel in this field.

Some notable guidance from the guest speakers at the WiE webinar:

""Don't be afraid to ask for opportunities. Don't be afraid to say yes to things that may scare you. If you love something and you want to do it whether you're a girl or not - don't let anyone's comments discourage you from doing that.""

""Know when to ask for help. Asking for help doesn't take away anything from your capabilities or your credentials.""

So let's start small?

In UAE

Statistically 87 per cent of the professional cluster of engineering is dominated by men with only 13 per cent of women working in this sector in UAE. The consistent effort of the citizens of the UAE in making the voice of female engineers heard has initiated a paradigm shift.

The impact of small-scale initiatives is often underestimated. With almost half of the higher education students in UAE being women we're actually almost halfway there! (Inspiring and guiding the UAE's young women into science and engineering - Khalifa University 2021)

Almost a year ago the Global Women's Forum Dubai (GWFD) was conducted with other 3000 attendees themed 'The Power of Influence' (Home - Global Women's Forum Dubai 2020 2021). Additionally the world's largest professional organisation aimed at improving technology and reaching out to audiences globally the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has taken great strides in recognising the achievements leadership and development of programs of females in engineering programs in the UAE Section!

Each year the IEEE UAE's Women in Engineering Committee (WIEC) selects two of its outstanding members to receive the much-coveted 'Chair's Recognition Award' and/or the 'Volunteer Recognition Award'. Currently the IEEE UAE Section is working towards 'building the technological infrastructure to develop techno-electrical industry and to improve the lifestyles of individuals' (as stated by Dr Fatma Taher IEEE UAE section chair) (IEEE Women in Engineering - IEEE UAE Section 2021).

For the years 2015 to 2021 the National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women in the UAE launched by Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak chairwoman of the General Women's Union is targeted at ensuring gender equality across all fields in UAE from local start-ups to multinational companies is gaining traction further empowering aspiring female scientists and engineers! (National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women - The Official Portal of the UAE Government 2021)

It is indeed heartening to see that as of 2020 56 per cent of the UAE government graduates in the fields of science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) are women (UAE and UAE 2021).

The Dream

Nonetheless we have a long way to go! Let us all female engineers be sources of inspiration to each other and reach for the moon (literally)!

Before becoming an architect at age 37 Johnson ran the architecture department at MoMA and the spare luminous building which he inhabited for over half a century embodies the Modernist International Style that he helped define in a landmark exhibition at the museum in 1932. The home also established Johnson himself as the paragon of a specific type of New York architect: erudite absolutist in his refinement and formidable in his influence wielding shaping careers institutions and public opinion like few others in his field.

But since the National Trust of Historic Preservation opened the Glass House to the public as a museum in 2007 visitors have discovered there’s more to the place than its namesake centerpiece. By the time Johnson died in 2005 the five acres he’d bought in 1946 had grown tenfold to encompass 14 structures including experimental follies a subterranean painting gallery and three wooden homes from earlier periods including a shingled 18th-century dwelling that Johnson and his partner the curator David Whitney would use as a refuge in hot weather. For the past 15 years however a pivotal part of the estate has remained semi-concealed: Johnson’s guesthouse known as the Brick House and situated just 80 feet from the site’s main attraction has been closed to the public because of water damage. Now after an extensive restoration and in time for the Glass House’s 75th anniversary the building has finally been unveiled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VrLWVsZWN0aW9uLWJvcmlzLWpvaG5zb24tcGhvdG8taWQtMDM4YmY3YmY3MmM3NDkwMTM3ZWM5MjFhNTI0MmEyZWbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson turned away from polling station after forgetting photo ID,"LONDON (AP) — Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from a polling station after forgetting to bring ID to vote in the U.K.'s local elections.

British media reported Friday that Johnson — who introduced the requirement for voters to provide ID with a photo when he was in office — was told by polling station staff in South Oxfordshire Thursday that he would not be able to vote without proving his identity.

Sky News reported that Johnson who served as Conservative prime minister from 2019 to 2022 was later able to cast his ballot and that he voted Conservative.

Johnson introduced the Elections Act requiring photo ID in 2022 and the new law was first implemented last year in local elections. But Thursday was the first time large numbers of voters across England and Wales have had to present ID such as a passport or driving license to vote.

The Electoral Commission said the vast majority of people were able to meet the new requirements although it noted that some people who would have wanted to vote may have decided not to try because they did not have acceptable ID.

It also said there was evidence that some people such as disabled people and the unemployed found it harder to show voter ID.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9ucHVibGljbWVkaWEub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvZWxlY3Rpb24tMjAyNC8yMDI0LzA1LzA1LzQ4NjYyOC9tb2xseS1jb29rLWRlZmVhdHMtc3RhdGUtcmVwLWphcnZpcy1qb2huc29uLWluLXNwZWNpYWwtZWxlY3Rpb24tZm9yLXNlbmF0ZS1kaXN0cmljdC0xNS_SAbcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG91c3RvbnB1YmxpY21lZGlhLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2VsZWN0aW9uLTIwMjQvMjAyNC8wNS8wNS80ODY2MjgvbW9sbHktY29vay1kZWZlYXRzLXN0YXRlLXJlcC1qYXJ2aXMtam9obnNvbi1pbi1zcGVjaWFsLWVsZWN0aW9uLWZvci1zZW5hdGUtZGlzdHJpY3QtMTUvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Molly Cook defeats State Rep. Jarvis Johnson in special election for Senate District 15,"Cook’s 14-point victory sets her up as the heavy favorite to win both the Democratic primary runoff on May 28 and the general election to fill SD 15 in the next legislative session.

Lucio Vasquez / Houston Public Media

Voters in Senate District 15 have elected ER nurse and political activist Molly Cook to fill the unexpired term of Houston Mayor John Whitmire. Cook's margin of victory indicates her strength heading into the Democratic primary runoff later this month.

Molly Cook jumped out to a sizable lead over State Representative Jarvis Johnson when Harris County released the early voting numbers in the special election Saturday evening. By the time the unofficial final results came out early Sunday morning Cook led by more than 2000 votes out of about 16000 cast — more than 14 percentage points.

During the campaign Cook emphasized her experience as a medical professional and focused on issues such as energy affordability abortion rights gun safety protecting public education and LGBTQ+ rights. Her victory in the special election makes her the first openly LGBTQ+ state senator in Texas.

Molly Cook previously challenged John Whitmire for the Democratic nomination for Senate District 15 in 2022. She lost that race by 58.4% to 41.6% but gained name recognition.

Cook will face Jarvis Johnson one more time in the Democratic primary runoff May 28 to determine who will represent the party against Republican candidate Joseph L. Trahan in the general election. The winner of the November contest will represent SD 15 in next year's legislative session. The last time a Republican won SD 15 was more than 50 years ago making the winner of the Democratic primary runoff the heavy favorite in the general election.

Cook’s victory in the special election will count towards her seniority in the Senate if she wins the primary runoff and general elections. In the meanwhile it means SD 15 will have representation in the Senate if Governor Greg Abbott summons the Legislature back for a special session this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcGhhcm1hLWdpYW50LWFkZHMtaXNyYWVsLWxpc3QtbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QtbWFya2V0cy1vbWlzc2lvbi1yYWlzZXMtcXVlc3Rpb25z0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9waGFybWEtZ2lhbnQtYWRkcy1pc3JhZWwtbGlzdC1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1tYXJrZXRzLW9taXNzaW9uLXJhaXNlcy1xdWVzdGlvbnMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pharma giant adds Israel to list of Middle East markets after omission raises questions,"Johnson & Johnson has added Israel to its directory of global markets on the company's order management website after sparking questions over why the list included ""Palestine"" and not the Jewish state.

Johnson & Johnson’s ""Middle East"" section lists ""Palestine"" among 20 markets including Iran Iraq Jordan and Lebanon. When Fox News Digital checked the site on Sunday morning there was no option for Israel.

When asked about why Israel was omitted from the site a company spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the tool isn't used for all markets and those customers in markets not listed including Israel use a different method to order products from Johnson & Johnson.

""If a market is not listed on the site it simply means that a different method of ordering is used in that market.""

After Fox News Digital's inquiry and receiving questions from elsewhere about the exclusion of Israel the spokesperson said Israel has been added to the site to clarify how customers in this market order products from Johnson & Johnson.

The actor and former wrestling pro 52 ran into a young fan during a trip to Target and instead of snapping a pic or signing an autograph the pair — ever-so-punnily — played a game of rock paper scissors together.

In a video of the exchange which Johnson shared in an Instagram post on May 4 the two had an intense rivalry in the towel aisle after the kid challenged him to a match.

After Johnson won one round by — fittingly — playing “rock” his opponent took the loss like a champ and the star offered up a rematch.

“Aw come on you know I’m going for the rock all the time. Want to go again?” he asked and the young fan obliged.

Then the duo ended up with four draws in a row before once again Johnson won using “rock” — but their rivalry still wasn’t over.

Elsewhere in the store their face-off continued starting with two draws before — finally! — the actor’s young fan took home a sweet victory beating Johnson by playing “scissors.”

Victorious the child threw his hands up in the air and the video ended with a GTA-inspired freeze frame and text that read: “Mission passed! Respect +”

In the caption Johnson shouted out his opponent for his persistence — and hinted that yet another rematch may be in their future.

""Gotta respect this kid’s tenacity — he ain’t taking an L in public from The Final Boss” the actor wrote adding “You know I wasn’t leaving this store without making sure this kid gets his ‘I beat the Rock at Rock Paper Scissors’ story.' ""

“Good job kid” he added. “Payback is coming!!”

The star is a proud girl dad to three daughters: Simone 22 whom he shares with ex-wife Dany Garcia and Jasmine 8 and Tiana 6 whom he shares with wife Lauren Hashian.

Speaking with PEOPLE about fatherhood in 2023 Johnson said ""I've reached a point in my life where I can create my own schedule which has really been nice because it wasn't always that way and I'm really lucky.”

“It allows me to get closer to the girls” he added.

The iPhone 12 mini features a 5.4-inch OLED display and is the company’s most inexpensive new smartphone. The low price didn’t help though and the iPhone 12 mini is currently the worst-selling model accounting for about 6% of sales.

The renowned investment firm JPMorgan Chase recently released its latest forecast in which analyst William Young cut its iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini production forecasts by 9 and 11 million respectively. At the same time he also confirmed that market demand for the iPhone 12 mini is weak and global sales are too low. The analysts citing their supply chain sources added that Apple will cease production of this phone in the second quarter of 2021.

Thus the iPhone 12 mini may become the most short-lived flagship model in iPhone history. At the same time it is expected that in the new line of smartphones there will again appear a small model which Apple can optimize and make more attractive (iPhone 12 mini battery life is very bad).

The analyst also raised the iPhone 12 Pro Max sales forecast by 11 million units.

Apple finally defeated Samsung in the global smartphone market

Apple overtook Samsung to become the world’s leading smartphone brand amid record sales of iPhone smartphones. The company showed a huge jump in the last quarter of last year while Huawei‘s position weakened greatly.

According to Counterpoint Research shipments of iPhone smartphones increased 22% in the previous quarter. The surge is driven by the release of the iPhone 12 lineup which supports fifth-generation networks. Also sales of previous models did not fall the demand for which is stable after the price decline.

The company has shipped 90 million smartphones and has more than 23% market share. Analysts note that Apple has strengthened its position in the premium segment of smartphones in China. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook two of the top three selling premium smartphones in China are from Apple.

The second place in the quarter belongs to Samsung which received about 19% of the market. The third place went to Xiaomi followed by Oppo and Vivo which took the fourth and fifth places respectively. Huawei dropped to 6th place.

If we consider the results for the year then Samsung is in the lead Apple is second Huawei is third followed by Xiaomi Oppo Vivo and Realme. The latter was the fastest growing brand in the past year.

Top 10 Most Fined Companies

Bank of America (US) – $82737699939 over 214 fines.

UBS (Switzerland) – $16792800910 over 83 fines

Taking the spot for the company which has been fined the most since 2000 was the Bank of America who have had to pay an incredible $82.7 billion across 214 individual fines over the years many of which have come about as a result of the 2008 financial crisis and relate to things such as mortgages and financial disclosures.

The biggest single fine that they’ve faced added up to $16.65 billion as part of a settlement to the Department of Justice over the sale of risky mortgage-backed securities prior to the recession the largest settlement between a single company and the federal government of all time.

Top 5 Most Fined Industries

Financial Services – $330904834105 over 6093 fines

Pharmaceuticals -$50318398621 over 890 fines

Oil & Gas – $45544460694 over 5961 fines

Motor Vehicles – $31099611959 over 744 fines

Utilities & Power Generation – $22447575068 over 1911 fines

Businesses in the financial sector were by far the most likely to find themselves in trouble paying a total of over $330 billion over the last 20 years which is more than all over industries combined. The likes of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are amongst the biggest fines in this sector as well as other major banks and financial institutions such as Citigroup Wells Fargo Deutsche Bank UBS and Goldman Sachs.

Mortgage Abuses – $56676183058 over 158 fines

False Claims Act and Related – $47097771445 over 2925 fines

‘Toxic assets’ is a term that was coined during the financial crash and refers to investments that are difficult or impossible to sell due to a collapse in demand for them. Vast amounts of these toxic assets were sold in the build-up to the crisis with some of the biggest culprits being the Bank of America JPMorgan Chase and the Royal Bank of Scotland.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy9hbnotcHJvYmVkLWJ5LXRhaXdhbi1mb3ItY3VycmVuY3ktbWFuaXB1bGF0aW9uLTIwMjEwMjA3LXA1NzBhcdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ANZ probed by Taiwan for currency manipulation,"ANZ Banking Group is among a number of international banks subject to an investigation by Taiwan’s central bank into possible speculation on the country’s surging currency last year.

So far sources indicate that the new lineup could be called the iPhone 12s or iPhone 13.

The analyst citing his Apple supply chain informants says that all new models will retain the same screen sizes as the iPhone 12 line but Apple will reduce the notch and slightly increase the body thickness.

The increased thickness of the case indirectly indicates that Apple will finally increase the battery capacity of its smartphones. iPhone 12 users complain the most about the short battery life of smartphones especially with the fifth-generation mobile networks. Apple seems to have heeded the criticism.

William Young noted that the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max models will feature OLED displays with a 120Hz refresh rate. He also added that the iPhone 13 / 12s will outpace the iPhone 12 in first-quarter shipments. The maximum target is set at 90 million smartphones.

The same analyst said Apple will stop manufacturing the iPhone 12 mini in the second quarter of 2021 while the company will make tangible changes to the iPhone 13 mini to make it more attractive and marketable.

Feb. 7 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- U.S. Kimberly-Clark brand Huggies® unveiled its new look feel and mission in their first-ever 30-second big game spot that welcomed gameday babies to the world like never before.

The new commercial demonstrates what it's like for babies being brand new to life assuring them Huggies the beloved diapers and wipes brand is there to help navigate the unknowns of babyhood. The commercial signals Huggies' refreshing take on the diapers and wipes category and its unique supportive role in helping babies and parents through uncharted territory.

You’re finally here baby! Welcome to the world. It’s pretty weird but stick with us kid. We’ll help you figure it out. #WeGotYouBaby

""We're excited to spotlight our celebrity arrivals new babies born today and every day"" said Rebecca Dunphey President of Personal Care at Kimberly-Clark North America. ""Not only were we first time advertisers but we're also proud to be the first brand to feature gameday newborns in our spot! It was an incredible journey with our agency partners and we're thrilled to have been able to have this opportunity.""

While much of the commercial was pre-produced the spot featured eight babies who were born on February 7 2021 the same day the ad was featured in the broadcast. Understanding the logistical mastery needed to obtain day-of user-generated-content Huggies started outreach in late 2020 to its network of hospital partners worldwide eventually signing on dozens of partners before game day. Together Huggies and these long-time hospital partners engaged expecting parents and had them submit user-generated pictures and video clips of their newborns to be featured in the big game commercial later that day. All the footage of the gameday newborns was submitted virtually without the brand ever having to enter a hospital.

Of the eight newborns featured in the commercial baby Destinee Freyja and Adam were all born in Tampa Florida the city where the big game took place. The other five babies who made their debut in the ad include baby Acre of Green Bay WI Donyelle of Chicago IL Valentino of Long Beach CA and Khloe of Cape Coral FL. Additionally baby Emmett of Fort Meyers FL was also in the spot and his mother was coincidentally born on gameday in 1986!

About the ""We Got You Baby"" Creative Platform:

Huggies re-imagined its global identity refreshed its logo and created a more confident reassuring and playful visual world through their new creative platform ""We Got You Baby."" This new platform speaks directly to babies while celebrating everything parenting and babyhood may bring.

""We found that against a sea of noise families need a supportive ally throughout every step of babyhood"" said Dunphey. ""With decades of experience and innovation Huggies is just that offering parents the confidence they crave and babies the products they need to stay healthy comfortable and protected.""

To continue celebrating newborn babies Huggies is giving away 25000 ""Welcome to the World"" newborn starter kits to help new parents on their amazing journey. The kits will include Huggies® diapers wipes a branded tote bag key milestone cards and a Huggies®-branded bodysuit by Carter's for baby.

Instead there will be at least 15 first-time advertisers stepping in to fill the void.

While every Super Bowl commercial slate features a handful of new brands this year's group is notably large – and particularly eclectic. There's a startup that makes men's soaps and personal care products. A Swedish banking company. And at least two food delivery services.

The going rate for a 30-second spot during CBS' broadcast this year was $5.5 million.

Here's a look at just seven of the brands that will step onto the Super Bowl stage for the first time Sunday courtesy of USA TODAY's Ad Meter which ranks Super Bowl commercials based on consumer rating.

Dexcom

Rarely do we see a niche health technology company step onto the Super Bowl stage. But Dexcom which makes continuous glucose monitoring systems is taking that step this year with a 30-second spot that will air after the first quarter. The ad is narrated by musician Nick Jonas who has Type 1 diabetes.

Dr. Squatch

After years of building brand awareness with viral YouTube videos Dr. Squatch decided to take its campaign to the big game this year a significant step for a company that sells men's soap and other personal care products. The move comes on the heels of a strong 2020 in which Dr. Squatch says it reached roughly $100 million in sales.

Klarna

Actress and comedian Maya Rudolph stars in this 30-second spot for Klarna a Swedish banking company that among other things allows consumers to ""buy now and pay later."" Four miniature versions of Rudolph ride into a Western town to show how Klarna allows consumers to pay for an item in four separate installments. Chief marketing officer David Sandstrom called the ad an ""exciting milestone"" for the company.

Robinhood

It's been quite the month for Robinhood the stock-trading platform that many amateur investors used to purchase shares in Gamestop and manipulate the market. The company later drew criticism (and lawsuits) for temporarily blocking its users from buying Gamestop shares. Robinhood's 30-second Super Bowl ad is titled ""We Are All Investors.""

ScottsMiracle-Gro

The lawn and gardening company is making its first foray into the Super Bowl with a celebrity-heavy spot featuring Martha Stewart John Travolta and more. The 45-second ad which will run in the second quarter is part of a broader campaign from ScottsMiracle-Gro in the leadup to spring and encourages viewers to ""keep growing.""

Uber Eats

Mike Myers and Dana Carvey reprise their ""Wayne's World"" roles in a 60-second spot for Uber Eats which also features rapper Cardi B. The food delivery service has enjoyed a surge in business during the COVID-19 pandemic as many Americans have eschewed dining out at restaurants. DoorDash a similar company is also making its Super Bowl advertising debut with a 60-second ad of its own during the first quarter.

Vroom

While car brands like Hyundai and Kia decided to bow out of this year's commercial lineup Vroom – which allows people to buy or sell used vehicles online – decided to hop in. The company said its 30-second spot will be the first national ad for a used car company to air during the Super Bowl since 2014. It also comes roughly eight months after Vroom went public.

And yes his trademark monocle top hat and cane are back as well.

Planters Peanuts founded in 1906 in Wilkes-Barre has revived its iconic mascot which was killed off around this time last year and replaced by “Baby Nut.”

The company recently revealed Mr. Peanut’s return in a “How it started. How it’s going.” meme that is currently popular online showing a photo of Baby Nut in February 2020 next to a picture of the resurrected Mr. Peanut today.

Local businessman Thom Greco an avid Planters Peanut memorabilia collector who is trying to bring a museum to Mr. Peanut’s birthplace said he always believed Mr. Peanut would be back and was happy to hear the news.

“We thought that was going to happen” Greco said. “In our opinion Baby Nut was brought along to give attention to Planters Peanuts to a younger generation.”

Greco said he recently purchased a significant amount of Planters memorabilia — including an antique peanut roaster with Mr. Peanut sitting on top — during an auction in Alabama following the death of one of the best known Peanut Pals a group dedicated to Planters memorabilia.

He hopes to one day showcase the items in a visitor center and museum in Wilkes-Barre which remained Planters’ home in a South Main Street building until 1961.

“The more the city embraces Planters Peanuts the better” Greco said.

In a commercial before last year’s Super Bowl Planters killed off its beloved mascot in a fiery crash of his NUTmobile.

The tragic death of one of the world’s most recognizable brand characters was designed to build anticipation for Planters’ $5.6 million Super Bowl ad of Mr. Peanut’s funeral — attended by a host of other notable company mascots such as Mr. Kool Aid and Mr. Clean. At the funeral a tear from Mr. Kool Aid dropped on Mr. Peanut’s grave. Baby Nut soon sprouted up.

Instead of spending that kind of money again on a Super Bowl ad Planters this year is donating $5 million to reward people who have gone “A Nut Above.”

“This year instead of spending $5 million dropping me off a cliff again — please don’t — I’m spending it on the people who helped make the world a little less nutty” Planters wrote on Mr. Peanut’s Twitter feed.

The return of Mr. Peanut is the mascot’s fourth transformation in a year. Within seven months of the Super Bowl Baby Nut became Peanut Junior — a 21-year-old adult nut minus Mr. Peanut’s famous top hat monocle and cane. In December the nut transformed again into a 50-year-old named Bartholomew Richard Fitzgerald-Smythe or Bart for short.

Through it all the mascot retained the @MrPeanut handle on Twitter.

Last week Planters hinted at a return to the traditional Mr. Peanut by tweeting “Found my monocle. See you soon.” It was accompanied by a video that said “He’s back with a bang.”

On Wednesday the new and improved Mr. Peanut was revealed.

The return of the original Mr. Peanut comes at a time when Planters’ parent company Kraft Heinz is in talks to sell Planters to Hormel Foods Group for $3 billion.",,,,,,,,,

Instead the focus is to transform the property complete with a garden and space for additional entrepreneurs who would preferably be from the south side of the city.

“We want to redefine an area that has seen disinvestment and turn that around into an area that is seeing reinvestment” Dillin said noting that it is important to create an environment that will not only attract grocers but keep them from leaving.

“It wasn’t that Kroger left. It was that Kroger was the last grocery store to leave that area” he added.

The grocery chain closed its location on S. Limestone St. in March. That led to the south side of Springfield being labeled a food desert with the closest grocery store roughly four miles away.

Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck said in September that after the store closed the city received internal documents from Kroger showing the store “was losing money.”

“A lot of it was around products that have a shelf life” Heck said during a Facebook live discussion at the time.

“Unfortunately they were losing a lot of products that weren’t getting turned over quickly enough” he added.

In a statement released in February right after Kroger announced the store would be closing the company said the location was being closed as part of the company’s Restock Kroger plan.

“As part of the Restock Kroger plan the company will utilize more of its capital to fund technology and infrastructure upgrades to provide its customers with a seamless shopping experience by accelerating digital growth in the region” the statement said.

However a concern of profitability can make finding a replacement difficult. Dillin said that is why it is important that the project ties in with larger plans of redevelopment in the area.

That includes putting together a business plan that would make the space more attractive to potential investors.

Just advertising the location alone will not be attractive Dillin said. But marketing it as something that would be part of a larger concept would create more interest.

That includes marketing the location that would not just be a grocer but one that would also feature local entrepreneurs specifically eateries. The idea would have those entrepreneurs fill up remaining space that would not be filled by a grocer.

Having a grocer in that location still remains one of the top priorities. Several community discussions between residents and representatives of Dillin LLC identified that as an important issue for the community.

Dillin added that means also being more targeted when reaching out to potential grocers noting that the space would not be attractive to the larger more corporate stores.

“We have been more focused on community grocers. That would include those that may have multiple locations in the grocery business” Dillin said.

“It is very difficult in today’s world for an entrepreneurial person to start up a local grocery. Food distribution tends to go towards larger companies” he added.

The city has been in talks and working with Dillin LLC since last year and both entered into a letter of intent over the summer.

Heck said during a Springfield City Commission meeting last week that the redevelopment agreement which was approved during the same meeting serves as “that important next step to continue to work towards the revitalization” of the former Kroger property and the corridor it is located on.

The agreement outlines what is expected from the city as well as what is expected from Dillin LLC. It is also broken into two phases with the first one expected to be completed by March.

The first phase includes predevelopment work as well as hosting community conversations looking at financing opportunities and developing a plan to market the project.

City officials say the agreement is important because the overall project is addressing food access issues in that part of the city.

Dillin said that his company has already completed most of the work that is included under the first phase. The second phase would include obtaining financing and moving forward with renovation work.

There is also a clause in the agreement that highlights steps that would need to be taken if either party decides to back out. In that case the property would go back into the control of the city.

The city expects Dillin and his team to identify and lease the property to a qualified grocer by July 31. The former Kroger location is in the possession of the local land bank. That property is expected to be turned over to Dillin LLC by March.

Dillin is a longtime property developer. He took over the development of the Austin Landing Project in Miamisburg in 2016 until it’s sale in late 2019. He was also behind the Levis Commons development in the Toledo region.

In 2019 Dillin had plans for a proposed $130 million redevelopment at Ohio 48 between Sheehan and Spring Valley roads in Centerville which included a vacant Kroger building and lot according to the previous reporting.

Dillin had been working with investors and proposed redeveloping Centerville Place into a mix of office retail and restaurant space as well as about 350 housing units.

However the proposal was abruptly withdrawn. At that time Dillin said in a statement that investors had the need “to focus on other parts of their business which prevented their comfort in an investment of this magnitude.”

“We thought that we had investors secured in the Centerville property and it turned out that we didn’t” Dillin recently told the News-Sun.

He said this project will be different as his company will be in control of securing investors for the project which he said was not the case for the Centerville project.

Dillin said moving forward the focus would be to secure private investors as well a tap into public sources of funding depending on which direction the project goes.

He added that his company has had a dialogue with over a dozen grocers with a few expressing interest at this point.

While Ryan pointed her in the right direction the woman mentioned that she had been feeling sick. After Ryan helped her and her son pay for their groceries the woman suddenly collapsed.

Ryan quickly dialed 911 and a team of EMTs arrived to take the woman to the hospital. While overhearing the first responders question the woman Ryan discovered that she had been sick for over two months and received a COVID-19 test earlier that same day.

Ryan didn’t know the results of the test but concerned about potential exposure to the virus she asked her manager if she needed to quarantine or take time off work.

“If you don’t get any symptoms then it’s fine” the manager replied.

April Martin the corporate affairs manager for the Kroger Dallas Division said that Kroger has complied with all health and safety regulations when identifying positive cases among store employees.

Nearly a year into the pandemic Ryan’s experience that day reflects the challenges that grocery store workers across Texas are facing in their stores every day. For months workers have risked their health to keep shorthanded grocery stores open all while dealing with increased hours and customers refusing to wear masks.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices urged states to include front-line essential workers in Phase 1B of vaccine allocation. But Texas decided not to include any essential employees like grocery store workers in the state’s current vaccine priority groups. Without any guarantee of vaccine prioritization grocery workers now find themselves overwhelmed and continually exposed to the virus with no end in sight.

“It’s kind of a big mess” Ryan said. “That’s what it feels like. It feels like a big mess and it feels like there’s no right answer.”

Martin said the grocery store company like several American businesses that had to swiftly alter how they operate in a pandemic has spent more than $1 billion to provide safeguards against the virus and give employees bonuses paid leave and wage premiums among other things.

""Our dedicated associates have gone above and beyond to serve our customers and communities during one of the most challenging times in our nation’s history and we’re committed to providing the resources and support to keep them and their families safe as they continue their remarkable effort"" she said.

Back in April when people made a rush for essential supplies like toilet paper and soap Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted a message of support for grocery store workers saying that “everyone across our state appreciates your hard work to help Texans respond to the #coronavirus.” Since then workers say they have felt forgotten and abandoned by the state government.

In December the Texas Expert Vaccine Allocation Panel in charge of designating each population currently eligible to receive vaccinations decided against including front-line essential workers in Phase 1B. The Department of State Health Services said that the panel wanted to reserve vaccine doses for those at the highest risk of death which includes people over 65 and anyone over 16 with a chronic medical condition that puts them at higher risk.

At least 8 million Texans currently qualify for Phase 1A or 1B of vaccine allocation but the state has received fewer than 4 million doses thus far. The panel is currently considering potential priority groups for Phase 1C of vaccine rollout and its decision will depend on epidemiological data about virus transmission according to DSHS Director of Media Relations Chris Van Deusen.

However at least 11 states and the District of Columbia followed CDC recommendations by deciding to put front-line essential workers including grocery store employees in the their latest rounds of vaccine allocation according to The Washington Post. New York allowed grocery workers to start getting the vaccine last month. Arkansas has also started vaccinating teachers and educators in the first round of essential workers to receive doses and the state plans to expand distribution to other essential workers later this month.

“You feel like you don’t matter when your own state goes against every recommendation that there is out there” said Dawn Hand who works at a Kroger in Houston. “Why don’t we matter? What’s your answer to that?”

While 17.7% of the total Texas population is uninsured 24% of grocery workers in 11 Texas cities have no health insurance according to an Associated Press analysis of census data. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted people of color in Texas and COVID-19 is deadlier for Black and brown people in the state. Black and Hispanic Texans have also faced more obstacles than white people in accessing the vaccine. Hispanic Texans make up 46% of grocery store workers in the 11 analyzed Texas cities and just over 39% of the state population. Black Texans make up more than 17% of grocery store employees in those cities compared to just under 12% of the state population.

The AP compiled information from the U.S. Census Bureau on cities with the largest populations of front-line workers to estimate the proportion of such employees in different demographic groups in 100 cities across the country. The Tribune analyzed the data on the 11 Texas cities in that list: Amarillo Arlington Austin Corpus Christi Dallas El Paso Fort Worth Houston Irving Lubbock and San Antonio.

In early January state Rep. Vikki Goodwin D-Austin spearheaded a letter from 10 state representatives to Abbott and Dr. John Hellerstedt the DSHS commissioner asking for essential workers like teachers and grocery store employees to be given vaccine priority. Goodwin argued that such workers should receive the vaccine as soon as possible because they are risking their lives every day to keep Texans healthy and safe.

Goodwin told The Texas Tribune that she wants grocery workers prioritized in the next phase of distribution although she understands that the panel’s decisions remain extremely difficult.

“I wasn’t aware that other states had added grocery store workers to Phase 1B and I think maybe it’s something to point out to the EVAP committee and see if they would reconsider adding grocery store workers to Phase 1B” Goodwin said.

In a rare move Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also sent a letter to Imelda Garcia chair of the EVAP requesting changes to the vaccine rollout plan to make distribution more efficient and effective. Patrick specifically asked for teachers to be prioritized but he did not mention grocery store workers.

Patrick’s office did not respond to a request for comment and Garcia declined an interview request from the Tribune.

Even well over a month after vaccines received federal approval Texas continues to see dangerously high levels of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Just last week three other workers at her Kroger location tested positive for the coronavirus Hand said. According to one study from the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine grocery workers who interact with customers are five times more likely to contract the virus than employees in other positions.

“You gotta scramble to fill their schedule and a lot of people — they’re tired they don’t wanna do it” Hand said. “It sucks. It really sucks. What do you do? We just have to get up every morning and push on and that’s all we can do to ensure that the community that we care about gets fed.”

To make matters worse grocery workers also frequently find themselves in the middle of fights over mask mandates and safety protocols in their stores. Despite a requirement for all customers and employees to wear masks at Kroger both Hand and Ryan said they see people come into the store without masks every day.

In fact multiple members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1000 have been fired for excessive confrontations with customers who refused to wear a mask in their stores union president Ricky Burris said in his January 2021 membership update.

Martin the Kroger corporate affairs manager said the store “provided tips for de-escalation” to help employees interact with customers frustrated about the mask mandate. Still workers have felt powerless to say anything to those customers according to Ryan and Hand.

“The people that I work with we just do our jobs” Ryan said. “We have people come into the store daily who do not have face masks on and nobody says anything to them. We just don’t. The managers don’t say anything to them the associates don’t say anything to them because we know the risks of asking someone to put a face mask on or to leave the store so we just don’t.”

Hand and Ryan said workers don’t always have enough time to properly sanitize different parts of the store and managers have failed to communicate clearly the protocol that employees have to follow when one tests positive. Because most people remain desperate for work during a pandemic-related recession workers often avoid reporting symptoms or following procedures because they need the money.

“A lot of employees are not gonna step forward and say ‘I need to quarantine. I need to get tested’” Ryan said. “There’s no benefit to getting tested. You’re gonna lose hours you’re gonna lose work time you’re potentially not gonna get paid for choosing to take the safe route.”

Facing such difficult situations and virus exposure every single day grocery store workers desperately need additional support to maintain their mental health and wellbeing Ryan added. Last year Kroger offered six free counseling sessions to all employees but it’s unclear if the company will provide the same opportunity again in 2021.

“The crazy thing is I’ve never in my life called my store and said I need a mental health day but I literally did it that last week when that lady fell out at my register” Ryan said.

With so much tension at work and little support from the state or from their employers many grocery workers still see the vaccine as their last hope for better months ahead. Although they recognize the need for high risk and elderly individuals to receive vaccine priority as well they also point out that they will continue to expose their families at home until they receive protection by being vaccinated.

“Our seniors need it. And my God if my son had cancer God forbid I’d want him to get the vaccine and I’d want him to get it before me” Hand said. “So I try to look at it as if it was my family. I would really really prefer them to get it before me but then I’m the one that’s exposing them so on that same side of the coin I need it too.”

One of the joys of Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) is that you never know what you will find when you visit. Recently I hiked part of Compartment 113 in SHNF. This is an area that I had never explored.

A compartment is a 500-2000-acre area managed by the U.S. Forest Service (FS) for wildlife wood watershed recreation and other multiple-uses. Each compartment is divided into stands which are managed as groups of trees which share similar characteristics.

Compartment 113 is at the southern boundary of SHNF. The part I hiked is near the corner of FM 2025 and Stephens Road just north of Cleveland Texas in San Jacinto County.

Two things drew me to Compartment 113. First in Stand 12 there appeared to be a well-developed Laurel Oak – Willow Oak forest which is often called a “Flatwoods”. This forest is defined by poor internal drainage and overland flow of rain run-off. I found a fine example of this forest in Stand 12.

The second thing that drew me to Compartment 113 is Stand 13 which appeared to have an unknown streamside forest. Although the FS labels Stand 13 on one map as a 81 acres of immature sawtimber Loblolly Pine and does not show the presence of streams a different FS map showed the possible presence of a stream.

As I pulled up to the entrance to Forest Road 294A it became obvious to me that there was a stream in Stand 13. That was exciting because streams are often places that team with life due to the presence of water.

The stream I found and hiked along appeared to be an intermittent stream that flows part of the year. During the summer flow stops and the stream exists as intermittent pools. This stream begins northeast east and north of Stephens Road and is composed of several tributaries that are ephemeral (flow only during a rain).

The stream turned out to be tannin colored (due to vegetative decomposition) had some gravel had a sluggish flow and had many hydrological features within and next to the floodplain like abandoned channels depressions dissected/sloped terrain and elevated bluffs or vistas. There was a moderate amount of downed wood along with stumps mostly pine on the bluffs and in the floodplain.

The FS classifies this stream as a Hardwood River Floodplain/Swamp. I observed a well-developed hardwood slope and minor stream community with many Sweetbay Magnolia Loblolly Pine White Oak Southern Magnolia Red Maple (some blooming) Sweetgum American Hornbeam and American Holly. Some other plants seen along the stream were Dwarf Palmetto Crossvine Springcress violets American Elderberry Partridge Berry Jack-in-the-Pulpit Sebastion-bush Sweetleaf Sphagnum Moss Arkansas Blueberry Resurrection Fern Christmas Fern and Southern Wax Myrtle.

Unfortunately some people have not taken care of Compartment 113. All-terrain vehicles have been illegally driven around the locked gate on FR 294A and I found trash dumped by the side of this road. Several deer feeders and a hog trap were found near the stream. It is sad that people participate in ugly uses on our public lands and do not take care of them.

Despite this Compartment 113 is a great place to visit. I had a beautiful hike with unexpected surprises that made me feel joyful. You cannot ask for more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9mb29kLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvZm9vZC1ldm9sdXRpb24tcmVjYWxsLWRpcHMtc2FsYWRzLXJlY2FsbGVkLXN1cGVyLWJvd2wvNDQxOTE1MTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Bowl food recall: Food Evolution recalls dip and salad products,"An Illinois company is recalling nearly 7000 pounds of ready-to-eat dip and salad products containing meat the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced Friday.

The Proctorville Foodfair store added the ability for customers to order groceries online for curbside pick up last summer and many of the stores locations now offer the service.

Store manager Kevin Callicot said it has proven popular with customers since its implementation.

“We started in around July” he said. “It’s a new thing for each store. Ashland just added it.”

He said the service started slow at first but took off in following months.

“More and more customers have been picking things up” he said.

Callicot said that those ordering go to www.foodfairmarkets.com where they create an account.

“Then you click what you want and send it to us” he said.

Customers can then pick up their groceries at the designated parking spots outside the store.

While it was started to make shopping easier for COVID-19 precautions Callicot said the store will continue to offer curbside pick up even after the pandemic is over.

“We’ll definitely keep it” he said.

At the Coal Grove Food Fair manager Chris Jones aid that even though the store does not have the designated parking spots set up they are still taking part and employees will bring groceries out to those who order.

“We’re definitely honoring that” he said stating customers can place orders.

Curbside pickup has been implemented by retailers nationwide across the spectrum from grocery stores like Kroger and Walmart to stores such as auto parts dealers and sporting goods shops.

A study by Coresight research in August found that 75 percent of the top 50 store-based retailers in the U.S. were offering some form of pick up service.

Smith who joined Coal Grove Foodfair store last year said pick up service there has been great for customers and he said they hope to continue it into the future as well.

“We want to take care of our customers” he said. “We always want to go above and beyond for them.”"

Las Vegas’ skyline has never been stable.

In the ’90s and 2000s the desert oasis-themed properties built during the city’s mob era were demolished to make room for bigger more lavish properties. Wynn Las Vegas replaced the Desert Inn the Bellagio was built on the ashes of the Dunes and The Venetian now offers gondola rides where the Sands once stood.

Demolition has been one of Las Vegas’ go-to methods for a refresh but certain aspects of Las Vegas’ skyline today will be here to stay thanks to a condominium trend that started in the 2000s. Real estate experts say the individually owned units inside the properties will make them difficult to tear down.

“Las Vegas does have a history of reinventing itself over the years. The market has seen a number of properties being torn down in an effort to replace it with something bigger better and more innovative” Applied Analysis partner Brian Gordon said. “For those locations that have these individually owned condominium units that development alternative becomes much more challenging.”

‘Difficult to tear down’

A dozen-plus high-rise condo buildings are spread across the tourist corridor. Some — like Turnberry Towers and Juhl — are purely residential. Others are attached to hotels like Palms MGM Signature Trump International Vdara and Waldorf Astoria.

Gordon said the hotel-condo trend first took off in Las Vegas in the early- and mid-2000s when land value and construction costs were soaring.

Developers needed to find a way to help finance their projects and condos offered a simple solution. Properties could sell individual units to frequent travelers who agreed to put their unit back in the rental pool a certain number of times throughout the year.

“Costs were escalating land values were elevated and demand for Las Vegas amenities and resort properties was high” Gordon said. The “for-sale condominium component (helped) fund that infrastructure.”

That financing trend died out when the market came crashing down during the Great Recession. Dreams of the “Manhattanization” of Las Vegas faltered as several planned high-rise mixed-use properties were nixed in the mid-2000s. Other projects pivoted operations: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for instance canceled condominium sales in 2008 and converted the units into hotel rooms after its original developer defaulted on a loan and Deutsche Bank took over.

While there are fewer condominium properties in Las Vegas than originally planned those that did make it to completion seem to be here to stay.

“Those properties will be more and more difficult to tear down” said Uri Vaknin a partner at private equity firm KRE Capital LLC who oversees five condominium properties in Las Vegas. “You have to get almost complete buy-in from ownership based on Nevada law.”

Layer to Las Vegas’ history

Gordon said condominiums “add an additional layer of complexity” to Las Vegas’ redevelopment activities. He expects the city’s current condominium towers to be around for at least the next decade.

Their longevity could be good for Las Vegas Vaknin said. As the chair of The Neon Museum’s board of trustees Vaknin said the buildings could help bolster the city’s architectural history.

“As we’ve matured as a city … we’re also seeing the importance of the history of our city” he said. “Part of what we know about Las Vegas is it is constantly evolving. At the same time we want to keep some of the stuff that makes Las Vegas Las Vegas. We don’t want to lose our identity.”

Brendan Bussmann of research and management consulting firm Global Market Advisors said these mixed-use properties have loyal customers who prefer the space and amenities compared with the traditional hotel offerings.

“There are individuals out there that … enjoy that product” he said. “Some people want that larger (room) that has a kitchen” when they visit Las Vegas.

Vaknin added that many of the condo-hotel hybrids lack the heavily-themed designs seen in other structures which could help them avoid going out of fashion longer.

“There will always be (demolitions)” Vaknin said but “I don’t think a place like CityCenter will be obsolete for decades and decades to come.”

Spokespeople for MGM Resorts which owns 50 percent of CityCenter declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for Red Rock Resorts which owns Palms Place also declined to comment.

Las Vegas: a ‘unique market’

Unlike the historic high-rises in New York or Chicago many structures in Las Vegas last just decades.

The Landmark was open 26 years before it was imploded. Dune’s South Tower was around for only 15. Desert Inn’s Palms Tower lasted seven.

For a city used to seeing buildings toppled over after only a few decades condominiums could throw a wrench in the city’s’ go-to method for a face-lift.

“We’re accustomed to seeing properties torn down after a few decades” Gordon said. “That seems to be something that’s fairly unique to this particular market given the evolutionary nature of the resort industry as a whole.”

Perhaps no one knows this better than Mark Loizeaux president of Controlled Demolition Inc. The Maryland-based business has been tearing down Las Vegas resorts since the Dunes implosion in 1993.

Loizeaux orchestrates implosions all over the country but Las Vegas has provided a steady stream of business over the years. The Riviera’s 2016 implosion was the company’s 28th or 29th Las Vegas project — at this point it’s hard to keep track.

“Las Vegas is a very unique market” Loizeaux said. “Nowhere else are people so aware of the value of time.”

Loizeaux said he has been approached with inquiries on three “iconic” Las Vegas structures in recent months but wasn’t able to share names because of nondisclosure agreements.

“I don’t see (implosions) immediately on the horizon” he said.

Despite redevelopment challenges tied to Las Vegas condos Gordon said the city will continue to evolve.

“These particular buildings will last much longer than we’ve seen among other sites up and down the Las Vegas Strip just by a function of their ownership” he said. “But that doesn’t mean other properties without a residential component won’t ultimately turn over or be redeveloped with time.”

“Our company has a long history of operations and innovation in Ohio and the Dayton area” LexisNexis said in a statement Wednesday. “While we no longer own any property in Miamisburg we have long term leases on two of the buildings on campus (9443 and 9393 Springboro Pike) and we have no plans to leave.”

The 391000-square-foot campus is located on 60 acres and includes buildings at 9443 9473 9555 and 9595 Springboro Pike.

This is the first time the buildings have been on the market.

The post-COVID world probably means less office space but it will not mean no office space said Dean Miller an ICP principal who often works in the Dayton area. He said ICP is confident in the “South Dayton” area with its ability “to reach down to the North Cincinnati” market for business and workers.

The area is in unincorporated Miami Twp. area a locale that has no municipal taxes and it is close to two busy interstates Miller observed.

Manager to reopen Voltzy’s Root Beer Stand

The long-time manager of Voltzy’s Root Beer Stand is vowing to reopen the Moraine restaurant in part to honor the wishes of its founder Rick Volz who died Monday at Kettering Medical Center after a lengthy illness.

“My main goal is to keep his legacy alive and I promised him I would give it my best effort” Samantha “Sammy” Bowman told this news outlet in a phone interview. “I know it’s not going to be easy.”

Bowman has launched a GoFundMe campaign with a goal of $10000 to “help pay for his funeral and cremation expenses” and “with whatever is left over putting it into reopening Voltzy’s as my own” she wrote on the fund-raising web site

Bowman said Volz “has been a a big influence on my life. He’s been like a grandfather to me for as long as I can remember.”

Volz who had no children of his own had operated the carryout restaurant for more than 30 years the last 12 at 4668 Springboro Pike. He was known for its burgers and sandwiches — some named after politicians and celebrities — as well as its house-made soups slaw dogs coneys and root beer floats. But it was perhaps best-known for the super-sized high-wattage personality of its owner who greeted customers by name and delivered good-natured occasionally R-rated taunts and one-liners in rapid-fired banter with his regular customers and occasionally even with “newbies” whom Volz thinks can take the ribbing.

If all goes well Bowman said she would like to reopen “in the next couple of months.”

Volz had faced a series of health setbacks in recent years that accelerated in recent months. Less than two months ago in December 2020 Bowman wrote that Volz had undergone a below-the-knee amputation of his right leg. Volz had been open about his previous surgeries in which he had toes and part of his foot amputated.

The GoFundMe.com campaign is entitled “Remembering Voltzy.”

Brewery wants to open second tap room

Yellow Springs Brewery is seeking approval to open a second tap room in a former bowling alley that the brewery purchased in 2016 for storage and distribution.

Plans call for opening a barrel room as a secondary tap room at the former Village Lanes bowling alley at 1475 Xenia Ave. in a facility the brewery now calls the South House building Lisa Wolters co-founder of the brewery told this news outlet this morning Jan. 29.

“We will still be doing our brewing at the Millworks/Walnut Street location but the barrel-aging will take place in the Barrel Room at the South House” Wolters said. “We will be increasing our variety of products — barrel-aging and eventually sours — and offer more space to enjoy our beer in a safely distanced manner.”

Yellow Springs Brewery has applied to the Ohio Division of Liquor Control for a license to accommodate those plans and will release more details about the second tap room when the brewery’s owners obtain the necessary permits Wolters said.

The brewery which opened in April 2013 had previously expanded its operations at its brewhouse and tasting room at 305 N. Walnut St. Yellow Springs Brewery has evolved into a regional powerhouse among Dayton-area craft breweries with its canned and bottled beers available in multiple retail markets in southwest and central Ohio.

Leidos land Air Force contract work

Leidos has won a $68.6 million Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) contract to work in the arena of electronic warfare.

The Fortune 500 company is based in Reston Va. but like many defense contractors with local offices has a presence off Pentagon Boulevard in Beavercreek.

The award is an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with cost-plus-fixed-fee task orders for the “Threat Assessment and Aircraft Protection Defensive Electronic Warfare” program the Department of Defense said Wednesday.

This program will conduct research to design expendable ordinance and directed-energy (signal) countermeasure concepts in electro-optical and multi-spectrum electro-optical/radio-frequency domains in response to “an ever-changing missile threat landscape using threat exploitation” the DoD said.

In general electronic warfare can refer any military activity that uses electromagnetic energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum in battle.

In August Leidos won a nearly $59 million order from the Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Lexington Park Md. to develop adaptive radar countermeasures hardware and software.

The new AFRL contract will also involve modeling and simulation evaluation hardware and field testing.

Work will be performed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where AFRL is headquartered and much of its work is conducted and is expected to be completed by Jan. 29 2025.

Starbucks property sold

A Los Angeles limited liability company is the new owner of the Brown Street Starbucks.

PSMKK LLC bought the Starbucks franchise property at 1134 Brown St. for $715000 Montgomery County records show. The seller was 113 Brown Street Partners LLC also based in California who bought the property in November 2017 for just over $641000.

Loopnet listed this property as a “net leased offering” imposing “minimal landlord responsibilities.” That means the lessee or business using the property pays at least part of all the taxes insurance fees and maintenance costs.

Records give the sale date for the local property has Jan. 21.

The site has operated since 2001 on what has become — at least before the pandemic — an increasingly busy section of Dayton near the University of Dayton.

Founded in 1971 today Starbucks has nearly 33000 stores worldwide according to the company.

MOD has local co-op program

The Modern College of Design has started a co-op program involving more than 10 businesses and organizations most of them in Dayton its metro area.

The program helps the college’s students gain professional leadership and design experience while meeting job requirements toward a new bachelor’s degree completion program according to MCOD President Jessica Barry.

The participating business according to the college include:

•Better Business Bureau Dayton.

•Boom Crate Dayton.

•Dragonfly Dayton.

•Erica Fit Love Studios Dayton.

•Jafe Decorating Inc. Greenville.

•Life Church Oklahoma City.

•Olberding Brands Cincinnati.

•Stratacache Dayton.

•Theta Design Co. Dayton.

•University of Dayton Athletics Dayton.

•YSI a Xylem Brand Yellow Springs.

Taitech lands AFRL contract

A Beavercreek research company has received notice of a new $31.5 million Air Force Research Lab contract.

Taitech Inc. has been awarded a not-to-exceed $31587310 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for technology for sustained supersonic combustion — or “TSSC” the Department of Defense said.

The mission of TSSC is to provide research and development for investigation of basic concepts components sub-systems and diagnostics for high-speed air breathing propulsion systems airframe structures and internal/external aerodynamics including integration into air vehicles weapons and launch systems the DoD said.

Work will be performed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and is expected to be completed by February 2028.

Passenger traffic at Dayton airport dramatically down

Airline passenger demand took a nose dive during the pandemic last year on the scene and numerous factors are leaving the question of when it could recover up in the air.

Enplanements a measure of the number of passengers boarding a plane plummeted at Dayton International Airport from 892414 enplanements in 2019 to 337517 passenger enplanements in 2020 a 62.2 percent drop according to statistics recently released by the airport.

Credit: JIM NOELKER Credit: JIM NOELKER

That colossal drop mirrors one experienced by the industry as a whole nationwide with U.S. airlines reporting 27 million originating passengers in the third quarter of 2020 down from 86 million passengers a year earlier a 68.6 percent drop according to the most recent data available from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

The airline industry right now is seeing “a bit of a rebound” at the start of 2021 according to aviation expert Jay Ratliff.

A typical day the TSA screens 2 million people nationwide and as many as 2.5 million during November and December Ratliff told this news outlet Friday. Travel numbers during the pandemic dropped as low as 87000 people flying on one day last April a 95 percent decline.

“That was the bottom” Ratliff said. “We use that as the scale moving forward.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Elvis Presley’s Graceland was forced to shut its doors for two months during the first lockdown last year. And while The King’s home is open with Covid restrictions in place Elvis Presley Enterprises have decided to put on some limited virtual tours open to fans all around the world. Express.co.uk attended the first one in late January which took us through Graceland’s mansion via The King’s grave onto the Lisa Marie private jet and through his possessions cars and clothes inside Elvis Presley’s Memphis entertainment and exhibit complex.

Safe to say the two-hour tour was well worth the $100 price tag. Sure there was a brief technical glitch in the first 10 minutes but Vice President of Graceland Archives and Exhibits Angie Marchese made up for that by adding on another generous 30 minutes to the tour while answering fan questions throughout. There were only set to be two more of these virtual tours at the end of February and March but due to phenomenal demand Graceland are now putting on more with four types of tour to choose from. Graceland wrote in a statement: “The response to these tours has exceeded our expectations as all three of our initial Graceland Virtual Live Tours have officially sold out. So we are very happy to announce that we have added additional tour dates as well as three brand new virtual tour options. “There are now four unique Graceland Virtual Live Tour options available so that you can choose the one that’s right for you! All Virtual Live Tours are hosted by Angie Marchese Vice President of Graceland Archives and one of the world’s foremost experts on all-things Elvis Presley.” READ MORE: Elvis Presley: Upstairs at Graceland described by archivist allowed in

Andrea Bocelli first started duetting with his son in 2018 after discovering that not only did Matteo Bocelli want to be a singer but he had inherited his father’s incredible vocals. Their first duet was Fall On Me a tribute to each other and a song that features in the end credits of live-action Disney movie The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. Now the 23-year-old has teased his very only solo music is on the way.

Matteo wrote on Instagram this weekend: “It’s been two years since my debut at the most important music festival in Italy. “I’ll never forget the incredible feeling of walking on to the stage for the first time. “That moment marked the beginning of an intense creative journey – I can’t wait to share my music with you soon.” Hopefully it won’t be too long before the 23-year-old shares more with his fans.

Lisa Marie was only a little girl when her father died on August 16 1977. She was there that night at Graceland and rushed into the bathroom where he lay dead on the floor. Although she was only nine at the time she remembers that Elvis was constantly surrounded by his inner circle throughout his life and especially in his decline. As an adult an angry Lisa Marie called them ""slithering mother****ers"" and said they were still ""trying to take away his dignity"" even after he was gone.

Lisa Marie named three of them in a particularly furious attack accusing them of contributing to her father’s demise and then profiting from it afterwards. She referred to: ""Sonny West Marty Lacker Red West all these people that were worse than him."" ""They scared the hell out of me when I was a kid too.

The salaciously detailed Elvis What Happened? was set to expose the star’s drug use and unhealthy lifestyle to the world. The trio had been fired officially to save money but they claimed it was because they had tried to force Elvis to face his addiction issues. Over the years these three and numerous others from Elvis’ inner circle would continue to give interviews release books and make documentaries revealing yet more private details about their former friend and boss. Lisa Marie exploded with anger after watching one particular documentary and publicly accused the Memphis Mafia of ""helping"" her father ""go down"" at the end.

In another interview Lisa Marie added: ""I couldn't believe they were trying to take his dignity… I just thought 'You slithering mother****ers have no right. None. ""'You were responsible for this just as much as he was. His dignity was one of the most important things to him and you are trying to take it away."" Her fury inspired the song Nobody Noticed It for her 2003 debut album To Whom It May Concern.

The lyrics of the song paint a picture of Elvis suffering alone with nobody to help him. They say: “All that you had to endure Nobody noticed it” and go on to promise “Well they tried to make You look broken But not while I'm living.” While everyone from the Memphis Mafia has always protested over the years that there was no way to help Elvis that it was impossible to ever challenge his wishes Lisa Marie believed they should have done more. But she also recognised that it’s rare that stars like her father survive such an extraordinary pressures and lifestyles.

During the 1970s Elvis Presley became rather obsessed with guns and famously shot some of his TVs. One of the sets is on display at Graceland with the bullet hole seen quite clearly through it. According to Elvis expert and archivist Angie Marchese on a recent virtual live tour of The King’s house the star was watching Robert Goulet in his Palm Springs house when he decided to open fire.

Angie shared: “It’s true Robert Goulet was on TV and the actual bullet that was in the TV missed all the tubes. “This TV still does work and the bullet that was inside the TV is part of the collection. “We actually went inside to preserve this screen and epoxied it so those cracks would not spread anymore.” Goulet was an American singer and Broadway star who was actually a friend of Elvis.

Elvis died on August 16 1977 at his home Graceland. The star was found in his bathroom slumped on his chest by his fiancée Ginger Alden. Police reports and autopsies claimed the star was killed by a “cocktail” of medications and drugs ultimately leading to a heart attack. But a new report has now claimed Elvis’ death was first caused by a head injury that occurred years earlier.

Californian physician Forest Tennant reviewed the report on Elvis’ death and came to the conclusion that this injury caused a number of the King’s ailments. In the years leading up to his death Elvis complained of vertigo back pain insomnia eye infections headaches and more. He was even rushed to hospital in 1973 whilst suffering from jaundice putting him in a “semi-coma”. The star was also found to have a bleeding ulcer and hepatitis. Forest said these injuries and illnesses Elvis suffered from began when he tripped over a TV cord in a Hollywood hotel room in 1967.

Forest claims the injury was bad enough to cause brain tissue to become dislodged and “seep into his blood circulation”. His body then identified the matter as an illness and produced antibodies to destroy it triggering “hypogammaglobulinemia” - an immune system disorder. Forest said in a 2013 medical report that this diagnosis explained all of Elvis’ afflictions including minor - but chronic - bouts of pain in his liver lungs heart spine and bowels.

Elvis Presley could have injured his head which caused his death

The Voice: Tom Jones discusses singing with Elvis Presley

An overprescription of drugs was originally pointed at as the cause of Elvis’ death in the late ‘70s. His personal doctor Dr George Nichopoulos was indicted on 14 counts of overprescribing drugs to the star in 1980 as well as some other notable singers including Jerry Lee Lewis. Forest himself defended Dr Nick at his trial using the head trauma evidence in his favour. Elvis' official autopsy report will be released in 2027 but reports that the star's body was worse than initially announced have been released over the past few decades.

According to one report Elvis had a full-time nurse to look after him at his time of death. He also wouldn’t leave his house and ate “platters” of cheeseburgers instead of balanced meals. The Jailhouse Rock singer also had “four months worth of compacted stool” sitting in his bowel at the time of death. Chief investigator for the Tennessee Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner Dan Warlick said these events led to the star’s death.

Lockheed said Feb. 7 that ABL will perform a launch of its RS1 rocket from the Shetland Space Centre a spaceport to be developed on the island of Unst in the Shetlands in 2022. The rocket on a mission called the UK Pathfinder launch will place into orbit a tug developed by Moog in the UK that will then deploy six 6U cubesats.

The launch will fulfill an award made by the British government in 2018 to support development of a domestic launch capability. The $31 million contract to Lockheed Martin covered a launch then planned for a spaceport at Sutherland in northern Scotland as well as Moog’s orbital maneuvering vehicle.

Lockheed did not disclose at the time though which vehicle it would use for the launch. The company does not have a small launch vehicle of its own compatible with the spaceport but has invested in companies working on such vehicles including ABL Space Systems and Rocket Lab.

In October Lockheed announced the UK Space Agency agreed to allow the company to perform the launch from the Shetland Space Centre. The company said doing so would avoid conflicts with Orbex a small launch vehicle developer based in the UK that also plans to launch from Sutherland. At the time of that announcement Lockheed said it was in “discussions with a preferred partner” but did not disclose that company.

“We are absolutely committed to the success of this program and the world-class capability that ABL Space Systems brings will allow us to build on our long-standing partnership with the UK and strengthen the growth of the UK space sector” Nik Smith regional director of Lockheed Martin Space said in a statement.

“We want the UK to be the first in Europe to launch small satellites into orbit attracting innovative businesses from all over the world” Ian Annett deputy chief executive of the UK Space Agency said in the statement. “Lockheed Martin’s selection of ABL Space Systems for their UK Pathfinder launch brings us one step closer to realizing this ambition putting the UK firmly on the map as Europe’s leading small satellite launch destination.”

Lockheed said ABL’s ability to launch with limited on-site infrastructure played a key role in its decision. “We selected ABL Space Systems for the UK Pathfinder Launch to harness the flexibility of ABL’s integrated GS0 launch system and RS1 rocket which will allow us to quickly stand up our new site” Randy DeRosa program manager for Lockheed’s UK Pathfinder Launch program said in a statement to SpaceNews. “The ABL system is relatively easy quick and cost-effective to deploy with fantastic performance an important capability for many of our future customers.”

According to ABL its GS0 launch system is “fully self-contained” and thus doesn’t require any fixed infrastructure at the spaceport. Shetland Space Centre will provide a flat concrete launch pad bulk propellant and gas commodities as well as a mission control center.

The launch from the UK does require more paperwork for ABL in the form of export and launch licensing. A Technology Safeguards Agreement between the American and British governments along with a technical assistant agreement the company has with its UK partners will allow ABL to export its rocket to the UK. The launch will also require launch licenses from both the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority.

The RS1 rocket is in its final stages of development with a first launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California scheduled for the second quarter of this year. While the Lockheed contract covers a single launch ABL expects this to be the first in a series of launches from the UK.

“We’re hoping to establish a regular launch cadence from Shetland Space Centre allowing us to better serve the European satellite market” an ABL spokesman said. “We are beginning to formulate our European strategy and recently incorporated an ABL UK subsidiary to support these efforts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2xvY2toZWVkLXRvLWFybS11cy1mLTM1LXN0ZWFsdGgtamV0cy13aXRoLW51Y2xlYXItYm9tYnMtdW5kZXItYmxvY2stNC11cGdyYWRlLXJlcG9ydHMv0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vbG9ja2hlZWQtdG8tYXJtLXVzLWYtMzUtc3RlYWx0aC1qZXRzLXdpdGgtbnVjbGVhci1ib21icy11bmRlci1ibG9jay00LXVwZ3JhZGUtcmVwb3J0cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed To Arm US’ F-35 Stealth Jets With Nuclear Bombs Under Block 4 Upgrade — Reports,"US aerospace giant Lockheed Martin is set to integrate the fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighter jets with a tactical nuclear weapon under the latest Block 4 upgrade according to reports.

In November The EurAsian Times reported that the US’ F-35A Lightning II had been successfully flight-tested with the B61-12 nuclear bomb at Sandia National Laboratories’ Tonopah Test Range Nevada.

The forthcoming upgrade that includes a host of modifications aimed at improving the F-35’s performances will arm the fighter jet with the B-61 Mod 12 nuclear gravity bomb.

These new additions will boost the combat capability of the frontline F-35 fighters to use their stealth technology to penetrate hostile airspace without any warning and deliver nuclear weapons.

Considered the most sought-after fighter jet on the planet the single-seat single-engine all-weather multirole F-35 fighter is already in service with nine countries and boasts the ability to perform an array of roles including air superiority and strike missions.

Developed after the introduction of the F-22 Raptor the fighter can carry out electronic warfare and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

The fighter which has already undergone a 20-year design and development effort under Lockheed Martin will be provided with a series of upgrades in order to keep the aircraft ready for the next decade or two.

There are a host of new weapons systems that are due to be integrated under the Block 4 upgrades that will significantly increase the fighter jet’s maritime strike air-to-ground and air-to-air combat capabilities.

Among the weapons to be integrated is the GBU-54/B Stormbreaker also called Small Diameter Bomb II. Developed by American weapons manufacturer Raytheon the 208-pound Stormbreaker is very similar to the GPS-guided GBU-39 SDB I already integrated with the F-35.

With the Stormbreaker being only six to seven inches in diameter around eight such bombs can be fitted inside the F-35’s confined internal weapon bays.

Apart from the Stormbreaker Block 4 upgrade will also pave way for the introduction of the AGM-154 JSOW-C1 which is a larger thousand-pound glide bomb.

It will come with a datalink and infrared seeker for terminal guidance designed to penetrate and destroy moving maritime targets up to seventy miles away when released at high altitude.

Among the weapons under Block 4 upgrade the B-61 Mod 12 nuclear gravity bomb is the most lethal. The bomb which is the upgraded version of the B61 nuclear bomb has tail fins that can adjust its trajectory to strike on average within 30 meters of a designated GPS coordinate.

The bomb has a selectable yield between .3 and 50 kilotons and possesses bunker-penetration capabilities.

This deadly mix of both precision and penetration means that it could threaten an adversary’s leadership command and control facilities along with the hardened missile launch sites.

With different nations operating the F-35 fighters the Block 4 upgrade is expected to include the integration of country-specific weapons as requested by foreign F-35 operators.

According to the guidelines laid down in the NATO agreement the US B-61 nuclear bombs will also be available for deployment on fellow NATO nations operating the F-35s.

Apart from these features the Block 4 will contain modifications that have been structured in a manner so that the F-35 fighter can adapt to future warfare.

The upgrades are likely to enhance the fighter’s abilities so that it can function well at a time when the US begins introducing the planned sixth-generation fighter jet as well as the stealth drones like the B-21 Raiders.

As per the reports the Block 4 will equip the modern stealth fighters with faster computers more missiles panoramic cockpit display longer ranges and AI-flown wingmen.

This will in turn enable the pilots of the aircraft to become even more aware of their surroundings during missions so that they can draw data from different sources to derive the correct attack plans against enemies.

The new onboard computer on F-35 can gather organize analyze and display data on a single screen for pilots.

Under Block 4 the fighter will take another step further towards Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) which will put even more tactical emphasis upon the warplane’s information transmitting systems.

A concept of the US Department of Defense the JADC2 aims to connect sensors from all of the military services —Air Force Army Marine Corps Navy and Space Force—into a single network.

“The JADC2 technology demonstrations and new innovations are inspiring the military services to ‘reprioritize’ software upgrades to the F-35” according to US Air Force’s Director of the F-35 Integration Office Brigadier General David Abba.

Its long journey of some 10000 kilometers started on Thursday afternoon from the 114th Battle Wing at the Tanagra Air Base in northern Attica.

American insignia were affixed to the aircraft which was also legally registered with the United States Air Force (USAF) in order to avoid problems flying into the country’s airspace.

This means that until it returns to Greece for legal reasons the plane has been registered as part of the USAF fleet.

The jet has made a stop at a US Air Force base in Belgium where it will remain until Wednesday morning when it will depart with three other F-16s from other countries for its final destination in Texas.

The final leg of the trip over the Atlantic from Belgium to Fort Worth will take about 10 hours.

It will be refueled in the air about eight to 10 times. Sources familiar with such flights say that the frequency of refueling is linked to flight safety. An F-16 Viper can fly from Belgium to Texas with much less refueling. However the fuel tanks of the fighter must be almost constantly full so that in case of an accident or damage it has enough time to land on the nearest land.

The arrival of the fighter jet in the US for final tests as well as the introduction to the facilities of the Hellenic Aerospace Industry of a second F-16 that will be upgraded to a Viper configuration are testimony that the upgrading of the country’s jets is on track.

For the past month nonprofit organization Rebuilding Together Tampa Bay has been making free repairs on 30 Tampa homes in their Kickoff to Rebuild.

The initiative to make repairs on and rebuilds of houses in Super Bowl cities was started by national nonprofit Rebuilding Together 25 years ago in partnership with the NFL. Rebuilding Together Tampa Bay is an affiliate. This year has seen builds in 29 of the NFL’s 32 markets nationwide more than ever before.

Through a partnership with Lowe’s Home Improvement the official home improvement retail sponsor of the NFL homes in West Tampa East Tampa Drew Park Orient Park and Sulphur Springs have received critical repairs and roof replacements for the past several weeks.

The initiative led up to Friday’s special day of builds in which volunteers from Lowe’s and local contractors made repairs to homes for low-income families. NFL players Lyndell “Mack” Wilson and Derwin Gray attended the event to show support.

The repairs include roof replacements replacement of AC units and water heaters installment of hurricane impact windows and wheelchair ramps. They will impact 54 children and 46 adults in the Tampa Bay area.

Wanda Vinson and her father 84-year-old Otis are one family benefitting from the program.

Vinson moved back to her father’s home when he was declared legally blind and lost both legs from complications of diabetes.

Soon after it became clear that she would have to quit her job at a pharmacy and become his full-time caretaker.

When she moved in her mother Willie Ceil Vinson was still living but also suffered from diabetes and had a series of strokes. She died in January.

Vinson returned to school to become a medical assistant mainly so she would know how to help her dad in an emergency. Her son helps her working nights and staying with Otis during the day while Vinson goes to school.

But the 1957 home is in extreme disrepair with issues ranging from a leaky roof unsealed windows and doors to no working kitchen.

Vinson said that as her father’s caretaker Medicaid pays her $10 an hour for 27 hours a week. With high electric and water bills as well as taxes she told Otis “Dad we’re going under. The house is becoming too much we can’t afford her.”

She called Senior Connection who gave her a list of resources that included Rebuilding Together Tampa Bay. She applied and met the criteria for the program.

“I thought it was God sent from heaven” she said. “That is all I needed.”

Volunteers from Lowe’s have already repaired a leaky patch of roof and were measuring windows and doors for replacement. They can’t fix everything that the house needs but Vinson is grateful for the help.

“I cannot thank Rebuilding Together Tampa Bay enough for doing this me” Vinson said. “It’s nice to have somebody care.”

Beyond the partnership with the NFL Rebuilding Together Tampa Bay works year-round repairing and rebuilding homes for low-income families in Hillsborough County.

Brandy Canada-Williams the nonprofit organization’s director of operations said in the past year they have done 127 rehabs an additional 54 roofs and 12 rebuilt houses.

The organization also has an affordable housing program that offers new builds and rehabs of foreclosed properties for first-time buyers partnering with HUD-certified agencies.

Canada-Williams said there are plans to expand to Pinellas County. She added that since their fiscal year began in June they’ve spent $3.2 million in the community.

“I just want people to know the impact the organization has” Canada-Williams said.

On Saturday Rebuilding Together Tampa Bay is hosting the Kickoff to Rebuild community fair at Ragan Park in Tampa with the goal to provide local residents resources from 28 local organizations and nonprofits. The OneBlood Bus will be onsite conducting COVID-19 antibody tests and 250 COVID-19 prevention kits will be given away while supplies last. The event is free but RSVPs are strongly encouraged and can be made on the organization’s Facebook page. It runs from 9:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. at 1200 E Lake Ave.

Fox in the Same Bed,"Rob Lowe may have had humble beginnings but his trajectory in Hollywood turned him into a teen celebrity a member of the “Brat Pack” and a respected actor who shed those early labels.

He was a favorite of John F. Kennedy Jr. in The West Wing but rose to fame for his roles in The Outsiders and St. Elmo’s Fire. Another actor who came from the same era is Back to the Future king Michael J. Fox.

Both were in films that helped rock the ’80s and they crossed paths in Tinseltown. However there was a point when their interactions hit an awkward — but hilarious — bump.

Rob Lowe and Michael J. Fox came up around the same time

Playing Sodapop in The Outsiders shot Rob Lowe to a new level of fame and soon after he landed roles in films such as Oxford Blues and About Last Night. Back in the day a journalist for New York Magazine deemed Lowe Andrew McCarthy Judd Nelson Emilio Estevez Matt Dillion and Tom Cruise as members of the “Brat Pack.”

It’s a term that some of them found offensive but it stuck for years and typically lumped Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy in the crew too. Do you know who wasn’t part of that list? Michael J. Fox.

During that time period he’d been soaring in Back to the Future Teen Wolf and TV’s Family Ties adding blockbusters to his resume just like his peers. According to Lowe the Brat Pack distinction led to a “friendly rivalry” between the two.

Why Rob Lowe and Michael J. Fox were ‘frenemies’

In his book Stories I Only Tell My Friends Lowe said he first met Fox at a boxing match. When Fox introduced himself he asked about an invitation.

“Your invitation? Invitation to what?” Lowe asked. “To join the Brat Pack” said Fox. “I guess it was just lost in the mail” he said. Lowe checked for signs that he was joking and Fox dismissed him said he had his own thing. “The Snack Pack!” he declared.

After the match they spent the rest of evening throwing friendly digs at each other about their movies. Lowe ran into Fox months later as part of a political bus tour with Jane Fonda.

“The night before I am at frenemy Michael J. Fox’s house for the kickoff party this being our attempt to settle a fairly friendly but simmering rivalry” wrote Lowe.

Fox’s party wore Lowe out

Since the group had to leave at 7 a.m. for the bus campaign people gathered and had a good time at Fox’s house. Lowe remembered being tuckered out around 4:30 a.m. and bid goodnight to Fox’s attentive dog Tom Petty’s guitarist and everyone else. He headed toward a guest room to sleep.

“I stumble to an out-of-the-way guest room and am unconscious in seconds” Lowe recalled. “Even the commotion of a large object leaping onto the bed doesn’t stir me; I figure I’ll let Mike’s dog sleep where he wants” he said. Lowe remarked that the room was freezing and he was happy the dog helped keep him warm. Only it didn’t.

He was awakened by Fox’s assistant who barked “What the hell is going on?” Groggy and still under the previous night’s influence Lowe looked at the assistant and apologized for allowing the dog to sleep in the bed with him.

But the look on her face said otherwise. “I look next to me to discover Mike is in the bed not the dog. I leap out of bed” Lowe wrote. After loudly invoking Jesus — which elicited a “shuuut up” comment from a half-asleep Fox he hurried out of the room. They manage to make it onto the bus on time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9jaGVsc2VhLWhhbmRsZXItcmVjYWxscy13ZWlyZC1kaW5uZXItYXQtamVmZmVyeS1lcHN0ZWlucy1ob21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chelsea Handler recalls 'weird' star-studded dinner at Jeffrey Epstein's home,"Chelsea Handler was admittedly freaked out while attending a celebrity-packed dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein’s home.

During her Wednesday appearance on the “Literally! With Rob Lowe” podcast Handler 45 detailed the unusual evening with the financier who reportedly died by suicide in jail while being held without bail pending trial on child sex-trafficking charges.

“I did go to dinner at Jeffrey Epstein’s house” Handler told Lowe. “I didn’t know who Jeffrey Epstein was. It was like twenty — I don’t know what year it was but it was a long time ago. I went with Katie Couric. Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn were there. Charlie Rose was there.”

“I was at that dinner party but not for very long” she continued. “When we got there I was like ‘What is this gathering?’ Oh yeah Prince Andrew was there with — no with no one. He was there with Jeffrey Epstein.”

“Yeah we had dinner and it was so awkward and so weird” the comic added. “I was like what are we doing here? And then I asked Woody Allen how he and Soon Yi met and that was when I left.”

“Wait a minute” Lowe interrupted. “You asked Woody Allen how he and Soon Yi met?”

Previn is the adopted daughter of Allen’s ex Mia Farrow.

“At that point of the night I was like ‘This is such a ridiculous dinner party who are these people?’ I really was curious. I had forgotten for a moment and so I asked them what I would ask any other couple. But as it came out of my mouth I knew that it was too late and I was like ‘Oh.'”

“And he loved it and Soon Yi I don’t think she heard it and Katie looked at me and was like ‘Let’s go.'” Handler said with a chuckle.

“I love social faux pas stories. That’s a great one” Lowe responded.

“But could you consider that a faux pas?” Handler interjected. “I’m not being rude they are — by marrying your stepchild. Like that’s rude. So I don’t even consider it a faux pas.”

Handler added that the dinner party was the only time she ever saw Epstein.

“I’ve never been on the private island and I’ve never been on his plane. I’ve met him one time and that was the time.”

“That was a star-studded moment wasn’t it” Lowe asked with Handler responding “Yes it was it was very confusing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9zaHlsYXdhdHNvbi9yb2ItbG93ZS1kZXJlay1wYXRyaWNrLWRlbXBzZXktZ3JleXMtYW5hdG9tedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rob Lowe On Not Playing Derek In Grey's Anatomy,"In his 2014 memoir Rob revealed ""I got an urgent call from the producers of a potential new show for ABC called Grey's Anatomy ...I had read it and loved it—the writing was crisp real and very entertaining—and it's always been a good idea to hear out talented people."""
LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzA3L2NvdWxkLW5pa2UtYmUtYS1taWxsaW9uYWlyZS1tYWtlci1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Nike Be a Millionaire-Maker Stock?,"Investors shouldn't underestimate the growth potential of the sportswear giant.

Nike (NKE -0.28%) has been a consistent winner for shareholders over the years. Even though the sneaker giant is approaching $40 billion in annual revenue the swoosh just keeps growing.

Over the last five years the stock has more than doubled in value but what we want to know is this: Can Nike sustain its momentum long enough to turn a small investment into a million dollars?

Nike's past returns and growth

The first thing to consider is Nike's historical rate of return. Since the company has had a very similar main product line throughout the nearly 50 years it has been selling shoes under the Nike trademark we shouldn't expect the stock to deliver a higher return than what it has historically.

A $10000 investment in Nike stock in 1990 would have grown to be worth $1.58 million today including dividend reinvestment.

Keep in mind Nike was growing revenue much faster in the 1990s than it is today. In fiscal 1995 revenue grew 25%. At the time revenue had climbed fivefold over the previous 10 years from fiscal 1985.

Since fiscal 2010 Nike's revenue has only doubled which reflects a slowing growth rate as Nike's business gets larger.

The important thing to remember is that while stocks can do anything in the short term there is a high correlation between a company's growth in profits and the return of the stock price over a long period of time.

Nike's long-term goal is to grow revenue at a high-single-digit rate and grow earnings per share in the mid-teens range. If Nike can sustain that level of earnings growth over 30 years it's certainly possible that a $10000 investment could be worth more than $600000 in 30 years.

Any company that is growing over a long period of time can deliver massive gains if you hold the stock long enough. That's the beauty of compounding interest and why stocks are great wealth-building tools.

Nike's revenue target is a reasonable goal given that the athletic apparel industry continues to show signs of expansion. Other fitness brands like lululemon athletica and Peloton Interactive are also showing strong growth. One estimate placed the sports apparel market at $167 billion in 2018 and expected to reach $248 billion by 2026.

Nike has been growing in line with the industry. Between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2019 Nike grew revenue at a compounded rate of 6.5% but revenue growth was accelerating above that rate in fiscal 2020 right before the pandemic hit. Earnings per share didn't grow as much over those three years due to investments to support the growth of the digital business.

If Nike can deliver on its long-term outlook you could turn a small investment into a million bucks or at least get within striking distance. Here's how Nike can deliver.

Nike's strategy

Nike's investments in the direct-to-consumer business are laying the foundation for improving margins and growing profits.

The swoosh remains a hot brand which is driving explosive growth through Nike's mobile apps particularly SNKRS where Nike drops highly anticipated sneakers in limited quantities that sell out quickly. For the fiscal second quarter ending in November Nike reported that its mobile apps grew 200% year over year.

Nike's total revenue growth clocked in at 7% in the last quarter excluding currency consistent with management's long-term target. Nike's digital channel now makes up more than 30% of the business and management sees it reaching 50% in the near future.

Nike is now a digital-first company and since digital sales generate higher profits than sales through wholesale channels earnings per share should grow faster than Nike's single-digit revenue target over the long term. This is why analysts are currently forecasting Nike to post annualized growth in earnings per share of 34% over the next five years.

During the fiscal second-quarter conference call CEO John Donahoe summed up the key drivers that should fuel this growth stock higher over time. ""The structural tailwinds we're seeing including permanent shifts toward digital athletic wear and health and wellness continue to offer us incredible opportunity"" he said.

Not many consumer discretionary companies can sustain a mid-teens level of earnings growth over several decades but I will never say never about any great business. Look at it like this: Nike has been around for about 50 years and management is still talking about growing earnings at double-digit rates.

So yes Nike is a millionaire-making stock but you must be willing to hold the shares for a long time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVyY2l0eW1hZy5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9mcmVlLXBlb3BsZS1tb3ZlbWVudC1uZXctZm9ydC13b3J0aC1zdG9yZS11bml2ZXJzaXR5LXBhcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Changes at Fort Worth's University Park Village — New Athleisure Store In Banana Republic Out,"The second FP Movement in the state of Texas is opening in Fort Worth.

While longtime retail anchor Banana Republic is out at Fort Worth’s University Park Village something new is opening this week. Adding to the athleisure options which include stores from Lululemon Athletica and Athleta is a new offing from Free People which also already has a regular store in the Village. Say hello to its spinoff Free People Movement or FP Movement.

The new store is putting on the finishing touches but could open as early as Wednesday and definitely by Thursday June 3rd. It will be the second FP Movement store in Texas. The first opened in Austin’s The Domain mixed-use center two weeks ago with a much larger and more comprehensive store.

FP Movement is spreading fast having grown to nine stores across the nation from Pennsylvania to South Carolina and from Virginia to Texas with plans to open four more locations in June alone. Until one pops up near them curious fashion mavens can shop the full collection online.

The Free People Movement collection goes way beyond yoga pants and sports bras although you’ll find many styles and colors of those. Meant to be a hub for the life well-lived FP Movement offers performance-ready activewear practice-perfect styles and what they dub “beyond-the-gym staples.” Specializing in clothes ideal for yoga dance hiking and running favorite collections are named Way Home Good Karma Happiness Runs You’re a Peach and Hot Shot.

Like the boho-chic and always youthful main line Free People you can anticipate interesting cuts and proportions in this athleisure line as well. You can even channel your inner M.C. Hammer in FP Movement’s Harem Pants with an exaggerated inseam. There are flirty shorts catsuit onesies and even updated tennis sets. It’s all about comfort and movement.

With summer finally in full session it may be time to up your athleisure game. Now Free People Movement is here in Fort Worth to help.",,,,,,,,,

Brown our much-loved husband father grandfather son brother uncle friend and boss died on Tuesday January 26 2021 from injuries sustained in a skiing accident. Kevin was born on December 26 1957 in Little Rock Arkansas. A life-long Razorback he graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1981 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. His brilliant mind helped lead companies in the oil and petrochemical industries starting with Texaco and Sinclair Oil. He served as chairman of the American Fuels and Petrochemical Association where he enjoyed the challenge and camaraderie of his colleagues. He retired from LyondellBasell as Executive Vice President in 2017 to focus on his other passions: golfing skiing fishing travel and time spent with loved ones. Even in retirement he showed no signs of slowing down. Kevin woke early each morning for a long walk with the dogs before moving on to an early tee time or a meeting for one of his various board positions. At the time of his death he was on the Board of Directors of Flotek Industries and GCP Applied Technologies in addition to working in an advisory capacity for RLG. He continued to serve his beloved University of Arkansas through the Dean's Advisory Council and the Campaign Arkansas project. He was proud to be named a College of Engineering Distinguished Alumnus in 2011 and to the Hall of Fame in 2018. Kevin split his time between Park City and Houston having close friends who became family in both cities. He never met a stranger and made friends out of every acquaintance. Much to his family's chagrin he had a habit of greeting whoever was seated next to him on the ski lift and saying ""Where y'all from?"" He loved to mentor young professionals and guide them in their career. A connoisseur of fine wine and great food he was a grill master who prided himself on grilling a steak that rivaled most fine steakhouses and could whip up a chocolate cream pie you would swear was from a bakery. Always up for a house party he enjoyed welcoming friends to his home and sharing his unique southern hospitality. Kevin is survived by his wife Marie daughter Sydney and son-in-law Michael Chua grandkids Ben and Annie his parents Darrell and LaVonne Brown brother Jim sister-in-law Pam sister Karen his in-laws the Lyons family numerous nieces and nephews and more friends and colleagues than we could ever count. He is reunited with loved ones gone before him including his daughter Megan and father-in-law Curney Lyons. Special thanks to the PCMR ski patrol Park City EMTs and the entire staff at the University of Utah hospital. Due to Covid a memorial will be held at a future date when we can safely gather in the manner befitting such a man. In lieu of flowers the family asks that you consider a donation to the Kevin Brown Scholarship at University of Arkansas: UA Foundation Gift Services University of Arkansas 1002 W Maple Street Fayetteville AR 72701.

The FTX-associated address transferred 860 Tether Gold (XAUT) worth over $2 million to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute while an Alameda-related wallet transferred a total of 2027 Ether (ETH) worth over $6.3 million to two unknown addresses according to a May 6 X post by PeckShield.

While the reason behind the transactions is unknown they come a day ahead of FTX debtors’ deadline to file an amended version of the “Plan and Disclosure Statement” slated for May 7.

The amended plan could offer FTX creditors more insights into how they will be compensated for their lost funds. The final deadline for objections is set for June 5.

The collapse of FTX and its over 130 subsidiaries is known as one of the crypto industry’s most notorious black swan events which led to users losing at least $8.9 billion worth of funds. The collapse gave rise to one of the industry’s longest crypto winters when the Bitcoin (BTC) price bottomed out at $16000.

When will FTX creditors be repaid?

While FTX’s amended plan could shed more light on how customers will be made whole some creditors are expecting negative news.

Popular FTX creditor Sunil who is part of the largest group of over 1500 FTX creditors — the FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee — has cautioned users to reject the upcoming plan which will likely benefit the debtors. Sunil wrote in a May 5 X post:

“S&C [Sullivan & Cromwell] likely include clauses to absolve their liability for crimes. S&C puppet John Ray secures a position for himself. Property rights not recognized [for creditors].”

The warning comes nearly three months after top FTX creditors sued bankruptcy firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C). The creditors alleged that S&C took an active part in the “FTX Group’s multibillion-dollar fraud” claiming the firm benefited financially from FTX’s fraud a court filing on Feb. 16:

“S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.’s omissions untruthful and fraudulent conduct and misappropriation of Class Members’ funds. Despite this knowledge S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed at least impliedly to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.”

To date FTX creditors have sold over $490 million worth of claims through 507 transactions according to data from crypto debt broker Claims Market.

The legal proceedings could potentially extend for several years before reaching a conclusion mirroring the protracted case of the Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange which experienced a notorious hacking incident in 2014. The users of the hacked exchange are still awaiting compensation.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Since 2022 the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has been collecting money from Canadians the government says received benefits — such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) — in error.

The government has been withholding tax refunds and other benefits in an effort to recoup money sent to individuals it says were ineligible for the funds they received. The CRA told CBC News that at the end of last year it had collected roughly $1.8 billion in erroneous pandemic benefit payments.

But many Canadians have disputed the government's assessment of their eligibility for those benefits and hundreds have even taken the government to court .

The CRA told CBC News that as of April it has reversed the debts of roughly 27000 individuals who originally had been deemed ineligible but later had their eligibility verified.

Those figures only include pandemic benefits that were administered by the CRA. A portion of the CERB program was administered by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC); that department told CBC News it doesn't track how many benefit debts it has reversed.

The CRA told CBC News that as of April of this year it has reversed the debts of roughly 27000 individuals who had originally been deemed ineligible but later had their eligibility verified. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

Cris Best a Toronto tax lawyer said he's not surprised by the number of debt cancellations that have been issued. He said he's heard from several Canadians who believe they've been unfairly targeted by eligibility reviews.

""There's no doubt in my mind that there's a lot of inconsistency"" he said.

Canadians who have received a notice from the government stating that their eligibility has been revoked are able to ask for two reviews of their case. After that point their only recourse is through the courts.

Best said it's extremely difficult to argue a case with the CRA once an initial decision has been made because there is ""a reverse onus in tax law.""

""You're essentially guilty before innocent"" he said.

""The CRA can essentially assume facts which is what they do and then the taxpayer bears the burden to disprove those facts … It's not a very fair fight.""

Some people frustrated by review process

Jason Harth said he experienced the difficulty of dealing with the CRA when trying to help his daughter argue her case.

""It was a muck"" he said of the process.

The Cambridge Ont. resident said his daughter applied for CERB when she was laid off during the pandemic. She was able to find new employment roughly nine months later.

But roughly a year later Harth said his daughter started receiving notices saying her eligibility was under review. He helped his daughter provide the proper documentation to prove that she was eligible.

Harth said that after working with the CRA they found that his daughter had received a few extra CERB payments which they agreed to repay.

I don't understand how something so simple could go so wrong - Jason Harth Cambridge Ont.

But when a final notice came a few weeks later he said the eligibility assessment said the complete opposite. It indicated that she was eligible for the extra payments she received but not the money she was given for the time she had been laid off.

""I'm thinking 'Somebody didn't read this right'"" Harth said recalling the final assessment.

Harth said he and his daughter contacted the agency a number of times but were told there was nothing to be done and that she would need to repay $16000.

The issue wasn't resolved until Harth contacted the taxpayer's ombudsperson who he said reached out to him and the CRA directly.

""[The CRA] finally got off their butt and called us and said that 'Yes we see that there's been … a mistake.' But they didn't provide an explanation"" Harth said.

""I don't understand how something so simple could go so wrong.""

Kelly Stewart of Ottawa said the CRA also deemed her ineligible for the benefits she received despite her providing the agency with documents to prove otherwise.

""I just feel that my case from the very beginning has been handled very poorly"" she said.

Stewart said she had to send her documentation twice because the CRA said her first submission was lost in the agency's mail room. She also said the case numbers on the two decision notices she received don't match the original case number she was assigned.

A spokesperson for Minister of National Revenue Marie-Claude Bibeau said the department believes the validation process is going well.

""After the CRA sent out notices of redetermination to some individuals that were deemed to be ineligible many Canadians were able to demonstrate their eligibility with the proper documentation"" Simon Lafortune Bibeau's press secretary said in an email.

""We are more than satisfied with the CRA's validation process on this matter and will continue to ensure that all eligible Canadians receive the benefits they are entitled to.""

But Stewart said she is less than satisfied with how the process has gone so far.

""[It's] incredibly frustrating because it's so strange and it just really kind of damages whatever confidence I had left in this process"" she said.

Stewart said she intends to seek a judicial review of the CRA's decision on her case.

Even though his daughter's issue was resolved in the end Harth was equally unimpressed with how the tax agency handled the situation.

""The whole review just left me questioning the integrity of the agency due to the inappropriate handling of the situation"" Harth said.

""They made it very difficult."""

UnionPay provides bank card services and major card schemes which enable bank customers to conduct fast cashless transactions across the world.

Founded in 2002 under a charter from the People’s Bank of China UnionPay is the only domestic bank card organisation in China issuing more cards than Visa and Mastercard combined reports say.

Speaking during the consolidation of its partnership with Post Bank in Kampala Luping Zhang the general manager UnionPay International Africa branch said its ties with Post Bank will lead to 100% acceptance of UnionPay cards in Uganda.

“In this market we are also going to work with DTB Bank to roll out post terminals. After that we can achieve almost 100% acceptance in Uganda” Zhang said.

PostBank entered into the partnership in 2018. So far the bank has issued out 200000 UnionPay cards officials say.

China has been trying to secure greater market access for Africa to further cement its trade ties.

Already UnionPay has pushed its acceptance network in over 61 countries with an estimated 8.4 billion cards issued globally.

Zhang says in Africa UnionPay is present in 50 countries with cards issued locally in 11 countries.

DTB and PostBank will lead UnionPay card issuance in Uganda.

PostBank managing director Julius Kakeeto said: “We want as many Ugandans as possible to access affordable and sustainable financial services. The UnionPay card is only part of the long journey in trying to improve access and reduce the cost of banking services” he said.

According to statistics from the central bank Uganda’s trade with the leading import source China has grown from $768m in the financial year 2015/16 to $1b in 2019/20.

Major imports from China include footwear iron and steel plastics machinery among others.

UnionPay’s entry into the market comes amid increased competition with Visa and MasterCard as well as other global payment card issuers.

Given the growing trade between Uganda and China UnionPay will most likely rob Visa and MasterCard fee income in cross-border payments.

Data from the Bank of Uganda shows that the value of payments made using debit cards increased from sh670.3b in 2019 to about sh3.2 trillion in 2020 with the exponential growth partly attributed to actions taken by players in the financial sector including the promotion of the usage of cashless transactions as a measure to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission to customers and the public.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZy5tb25leXNtYXJ0LnNnL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy9wb3NiLWV2ZXJ5ZGF5LWNhcmQtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,POSB Everyday Card - MoneySmart Singapore Review 2022,"The POSB Everyday Card looks like a plain ol’ auntie card but don’t be fooled by its ho hum exterior.

Who should use the POSB Everyday Card?

There are some credit cards that are for atas people who drive Aston Martins and drink black truffle lattes. Not this card. The POSB Everyday Card is for average Singaporeans who eat cai png not “protein bowls” from Saladstop or similar shops.

In short it’s best for thrifty Singaporeans who don’t mind doing their shopping for necessities at Sheng Siong and Redmart. You get a pretty decent cashback of 5% to 8% on these everyday items without any pressure to spend.

Additionally because there’s no cashback cap for petrol it’s great for those who spend a lot on petrol like sales agents or those who need to drive around a lot for work. Get 6% cash rebate on the final charge amount after any other applicable discounts).

(Those with a Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational License (PDVL) are better off with the newly introduced Esso Private Hire Smiles Card instead. Read more about the 3 best credit cards for petrol here.)

That companion ticket will cover the cost of a companion ticket so long as you pay the $99 fee and cover the additional fees and taxes. (Sometimes the $99 fee requirement is waived.)

This is a major difference because with a companion fare like the one attached to the Alaska card you can get several hundred dollars in value.

But this companion benefit is limited to a $100 discount. It almost works in the opposite fashion so don’t get confused by that.

Tip: Use WalletFlo for all your credit card needs. It’s free and will help you optimize your rewards and savings!

Is the companion voucher worth it?

In order to receive the benefit you’ll have to spend $5000 in your anniversary year.

$5000 is a pretty low spend requirement for an annual bonus as they typically require much higher spend often starting around $15000 to $20000 a year. Some even go as high as $75000 plus!

So the spend requirement for this perk is very low.

The value of this benefit maxes out at $100 since it does not offer you a free fare so it makes calculating your value proposition very easy.

The annual fee for the Free Spirit MasterCard is $79 so a single use of this discount allows you to come out on top in terms of value which can make this credit card a keeper.

And that is without factoring in the use of other card benefits like the priority boarding 25% rebate on in-flight purchases etc.

The big thing to keep in mind is the opportunity cost here though.

You could always put $5000 worth of spend to a welcome bonus requirement for a much more lucrative reward.

For example if you were to spend $4000 to earn something like a 60000 point bonus of Chase Ultimate Rewards that could easily net you over $700 in travel.

So you could spend less and receive much more in value (like 7X or more). However that would require opening up a new credit card account and not everybody is always in the market for doing that.

So if you regularly spend over $5000 on this card then getting a $100 discount is a nice perk especially if you have plans to regularly fly with Spirit every year.

Arrival time

If your account is open with active charging privileges on your account anniversary date you will receive the companion voucher code via email within the first billing cycle after the anniversary each year.

Because this is such a new benefit we don’t have data on exactly how long this benefit takes to arrive.

Restrictions

Eligible credit card

In order to receive the benefit your primary fare and the companion fare must be purchased with your Free Spirit MasterCard.

(You’ll also receive 3X the points on your airfare so there is an extra incentive to use your card for your ticket.)

The traveling guest must be on the same itinerary and the booking must take place at the same time directly on Spirit.com.

Expiration

You must use your companion flight voucher code within 12 months of the date of issue.

The great thing about this benefit is that the travel may be completed after the expiration date of the voucher code.

Unfortunately your expiration date cannot be extended and once the voucher code has expired it cannot be exchanged.

If for some reason your credit card is closed or you cancel your credit card you will no longer be eligible to receive the benefit.

You also can not use this code on award to travel vacation packages or tours nor can you combine it with other airfare discounts.

Once you have met the minimum spend requirement for the benefit and after your anniversary date passes you will receive your voucher code via email to the email address associated with the primary card holder’s account.

If for some reason you do not receive it simply call the customer service number on the back of your credit card to get it re-sent.

It is possible that the terms may have more restrictions such as blackout dates or routing rules.

However as I mentioned this is such a new benefit that we will have to wait until we get more data on the terms and how those terms are applied.

Final word

Overall this is a somewhat mediocre benefit but it’s a great way to offset your entire annual fee if you hold his card. For someone who regularly flies with Spirit I think it makes sense to take advantage of this benefit.

Her home in North Dallas was in the path of the October 2019 tornadoes. Then she discovered in January 2020 that her doctor had been trying for two months to reach her for a serious talk.

That’s when she decided to step down as CEO of Dallas-based Match Group a company she spent 14 years helping to build.

“My doctor wanted to fire me as a patient because I didn’t listen to my voicemails” said Ginsberg 51. But the wife and mother of two daughters had been busy. Four days after the family’s house was destroyed Match Group was reporting earnings.

“We didn’t have a place to live” she said “but the quarter was good.”

Ginsberg describes herself as a “heads-down operator” who rolls up her sleeves and works with teams. She was used to spending 40 weeks a year on a plane as Match Group built a worldwide business.

“I had to reevaluate” she said. “Should I transition out?”

The decision was easier because Match was performing well she said and she would be succeeded by a woman. Ginsberg calls her successor Match CEO Shar Dubey her “closest friend in the world.”

Shar Dubey has been CEO of Match Group since March 1 2020. (Match Group)

The two had advanced together at Match as management partners with Dubey on the technology side and Ginsberg in marketing and operations. “We’re a Venn diagram. Our skill sets are different but our values are the same” Ginsberg said.

A year later Ginsberg a Dallas native who broke through in the male-dominated technology world to become a CEO twice — at Match and earlier at the Princeton Review and Tutor.com — is writing her next chapter. In her words she’s “having a blast.”

Houses are replaceable and last month her family moved into a new one also in Dallas. Last week she joined the board of thredUP the online consignment and thrift store company.

She’s also dealt with her health issue.

Ten years earlier Ginsberg chose to have a preventive double mastectomy due to a high risk of breast cancer.

Her doctor was trying to reach her last January to tell Ginsberg that her implants had to be removed as soon as possible. They had been recalled after being linked to cancer.

Ginsberg decided to be open about her health when she announced her resignation Jan. 28 2020. The week before she had the second surgery. She shared the details in a memo to Match Group’s 2000 employees believing it might help others.

Her openness motivated several people at the company to get tested. Seven women discovered they were positive for the BRCA1 gene she said meaning they too had a higher risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.

Both her mother and aunt died from ovarian cancer and it was her mother’s cancer diagnosis that brought Ginsberg at the time a single mom back to Dallas. The 1988 graduate of The Hockaday School grew up in Preston Hollow.

After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley in 1992 she had gone to live in Tel Aviv and then moved back to California and to Pennsylvania to get an MBA at Wharton.

“I never thought I would come back to Dallas but it was the best decision of my life” she said. “I didn’t realize how much was here and what an exciting time it was to be here. And now I never thought people in New York and California would be jealous that I live in such a great place.”

She doesn’t rule out being a CEO again someday but says that’s not her current goal. She was a director of J.C. Penney from 2015 until late last year when the board was dissolved after Penney was sold as part of its bankruptcy reorganization.

So she knows firsthand the challenges of the retail business. She says her daughters are educating her about the secondhand market behind thredUP. They’re both thrift shoppers — her almost 13-year-old is into retro fashion and her 22-year-old prefers it for environmental reasons.

Patricia Nakache general partner at California-based Trinity Ventures and chairwoman of thredUP takes credit for bringing Ginsberg onto the thredUP board. Years ago they had worked together on the board of Care.com a family services company.

“She was one of those people you meet in your career and say ‘I want to work with that person again sometime’” Nakache said.

ThredUP’s parallels to Match make Ginsberg “a terrific match” Nakache said. “She understands the demographic of Gen Z and has demystified online dating. The shift in public perception is a remarkable thing. That’s happening now with thrift shopping.”

Match Group a $2.4 billion-a-year business with eight brands including Hinge OKCupid and OurTime says 40% of relationships now start online and the stigma of online dating has fallen away.

Likewise forces such as environmental concerns and other trends are making secondhand purchases more mainstream. GlobalData forecasted that the secondhand market will hit $64 billion by 2024 from $28 billion in 2019 and overtake the traditional thrift and donations channels.

ThredUP has expanded from an online-only business into providing resale as a service to other retailers including Walmart.com and Macy’s and earlier at J.C. Penney. The idea is to help traditional retailers plug into the resale business and grow consumer demand.

Ginsberg says she cleaned out her closet recently and filled one of thredUP’s signature white and green polka dot bags. She took it to the post office expecting to have to explain what it was. But the clerk was unfazed and told her they get them all the time.

Ginsberg said she was attracted to the thredUP board because it’s mission-based. “I saw the passion for the business in [CEO] James Reinhart. If you can’t help the world why bother?”

Secondhand can have a bigger place in the market she said. It’s an alternative to fast fashion and it’s not a new idea that “one person’s trash is gold to someone else.”

At Match Ginsberg was in the business of helping people find each other and now she says she realizes that “I haven’t done anything but work.” She’s concentrating on other parts of her life including rediscovering her hometown where she has a lot of family and seeing it through a different lens.

“Dallas is an incredible community with a lot of philanthropy” she said. She speaks Spanish and has helped translate at the Hope Clinic in McKinney and the COVID-19 megacenter at Fair Park.

Ginsberg is also on the board of Uber Technologies and said that being exposed to other companies that are disrupting markets and where “the sky’s the limit is so much fun.”

She’s not ruling out running a company again someday and she believes it’s only a matter of time until women have parity in the C-suite.

At Match Ginsberg said she and Dubey were able to attract “rock star female talent.”

In fact Ginsberg was sued for recruiting Dubey after they had met at a previous job. The lawsuit was settled and over the next 12 years the professional acquaintances formed a leadership partnership and became friends.

At the beginning they were the only two women in senior positions at Match. “We ended up hiring a lot of women and they now make up 38% of leadership” a high number for a technology company. Ginsberg over the years also led a pay equity audit at the company.

“People say it’s very lonely at the top but we didn’t feel that way. We were in it together” Dubey said. They still talk multiple times a week.

Ginsberg is convinced the technology business will transition the same way medicine did over the past 50 years.

She tells her daughters Maya 12 and Talia 22 they can become anything they want.

“I think one day my kids and grandkids will be surprised to find out that there used to be a lot more men CEOs than women” Ginsberg said.

After nearly a year of wafting through the waters of pandemic dating the wormholes of Tinder Bumble Hinge and all the other mainstay apps — you may be sick of it.

Endless scrolling has its cons. The world is theoretically your oyster but you're also left to wade through your entire region's population. Your thumbs and your brain are weary from seeing the same userface and the same Office pickup lines over and over. Seeing as we're still stuck indoors you still have to meet online — but that doesn't mean you can't try something new.

Newer dating apps can be hit or miss. On one hand they cater to a smaller user base — which could be great if you're among like-minded company. On another you don't have nearly the amount of options you do with an app with over 50 million users like Tinder . Keeping these potential benefits and risks in mind here are some fresh dating app options:

jigsaw personality-led dating app Credit: jigsaw jigsaw personality-led dating app Credit: jigsaw

If you're especially tired of the HOTorNOT-style of swiping Jigsaw may be for you. Self-described as ""anti-superficial dating"" Jigsaw doesn't even let you see your match before you have a conversation. The app places a puzzle over a potential match's face and the pieces only fall away through exchanging messages. Jigsaw is currently available in New York and London with more U.S. cities coming soon .

You can download Jigsaw for iOS on the Apple App Store and for Android on the Google Play Store.

S'More has a similar pushback to the usual swipe model. Like the campfire dessert S'More wants to offer its users ""Something More."" Similar to Jigsaw it conceals people's faces — only on S'More the photos are blurred. Each day users can pick eight profiles to view. Profiles include icons such as what that person is looking for what turns them on what's their zodiac sign and the like. The more matches message each other the more the photos unblur. For these stay-at-home times S'More even has blurred video calls  where the first two of five minutes of conversation are blurred. All S'More users need selfie verification so there's no worries about catfishing.

You can download S'More for iOS on the Apple App Store. According to their FAQ an Android app is coming soon.

Chekmate is another app reworking how we date online. Chekmate was founded during the pandemic and is meant to bridge the gap between online and offline dating by being text-free. Instead users communicate solely through voice and video messages. If matches are comfortable meeting in person the app suggests local venues and users can send invites to each other; considering the coronavirus trends in the U.S. that may have to wait awhile — but it could make post-vaccine dates that much sweeter.

You can download Chekmate for iOS on the Apple App Store.

Chorus is also trying to blur the lines of app and in-person dating though in a completely different way than Chekmate. Chorus lets users invite a friend to play matchmaker and swipe for you; the only swiping on Chorus is done by the user's friends. Pals can also give feedback on your profile and comment on matches. Since the pandemic hit the app added a ""roulette"" option where users opt-in and are paired on a spontaneous five-minute blind video date.

You can download Chorus for iOS on the Apple App Store and for Android on the Google Play Store.

For a similar experience the dating app Ship also lets friends swipe for you.

nuit astrology dating app Credit: nuit nuit astrology dating app Credit: nuit

NUiT is an astrological dating app that uses much more than one's sun sign (the ""main"" sign based on your birthday) to calculate compatibility. According to the app's lead astrologer Haley Comet NUiT uses a complex algorithm that takes other factors into consideration such as natal charts which are diagrams that display the sun moon and planetary positions at the time of one's birth. NUiT also received recognition among the queer community for a feature I haven't seen on any other app: An option to not see or be seen by straight people. For astrology lovers — especially those who are queer — NUiT can result in a star-aligned match.

You can download NUiT for iOS on the Apple App Store and for Android on the Google Play Store.

While having children or being forward about wanting them may scare those trolling for hookups on Tinder but it's heybaby's bread and butter . The dating app is specifically for parents or wannabe parents thus cutting through potential awkwardness of bringing up kids. When users sign up for heybaby they answer a round of questions about their (would-be) parenting style plans for the future and more.

Cricket Australia introduced three new rules ahead of the tenth edition of Big Bash League in an attempt to drive interest throughout the course of a T20 game and to add new strategic angles to the game in its entirety. Cricbuzz looks into how the rules have fared at the end of the season and if has they served their purpose.

Power Surge

The 'Power Surge' will consist of a two-over period where the fielding side is allowed only two fielders outside the inner ring. The batting side can take it at any given time from the 11th over of the innings onwards. Meanwhile the Powerplay at the start of the innings has been reduced to four overs.

Thunder was the best batting side of the tournament by a distance and it reflected in the Power Surge stats. Thunder scored at 12.74 in the Power Surge overs which is well ahead of the second placed Scorchers. Renegades the weakest batting side of the season were the only side to score below 10 per over in Power Surge and their conservative approach is backed by the fact that they lost the fewest wickets in this phase (nine). In terms of economy rate Scorchers were the best side conceding at 9.43 runs per over which gives them a rate differential (run rate - economy rate) of 2.64 the best among all sides in the season. Scorchers were closely followed by Stars who scored at 11.59 and conceded at 9.44 per over giving them a positive differential of 2.15 second best behind Scorchers.

Despite this Stars finished second last in the league phase and failed to qualify for the knockouts. Interestingly Sixers who finished on top of the league phase and were the eventual champions has had the worst of Power Surge stats - they picked the second fewest wickets and had the worst economy rate while their run rate was only the fifth best giving them a rate differential of -2.10 the worst among all teams.

Power Surge stats

Team Wkts lost Run rate (RR) Wkts taken Eco rate (ER) Diff (RR-ER) Scorchers 11 12.06 15 9.43 2.64 Stars 14 11.59 21 9.44 2.15 Thunder 14 12.74 10 11.48 1.26 Strikers 14 10.01 14 10.45 -0.44 Hurricanes 20 10.11 11 10.98 -0.87 Heat 14 10.58 14 11.60 -1.02 Renegades 9 9.04 12 10.58 -1.53 Sixers 12 10.57 11 12.67 -2.10

The two innings which saw the two highest Power Surge scores underlined the very purpose of the new concept. In the encounter between Stars against Sixers in Gold Coast Glenn Maxwell and Nicholas Pooran scored 49/0 which revived their innings from 80/4 after 12 overs to an eventual total of 193. Power Surge infused momentum to Stars' innings which resulted them scoring 113 runs in the last eight overs after being 80/4 after 12 overs.

The second highest came when the match looked all but over as Heat struggled at 71/8 after 14 overs chasing 150 against Strikers in Brisbane. The unlikely pair of Jimmy Pierson and Mujeeb-ur-Rahman hit 43 off the two Power Surge overs to put the unlikely chase back on track which they eventually lost by two runs. It was another tick mark for the Power Surge concept as it injected life to a faltering run chase which paved way for a thrilling last over finish.

Of the 107 uninterrupted innings there were 60 times instances of batting teams opting to take the Power Surge at the start of 15th 16th or 17th over. Chasing teams preferred to use the Surge more often between overs 11 and 15 either to finish off chases quickly - to boost the net run rate - or to get a move on in a run chase. Teams batting first played it more conservatively and delayed the Surge to 15th over or beyond so as not lose wickets in a heap in search of quick runs leaving them too little at their disposal towards the end.

Power Surge Overs

The idea of Power Surge did change the dynamics of both batting and bowling sides considerably. Batting sides would hold it back until the big hitters arrive and get set. The fall of wickets too have had a say in when teams opted for it as teams favoured to take it only with two set batsmen in the middle. It often infused momentum into some stuttering innings and revived fortunes in other cases. Power Surge emerged the biggest winner of the three new rules and it is here to stay.

Sixers finished with nine Bash Boost points (equivalent to three outright wins) ©Getty

Bash Boost

The 'Bash Boost' is a bonus point given midway through the second innings. The side that is chasing down the target will be awarded with the bonus point ""if they're above the equivalent 10-over score of their opposition"". However if the team that is chasing is behind at the 10-over mark the fielding side will be awarded with the point. A team can now score four points every game as the points awarded for a win in general has been increased to three points from two previously.

The concept of Bash Boost points was introduced to create mini-battles midway through the run-chase. In the league standings teams finished in the order of wins with Bash Boost points accumulated playing little part in determining the final league standings. Table toppers Sixers finished with nine Bash Boost points (equivalent to three outright wins) while wooden spoon holders Renegades could muster only four. Without the Boost Points Strikers would have finished fourth followed by Hurricanes at fifth and Heat at sixth but the additional Boost Point helped Heat to finish ahead of both Strikers and Hurricanes. As a result Hurricanes missed out a Finals spot while Heat qualified and secured a home game at the Gabba for the Eliminator clash against Strikers. The three teams at the top of the league phase points table as well as the bottom two would have finished at the same spots had Boost Points been not there.

Of the 55 matches where Bash Boost points was awarded nearly 75% of those went to teams which ended as the eventual winners (41).

The concept was the biggest talking point in the final league game between Sixers and Stars when both sides required the Bash Boost point. Sixers needed just a solitary point from the match for securing a home finals fixture while Stars required all four points on offer to progress to further rounds. Stars batted first and their approach looked muddled when they made only 72 in the first ten overs compared to 105 runs in the ten overs in the backend. Instead of front loading the big hitters Stars held them back - a strategy which heavily backfired and in the end cost Stars a win.

Bash Boost points did offer chasing teams something to play for when they lost early wickets in tall chases. In the first week Strikers were six down inside nine overs chasing 175 and aimed for Bash Boost points with the win definitely out of reach. Renegades followed the same route in a couple of chases and bagged a point against Scorchers when they need five off the tenth over for Bash Boost points with the last two wickets standing and the final target being a distant 186. Whether Renegades deserved a point from that particular match is a debatable question one that might be probably introspected ahead of the next season.

The only occasion where the lure for Bash Boost points derailed as run chase came towards the end of the season when Thunder aimed for it with 12 required of the tenth over with the pair of Usman Khawaja and Callum Fergusson well set and nine wickets still in the bank. Thunder lost both set batsmen missed the target at halfway mark and the chase lost its momentum as Thunder finished six runs short of the final target losing out on all four points on offer.

While the concept of Bash Boost points did create some drama mid innings the approach by some teams towards it looked confused at times as Stars in the final league game when the one Boost point was as important as the win itself. The rule should come into its own over the next few seasons with teams coming up with well thought strategies on how to approach it. The coming seasons could throw up interesting scenarios where teams could finish higher on the points table with the help of more Bash Boost points despite fewer outright wins.

X-factor

The 'X-factor Player' who is named as the 12th or 13th player can get into the game at the 10th over of the first innings replacing any player who is yet to bat or has bowled no more than a single over.

Of the three new rules X-factor found the fewest takers in the inaugural edition. The reasons could be the lack of options - unavailability of many of domestic players at the start of the season who were either with the national team or A-team taking on the visiting Indian team as well as the absence of several high-profile overseas signings reducing the 12th and 13th option to grade cricketers often. Teams activated X-factor sub more often towards the end of the season with wider pool of players to choose from.

Of the 118 possible instances teams activated X-factor sub only 24 times two of those being injured forced substitutions. Heat used it most times (eight) followed by Hurricanes (four) while Scorchers activated it only when Mitchell Marsh was injured in the game against Hurricane in Perth. The players brought in also made little impact in the eventual outcome of the game. Of the 20 instances there was just one score of 30+ and one innings where a bowler picked two or more wickets.

From what we saw in the season X-factor sub slightly favoured teams which fielded first with as many as 20 of the 24 substitutions were made by sides bowling first. One pattern which emerged as the season progressed was the sides bowling first would often use a swing bowler upfront in the first innings to see if there is any movement in the air on offer and if not replace him with a death overs specialist who could also be more adept in the latter half of the innings with the prospect of bowling an over in the Power Surge. Heat substituted out Xavier Barlett in four matches after bowling the first over while Morne Morkel was brought in four times who was a specialist bowler for the death and Surge overs.

Given the rule as it stands sides batting first could bring in an additional batsman either when there is a collapse by the midway stage of the innings or when they are staring down a big chase. Only once did a team lose five wickets at the halfway mark and the highest first innings total after 10 overs was only 109 which probably prevented batting teams from triggering X-factor sub option often. In the second league game against Sixers Hurricanes batting activated X-factor sub replacing Peter Handscomb with big hitting Tim David when they were 91 without loss after ten overs batting first and needed David's raw power for a big finish. In the Eliminator final Strikers bought in batsman Jono Wells after the initial XI had as many six proper bowling options one of the rare case of teams admitting a selection failure in the first place. The timing of the substitutions (10th over in first innings) at times proves too early to call in a replacement especially for the batting side and a possible tweak that can be added to the rule ahead of the next season.

The rules succeeded to a large extent in what the organizers were looking for creating mid-innings showdowns and it would only be a matter of time before it brings in more strategic and tactical thinking as teams are still getting a feel of it. The new rules have certainly added a layer of interest to the proceedings and at times dictated the rhythm of innings in the second half. And for that alone they deserve a longer run.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3NucC1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1wdWxscy1vdXQtb2YtcmFjZS0xMzEzMDMwMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC9zbnAtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VyLWdyYWVtZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcHVsbHMtb3V0LW9mLXJhY2UtMTMxMzAzMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Swinney set to become next SNP leader and Scottish first minister as rival quits race,"John Swinney appears set to become Scotland's next first minister after Graeme McCormick pulled out of the race to become SNP leader.

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months"" he said.

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

""I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.""

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzL2N4eDg2NDR5OTh3b9IBNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzL2N4eDg2NDR5OTh3by5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Swinney warns of SNP rebuild delay if leader bid challenged,"Last year Mr Swinney told the BBC’s Nicola Sturgeon podcast that he had been trying to stand down from government since 2016.

However he said he had been persuaded to run on this occasion after discussions with his family.

He chose not to run in 2023 as he felt ""tired and drained"" after a number of years in important roles but that he was feeling refreshed after a year out of the cabinet.

Mr Swinney said: ""I thought it was time for other people to take leading roles… I thought I’d done my bit.""

However he said he now had ""peace of mind"" that running would be the ""right thing to do for me and my family and my party and my country.""

The Perthshire North MSP added that he was confident he would deliver independence and that he would aim to do this through ""reasoned conversation"".

Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said it was ""laughable"" that Mr Swinney wanted to take conflict out of a push for independence.

He said: ""Scotland needs a first minister focused on the public’s real priorities – fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy – not one fixated on dividing the nation just to pacify the warring SNP.""

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP were a ""divided and chaotic"" political party who had ""broken the trust"" of Scottish people.

He told The Sunday Show that Mr Swinney was managing his party and its ""decline"" rather than focusing on the priorities of people in Scotland.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktZmlyc3QtbWluaXN0ZXItc2NvdGxhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to thwart John Swinney's bid to be first minister with own leadership run,"Mr Swinney has pitched himself as a unity candidate following Mr Yousaf’s disastrous tenure in charge of the SNP.

Last week he persuaded his only viable challenger Ms Forbes not to stand in exchange for a “significant” role in government.

“My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP” Mr Swinney said. “So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had.

“Every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding. And I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.”

Should Mr McCormick win enough support to force a contest a programme of hustings would take place.

While the former deputy first minister would not be obliged to attend sources close to him said they expected that he would “respect the process” and debate Mr McCormick.

However a leadership contest could be expensive for the cash-strapped party with last year’s election to replace Nicola Sturgeon costing the party £160000.

‘SNP must build more support for independence’

SNP headquarters will check signatures on physical forms on Monday. Anyone who has submitted nominations will be checked to ensure their membership is still in date with the result expected in the afternoon.

If there is no contest Mr Swinney would be elected as SNP leader unopposed and likely be voted in as first minister on Tuesday.

In a speech at the SNP party conference last year Mr McCormick described the SNP-run Scottish Government as “flatulence in a trance”.

Mr Swinney said on Sunday that his party had to build more support for independence and admitted that it was not currently a “compelling proposition” for most Scots.

He said: “So what I think our priority has got to be is to spend less time discussing the mechanics and the thresholds of independence but to start winning the arguments about why independence is an absolute necessity for people in Scotland.”

Craig Hoy the Scottish Tory chairman said Scots would be “dismayed but not surprised” to hear that “independence remains John Swinney’s overriding priority”.

He added: “Scotland needs a first minister focused on the public’s real priorities – fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy – not one fixated on dividing the nation just to pacify the warring SNP.

“It’s laughable of John Swinney to say he wants to take the ‘conflict’ out of the push for independence. The only way to do that is to drop it and concentrate on the issues that matter to Scots.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1hYmFuZG9ucy1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWJpZC1hbmQtZW5kb3JzZXMtam9obi1zd2lubmV50gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC9tYXkvMDUvc25wLWFjdGl2aXN0LWFiYW5kb25zLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtYmlkLWFuZC1lbmRvcnNlcy1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist abandons leadership bid and endorses John Swinney,"A Scottish National party activist has pulled out of the race to become its new leader and has endorsed John Swinney as Scotland’s next first minister.

Word travels fast within the massive web of franchisees employees and suppliers that make up McDonald's. So when a 2019 marketing presentation showed a burger recipe made with ""coon cheese"" it wasn't long before Jim Byrd a Black McDonald's operator who owns two locations in Tennessee was texted a photo from a fellow franchisee.

Chris Kempczinski who was the US president of McDonald's at the time and is now its CEO apologized for the recipe which originated in Australia. (The Australian brand Coon Cheese got its name from the cheese maker Edward William Coon not the dehumanizing anti-Black slur and recently announced it would change its name after criticism.)

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The ""coon cheese"" reference. Insider

Byrd thought the incident revealed larger problems. Dozens of Black corporate staff and franchisees had disappeared from McDonald's in recent years.

""It makes you start to look at or wonder about the leadership and who's in the room"" Byrd told Insider in 2019. ""You start looking around and there's no representation.""

Last October Byrd and his brother became the named plaintiffs in a class lawsuit made up of Black franchisees suing McDonald's over racial discrimination. The lawsuit was at least the fifth major discrimination suit filed against McDonald's in 2020.

Black restaurant workers said they were called ""ghetto."" Two Black executives alleged that a coworker in the corporate office used the N-word while another criticized ""angry Black women."" Former franchisees are seeking more than $1 billion in damages saying the company sent them on ""financial suicide missions.""

As McDonald's was battered by racial-discrimination suits the company publicly backed the Black Lives Matter movement matching support with new hires and donations. (McDonald's declined to comment on the record on the ""coon cheese"" incident.)

Insider spoke with more than a dozen current and former McDonald's franchisees and corporate executives in the past year to understand the company's work around racial equity in light of discrimination allegations.

Insiders said events that took place in 2020 helped bring about a racial reckoning at McDonald's. The company had new leadership with an avowed focus on values corporate America was grappling with its role in enforcing white supremacy and Black insiders at McDonald's were ready to speak out.

And while there are signs of progress some insiders said McDonald's new guard still needs to back its words with more actions.

'Black lives matter' at McDonald's

After the police killing of George Floyd McDonald's took unprecedented actions.

It released a solemn video listing the names of Black people killed by police or in incidents of racist violence. It ended with the words ""Black lives matter."" The video was coupled with a million-dollar donation to the National Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

Behind the scenes McDonald's executives sounded equally determined to take a stand according to an internal systemwide webcast in early June a recording of which Insider viewed.

""There were some who responded to my note who suggested that we should simply stay out of it"" Joe Erlinger the head of the US business said on the webcast in reference to McDonald's support for Black Lives Matter.

He went on: ""That's not the type of leader that I am and that's not the type of brand that McDonald's should be. . . . Being silent is not an option. We must lead. We cannot go back to business as usual.""

In June McDonald's created a global advisory council on diversity equity and inclusion building an international plan to craft consistent but locally relevant policies and programs. In July the company announced plans to establish ""time-bound commitments"" to diversity including recruiting more diverse franchisees.

In the fall it made big-name hires including former Obama advisor Katie Beirne Fallon who became McDonald's first chief global impact officer and Reggie Miller who was tapped as the global chief diversity equity and inclusion officer.

""We cannot be complacent"" Miller told Insider in an email interview in January. ""There is no end date on progress needed to ensure equality for all. We need top-down and bottom-up accountability engagement and shared responsibility to drive change.""

While some said they felt the efforts were helping others told Insider they were less convinced.

Critics remain skeptical of McDonald's efforts

Among the skeptics is Jim Ferraro an attorney representing current and former Black McDonald's franchisees in two racial-discrimination suits seeking more than $1 billion in damages.

Black former franchisees connected with Ferraro in early 2020 following an Insider investigation into inequalities at McDonald's. The investigation found that locations owned by Black franchisees netted $68000 less a month on average than McDonald's overall franchisee average. Black franchisees said they were not offered the same opportunities as their white counterparts but faced stricter expectations.

Ferraro told Insider his team presented McDonald's with a draft of the complaint in early June with the possibility of settling out of court. That's when McDonald's launched its ""huge PR campaign"" he said. In addition to its donations and pledges the company began renegotiating Black franchisees' rent deals behind the scenes people with direct knowledge said.

""They're doing all these things because they want the current operators to become their allies but they're buying them off"" Ferraro said.

Worker-advocacy groups said they were similarly skeptical.

In 2020 McDonald's came under fire in light of workers' safety concerns during the pandemic lack of paid sick leave and sexual-harassment allegations. Karesha Manns a McDonald's worker in Memphis Tennessee argued in a January opinion column that fast-food workers' wages were a question of racial justice. She wrote that ""raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would increase wages for nearly 40% of Black workers."" Restaurant workers in Florida and Illinois sued McDonald's saying they faced racial discrimination on the job.

Deatric Edie a McDonald's worker involved in the Service Employees International Union-backed Fight for $15 campaign said in June that McDonald's ""cannot be against 'systemic oppression'"" when its ""policies force hundreds of thousands of Black and Brown workers to live in poverty.""

Related stories

""You cannot claim to be against 'inequity injustice and racism' while lobbying against paid sick days during a pandemic putting profits ahead of workers' safety ignoring sexual harassment and fighting efforts of Black and Brown workers to join together in a union"" Edie's statement went on.

McDonald's is aware of criticism — but is it doing enough?

McDonald's has said it's committed to greater investments in workers. Petar Kujundzic/Reuters

Because 95% of McDonald's locations in the US are owned by franchisees the company does not directly control the vast majority of workers' wages or benefits such as sick leave. But the chain has committed to focusing its 2021 investments in supporting workers in franchised locations.

""As you've heard us say before for many years McDonald's had two distinct faces"" Miller said. ""One was that of a big global corporation. The other was that of the McDonald's you grew up with where you know your order know your server and feel at home. The distinction between the corporate and consumer brand doesn't exist today.""

The money netted by Black franchisees on average continued to improve through 2020 against McDonald's overall franchisees' average a source with knowledge confirmed to Insider.

Still some insiders — including individuals involved in the discrimination lawsuits — said they did not trust McDonald's to address racial discrimination if the chain does not acknowledge past grievances. The company denied allegations made in three racial-discrimination suits filed in 2020 two of which were filed by franchisees and one that was filed by former McDonald's executives Vicki Guster-Hines and Domineca Neal.

""We will defend against these lawsuits even as we move forward with the actions needed to foster an environment where equitable opportunity is part of the lived experience for McDonald's franchisees suppliers and employees"" Miller said.

All three complaints connect allegations of racist incidents to the loss of Black leaders at McDonald's in recent years. According to the complaints Black franchisees and executives were routinely passed over for opportunities when Kempczinski was running the US business and Steve Easterbrook — who was ousted in November 2019— was CEO.

There were 186 Black McDonald's franchisees in 2020 down from 377 in 1998 according to the franchisees' complaint. In 2019 there were just seven Black corporate officers at McDonald's down from 42 in 2014 according to Guster-Hines and Neal's complaint.

McDonald's said the shifts were in line with wider restructuring. Nearly 30% of McDonald's current franchisees come from under-represented groups the company said. Half of its officers are from underrepresented populations and 17% are African American.

By comparison 11.6% of Starbucks' officers at the level of senior vice presidents or higher are Black. Just 6.3% of vice presidents at the coffee giant identify as Black a report released by Starbucks in October found.

McDonald's has a greater representation of Black officers in leadership than fellow corporate giant Walmart. A fourth of Walmart's officers are people of color and just 7% identify as Black or African American data from mid-2020 showed.

Black insiders who believe racial inequalities grew under Kempczinski and Easterbrook said leadership has failed to address its own shortcomings.

Neal and Guster-Hines said that they raised concerns over the lack of Black executives at McDonald's directly with Kempczinski but were ignored. According to their complaint in an April 2019 meeting to discuss the lack of African American representation in upper management Kempczinski ""stated point blank that the 'numbers don't matter.'""

The executives' complaint also highlighted the behavior of US West Zone President Charles Strong a named defendant in the case along with Easterbrook and Kempczinski.

In 2017 Neal said she was instructed by Strong not to consult with other African American women because they were ""too angry and aggressive"" with ""that Black-woman attitude."" Neal said that Strong later told staff and franchisees that she was ""angry"" which she said hurt her standing at the company.

Kempczinski Strong and Easterbrook did not respond to Insider's request for comment on the allegations. McDonald's said in a statement to Insider the allegations in the lawsuit specifically as they related to Kempczinski and Strong were inaccurate.

When asked for comment on direct quotes from the lawsuit McDonald's said in a statement that ""this reporting is demonstrative of a pattern of bias and an unchecked willingness to report falsehoods and half-truths in an effort to incite controversy.""

""Even from Business Insider we would expect more"" McDonald's statement continued.

McDonald's representatives declined to provide further context or evidence to disprove the allegations in the lawsuit on the record.

Strong continued to serve as one of McDonald's top executives in the US through 2020. McDonald's confirmed that Strong announced his retirement in January after more than 50 years at the company.

McDonald's board has also come under fire for inaction around racial discrimination as well as Easterbrook's alleged sexual misconduct. The activist investor CtW Investment Group is calling for McDonald's chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. who has been on the company's board for 24 years to be replaced.

""The board hasn't been able to take decisive action"" CtW executive director Dieter Waizenegger told Insider. ""Issues started to fester. They can erupt and create much larger crises further on.""

What does McDonald's believe in?

Within McDonald's people remain divided on how the company should approach racial equity and social justice. Some franchisees pushed back against what they see as a needless emphasis on politics and social justice in 2020. Others feel the company is not going far enough to root out racism within the system.

Still some are proud of what they see as McDonald's work to create positive change.

One member of the global people team which oversees diversity efforts told Insider that she felt her coworkers genuinely want to do the right thing on issues such as unconscious bias lifting up minority voices and creating opportunities. She said the team had sharpened its focus on diversity with the hiring of Heidi Capozzi as chief people officer in April.

""Companies are like people"" Vicki Chancellor the franchisee who leads McDonald's Operator's National Advertising (OPNAD) Fund told Insider in late August when asked about the company's approach to ethics and values more broadly.

""There may be a misstep but you don't judge them by that misstep"" said Chancellor McDonald's first Black OPNAD chair. ""You judge them on how they handle the misstep. And to me McDonald's is doing the right thing. And I know that they will continue to do the right thing.""

Diversity efforts can take time to succeed especially at a company like McDonald's that has roughly 40000 locations in more than 80 countries. However Americans are increasingly demanding more from McDonald's and other companies when it comes to racial justice.

Marcia Chatelain a Georgetown University professor and the author of ""Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America"" said that McDonald's and other brands assumed that tweeting ""Black Lives Matter"" would be enough to place them on the right side of history.

""What they probably didn't anticipate was we are at a moment where people ask for more"" Chatelain said. ""They ask for more than donations. They ask for more than diversity-pipeline programs. They ask for more than skillful marketing.

""They actually ask for racial and economic justice. And the way that McDonald's could actually do that work is to really focus on the critical mass of workers.""

With more than 850000 McDonald's workers in the US alone the company's policies shape not only the restaurant industry but the national workforce. Miller told Insider that the company was in the midst of intentional change.

""We spent the last year listening reflecting and strategizing about how to better run our business"" Miller said. ""We considered how from crew to C-suite we work as individuals and how our company interacts with the world.

""Now it is time to put thought and intention into action.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMzI4NTMwL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1tY2RvbmFsZHMtY29mZmVlLWNvbXBhcmVzLXRvLXN0YXJidWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How McDonald's Coffee Compares To Starbucks,"Here's How McDonald's Coffee Compares To Starbucks

Let's be honest: If you're a true coffee snob then chances are you're not pulling up to either of these drive-thrus anytime soon. We're willing to bet you keep your coffee local or maybe even make your own cold brew at home – any chance we can have a cup?

For the rest of us average amateur coffee-lovers who just need a caffeine fix to get by (or a snap of our Frappuccino to post on your Instagram story) there are plenty of fast casual options to grab a cup of joe.

Two of the most popular options in the U.S. are Starbucks – of course – and believe it or not McDonald's. The hamburger chain has grown in the decade since its introduction selling nearly 1 billion cups of coffee per year (via USA Today). That's nothing on Starbucks' 7 roughly billion cups (via CNBC) but it's substantial enough to make you wonder: Just how good is McCafé coffee after all?

The internet is quite divided on whether or not the taste of a McDonald's coffee outranks Starbucks. One Redditor said the fast food joint's coffee seemed watered down while others said it's at least better than the cheap stuff you'll find at a local gas station. A few even prefer it to Starbucks and said McDonald's offers ""an excellent brewed coffee"" that ""certainly kicks [Starbucks'] butt.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3RqYXJlZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNy9tY2RvbmFsZHMtc3VwZXItYm93bC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLTIwMjEtaXMtbGlrZS1hLWNhcnBvb2wta2FyYW9rZS1lcGlzb2RlLXdhdGNoLW5vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Super Bowl Commercial 2021 Is Like a Carpool Karaoke Episode – Watch Now!,"Everyone is a Carpool Karaoke star in McDonald’s new commercial that aired during the Super Bowl LV.

In the advertisement the fast food company says Thank You to all the people who utilized the drive thru during the last year while the world went through a pandemic.

It shows a montage of drive-thru customers singing along to their favorite songs including The Proclaimers’ “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)” and Celine Dion’s “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now.”.

“This ad was inspired by the fan truth that so many of us share: visiting the Drive Thru in 2020 while belting out our favorite songs and jamming out in our cars” Jennifer Healan vice president of U.S. marketing said about the visual. “These are the little things that people love about McDonald’s and we bring these to life in ways our customers would actually talk about them.”

“Twenty f**ing minutes ... Don’t tell me to f***ing settle when you can’t even cook a fresh f***ing meal” the woman yells.

“Everyone here is fed up with this f***ing restaurant.”

A young child jumps up and down beside her before saying “stop it mum”.

Mid North Coast Police District said it had received reports the 28-year-old woman was aggressively abusing a number of staff including teenage employees over a dispute on the time it was taking for her order to be processed.

It’s alleged she used “extremely offensive and abusive language towards the employees”.

Why we don't celebrate at Maccies,"If you were born and raised in the 90s McDonald’s birthday parties were the best present you could get.

It might be hard to believe now but there really was a time when we actively looked forward to rolling around in a germ-filled ball pit and eating French fries that had been fingered by as many hands as physically possible. How times change.

However no matter what the current social stigma attached to partying might be McDonald’s birthday parties were and always will be awesome.

Why then are they no longer such a big deal? Here’s what you need to know about an iconic part of fast food folklore.

McDonald’s birthday parties were legendary in the ’90s (Credit: PA)

Do McDonald’s still do birthday parties?

Although many people associate McDonald’s birthday parties with the ’90s and ’00s McDonald’s birthday parties are still an active part of the chain’s business model.

The McDonald’s UK website states that prospective partygoers should “speak to the restaurant manager at the particular McDonald’s restaurant that you intend on visiting”. They will then be able to confirm whether a party is an option.

And it’s not just Britain that caters for McDonald’s birthday parties either.

In Australia for instance customers have a choice between two different birthday party packages at over 200 separate locations.

McDonald’s birthday parties aren’t as popular as they once were (Credit: PA)

What happens at a McDonald’s birthday party?

Back in their heyday McDonald’s birthday parties were an essential if admittedly chaotic part of any celebration.

Although formats differed according to location the basic schedule looked something like this:

You plus 20 other frenzied yowling children would descend on poor unsuspecting McDonald’s employees after an afternoon of bowling/movie watching or some combination of the two.

There would be a designated quarantine zone of two to three tables near the back of the restaurant to try and keep everyone in check. This never worked.

Partygoers would receive cardboard crowns and balloons as a peace offering. This only made everyone more agitated.

Everyone would get a Happy Meal – no exceptions. One person might try and order a Filet-O-Fish. Everyone would bully this person for the rest of the day until they cried and left early.

If parents were lucky there would be a soft play area to contain the mob. If they weren’t the dining room became a warzone.

The whole party would fight over the best Happy Meal toys in a chilling display of capitalistic Darwinism. The strong preyed on the weak leaving the losers to choose between McDonald’s books and a plastic gardening kit.

In the days before fruit bags were a Happy Meal must-have vitamins were strictly banned from McDonald’s birthday parties. It was like an e-number-fuelled Apocalypse Now. We loved the smell of McNuggets in the morning.

Happy Meals were the only option at kids’ birthday parties (Credit: PA)

The downfall of the McDonald’s party

Understandably times have changed somewhat. Today’s McDonald’s birthday parties are more sanitised affairs. Strict rules and regulations have replaced the carnage of the ’90s.

Perhaps this dramatic change in vibe explains why McDonald’s birthday parties aren’t the cultural force they once were.

READ MORE: How much does Casey Webb make on Man v. Food?

Without the genuine element of danger and chaotic tint everything has become a little more vanilla.

Admittedly it probably makes the experience more enjoyable for employees. But when you sand down the edges on something inevitably you lose part of its character.

While we miss the parties the same can’t be said for creepy Ronald McDonald (Credit: PA)

Why did Mcdonald’s get rid of Ronald?

Another intrinsic part of the authentic McDonald’s birthday party experience was the frankly terrifying figure of Ronald McDonald.

Whenever there were scenes of unfettered joy occurring at a restaurant Ronald would appear to traumatise the guests into stunned silence.

However for several years Ronald’s demonic visage has been notable by its absence. This is true across the McDonald’s brand and not just for parties.

The reason for this is thanks to some seriously nefarious pranking in the summer of 2016.

All over the world people began reporting sightings of creepy clowns menacing towns and cities at night. In some cases the clowns engaged in seriously threatening behaviour.

In this atmosphere McDonald’s made the executive decision to retire the character. As McDonald’s spokesman Terri Hickey said at the time: “McDonald’s and franchisees in the local markets are mindful of the current climate around clown sightings in communities and as such are being thoughtful in respect to Ronald McDonald’s participation in community events for the time being”.

Since then Ronald has taken a backseat in McDonald’s marketing.

McDonald’s still have options if you want to celebrate your big day with the Golden Arches (Credit: PA)

What can you get on your birthday for free at McDonald’s?

Officially at least according to the McDonald’s UK website there are no birthday freebies at the Golden Arches.

However there is also plenty of evidence to dispute this claim.

For instance Freebie Depot describes how many McDonald’s give free Happy Meals to kids on their birthdays.

Clearly the arrangement is not set in stone but it certainly suggests that there are still benefits to a McDonald’s birthday"

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Biocartis and Merck to Collaborate on Improving Patient Access to Personalized Medicine in Middle East and North Africa (MEA) Region

Biocartis (Mechelen Belgium) announced an expansion of its collaboration with Merck Serono Middle East and Merck Saudi Ltd. both affiliates of Merck KGaA (“Merck”). The collaboration aims to improve patient access to RAS biomarker testing in the Middle East and North Africa (MEA) region.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide with an estimated incidence of more than 1.9 million new cases annually. An estimated 904 thousand deaths from CRC occur worldwide every year making it the second most common cause of death from cancer.1 Understanding an individual patient’s biomarker status is key to support timely treatment decision-making in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).2 Treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody therapies have shown to improve outcomes in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC34 and have become standard of care for RAS wild-type mCRC.5

RAS biomarker testing is cumbersome and not readily available in all parts of the world. The Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Test and Idylla™ NRAS-BRAF Mutation Test are highly performant6 Tests that rapidly determine the RAS biomarker status in mCRC tumor tissue samples. Due to the ease-of-use of the Biocartis Idylla™ Platform the Tests can be deployed in any user setting and in turn aid patient access to biomarker testing globally.

Roger Moody Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis commented: “We are thrilled to announce the expansion of our collaboration with Merck in the Middle East and North Africa (MEA) region aimed at advancing healthcare solutions and ensuring timely and accurate diagnostics for mCRC patients. In our mission to enable universal access to personalized medicine for patients around the world Biocartis is proud to provide Idylla™'s cutting-edge technology for mCRC testing across countries in the MEA region. This collaboration underscores our shared dedication to overcoming the challenges in the healthcare environment of the MEA region and ensuring that patients receive the right medicine at the right time.”

Ramsey Morad SVP & Head MEAR - Middle East Africa Turkey & Russia/CIS at Merck added: ""In line with our commitment at Merck to enhance patient care in the MEA region we are happy to collaborate with Biocartis in addressing the critical need for improved access to RAS biomarker testing particularly in areas where such testing is not readily available. By leveraging Biocartis' RAS-testing platform we are confident this will allow treating oncologists to swiftly determine biomarker status and facilitate timely treatment decisions for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.""

I’m on the run with you my sweet love

There’s nothing wrong contemplating God

Under the chemtrails over the country club

Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool

Me and my sister just playing it cool

Under the chemtrails over the country club



Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels

Go to the market the kids’ swimming pools

Baby what’s your sign?

My Moon’s in Leo my Cancer is Sun

You won’t play you’re no fun

Well I don’t care what they think

Drag racing my little red sports car

I’m not unhinged or unhappy I’m just wild



I’m on the run with you my sweet love

There’s nothing wrong contemplating God

Under the chemtrails over the country club

Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool

Me and my sister just playing it cool

Under the chemtrails over the country club



Meet you for coffee

At the elementary schools

We’ll laugh about nothing

As the summer gets cool

It’s beautiful I’ll escape

Normality settles down over me

I’m not bored or unhappy

I’m still so strange and wild



I’m in the wind I’m in the water

Nobody’s son nobody’s daughter

Watching the chemtrails over the country club

Suburbia The Brentwood Market

What to do next? Maybe we’ll love it

White picket chemtrails over the country club



My love my love



Washing my hair doing my laundry

Late night to be I want you holding me

Like when we were kids

Under chemtrails and country clubs

It’s never too late baby so don’t give up

It’s never too late baby so don’t give up

Under the chemtrails over the country club yeah

(You’re born in December I’m born in June)

Under the chemtrails over the country club yeah

ST. PETERSBURG Fla. — Hefty fines could be coming to 50 Cent and other organizers who hosted a Super Bowl party St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman tweeted.

And it could cost a little more than 50 cent(s) he added.

TMZ was the first to report 50 Cent hosted the Friday night bash in a private hanger at Albert Whitted Airport. Doors opened around 9 p.m. with general admission tickets going for $85 to a stage table costing around $7000.

Videos posted to Snapchat (warning: language) and Facebook showed some but not all people wearing masks despite warnings from health officials given the ongoing state of the coronavirus pandemic. Some doctors remain wary cases could spike locally given not-socially distanced Super Bowl parties.

A city spokesman said officials will work to learn more about what happened Friday night before a decision if any is made against the organizers.

This isn't how we should be celebrating the Super Bowl. It's not safe or smart. It's stupid. We're going to take a very close look at this and it may end up costing someone a lot more than 50 cent. @TMZhttps://t.co/Vrvg8fTdBB — Rick Kriseman (@Kriseman) February 6 2021",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYnRzLW1lbWJlcnMtbGlrZS1mb290YmFsbC5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do the BTS Members Like Football?,"They're award-winning K-pop artists but some of the BTS members like sports. Here's what we know about their relationship with football.

They’re award-winning dancers and singers. Still RM Jin Suga J-Hope Jimin V and Jungkook have fun while onstage. They even pretended to play football while visiting iconic United States stadiums.

While performing at Soldier Field in Chicago during the Love Yourself: Speak Yourself World Tour the BTS members wanted to have some football-themed fun. Using a balled-up face towel Jungkook tried to make a touchdown passing the other members.

“A little rain won’t stop you from enjoying the show right?” RM asked the audience prior to Jungkook’s DIY-football play. “Let’s think of when we play soccer or football when it’s raining. It’s more fun right? You know what? Soldier Field is known for football. Chicago Bears!”

A few days later Jin wanted to join in on the football fun according to Stylecaster. At New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium V turned to the crowd and asked “Who is the running back?” Jin quickly yelled “me!” Instead of getting tackled Jin was met with a giant hug from the remaining BTS members.

Between writing performing and recording original music it’s unclear if these performers find time to watch the Super Bowl or keep up with American football teams. However during one interview RM congratulated the Toronto Raptors for winning the championship.

Some of the BTS members are somewhat sports fans though. It’s no surprise to BTS fans that J-Hope is a bronze medal winner for tennis — out of three teams. Before joining BTS J-Hope and Jimin were both trained dancers.

The BTS members played their share of sports for ‘RUN BTS’

Sometimes when they’re doing challenges for RUN BTS the BTS members perform in sports-related activities. In 2020 they played badminton some of the members using dustpans and even frying pans as rackets. During the same episode they played a game of “foot volleyball” which involved a lot of running from both teams.

Another episode of RUN BTS had the members play a game a Laser Tag in two teams. Whoever captured the other teams’ balloons won. This proved to be a problem for some members especially when one of the balloons floated away.

On a few other occasions the members showcased their skills at sports like archery and soccer. Of course each of these performers are skilled dancers performing intricate choreography for songs like “Black Swan” and “On” off of Map of the Soul: 7.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9mb290YmFsbC1uZXdzL21hbi1jaXR5LWxpdmVycG9vbC1sYXRlc3Qtcml2YWxyeS0xOTc0NzUyMtIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9mb290YmFsbC1uZXdzL21hbi1jaXR5LWxpdmVycG9vbC1sYXRlc3Qtcml2YWxyeS0xOTc0NzUyMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Taylor Swift a bad bus journey and a goldfish bowl intensified Liverpool's modern Manchester rivalry,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Pep Guardiola was in his happy place in the summer of 2018.

The Manchester City manager had defied all expectations and many a pundit over the previous year shattering the Premier League record for most points in a single campaign with a formidable league-and-cup double banishing all memories of an exasperating first season in English football.

So thrilled was Guardiola with his situation that he had agreed a contract extension at the club to take him to 2021 that if fulfilled would make City his longest stay in management.

There were many reasons for a spring in his step as he took a young squad off to tour the United States while the majority of his senior players toiled at the World Cup not least the opportunity to enjoy five days in New York the city where he had spent a year on sabbatical and where longtime friend and assistant Domenec Torrent now presided.

They only fly in the City ointment aside from an unexpected cup upset against League One side Wigan Athletic had been Liverpool.

Jurgen Klopp's team had blitzed them on the pitch to deliver their first league defeat in January while their fans had outrageously battered the City team bus on the way into Anfield to knock them out of their stride for a Champions League quarter-final defeat that some awful officiating helped to decide.

That summer across the Hudson River the budding rivalry between the two best sides in England kicked up a notch in a friendly that turned out to be anything but.

Things appeared bleak as soon as the first City staff arrived at the MetLife Stadium on July 25.

Taylor Swift concerts on three consecutive nights had left just 24 hours for a new grass pitch to bed in on top of the synthetic surface.

Together with an unusually large amount of rain the surface was so bad that Guardiola took one look and decided he couldn't risk star centre-back Aymeric Laporte on it.

Some City staff were also a little taken aback to discover how seriously their counterparts were treating a friendly game on a dreadful surface with mismatched lineups.

The match finished with Mo Salah Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane up against Cameron Humphreys Tosin Adarabioyo and Eric Garcia.

City actually took the lead in the second half when Leroy Sane raced onto a through-ball to score but a Salah header and a last-minute Mane penalty ensured defeat for an inexperienced City.

Worse was to follow after the match in the goldfish bowl of a press conference room.

The unique design in the stadium meant that supporters who had paid enough - predominantly Liverpool fans in a country where their reach is far greater than City's - could pile around three clear-glass walls and listen in on the managers speaking.

Guardiola had already shown signs of not being in the mood to chew over the defeat when he smashed back a gentle underarm of a question about Sane showing that he could prove any doubters wrong after a difficult start to the summer when he was unexpectedly dropped from Germany's World Cup squad.

""It depends on him"" the City manager slapped back.

""He needs more minutes and he needs to regain his principles in terms of playing without the ball.

""He has the talent to do that and we are happy that he scored. Still he is far away from his best.""

When he was interrupted by a raucous roar to his right and the doors swinging open to allow Klopp into the room the Catalan jumped out of his chair.

The oblivious Liverpool boss had no idea that his opposition number had still been talking and offered to do a joint press conference - far from a rarity in pre-season - but Guardiola declined hurrying off stage left back to Manhattan to leave Klopp with an adoring audience doing his best to laugh off the suggestion that his team had struck a psychological blow by kindly pointing out that this probably wouldn't be the team chosen to defend the title.

If the City manager managed to escape back to the comfort of Central Park without letting out a rendition of 'Well done he's 13' he couldn't resist a poke at the hype that had accompanied reports of Liverpool's victory before he left the United States.

After a win over Bayern Munich in Miami to end a largely peaceful tour with their first victory Guardiola used his last press conference there to stress how happy he was with both performances.

""We lost [against Liverpool] because of an offside goal and a ridiculous penalty"" he said ""but the result doesn't matter - it was the way we played and the same today [against Bayern].""

That rainy evening New Jersey played a part in setting up one of the greatest title races in Premier League history complete with one of the all-time defining meetings between the pair as City won 2-1 at the Etihad in January 2019 in an electric match that would prove to be Liverpool's only defeat of a campaign that they still managed to come up short in.

When it mattered they couldn't shake City off.",,,

The MGM Resorts (MGM) portfolio includes 29 unique hotel and destination gaming offerings across the US and Macau. The company is currently also targeting an expansion across Asia.

MGM has been instrumental in “giving back to the community” and last year alone donated 552000 meals in Southern Nevada alone and leveraged their significant expertise to support Nevada’s COVID-19 taskforce with 261000 hospital gowns 200000 medical gloves and 500000 KN95 respiratory mask.

The multi-layered Seven-Point Safety Plan that was implemented prior to re-opening its resorts after the coronavirus lockdowns was one of the first of its kind and the company is committed to the fight to stop the spread of the virus.

“We’re proud of the work we’ve done to adapt and continually provide unmatched guest service through this period of uncertainty” said Bill Hornbuckle CEO & President of MGM Resorts International. “Furthermore as a long-standing leader in the hospitality and entertainment business we take seriously our Social Impact and Sustainability obligations and brand reputation as we strive to make the world a better place.” (See MGM stock analysis on TipRanks)

Goldman Sachs analyst Stephen Grambling reiterated his Sell rating on MGM two weeks ago but raised his price target to $27 from $23. This implies downside potential of around 21% from current levels.

Grambling sees “significant potential” for online sports betting stocks to re-rate closer to consumer internet peers as a “network effect begins to take hold and new forms of revenue become visible.”

Meanwhile consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 1 Buy 6 Holds and 2 Sells. The average price target of $28.71 suggests downside potential of around 16% over the next 12 months.

Las Vegas’ skyline has never been stable.

In the ’90s and 2000s the desert oasis-themed properties built during the city’s mob era were demolished to make room for bigger more lavish properties. Wynn Las Vegas replaced the Desert Inn the Bellagio was built on the ashes of the Dunes and The Venetian now offers gondola rides where the Sands once stood.

Demolition has been one of Las Vegas’ go-to methods for a refresh but certain aspects of Las Vegas’ skyline today will be here to stay thanks to a condominium trend that started in the 2000s. Real estate experts say the individually owned units inside the properties will make them difficult to tear down.

“Las Vegas does have a history of reinventing itself over the years. The market has seen a number of properties being torn down in an effort to replace it with something bigger better and more innovative” Applied Analysis partner Brian Gordon said. “For those locations that have these individually owned condominium units that development alternative becomes much more challenging.”

‘Difficult to tear down’

A dozen-plus high-rise condo buildings are spread across the tourist corridor. Some — like Turnberry Towers and Juhl — are purely residential. Others are attached to hotels like Palms MGM Signature Trump International Vdara and Waldorf Astoria.

Gordon said the hotel-condo trend first took off in Las Vegas in the early- and mid-2000s when land value and construction costs were soaring.

Developers needed to find a way to help finance their projects and condos offered a simple solution. Properties could sell individual units to frequent travelers who agreed to put their unit back in the rental pool a certain number of times throughout the year.

“Costs were escalating land values were elevated and demand for Las Vegas amenities and resort properties was high” Gordon said. The “for-sale condominium component (helped) fund that infrastructure.”

That financing trend died out when the market came crashing down during the Great Recession. Dreams of the “Manhattanization” of Las Vegas faltered as several planned high-rise mixed-use properties were nixed in the mid-2000s. Other projects pivoted operations: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for instance canceled condominium sales in 2008 and converted the units into hotel rooms after its original developer defaulted on a loan and Deutsche Bank took over.

While there are fewer condominium properties in Las Vegas than originally planned those that did make it to completion seem to be here to stay.

“Those properties will be more and more difficult to tear down” said Uri Vaknin a partner at private equity firm KRE Capital LLC who oversees five condominium properties in Las Vegas. “You have to get almost complete buy-in from ownership based on Nevada law.”

Layer to Las Vegas’ history

Gordon said condominiums “add an additional layer of complexity” to Las Vegas’ redevelopment activities. He expects the city’s current condominium towers to be around for at least the next decade.

Their longevity could be good for Las Vegas Vaknin said. As the chair of The Neon Museum’s board of trustees Vaknin said the buildings could help bolster the city’s architectural history.

“As we’ve matured as a city … we’re also seeing the importance of the history of our city” he said. “Part of what we know about Las Vegas is it is constantly evolving. At the same time we want to keep some of the stuff that makes Las Vegas Las Vegas. We don’t want to lose our identity.”

Brendan Bussmann of research and management consulting firm Global Market Advisors said these mixed-use properties have loyal customers who prefer the space and amenities compared with the traditional hotel offerings.

“There are individuals out there that … enjoy that product” he said. “Some people want that larger (room) that has a kitchen” when they visit Las Vegas.

Vaknin added that many of the condo-hotel hybrids lack the heavily-themed designs seen in other structures which could help them avoid going out of fashion longer.

“There will always be (demolitions)” Vaknin said but “I don’t think a place like CityCenter will be obsolete for decades and decades to come.”

Spokespeople for MGM Resorts which owns 50 percent of CityCenter declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for Red Rock Resorts which owns Palms Place also declined to comment.

Las Vegas: a ‘unique market’

Unlike the historic high-rises in New York or Chicago many structures in Las Vegas last just decades.

The Landmark was open 26 years before it was imploded. Dune’s South Tower was around for only 15. Desert Inn’s Palms Tower lasted seven.

For a city used to seeing buildings toppled over after only a few decades condominiums could throw a wrench in the city’s’ go-to method for a face-lift.

“We’re accustomed to seeing properties torn down after a few decades” Gordon said. “That seems to be something that’s fairly unique to this particular market given the evolutionary nature of the resort industry as a whole.”

Perhaps no one knows this better than Mark Loizeaux president of Controlled Demolition Inc. The Maryland-based business has been tearing down Las Vegas resorts since the Dunes implosion in 1993.

Loizeaux orchestrates implosions all over the country but Las Vegas has provided a steady stream of business over the years. The Riviera’s 2016 implosion was the company’s 28th or 29th Las Vegas project — at this point it’s hard to keep track.

“Las Vegas is a very unique market” Loizeaux said. “Nowhere else are people so aware of the value of time.”

Loizeaux said he has been approached with inquiries on three “iconic” Las Vegas structures in recent months but wasn’t able to share names because of nondisclosure agreements.

“I don’t see (implosions) immediately on the horizon” he said.

Despite redevelopment challenges tied to Las Vegas condos Gordon said the city will continue to evolve.

“These particular buildings will last much longer than we’ve seen among other sites up and down the Las Vegas Strip just by a function of their ownership” he said. “But that doesn’t mean other properties without a residential component won’t ultimately turn over or be redeveloped with time.”

Every weekend is a party in Las Vegas. Even so Super Bowl weekend stands out.

There are two events in which the sporting world and Las Vegas become intertwined: the first week of March Madness and Super Bowl weekend. Give many fans the choice and they’d pick watching the games in Vegas over attending them in person. There’s more fun to be had in Sin City.

The Super Bowl parties everyone is used to in Las Vegas won’t be the same this year. Nobody knows what will happen for March Madness either.

Super Bowl Sunday will still be a good time in Las Vegas. There are endless betting possibilities at BetMGM for Super Bowl LV and plenty of people will still make the trip. Just nothing like usual due to COVID-19 restrictions.

“My hunch is that especially on strip properties the social distancing will make it a very different Super Bowl experience” said Gill Alexander host of “A Numbers Game” on the Vegas-based VSiN network. “I think those in attendance will be as exuberant as ever but with sort of unspoken recognition that this isn’t quite the party we’ve come to know.”

This will be the coronavirus Super Bowl. In Tampa there will be more cardboard cutouts in the stands than fans. It will make for a bit of an unusual and awkward broadcast balancing a celebration of America’s biggest sporting event with the reality of a public health crisis that is still ongoing.

It will be a lot different in Las Vegas too.

Las Vegas during a pandemic

Visiting Las Vegas over the past 11 months has been unusual.

There’s still gambling though with plastic separators between seats at the tables. Sportsbooks are still showing games though the seats are spread out with six feet between them. Restaurants are open but with restrictions on seating capacity. Nightclubs and big shows are dark. Masks and constant reminders to keep your mask on indoors are a way of life like they are in every other city.

The most obvious difference is the size of the crowd. That will be noticeable on Super Bowl weekend too.

“It’s pretty quiet” said Jeff Stoneback director of trading for MGM Resorts. “Probably the quietest Super Bowl I’ve ever encountered here.”

Hotel occupancy rates are generally above 90% in Las Vegas for Super Bowl weekend. Wynn CEO Matt Maddox recently said he was optimistic that hotel occupancy at the Wynn properties on Super Bowl weekend would reach 50% according to Yogonet. It hasn’t been that high since October.

There are still plenty of watch parties planned but they will be scaled back.

Typically MGM hosts a Super Bowl party for about 1400 of its VIP players in a ballroom. This year government regulations limit gatherings to 50 people. MGM will have four ballrooms with 50 people each.

“The atmosphere is not the same for 50 people as it is for 1400 people but it’s the Super Bowl and everyone is here to have a good time” Stoneback said. “And there’s still a lot to bet on.”

There will still be many Super Bowl wagers perhaps even a record amount. Sports betting is one of the few things in Las Vegas that didn’t take a hit with the pandemic.

Sportsbooks still had a big year

It has been a rough year for most businesses but especially in a city that thrives on revelry.

According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Las Vegas had 1.247 million visitors in December down 64% from December of 2019. For the year there were 19 million visitors down 55.2%. Hotel occupancy was down from 85.1% in December of 2019 to 30.9% this past December. Gross casino revenue on the strip was down 50.7%.

But the sportsbooks didn’t see a big drop once sports returned. According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board sportsbooks had a profit of $238.45 million in 2020. That included a massive $61.8 million profit in November a record month. In October sportsbooks handled $659222395 in bets an all-time high for one month according to USBets.com.

“Even though the bodies aren’t in town the money is coming in” Stoneback said.

There were two big reasons the sportsbook had a normal football season in terms of bets and profit. Betting apps were huge. People who are uncomfortable going into a casino during a pandemic can just bet on their phone. Also there are fewer options for visitors. People can’t drop money on a Cirque du Soleil show or bottle service at Hakkasan Nightclub so they were putting it on the Green Bay Packers or Dallas Cowboys instead.

“It’s the only show in town” Stoneback said.

Hopefully this Super Bowl is a one-off. Perhaps with vaccines MGM will be back to its huge VIP Super Bowl party next year and visitors will flow through Las Vegas all weekend. But it could take a while before Las Vegas is back to normal.

“I hope by March Madness things will be different” Alexander said “but only time will tell if that’s too soon too.”

We all know that machines are critical and that we need to address issues before they cause a catastrophe. But that work requires significant manual resources and still results in frequent downtime production loss and supply chain disruptions.

One 2017 survey of 600 IT and field service decision makers found 82% had suffered one or more unplanned outages in the previous three years. The impacts of unplanned downtime are expensive and varied but the most common consequence is the inability to deliver products or services which translates directly into lost revenue.

Currently most industrial companies don’t continuously monitor the health and performance of machines. Instead they rely on archaic failure models based on machine usage. It’s challenging to predict industrial failures using operating hours or life cycles and as the survey shows this outdated model simply doesn’t work to prevent operational disruptions.

With these results it’s hard to imagine maintenance and reliability becoming key drivers of innovation and excellence. Enter machine health which uses Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict and prevent machine failures and improve machine performance. Manufacturers using machine health are seeing dramatic improvements that can accelerate wider digital transformation across the supply chain.

A global CPG company has saved millions of dollars by preemptively diagnosing machine problems and prioritizing the machines most critical to operations. Improvements have been so significant that the company is creating new roles specifically focused on machine health and using performance data to inform daily meetings. It’s even using machine health insights to improve quality control and supply chain stability. This top-down transformation is possible at any facility that takes machine health seriously.

The journey to machine health

Machine health is insight-based while traditional approaches to reliability maintenance and operations are compliance-based. This means it’s inherently predictive and prescriptive while traditional approaches are reactive or preventive. A machine health solution allows companies to switch from these older approaches to one that can sense precisely when machines will experience a reduction of performance prescribe corrective actions and operational adjustments to avoid it and schedule necessary maintenance.

Performing maintenance reliability and operational activity based on the machine’s real-time condition (rather than less reliable indicators like age) eliminates unplanned downtime and a significant portion of the reactive and preventive workload. Machine health also minimizes downtime caused by maintenance itself because machines only receive service when absolutely necessary.

The people who design maintain operate and manage industrial assets now have access to the same machine health data in real time which leads to enhanced collaboration and frees up resources for high-value work. Instead of performing unnecessary routine or reactive activities maintenance and reliability professionals can focus on unlocking production capacity uptime optimization and process improvement.

Machine health is also about understanding the relationship between individual machines and overall performance. Prescriptive mechanical health diagnostics and operational performance analytics reveal how each part of an operation fits into the whole. Those insights have a transformational impact on manufacturing operations and help improve outcomes across the board.

As part of a larger asset management strategy machine health improves uptime manufacturing capacity productivity product quality time to market supply chain-level agility risk reduction and predictability of production. Simultaneously it promises dramatic reductions in maintenance costs labor costs and inventory holding.

What makes machine health effective

AI-driven machine health solutions consist of four key components that work together to transform industrial operations.

1. Monitor

Sensors continuously capture streams of high-quality standardized mechanical and operational data from machines. Vibration and magnetic data are sufficient to detect most mechanical and electrical faults in rotating equipment. Other sensor data — like temperature ultrasound fluid analysis pressure and electrical current — can help augment this coverage and enable diagnostics of additional components.

Sensor data can be supplemented with operational data streams (like machine speed load and recipe) to enable even more precise predictions and recommendations for operational performance across individual machines machine centers and production lines.

Without continuous and standardized data machine health diagnostics and performance analytics become sporadic and ineffective; they simply won’t scale across machine types facilities and operational use cases.

2. Diagnose

Deploying the right sensors isn’t enough. AI insights should enable the practitioner to easily understand what the potential issue is which parts of the machine or the production process are affected why the issue is emerging how to improve the condition with the right corrective or preventive actions and when they should act.

Cloud-based AI algorithms can use mechanical and operational data to not only predict the condition of the machine but also help optimize the performance of other machines and systems around it. For example an emerging mechanical issue on a critical component of a production line can impact product quality downstream. By using machine health and performance insights across the entire production line manufacturers can quickly link mechanical issues to production outcomes prescribe an early intervention and improve the design of the overall process.

3. Guide

Machine health guides reliability maintenance and operations teams on what to improve how and in what order. Reliability teams use AI-driven insights to identify and eliminate the root causes of failures and replicate these best practices across the organization.

In addition machine health provides the ability to look into the future — by making accurate predictions of asset life span and performance based on its real-time condition. This level of insight enables more predictive and dynamic asset strategy and operational planning. Asset performance can now be directly tied to expected production outcomes and supply chain strategy and the organization’s overall financial needs.

4. Act

Machine health insights enable maintenance and operations teams to plan activity based on a common set of machine metrics and real-time insights. Technicians and operators can act on recommendations based on the actual condition of the machine and root cause diagnostics. Together these teams can collaborate to eliminate emerging issues and optimize production processes and control parameters. Machine health solutions also make it easier to capture institutional knowledge; provide expertise remotely; and standardize best practices for reliability maintenance and operations.

The industrial world is undergoing a rapid shift toward digitization that’s been significantly accelerated by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Machine health provides a proven critical use case and serves as a foundational part of this shift. This is why manufacturing leaders are embracing a new era of machine health and performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd2luZHNvcnN0YXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9nbG9iYWwtbWljcm9jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLXRvLWlkbGUtd2luZHNvci1hc3NlbWJseS1hbmQtZXNzZXgtZW5naW5lLXBsYW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global microchip shortage forces Windsor assembly lines to idle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/global-microchip-shortage-to-idle-windsor-assembly-and-essex-engine-plants on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd2luZHNvcnN0YXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9nbG9iYWwtbWljcm9jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLXRvLWlkbGUtd2luZHNvci1hc3NlbWJseS1hbmQtZXNzZXgtZW5naW5lLXBsYW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

It frees data scientists from worrying about hyperparameter tuning and model selection. It enables developers to build self-tuning software which adjusts itself with new training data. It is fast economical and easy to use.

Problem

More and more businesses start building millions of ML-embedded applications. It adds up to a large cost to manually choose the right training algorithm and tune the hyperparameters for every task and every dataset. Massive consumption of computation resources in tuning machine learning models also brings a tremendous burden to the environment.

Solution

We build an economical AutoML system that handles tuning tasks robustly and efficiently. FLAML leverages the structure of the search space to choose a search order optimized for both cost and model quality. Overall the search tends to gradually move from cheap trials to expensive trials while improving model accuracy.

Our design enables it robustly adapting to an ad-hoc dataset out of the box.

How to get started

FLAML can be easily installed by pip install flaml .

With three lines of code you can start using this economical and fast AutoML engine as a scikit-learn style estimator.

from flaml import AutoML

automl = AutoML()

automl.fit(X_train y_train task=""classification"")

You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning tool for XGBoost  LightGBM  Random Forest etc. or a custom learner.

automl.fit(X_train y_train task=""regression"" estimator_list=[""lgbm""])

You can also run generic model tuning beyond the scikit-learn style fit() .

from flaml import tune

tune.run(training_function config={""learning_rate"": tune.loguniform(lower=1e-5 upper=1.0) ""num_epochs"": tune.loguniform(lower=1 upper=100)} init_config={""num_epochs"": 1} time_budget_s=3600)

Read our ethics policy

Article Hero Image

Microsoft is taking on Apple's Keychain by bringing its Autofill system of password storage and synchronization to iOS and macOS in the form of an update to the Microsoft Authenticator app and a Google Chrome extension.

Microsoft's Autofill is similar in concept to Keychain and many other password managers on the market in that it can store and automatically insert account credentials for various apps and services. Instead of remembering many different passwords Autofill requires users to at least memorize their Microsoft Account username and password with it handling the rest of the work.

Launched on Friday the change to the Microsoft Authenticator app adds password storage through Autofill. Once set up passwords saved to the Microsoft Account using the Microsoft Edge browser will automatically synchronize with the app.

For Mac users the new features of the Microsoft Account can be used via the Microsoft Autofill browser extension. Available on the Chrome Web Store the extension automatically fills in account credentials in the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.

Once enabled the extension also provides a way for users to manage their stored passwords and to view and edit details when appropriate.

While this does bring Microsoft to the same market as LastPass 1Password and other third-party tools as well as bringing it in line with Apple and Google in offering cross-platform password synchronization it may not necessarily be enough for Apple's user base. For example it is limited to two browsers on macOS whereas Apple's Keychain is system-wide allowing it to be used in many different apps.

Microsoft's push onto iOS and Mac mirrors a similar attempt by Apple but in the opposite direction. On Monday it released an update for iCloud for Windows that added iCloud Passwords for Windows an extension allowing Chrome users to synchronize their passwords with the cloud-based Keychain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWVkZ2UtbGVnYWN5LXJlbW92YWwtYXByaWwtMTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft will automatically uninstall the old version of Edge on Windows PCs,"Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer as the default Windows web browser back in 2015. Six years later Microsoft is rather forcefully replacing that version of Edge with a newer model.

Microsoft announced on its tech blog Friday that Edge Legacy (the older version of the browser that comes pre-installed on Windows 10 PCs) will be automatically removed from those computers with a software update on April 13. Anyone still using Edge Legacy on Windows 10 is strongly advised to switch over to the new version of Edge based on Google's open-source Chromium software which launched a year ago.

If you don't manually make the switch before April 13 your PC will do that for you. Those who have Edge Legacy on their task bars or desktops will see it replaced by the new version of Edge. You could theoretically keep using Edge Legacy if you just don't install the April 13 software update but the Chromium version of Edge is the only one that will keep getting new features and most importantly security updates going forward.

For what it's worth Microsoft promises the new Edge is fast and reliable. We'll let you be the judge of that. This should go without saying but if you use a third-party browser like Chrome or Firefox this change will not affect your daily routine in the slightest. It'll be like it never even happened. We promise.

The removal news isn't entirely a surprise. Microsoft confirmed in August 2020 that Edge Legacy browser would no longer be supported after March 9 2021. The latest development reinforces the coming change with Microsoft taking the dramatic step of removing the browser automatically.

Internet Explorer will be sticking around though that too is set for some changes. Microsoft started winding down support for the browser in November 2020 and that's expected to end on Aug. 17 2021 when Microsoft 365 ends its support for the now-ancient browser.

That doesn't mean Explorer will follow Edge Legacy into oblivion however. Microsoft wrote in the 2020 announcement that the browser ""isn't going away."" The reason? ""Customers have made business-critical investments in IE 11 legacy apps and we respect that those apps are still functioning.""

All that said you definitely shouldn't still be using Internet Explorer unless you have a specific reason to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L21pY3Jvc29mdC13aWxsLWF1dG9tYXRpY2FsbHktcmVtb3ZlLXRoZS1vbGQtZWRnZS1icm93c2VyLWZyb20td2luZG93cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft will automatically remove the old Edge browser from Windows,"Microsoft has finally decided on the timing of abandoning the outdated version of its Edge browser in the Windows operating system.

In an official message Microsoft explained how the process will proceed. As planned on March 9 2021 support for Microsoft Edge Legacy will be discontinued which means the termination of the release of updates for the browser.

The planned “Tuesday update” for Windows 10 will be released on April 13th. This update will remove Microsoft Edge Legacy from the system and install the new Microsoft Edge on the Chromium engine if it is not already present on the PC. The process of removing and replacing will happen automatically whether the user wants it or not.

Also the “deleting” update will be part of the test version of Windows 10 March Preview. Microsoft plans to remove the old Edge not only on the recent versions of Windows 10 but older versions as well. The update will be available for the following versions:

Windows 10 version 1803 (April 2018)

Windows 10 version 1809 (October 2018)

Windows-10 version 1903 (May 2019)

Windows 10 version 1909 (October 2019)

Windows 10 version 2004 (May 2020)

Windows-10 version 20H2 (October 2020)

Microsoft notes that since Windows 10 20H2 has the new Chromium-powered Edge already installed as the default browser it won’t be reinstalled only the old Edge will be removed.

Recall that now Microsoft Edge on the proprietary EdgeHTML engine is included in the operating system. Thus “bundled” with Windows 10 the user gets three preinstalled browsers at once – Internet Explorer the old Edge and the new Edge.

Microsoft Edge now supports history and open tabs syncing

After months of waiting Microsoft is finally rolling out the tab and history sync feature to users of the non-experimental stable version of the Edge browser.

Up to this point the new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser has synchronized passwords and bookmarks and also allowed open websites to be sent from a mobile device to a computer. However the new Microsoft Edge lacked features as familiar to Chrome users as syncing history and tabs. In December they began testing the synchronization of history and tabs in the beta version of the browser.

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

The change will take place on the server-side; so users don’t need to take any action to get the new feature.

The function must be active on all devices with the synchronization. The new settings are available for both Windows computers and mobile devices.

Microsoft Edge browser now uses 27% less RAM on Windows 10

When the browser uses a lot of RAM it slows down the entire operating system. Accordingly in order to avoid this users have to limit the number of open tabs; but developers of browsers can improve memory usage a bit as is the case with Microsoft Edge.

Microsoft has improved the Edge browser. It uses less memory as Microsoft notes in its blog the company’s mission is to provide the best browser for Windows. The words of the developers are not at odds with the case.

Recently Edge switched to the Chromium engine and began to work faster. And after the release of the large functional Windows 10 May 2020 Update; the browser has become even more economical with regard to RAM. Its use has decreased by up to 27%. True Microsoft makes a clarification that “performance on individual devices depends on configuration and use”; but on the whole everyone should feel Edge’s more economical attitude to memory."

Here’s the deal….

Unable to advertise nationally in the upcoming football championship game Coors Light has devised a novel way to not only get in front of consumers but to literally get inside their heads.

“If we couldn’t advertise nationally during the game what if we were able to run an ad in people’s dreams?” says Marcelo Pascoa vice president of marketing for the Coors family of brands at Molson Coors Beverage Company.

“At first it felt very weird but very intriguing” he says. “Can we actually do that?”

The short answer is evidently yes.

Molson Coors worked with Dr. Deirdre Barrett a leading psychologist professor author and expert on dreams based in Cambridge Mass. to create a sleep study. The experiment used a technique called targeted dream incubation a process where peoples’ dreams can be guided by prompts that are manifested in their subconscious as they sleep.

The experiment’s goal was to help participants create an advertisement of their own making in their dreams by feeding them images of refreshment including Coors Light and Coors Seltzer.

Sounds both interesting and quite frankly a little concerning…

Barrett and a her team of sleep technicians showed participants a trippy 90-second film featuring a shimmering avatar flying around mountains and streams while Coors images bounce down stairs and undulate underwater.

There’s even a talking fish holding a Coors Light and who doesn’t want to dream about that?

To participate in what Pascoa calls “potentially the largest sleep study ever” drinkers can visit CoorsBigGameDream.com and watch the visual stimulus video before they fall asleep.

Coors is releasing the mini-documentary via digital platforms while 15-second spots will air on TV leading up to the Feb. 6 championship game between Kansas City and Tampa Bay.

While Coors saw surprising results from the experiment using dream incubation to reach consumers remains a nascent approach Pascoa told Beer & Beyond.

But Professor Barrett asserts that according to her research it is proving to be an effective way to make a connection.

“I have no idea if other advertisers will choose to ask people to dream their ads in their dreams but it certainly seems to work” she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXNmdXJuYXJpLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvd2F0Y2gtc3VwZXItYm93bC1sdi1iZWVyLWNvbW1lcmNpYWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: Super Bowl LV Beer Commercials,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisfurnari/2021/02/06/watch-super-bowl-lv-beer-commercials/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXNmdXJuYXJpLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvd2F0Y2gtc3VwZXItYm93bC1sdi1iZWVyLWNvbW1lcmNpYWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Fair Lawn N.J. – A Nabisco plant in New Jersey will close for good by summer’s end after 63 years of operation leaving as many as 600 people without jobs officials said.

The plant in Fair Lawn New Jersey produces baked goods under the Nabisco brand including famous treats such as Oreo Lorna Doone and Teddy Grahams filling a portion of Route 208 with the smell of fresh-baked cookies.

Mondelez International the North American division of Nabisco’s parent company had said in November that closure of the plant was under consideration. Mayor Kurt Peluso said local officials were told Thursday that the plant will shut in late August or early September.

“It’s really sad news” Peluso said. “It’s really sad news. Nabisco has been a big part of Fair Lawn. We’re disappointed to see it go and we feel horrible for all the employees.”

A factory in Atlanta will also be shuttered while a plant in Richmond Virginia will remain open. Mondelez International also has facilities in the Chicago area and in Portland Oregon.

“Both Fair Lawn and Atlanta are no longer strategic assets from a geographic footprint perspective and both face significant operational challenges including aging infrastructure and outdated production capabilities which would have required significant investment to bring them to the modernized state required for the future” the company said in a statement.

The company vowed to work with employees and their unions to support them through the transition.

Laurie Guzzinati the company’s senior director of corporate and government affairs in North America acknowledged that it was “a difficult day for employees” but said the decision wasn’t made lightly. She said the closure decision “is not a reflection of their contributions or their commitment to the business.”

Local 719 President Richard Nazzaro called the decision by company officials “despicable” saying employees had “worked loyally all through the pandemic every day coming into work risking their health to provide cookies to the American people and profits for their pocket.”

Workers he said “are devastated. They have no idea what the future holds for them and their families.”

Closure of the plant was considered a few years ago but the company chose then to shutter a Philadelphia facility instead.

Peluso said Fair Lawn was committed to keeping the property commercial rather than residential adding that he has been approached with redevelopment proposals including using the site for a distribution center or a studio to produce films and TV shows.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9xci1jb2Rlcy1jb3ZpZC1wYW5kZW1pYy1kby1wZW9wbGUtdXNlLXRoZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the pandemic finally get Americans to embrace QR codes?,"My husband and I sat at our kitchen table in Philadelphia recently breaking up the monotony of quarantine cooking with a delivery from the recently launched Pete’s Place chef Peter Serpico’s self-described “kinda Korean” takeout spot he runs from his temporarily shuttered restaurant. Pasted onto the plastic lid of the spicy chicken ramen there was a small QR code. We’ve seen (and mostly ignored) them for years but they’ve started popping up again—at restaurants bars and shops. My husband pointed his phone’s camera at the black-and-white square and was rewarded with a video. In it Charlie Serpico’s 5-year-old daughter deftly and charmingly demonstrates how to assemble the meal using the included uncracked soft-boiled egg.

“We were searching for a way to personalize the experience” Serpico says. “When we were a sit-down restaurant with an open kitchen we had the ability to personalize it with face-to-face interaction. We wanted to capture that through takeout.”

It was a successful endeavor. Not only were Charlie’s instructions helpful but the delightful surprising moment brightened what would have otherwise been an uneventful (albeit delicious) takeout dinner.

QR codes or quick response codes were invented in 1994 by Masahiro Hara an engineer who worked in Japan’s auto industry with the goal of tracking vehicles and parts during the manufacturing process. Instead of typing in a tedious URL scan a small black-and-white label with your phone to instantly pull up a website or app. In the years that followed other sectors including advertising marketing and online payment services adopted their usage. A wide swath of countries in Asia embraced the technology; in China alone they can facilitate everything from charging mobile phones to flirting in bars. Now in cities like Bangkok and Hong Kong the technology has been tapped to help curb the COVID-19 pandemic; codes posted at the entrance to grocery stores and public transit centers help contact-tracing efforts in case of outbreaks. But in the decade or so since QR codes have been floating around the U.S. they haven’t been widely adopted. In the past year though spurred by the pandemic the technology seems to finally be coming into focus.

Before 2017 when Apple updated its iPhone software to enable the camera app to read QR codes users had to download a specific QR reader app. Some tech industry insiders speculated that eliminating that minor friction would make the codes more ubiquitous but even then they never really took hold. Then opportunities arose during the pandemic which prompted a rethink of long-standing norms and may have finally made the technology more permanently mainstream in the U.S.

In its recent state of the industry report the National Restaurant Association noted that since last March half of full-service operators have added digital menus accessed by scanning a QR code. This includes 28 restaurants that make up José Andrés’s ThinkFoodGroup. Chief operating officer Eric Martino says at the onset of the pandemic the company immediately sought ways to make its operations contactless.

“We had to figure out how to keep people safe” Martino says. “People are not going to want to touch a menu and how do we do this without having to hold a [credit] card which puts our team in danger?” The COO recalled how QR codes were stamped on new appliances linking to a digital manual or enabling owners to seamlessly shop for new parts.

“If we could use this technology we could really help change the game” he says. As ThinkFoodGroup began reopening restaurants Martino and his team focused on contactless systems and found a company called GoTab that enabled their customers to scan a QR code pull up a digital menu and in some of the restaurants pay through the connected point-of-sale (POS) system.

Now a small plastic cardholder sits on each table displaying the black-and-white checked square that instantly pulls up the menu. (It’s sanitized between seatings.) Though the restaurants still offer disposable paper menus for diners who don’t have mobile phones or would rather not use the QR code system Martino says over 110000 guests have used the QR code menus since ThinkFoodGroup launched the system each spending an average of 11 minutes engaged in it.

Restaurants that run the gamut from quick service to fine dining have adopted QR codes as part of their safety protocols since the onset of the pandemic. In Philadelphia modern Taiwanese spot Baology started using QR codes last spring to display its frequently changing menu of handmade pot stickers and gwa baos and since some customers aren’t familiar with the cuisine to provide images. Owner Judy Ni was familiar with QR codes from using them in Taiwan where her parents emigrated from and theorizes Americans’ reluctance to adopt the technology pre-pandemic stems from our collective cultural notion of service.

“In Asia speed and convenience is of the essence and their absorption of new technologies and practices is breathtakingly fast” Ni says. “Americans are slower to adopt new conveniences and technology while also having expectations for how they should be ‘served’ especially at certain types of establishments.”

With the restaurant industry in a state of pandemic-induced flux the time for introducing new norms is now. Besides popping up in fast-casual and chain restaurants QR codes have also made an appearance at some of the country’s most rarefied establishments—places where pulling out your phone to peruse a menu might once have seemed as incongruous as being alerted that your table was ready with a vibrating restaurant pager. Several restaurants under the Relais & Châteaux umbrella have QR code-accessible menus including New York City’s Jean Georges Gabriel Kreuther and Daniel. At Daniel Daniel Boulud’s eponymous French restaurant on Manhattan’s Upper East Side the chef says they began using QR codes to eliminate a surface that multiple people touch like a menu for employee and guest safety. But it hasn’t diminished the fine-dining hospitality experience. “Our guests have embraced the contactless menus and have found it to be a simple and straightforward experience to navigate” says Boulud noting that the team is considering maintaining the digital menu option after the threat from the pandemic passes.

Like Serpico’s Pete’s Place restaurants are also tapping the technology to go beyond showcasing menus to inject both utility and unexpected fun. In Los Angeles the QR code on Yunomi Handroll’s takeout bento box shows how to assemble it and Big Bar sells cocktail kits that come with a QR code pointing to a step-by-step instruction video.

QR codes are catching on quickly elsewhere in North America. At La Bartola in Toronto chef and owner Ivan Castro optimizes the takeout experience with “Journey Through Mexico” dinner boxes each one highlighting a different region of his native country. “We wanted to make this a sensorial experience involving sight touch taste and smell but the hearing was missing” Castro says. “So we made a curated playlist to bring you to the place you’re visiting; we used a QR code to make everything easier for our guests to enjoy the journey.” While tucking into Oaxacan tamales and mushroom tlayuda diners can listen to transportive tunes. “It was the most restaurant-y vibe I’ve felt in more than 10 months” says Toronto-based writer Kat Tancock. “It was so nice to have someone else picking the music.”

As QR code use has gained steam in the restaurant industry it’s opened the door for others in the hospitality sector now riding the wave of these new swaths of savvier (and more attentive) consumers. The W Hotel is opening its first outpost in Philadelphia this spring and with the help of advertising agency One Trick Pony have planned for a larger-than-life installation wrapping around their highly trafficked corner of Center City. Complex general manager Ed Baten says he remembers when QR codes first emerged but though they seemed cool and useful interest seemed to fizzle out.

“Then along comes the pandemic and businesses are trying to find ways to communicate and share information” he says. “In particular the hospitality industry has so many pieces of collateral whether it’s a restaurant menu or instructions for how to operate your TV we want to minimize the touch points that might be issues for potential exposure.”

The installation will include an Easter egg hunt–like experience wherein passersby can uncover something different behind each code—a playlist a video highlighting one of the local artists whose work is featured at the hotel or another glimpse into its interior.

While QR codes have become a ubiquitous no-contact menu option for thousands of restaurants and bars and have opened the doors to more creativity and engagement for many others will they stick around when they’re no longer strictly necessary for providing contactless options during a global pandemic? For Eric Martino ThinkFoodGroup’s COO the convenience of using them just makes sense. In restaurants such as the group’s fast-casual concept Beefsteak located on four college campuses Martino sees using the codes to peruse the menu order and pay online making it both quick and convenient. “You can use this almost like a walk-through drive-thru” he notes. “This technology will help the industry move forward outside of the pandemic.”

According to Baten another bonus in using QR codes is that they stay relevant. Though the physical printed matter remains the same it can direct users to an ever-changing website or app. “The way QR codes work our content can be refreshed” he says. “It would never get stale.” The technology has existed for more than 25 years and in America it’s finally arrived.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlYWRlcmxpdmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy8xOTA2ODY0My5tcC13ZWxjb21lcy0xNS1taWxsaW9uLWNhZGJ1cnktaW52ZXN0bWVudC1jaGlyay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MP welcomes £15 million Cadbury investment for Chirk,"The investment will include £11 million to create a new line of the future for Cadbury Dairy Milk tablets as the company consolidates the majority of its tablet production at the site.

MPWR,Monolithic Power Systems,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZW4ueWFiaWxhZGkuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2RldGFpbHMvMTA1NDczL2RpYXNwby1hYmRlbGdoYW5pLWVsLWthY2ltaS1pbnZlc3Rpbmcta25vd2xlZGdlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diaspo #179 : Abdelghani El-Kacimi investing in the knowledge economy to change the world,"Since Monday a one-of-its-kind and accessible-to-everyone online platform has allowed businesses and people to update their connected devices. This project is developed by FotaHub Inc a company created by Moroccan Abdelghani El-Kacimi. The platform is about allowing everyone to benefit from the technologies that it has been developing for years.

Born in Morocco in the village of Ouagrar in the Ouazzane region this businessman spent his entire childhood in the country. After obtaining his baccalaureate in 1989 he chose to go to Germany despite several challenges.

He enrolled in preparatory classes and then went for the engineering school of the University of the Ruhr in Bochum. «Obviously when you arrive in a country there are challenges to overcome. I was 17 when I arrived in Germany I didn't speak German and was financially-challenged» he told Yabiladi.

Born to a modest family made up of a father working as a teacher a stay-at-home mother and seven little brothers and sisters Abdelghani El-Kacimi was nevertheless convinced that «those who work hard make it against all odds».

And that's exactly what he tried to do during his twenty-year-long career. After finishing school in 1998 he did a short one-year stint at world-renowned Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS the design automation division for a year and a half. From there Texas Instruments a world-class American electronics company in the field of electronic components and semiconductors hired him to fill the position of designer of integrated circuits. His penchant for applications and marketing sparked from then-on an «entrepreneurial spirit» in him.

«I had to convince customers to use Texas Instruments products and I saw their problems and how they start.So I said if they know how to do that why not me one day». Abdelghani El-Kacimi

Computing in the world of on-board electronics

Five years later he left the American company for a start-up based in California Monolithic Power Systems MPS. «It was a business that had just left the garage were it was founded. I stayed there for three years because I told myself that we had to work with them to learn entrepreneurship» he recalled.

The Moroccan on the hunt for new opportunities subsequently acquired shares in a German company called Itemis AG in which he became eventually CEO. Pursuing his ambition to change the world he then tried to «unite the world of embedded and industrial computing and the world of classical computing».

To this engineer the gap existing between the analytical mind of a computer engineer and an electronics engineer is enormous and constitutes «one of the biggest brakes for industrial development because these two worlds do not understand each other».

To solve this problem Abdelghani El-Kacimi launched the very advanced computing technologies in the world of on-board electronics. Technologies thanks to which his company became 9 years later a «world leader in the design of complex electronic systems».

In 2017 he went on to develop the FotaHub platform.»Several thousand hours have been spent on work. I told myself that this service was so innovative that it deserved a company for it. So I made a spin off of the company to create a separate and independent entity in Delaware in the United States» he explained. While since its creation the company was catering mostly to a select few private customers it has become open to the public since Monday.

In the meantime Abdelghani El-Kacimi has not forgotten his country of origin to which he remains very attached. In 2011 he responded when the government created the first clusters to lead the microelectronics cluster. He then started planning «to build a bridge between the Moroccan academic world and the industrial world».

Investing in the knowledge economy

But what drives this Moroccan is his conviction that the economy of know-how is the one Morocco must focus on during this century. «We are way behind the Asians and South Americans. But in our MENA region whether for Arab countries or Africa we still have a head start that must be kept» he said.

«We can be the leaders in the knowledge economy in Africa and position ourselves as a pioneer in technology.It is something that concerns me and in which I would like to invest and therefore start in my country». Abdelghani El-Kacimi

It is in this context that his company FotaHub decided to invest in the first Moroccan robot Chama. In addition to this investment the company has also made a commitment to the Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech.

«Through it other Moroccan universities can dive into the world of artificial intelligence and connected objects and be able to do collaborative work between universities and researchers while going through a global platform created by a Moroccan» he proudly said. Via his company the businessman also intends to «make calculating tools available to all Moroccan universities».

«We must also unite entrepreneurs in our country around the idea of investing in know-how. I have invested several million dollars to get to where I am now. I might have slept better if I had an investor in the beginning who had proposed that I do the work and they provide me with financing» he explained.

To Abdelghani El-Kacimi the current challenge remains to «ensure the succession». «I am 49 years old and I worked for about 20 years to get where I am now. I hope it doesn't just end with personal success at my level and that this know-how is passed on. I would like in the next years to participate to the creation of know-how in my country and promote technological independence» he confides.

To this Morocco-born entrepreneur «knowledge is the only inexhaustible raw material by dint of our investing in it».",,,,,,,,,,,,

After sputtering in development several years ago and then being shut down before it saw the light of day the tech giant’s car project is apparently back on track.

Several outlets including CNBC and the Wall Street Journal have reported that Apple is discussing a deal to manufacture a vehicle in the U.S.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment but the company rarely discusses future products.

Given Apple’s status as the world’s most valuable company – it’s worth about $2.3 trillion on the stock market – any new product it's pursuing should be taken seriously.

“We continue to believe it’s a matter of when not if Apple enters the EV race” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note referring to electric vehicles.

But assuming it actually happens what will the vehicle look like what will it cost and how much different will it be from other EVs on the market? We attempt to answer some of those questions below.

Consumer Reports:These are the 10 most and least reliable 2021 cars trucks and SUVs

Will it be an electric vehicle?

Without a doubt. There’s essentially no chance that Apple takes on the competitive market for gasoline vehicles. Expect it to be a battery-powered electric vehicle.

Given the company’s expertise in battery-powered consumer electronics it makes sense that it would attempt to extend that expertise to cars.

“Look for Apple to introduce potentially next-level/game-changing battery tech into its cars” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a research note.

Just keep in mind: Batteries for cars are much different than batteries for consumer electronics. You wouldn’t leave your laptop sitting out in the rain overnight and expect it to work in the morning.

What will it be called?

OK speculators seem to think it will be called iCar. But that might be a little too cute for a product for which you pay tens of thousands of dollars.

Apple’s code name for its car project was Project Titan – at least when it was canceled around 2016 after a couple of years of development.

This much we know: The vehicle won’t be called the Titan. That’s the name of a full-size Nissan pickup truck.

How much will it cost?

Have you ever heard of a cheap Apple product? We didn’t think so. No one is offering a price estimate for an Apple vehicle yet – we don’t even know if it would be a passenger car an SUV a pickup a van or something else altogether.

But it would be shocking if it cost less than the average price of a new vehicle sold in the U.S. in the fourth quarter which topped $40000 according to car-research site Edmunds.

Who will make it?

The reports suggest that Apple is in discussions with the company that manufactures Hyundai and Kia vehicles. The company would make a more than $3 billion investment to assemble the vehicle at a plant in Georgia.

The southeastern U.S. is generally where foreign automakers have gone to assemble their vehicles in large part to avoid the likelihood of a unionization effort in the Midwest where the United Auto Workers represents hourly workers at General Motors Ford and Fiat Chrysler.

Another possibility is that contract manufacturer Magna International will be involved according to Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally. Magna has experience managing complex vehicle production projects for clients.

Will it be a self-driving car?

All the major automakers and numerous tech companies are working on self-driving vehicles in some capacity. And analysts said they’d be surprised if Apple isn’t doing the same.

“Don’t expect steering wheels” Jonas said. “We have a hard time imagining Apple entering the automotive market with a vehicle design that involves human intervention in the driving process.”

He compared an Apple car with a steering wheel to “an iPhone with physical buttons and a coiled rubber cord connected to a wall.”

But a self-driving car could introduce a “longer timeframe” in part due to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s cautious approach to unveiling new products Ives said. Automakers and tech companies have yet to solve the thorniest challenges associated with autonomous driving.

When will it arrive?

It’s at least a few years off. Ives suggested that it could be unveiled as soon as 2024. But will it be ready to produce by then? That seems unlikely.

The pattern in the industry is to announce vehicles that are still a long way out. Tesla has made a habit of revealing cars more than two years before they’re ready to roll out. But it would be natural to expect Apple to begin taking reservations as soon as the car is announced.

Keep in mind that it typically takes three to five years to design and build a new vehicle from scratch so 2024 may require “Herculean-like auto production capabilities” plus solving battery production issues and regulatory hurdles Ives said.

Why now?

Battery technology has improved and advancements in autonomous vehicle systems have reached a point where it might finally be feasible to do an unconventional vehicle.

But there’s another factor that can’t be ignored: the political environment.

“Taking a step back we believe this speaks to what we believe is a golden age of EVs on the horizon with a green tidal wave expected in the US under a Biden Administration and China seeing skyrocketing consumer demand across the board” Ives said.

Bottom line: Biden is expected to support incentives to produce or purchase electric cars which don’t emit climate change-causing emissions like gasoline vehicles do.

Could it all fall apart again?

Yes. Apple’s previous car project was disbanded after it reportedly delivered insufficient results.

Perhaps the greatest risk is that Apple decides it’s just too expensive to dive into auto manufacturing which is where cash can go to die.

Just ask Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He’s openly acknowledged that Tesla came within weeks of running out of money when production of the Model 3 compact car was struggling in 2018.

Apple won't be running out of money any time soon. But shareholders may not react kindly to a money-losing venture when the company's other products are cash cows.

And plenty of it. If we didn’t no get-rich-quick-scheme could be successful.”

Ponzi was onto something that’s worth remembering in this era of GameStop Reddit Robinhood investor revolts and their backlash and not just about the time-honored notion of robbing Peter to pay Paul. He’d tapped into raw elements of human nature. In 1920 he fashioned a get-rich-quick-scheme that contained a perfect cocktail of credibility mixed with enticing reasons to suspend judgment. This was at a time when the United States was facing an economic depression in the aftermath of a brutal World War and a tragic global pandemic.

The people in Boston who bought into Ponzi’s scheme were both rich and poor. The dream attached to his pitch served as the great equalizer. They wanted to believe in Ponzi’s ability to make them richer or at least to suspend disbelief in his scheme for doing so.

Ponzi successfully pedaled the idea of making a 50% return in 90 days — an excellent prospect since banks were offering a mere 4% return annually. One reason it worked so well was that those investing at the beginning did reap the promised returns. So they came back for more and the word spread.

A century later behemoth hedge funds like Melvin Capital Citron Capital Point72 and others while projecting legitimacy offer a promise not too dissimilar from Ponzi’s. The difference now being that they aren’t just relying on individual customers but in an incestuous cadre of Wall Street’s finest. That means they are also backed by lots of institutional money. When one falters if it stands to impact others they will step in to help. Small investors don’t get the same lifelines.

Melvin Capital Management LLC is the legal entity name for an LLC called Buttonwood Plot LLC a Delaware-based LLC (or so it is addressed). According to SEC documents filed in March 2020 the custodians or specialized financial companies that hold or safeguard securities on behalf of Melvin Capital (for a fee) include none other than Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and to a lesser degree J.P. Morgan Securities. The lower the value of Melvin Capital’s securities or loss on short sales the more custodians stand to lose.

Citadel one of Melvin Capital’s backers says on their website they are “Driven by a thirst for knowledge the conviction to move faster and the confidence to be bolder we transform powerful ideas into action every day.”

Indeed. These firms offer their clients opportunities to beat the market for a 1.5-2% management fee and a percentage of any upside (they generally get a fee regardless). The bigger hedge funds have a secret sauce though. So do asset management giants like BlackRock or Vanguard. Thanks to the 1999 repeal of the Great Depression era Glass-Steagall Act that had once separated bank deposits from other banking activities so do Wall Street mega-banks. These institutional bullies bag profits through the use of trillions of dollars of at their core other people’s money.

WallStreetBets on Reddit

Now jumping forward to the GameStop phenomenon there are two main things to consider. First when retail individuals invest or speculate in the markets they are generally doing it with their own money. They don’t have the advantage of size to compete at the same level. They aren’t able to see or move market flows by their sheer financial immensity unless they band together. It’s just math. Even then the odds are heavily against them.

The casino almost always wins in the end. That’s why what those on Reddit started was the equivalent of a labor union only it was financial solidarity acting in concert and with specific targets. Some people are even calling it a sort of Occupy Wall Street 2.0. But what it boils down to is the desire to make money like the big boys plain and simple. Calling multi-billion-dollar hedge funds out on routine market manipulation and massive influence on the markets in the process was a cool bonus.

Secondly though the ethos of WallStreetBets reflected Wall Street itself in moniker and mode they weren’t discussing insider information just circulating strategies through an 8.5-million-member group strong that caught on. In that respect they were doing what Wall Street and corporate CEOs do every time they tout the success of their company on any business news station. They just achieved quicker more amplified results.

It comes down to this. The big boys don’t want anyone else playing in their sandbox. They are scared that WallStreetBets could redefine that sandbox. It’s not just monetary losses they fear but the threat of massive outflows of cash that thought was terrifying. So they closed rank.

Robinhood the app whose mission statement is to “democratize finance for all” was but one mechanism to transact retail trades. TD America was another. There are many. In the age of trillions of dollars of Fed-created cheap money what we’ve seen is the fueling of an epic disconnect between the market and the real economy. Online brokerage firms fell over themselves to compete with each other by offering zero-fee transaction services fractional shares and options platforms to retail customers.

The trajectory of a monetary policy on steroids following the financial crisis is a natural one. Regular people are now simply doing what the big boys have done forever just in greater numbers.

Is this a great victory to enable ordinary people to gamble in the same way the billionaire investor class can? Perhaps. But only if people understand the risks. For what soars unnaturally can plummet more quickly. GameStop having hit a stratospheric $483 per share nose-dived below $100 days later leaving retailers late to the party facing steep losses.

There are lessons to learn here but they might be missed. Bipartisan politicians are advocating for the retail investor and gains made while wanting to “protect” them against losses ostensibly from their naivety. Yet the real focus should be on the Wall Street suits operating the casino not the individuals dealing the cards. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s initial letter calling on Robinhood’s leadership to explain why it had “abruptly changing the rules” during the GameStop situation is a good place to start. But the net needs to be cast wider. The government should examine whether brokerages are in fact offering their retail customers the exact same prices and services that large firms get routinely.

The American people also deserve to know what financial firms were involved behind the scenes and with better access to information including the details behind any hedge fund’s participation. In the era of Too Big to Fail regulators should also decide whether hedge funds like those involved with GameStop should have more oversight. Understanding and closely monitoring or restricting certain behaviors of these mammoth institutions might not level the playing field — but it would be a good step toward making it a safer more transparent one.

The biggest secret revealed by the war between supposed smart money and the little-guy investors of Reddit is that the stock market has relatively little to do with productive investment. Daily investing has almost nothing to do with a company raising money for research and development. It is also driven far less by the fundamental value of companies. It moves too quickly for that. Massive deregulation with an exuberant monetary policy has made the Wall Street casino a larger speculators’ playground than ever before. The only difference now is that more of the spectators want to get in on the action.

Maybe if savings rates weren’t almost zero the frenzy to enter into equities would have been a less enticing prospect for the Wall Street firms that made record trading profits last year or for the small investor. But it’s not. During an unprecedented pandemic leaving millions dead economies in lockdown around the world and the worst economic decline since World War II Wall Street still came out on top.

So let’s give credit for the democratization of financial markets where it’s really due. Thank you Federal Reserve for killing the notion that fundamental value drives stocks individually instead of cheap money generally. Thank you Ben Bernanke Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell for your stewardship in “holding the line” for Wall Street.

Thank you to the Treasury Department which could issue debt cheaply because of Fed policy and thus pay less attention to where it goes and whether it has long-term impact. Thank you Hank Paulson Tim Geithner Jack Lew and Steve Mnuchin for collaborating with the Fed on that matter.

Thank you Democrats who claimed Dodd-Frank reforms crafted in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 would fix the covert connections of Wall Street banks with hedge funds. Not only did you allow Wall Street to keep converting depositors into fee-paying customers of their asset management arms and online brokerage platforms but you allowed for high-frequency trading to run a rigged stock market. Thank you Republicans for weakening Dodd-Frank further.

Thank you to both parties for not having the guts to resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act to keep the big banks from finding endless ways to use other people’s money to back speculation with no tangible benefit to Main Street. Thank you Think Tank Row in Washington for taking money from Wall Street and financial firm billionaires while overlooking how much the deck is stacked.

As for WallStreetBets infiltrating what’s now become a more-inclusive trading floor means more of the game has been exposed. What’s unfolding is something even Mr. Ponzi would envy.

Yonhap



By Lee Min-hyung



Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have reportedly abandoned their position as large short-selling holders of shares of Celltrion and HLB two Korean stocks most vulnerable to the trading practice amid an escalating fear that they could end up mired in a possible Korean version of the GameStop saga.



According to the Korea Exchange the two major investment banks were excluded from a list of ""large short-selling holders"" for Celltrion and HLB respectively as of Feb. 1.



Officials from Credit Suisse declined to comment on details over the issue saying that they were not authorized to speak on market issues.



Investors with the position refer to those whose short-selling balance exceeds 0.5 percent of outstanding shares of a listed firm here.



The move is seen as part of their movement to hedge risks amid concerns over the possibility of heavy losses as in the recent ""stock war"" between U.S. hedge funds and retail investors surrounding GameStop.



This is the first time since January 2018 that Goldman Sachs has been excluded from the list. It also marks the first time for Credit Suisse since April 2019.



For now only two companies ― Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley ― retain the status for Celltrion. Three global investment banks ― Merrill Lynch Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Global Market Securities ― also have more than 0.5 percent of shares for short-selling in HLB.



But with Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse abandoning the position the balance of short-selling for the two Korean biopharmaceutical firms has declined by a huge margin. As of Feb. 1 Celltrion's short-selling balance reached 4.92 million shares up 1 million from the previous trading day. The portion of the short-selling balance out of outstanding shares reached 3.65 percent. This is the first time in more than four years that the figure dropped to the 3-percent range.



The short-selling balance of HLB also came in at 2.77 million shares down by 520000 during the same period. The short-selling balance portion also dropped to 5.24 percent from the previous 6.22 percent. This is the lowest in more than two years since October 2018.



On the same day foreign investors engaged in a mass buying spree of Celltrion and HLB proving that the two investment banks launched a massive short-covering campaign to prevent them from being stuck with huge losses.



""Chances are that the investment banks' decision to reduce their short-selling balance of the two Korean companies was due to escalating worries of a Korean version of the GameStop saga"" an official from the investment industry said explaining why the two banks took preemptive measures.



""Retail investors are asked to remain thoughtful before purchasing bio shares vulnerable to short-selling disputes"" the source said.



In January Melvin Capital a hedge fund based in the U.S. is known to have lost around 53 percent of its total capital by betting against retail investors in GameStop. The estimated loss from for investors ― including Citron Research another big hedge fund along with Melvin ― betting GameSaga would fall is known to reach $5 billion.



A dispute surrounding short-selling is a major talking point here after the financial authorities decided to extend a ban on short-selling until May 2. This came in response to a growing call from retail investors that the resumption of the practice only favored foreign and institutional investors.

In light of this the Department of Health has issued health directions on the management of human remains that died of Covid-19 which prescribes measures to be implemented.

A local funeral parlour in Alberton Mosaic Funeral Group has confirmed that it has conducted at least 140 funerals in January alone due to Covid-19 related deaths.

Not only has this brought strain upon coffin manufacturers but flower companies are also said to be under pressure leaving mourners without a great deal of choice.

Martin Brits of Mosaic Funeral Group said this has led his staff to work overtime and that they have resorted to employing part-time workers to assist during this demanding time. Now more than ever the funeral industry is reportedly under immense pressure due to the high number of Covid-19 related deaths.

Mabore Sefara of AVBOB Funeral Service said that the pandemic is taking a toll on its funeral service employees.

“Our employees have been working 24/7 the past few weeks to ensure continuous service to our customers from collecting a loved one to arranging a funeral. We are arranging more funerals than usual in certain areas 300% more than the previous year” said Sefara.

Wrapping of coffins

In light of this the Department of Health has issued health directions on the management of human remains that died of Covid-19 which prescribes measures to be implemented.

This is after the department received reports of coffins of people who died of Covid-19 being wrapped with plastic. In some cases human remains are also reported to be wrapped inside and coffins marked with biohazard stickers prior to burial.

The Department of Health then arranged a meeting with interested and affected parties in the management of human remains. It announced that these directions do not prescribe the covering of coffins with plastics use of biohazard stickers or wearing full PPE by funeral directors. Or sanitising of the graves or clothes of people attending the funeral as this is unnecessary.

The public and the industry are advised that the measures prescribed are evidence-based and may change as and when new evidence is presented.

“Human remains can be buried either in a body bag or be wrapped in a shroud or blanket as the case may be. The body bag can be used for medical reasons or the family may decide to bury using these body bags” it announced.

The department has also regulated the number of people that can attend funeral gatherings to reduce the possible exposure to the disease.

Burial compliance

Ekurhuleni environmental health practitioners (EHP) have committed to monitor funeral undertakers and mortuary premises in light of the pandemic.

The EHPs are said to work tirelessly to inspect mortuaries and funeral undertaker premises. This is to ensure that preparation storage and preservation of human remains are conducted in line with the regulations relating to the management of human remains.

MMC for Health and Social Services councillor Nomadlozi Nkosi stated that the CoE issues a Certificate of Competence (CoC) in terms of regulations relating to human remains.

According to Zweli Dlamini City’s spokesperson EHPs monitor all funeral gatherings to ensure compliance with all health protocols under the Covid-19 level three regulations.

Dlamini said healthcare practitioners also visit the families of the deceased to provide education on necessary health protocols. This is said to ensure all health and safety protocols are adhered to during funeral proceedings.

Simply sign up to the ESG investing myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

A foundation backed by Ikea the Swedish furniture retail giant has committed $250m to seed a sustainable equity fund designed by Osmosis a specialist investment boutique.

The allocation by Imas an €11bn foundation that invests on behalf of the charitable arm of Ikea is the second large contract it has awarded to Osmosis.

The new Osmosis resource-efficient ex-fossil fuel fund aims to outperform the market capitalisation-weighted MSCI World index by investing in companies that score well environmentally. Around 170 constituents of the MSCI World index which holds around 1430 companies have been excluded from the new Osmosis strategy. As a result the portfolio’s exposure to both carbon pollution and water consumption is reduced by two-thirds and waste output by almost half compared with the MSCI index.

Henrik Lundin chief investment officer at Imas said he believed the strategy would produce better risk-adjusted returns by taking explicit account of the environmental costs resulting from carbon pollution water consumption and waste creation.

“The Osmosis strategy is a clever source of alpha. It should ultimately deliver outperformance over the MSCI World index” said Lundin.

It is important when divesting from fossil fuels that cuts are also made to water consumption and waste creation which are also environmental risks

Imas provided $270m in 2017 as seed capital for a sister Osmosis resource-efficient fund that also prioritises investments in companies with a good record on carbon emissions water usage and waste. That fund has delivered cumulative net returns (after fees) of 54 per cent compared with a 50 per cent return for the MSCI World.

“It is important when divesting from fossil fuels that cuts are also made to water consumption and waste creation which are also environmental risks” said Ben Dear who co-founded Osmosis in 2009.

Clean water is a scarce resource that requires energy for purification while huge amounts of plastic waste end up in the oceans or polluted landfills causing damage to the natural environment.

Although a rebound in oil prices from their depressed levels was possible as the global economy recovers from the pandemic the longer-term outlook “looks bleak for companies involved in the carbon-based energy sector” said Dear.

Osmosis which counts the Oxford university endowment as both a shareholder and investor now oversees assets of $2bn. It won its first Australian pension client in November after securing a mandate from the A$50bn Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation.

Climate change themed funds were among the biggest sellers in Europe last year as investors stepped up efforts to protect their portfolios from climate change risks.

Assets in European sustainable funds surged 52 per cent in the past year to hit €1.1tn in December. Flows in 2020 were almost double those of 2019 at €233bn.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A surge in online commerce led to a record number of new users more than 72 million and a substantial increase in total payment volume. On top of that PayPal introduced key new products like cryptocurrency investing QR codes and the option to buy now and pay later.

""We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year and we will step up that pace in 2021"" CEO Dan Schulman said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. Here are five products the company has planned for 2021 and what it all means for investors.

1. Investing

PayPal launched its cryptocurrency investing service in October last year and management says it's seen excellent traction so far. This year the company will expand the ability to buy sell and hold cryptocurrency to new international markets and increase the number of investment options. Additionally Schulman says the investing product won't be limited to cryptocurrency leaving the door open for PayPal to facilitate stock trading this year as well.

Rival payments company Square is way ahead of PayPal when it comes to making investing easy for its users. Square saw strong adoption among its Cash App users when it introduced bitcoin investing in 2017 and it expanded to stocks last year. Management says users that invest through Cash App generate much more gross profit for Square than those that merely use it for peer-to-peer payments.

PayPal can expect similar user behaviors to result in similar financial outcomes. But with a much larger user base than Square it can benefit more from its scale.

2. Spending cryptocurrency

When PayPal introduced the ability to buy cryptocurrency in its app it promised the ability to use crypto as a funding source for payments at some point in the future. Schulman said that capability will start rolling out later this quarter.

The ability to spend cryptocurrency through PayPal could lead to even greater adoption of the platform as a wallet to store funds. The number of merchants currently accepting direct payment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is extremely limited. The process of exchanging cryptocurrency for an exact amount of fiat currency can be cumbersome and fees on small transactions currently make it impractical. PayPal could make spending cryptocurrency simple.

3. Enhanced bill pay

The company has been working on getting bill payments off the ground since it entered a strategic partnership with Paymentus at the start of 2019. It's seen growing engagement in bill pay transactions over the back half of the year and investors can expect 2021 to be the year bill pay comes to the consumer PayPal app.

Bill pay will give PayPal access to payments it historically hasn't been able to capture. While the take rate for billers is lower than its standard take rate for retail merchants the cost is much lower as well. Bill payments are usually made with ACH or a debit card instead of a credit card. CFO John Rainey told analysts to focus on transaction margin instead of take rate during the buy-side analyst call after PayPal's third-quarter earnings report.

4. Budget and savings tools

PayPal could introduce budget and savings tools to its wallet in 2021. It's likely PayPal would offer those tools free to its users as such features would encourage users to store more funds in their PayPal wallets and then use those funds for transactions instead of more expensive (for PayPal) card payments.

Adding services and features users can't get with most banks will make it more likely they switch from a traditional bank to something like a PayPal Cash Plus account. The company can generate additional revenue from those accounts with its linked debit card and other bank-like services.

5. Honey's shopping tools

PayPal acquired Honey at the end of 2019 and Schulman had a grand vision for how Honey's shopping tools can fit into PayPal. In 2021 we'll see the early integrations of Honey with PayPal including wish lists price monitoring deals coupons and rewards.

Notably Schulman said he wants to offer those features both online and when shoppers use PayPal in stores. Automatically using an offer from Honey would be one more reason for people to use PayPal in stores instead of a credit card. The company has made similar progress by working with credit card companies' rewards products.

On the merchant end Honey's integration with PayPal gives merchants the ability to target offers to specific demographics and spending profiles. And ultimately Schulman sees Honey as being able to develop a demand curve for any product on the internet and PayPal will help people automatically purchase it when it hits their price.

What all these new products mean for investors

PayPal is quickly evolving from an online payment solution to a financial super app. It's a strategy that's worked well for Square which once said it wants to replace your bank but PayPal is quickly catching up and outshining its smaller competitor.

""Each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value"" Schulman said on theearnings call ""Consequently I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates.""

More engagement across the app means more transaction volume and more revenue for PayPal. This scale drives operating leverage and CFO John Rainey expects modest operating margin expansion this year.

(NASDAQ:CSOD) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business so we would like to shine some light on the company. Cornerstone OnDemand Inc. together with its subsidiaries provides learning and people development solutions through software-as-a-service model worldwide. The US$3.0b market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of US$4.1m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$32m leading to an even wider gap between loss and breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Cornerstone OnDemand will turn a profit with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate.

View our latest analysis for Cornerstone OnDemand

According to the 8 industry analysts covering Cornerstone OnDemand the consensus is that breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2021 before turning a profit of US$49m in 2022. Therefore the company is expected to breakeven just over a year from now. What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit we calculated an average annual growth rate of 78% which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.

We're not going to go through company-specific developments for Cornerstone OnDemand given that this is a high-level summary but keep in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.

One thing we would like to bring into light with Cornerstone OnDemand is its debt-to-equity ratio of over 2x. Typically debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity and the company has considerably exceeded this. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk in investing in the loss-making company.

Software itself is a broad term encompassing many different products designed for different tasks. There are two main classifications of software which are System Software and Application Software. System software is a computer program designed to work as a platform for other software while taking care of the computer’s hardware and internal functions. Examples of system software are Operating Systems such as Windows by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and IOS by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  or Utility Software such as McAfee Antivirus by McAfee (NASDAQ: MCFE). Application software on the other hand is software that is made with the intent to help users perform specific tasks. Most people know these as “apps” which can be downloaded on mobile phones or desktop computers. Examples of recognizable application software are web browsers such as Google Chrome by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) and image editor Adobe Photoshop by Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE).

While it is true that the software industry is dominated by American companies in recent years Canadian companies have also begin to make their mark in this sector making it one of the leading countries for software development. According to globalnewswire.com the Canadian market is forecasted to grow at 7.2 percent over the 2020-2027 time period. The Toronto-Waterloo Corridor is even referred to as Canada’s Silicon Valley with the second highest density of technology startups in the world.

A study of over 60 business groups with least ₹10000-crore market capitalisation shows that their combined m-cap has more than doubled to ₹108-lakh crore riding as they did the rip-roaring rally in the stock market from the Covid nadirs less than 11 months ago.

In this march as many as 46 groups (70 per cent) out-performed the blue-chip index the Sensex in terms of the rise from the market lows. The benchmark has gained 90 per cent between March 24 2020 and February 5 2021.

Biggest contributors

No surprises for guessing who stole the march. The ₹56-lakh crore m-cap addition for the period is led by business houses such as the Tatas (₹8.7-lakh crore m-cap) HDFC group (₹7.6-lakh crore) Reliance-Mukesh Ambani group (₹6.7-lakh crore) Bajaj group (₹3.7- lakh crore) and the Adanis (₹3.1 lakh crore).

For the Tata Group TCS led the charge with ₹5.2-lakh-crore m-cap rise followed by Tata Motors (₹81303 crore) and Titan (₹61608 crore). HDFC Group wealth was driven by the veterans — HDFC Bank (₹4.5-lakh crore) and HDFC (₹2.3-lakh crore). Reliance-Mukesh Ambani Group’s m-cap rise was mainly by Reliance Industries (₹6.6-lakh crore). Bajaj Group’s wealth grew on the back of Bajaj Finance (₹1.8-lakh crore) and Bajaj Finserv (₹83 066 crore). Adani Group’s m-cap jump was supported by Adani Green (₹1.46-lakh crore) and Adani Ports (₹68054 crore).

Pecking order

In the top-10 only Adani and Bharti groups saw major change in ranks in this period. The wealth created by the Adani Group led by billionaire Gautam Adani saw the business house jump several notches since March 2020 lows.

It has moved up from the 11th to the 5th rank thanks to the massive spike in stocks such as Adani Green Adani Enterprises and Adani Transmission. However Bharti Group slipped from the 5th to the 9th rank as the over-hang of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues as well competition from R-Jio dampened sentiment around the Airtel stock.

Outside the top-10 club rank changes were witnessed in cases such as Hinduja Group moving from 29th to the 16th spot thanks to the jump in Ashok Leyland and IndusInd Bank shares and JSW Group moving from 22nd to 17th rank on account of gains clocked by JSW Holdings and JSW Steel.

The fastest and slowest

In terms of fastest wealth addition (in percentage terms) the list is led by Adani Group (272 per cent) Hinduja Group (256 per cent) Raunaq Singh Group (235 per cent; thanks to the spike in Apollo Tyres shares) and Naveen Jindal Group (231 per cent; on account of the sharp jump in Jindal Steel stock) All these groups have seen their respective m-cap quadruple from March 2020 lows.

Among the conglomerates with slowest wealth rise are Dabur Group (30 per cent) Torrent Group (41 per cent) UB Group and Nusli Wadia group (54 per cent each)."

The traditionally cagey streaming giant has recently begun offering more insights into what subscribers are watching and in that context the list – which analyses data by country is updated daily and mostly appears about halfway down the landing page – made sense.

That is until we started seeing what we were actually watching.

The top 10 – in Australia at least – turned out to be a bizarre jumble of content totally untethered from previous understandings of a “hit”. It regularly contains a shambolic scattering of glossy tentpoles critical write-offs and total oddities.

@netflix top 10 in Australia is a fucking ride at the moment. Holy shit. Some horror. Some drama. Some boobs. Some real life crime. Lockdown clearly does strange things to people's brains. — Jason Steen (@Steen_Dr) August 8 2020

In the 30 or so days leading up to this article it housed expected wins (Bridgerton The Queen’s Gambit) nestled among long-forgotten flops (1996’s Masterminds) C-listers starring in B-movies (The 2nd led by Ryan Phillippe and Casper Van Dien) and critically panned nightmares (The Wrong Missy). What exactly is going on?

apparently The Cat in the Hat is top 10 on Netflix Australia today??? Glad to see everyone has well & truly cooked it. — rob (@rob_etc_) April 10 2020

While the selection may seem random at first it actually reveals a lot about the platform’s approach to content and the audience it serves. Netflix doesn’t make money from acclaimed hits or respected output; it succeeds by coaxing people to spend massive amounts of time on their site. This is done in two ways: by having enough content to accommodate any person in any mood; and then by making sure they don’t close the tab.

The first approach explains much of the eclecticism of the regional top 10 list. Netflix’s power lies in milking everyone’s micro tastes through its infamous algorithm. This dance of AI data science and machine learning explodes traditional hierarchies of what gets seen (or served). As Wired explained in 2017 it has helped to “find shows that [viewers] might not have initially chosen”. Rather than suggesting programs based on genres you’ve gravitated to before the algorithm throws up recommendations informed by patterns in watched content that you might not have even been aware of.

That’s why films you haven’t thought about in decades appear arbitrarily in the national top 10 (2004’s White Chicks made a recent cameo). They’re coasting on a wave of viewers watching what a computer sees as a comparable smash starring a similar star. That pathway also elevates more specialty output that might not have survived the competitive juggernaut of mainstream film and TV releases. This trend is sometimes referred to as the “Netflix effect”. It’s how shows that flopped or vanished on other channels (like the bingeable thriller You which originally fizzled on Lifetime) can reappear as breakouts.

With almost 12 millions Netflix subscribers in Australia (almost 47% of the population) unorthodox hand-delivered recommendations can accumulate enough momentum to crack the top 10. While the audience was always there a more traditional programming structure could have been hesitant to give them a chance to be known let alone watched.

All that data Netflix collects tells it not only what to serve but also what to make. Endless user insights lead to fine-crafted Netflix Originals targeted at highly specific audiences whom it understands on a near-cellular level. For every prestige darling like Marriage Story there’s Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: a sexy teen reboot that manages to align cannibalism devil worship and patricide with several high school theatre-inspired song and dance numbers.

If a perky protagonist balancing homework with her desire to rule hell feels like a chaotic combination of ideas it’s because it wasn’t crafted for you. Sabrina exists for the frothing devotees of Riverdale who like their girls next door to battle serial killers and organ-harvesting cult leaders. There just happen to be enough of them to push both shows into your eye line on the top 10 list.

Mountains of viewers data and content combine to explain much of the weirdness of the top 10. But the ranking has another stand-out feature: a prevalence of bland often derivative rating wins that appear to have few real world champions (looking at you Virgin River).

Kyle Chayka named this trend “ambient TV” in a piece for the New Yorker. Writing about Emily in Paris a show that wasn’t good or visibly even liked but still dominated global Netflix top 10 lists he wrote: “The purpose of Emily in Paris is to provide sympathetic background for staring at your phone refreshing your own feeds – on which you’ll find Emily in Paris memes including a whole genre of TikTok remakes.” He describes the show as “soothing slow and relatively monotonous” where “nothing bad ever happens to our heroine for long” thus capturing a relatable glassy-eyed viewing experience that has welcomed a new genre of top shows that aren’t so much “bad” as just kind of boring.

It clarifies the presence of culturally quieter programs like The Alienist (that no one really talks or writes about but apparently does watch) but also familiar-looking hits like Bridgerton and The Crown. A decade ago shows needed to keep you interested to sustain an audience in the week between episodes. In this new economy of time – and the careful art of not disrupting the flow of it – being snoozy can be as valuable as being watchable.

The top 10’s strangeness highlights new realities in how we watch and judge TV and movies. But it also reinforces old ones. Namely how disconnected the media’s impression of “successful” or “good” content is from what people actually consume. That has always been true but becomes more apparent when we’re allowed to freely gorge exactly what we want.

Even before Netflix began making surreal content grafted directly from our frontal lobes entertainment writing had begun to shift. Last century a critic’s job was to tell you if something was good or not. Now there’s too much content to attempt that. As a result what’s written about isn’t what people are generally watching; it’s what people who like to read and write about media are relating to. As such TV and movie criticism becomes narrower even more about the individual – their relationships experiences – and people like them.

Viewed like that the top 10 isn’t so chaotic. Rather it provides a clear-eyed view of who we really are by showing what we really want. As it turns out that’s random often bad and kind of boring. But if you also binge-watched Emily in Paris while looking at your phone you knew that already.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC1iaWdnZXN0LWNvbXBhbmllcy1jb21wZXRpbmctbmV0ZmxpeC0xNDMxMTYwNTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Biggest Companies Competing With Netflix,"10 most profitable movies of all timeIn this article we are going to list the 10 biggest companies competing with Netflix. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest companies competing with Netflix.

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has revolutionized streaming like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has e-commerce or Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has retail. I am sure most of the people reading this article will have Netflix and why not? I do even though the library in my country is probably half that of anywhere else.

While you might think that Netflix only came into existence a few years ago but the company was actually established way back in 1997. Of course in those days it didn't offer streaming services mainly because the internet at the time across most places in the world was insufficient to host streaming even in 360p let alone in HD or 4K. Even in the early 2000s high internet speed was a luxury few people could afford and buffering even a music video in low resolution was a chore most internet connections strained against. I remember trying to watch a 3 minute music video in 2003 and waiting for hours for the video to load. Now I can watch a 4K movie on Netflix without feeling any sort of lag at all.

Initially Netflix would rent out DVDs. The owners of Netflix had just come off a successful sale of their computer mail-order company selling it for $700 million and getting the idea of Netflix. In fact it was Amazon which had inspired them and they decided that they wanted to sell or rent products online and initially considered VHS tapes but realized they were too bulky and DVDs would be much easier and profitable to ship. And thus Netflix was born.

Initially the company had less than 1000 titles and just 30 employees but business started to grow steadily and in 1999 the company introduced the subscription method which it still employs today. Instead of paying separate rent for each DVD you took you just payed a monthly subscription fee and you could in exchange rent as many titles as you wanted. This method was so successful that the single rental model was entirely phased out by 2000. Since it had no due dates or late fee charges along with unlimited rentals it started to grow in size and stature and had nearly 300000 subscribers in 2000 providing major competition to Blockbuster. However despite gaining subscribers the company was actually still making losses worth millions of dollars and Blockbuster offered to buy it off for $50 million to boost its online presence a deal with Netflix rejected and I think we can all breathe a sigh of relief that the deal didn't go through or else we might have been deprived of the Netflix we have today.

Story continues

It was in the mid-2000s that Netflix moved to streaming as internet speed had improved significantly and lower costs of procuring internet connections led to more households getting high speed internet which finally made it feasible to provide movies online. On the other hand the popularity of Netflix's DVDs started to dwindle and even though the company rented its 1000th DVD back in 2007 it started to move away from this business and focus exclusively on providing streaming content. And even though Netflix had gained significant popularity in the United States it was still not quite as well known outside of the country. To counter this Netflix started its global expansion and became available in several countries across the world along with also obtaining the rights to international content and providing it to its subscribers as well. Currently Netflix has close to 200 million subscribers across the world and has become a really profitable company. It is also responsible for bringing niche international shows into the mainstream. An example of this would be La Casa De Papel or Money Heist which is a Spanish show and would've died in obscurity until Netflix picked up the rights and the show's popularity boomed across the world resulting in several more seasons and the stars of the show becoming international celebrities. Due to its video recommendation algorithm subscribers are also suggested indie titles which the users might like which has been a boost for these indie studios too.

The best thing about Netflix is the fact that it constantly aims to improve the user experience. I mean I love the skip opening credits button giving me the option of having to listen to the same credits especially when binging while the fact that it automatically skips closing credits when you're binging one episode after the other is really helpful too. Of course it does get annoying sometimes when you're browsing TV shows and movies only for the trailer of the movie to begin midway but Netflix has even added an option to disable autoplay which shows that it listens to its consumers and is ready to tailor the process and providing a best fit solution as well. And perhaps the biggest thing going for Netflix is the fact that it is extremely easy to use and there are no ads or commercials allowing you to watch your movie or TV show without any interruptions whatsoever. In fact Netflix is so easy to use that many people I know who used to pirate movies have instead turned to Netflix because of its convenience and hence moved from illegal activities to legal activities as well.

In recent years Netflix has gotten so huge that it has spent over a billion dollars in producing original content which includes both TV shows and movies. Some of its content has been incredibly well-received by both critics and subscribers such as House of Cards Stranger Things Dark Narcos and the Queen's Gambit among many others. However it has also had a lot of shows and movies which have failed to make a similar impact such as Richie Rich The Open House Paradox Sextuplets The Last Thing He Wanted and many others. This basically means that it is a bet to start any Netflix show and know whether you'll get excellent quality or a mediocre production.

However whether you're a fan of the content being produced by Netflix or not what you can't deny is the power and influence the company has which has even allowed it to challenge major movie studios. If you take a look at the richest movie stars right now the one thing you'll notice is that a lot of their earnings come from Netflix rather than major movie studios. In fact in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic shutting everything down across the world including production of content major movie stars instead padded their earnings with movie deals and content deals with Netflix with Dwayne Johnson the highest paid actor in the world receiving $25 million from Netflix for working on Red Notice with Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds. And you can only see Netflix content if you have a subscription which is why original content is a move by Netflix to gain more and more subscribers and improve their earnings even more. And if things continue this way Netflix will soon be a major competitor to movie studios. The company has also made its presence in prestigious awards ceremonies such as the Oscars where it has garnered multiple nominations for its original content.

Speaking of the pandemic perhaps no year was as important to Netflix as 2020. As billions of people across the globe were confined to their homes as the pandemic devastated the world there was little for them to which is why many resorted to watching Netflix which in turn saw demand for its content increase significantly. It got to the point that the European government requested Netflix to reduce the bit rates it take people to stream content to allow more people to stream content without any issues. This was done to reduce Netflix traffic on European servers and enable them to work without issue. I can easily say personally at least that lockdown would've had been a lot more difficult had Netflix not been available to me and the monthly fee I pay to access hundreds of hours of content including some of my favorite TV shows is absolutely worth it.

However other companies have started to realize the importance of entering the lucrative streaming market. While a few years ago there were hardly any major competitors to Netflix this has all changed with times and many major companies have started to provide streaming options as well including the production of original content which has led to the market becoming saturated. While this has benefits for viewers including more accessible content than ever before there is a downside that if someone loves five shows available on five different streaming services the person has to shill out the monthly subscription frees for five services which is purely unstainable. These streaming companies have been able to make a dent in Amazon's market share in the content streaming industry. So without further ado let's take a look at the biggest competitors to Netflix starting with number 10:

Two men who appeared on the Netflix docuseries “Cheer” have been arrested and charged in separate sex crime cases involving minors authorities said.

The arrests on Wednesday of Mitchell Ryan and Robert Joseph Scianna came nearly five months after federal prosecutors in Chicago accused “Cheer” star Jeremiah “Jerry” Harris of “enticing an underage boy to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself.” He was later indicted on additional charges.

The “Cheer” docuseries follows the cheerleading squad from Navarro College in Corsicana Texas. The series debuted on Netflix in January 2020.

Ryan 23 was arrested by police in Coppell Texas on a charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child on July 24 according to Dallas County Sheriff’s Department records.

Details of the case were not immediately available. CNN has reached out to police and prosecutors for additional information.

Ryan was booked on Thursday and released early the next morning on $50000 bond.

“Mitch and his family were surprised by this arrest” Ryan’s attorney Jeremy Rosenthal told CNN Saturday. “There are two sides to every story and we are confident Mitch’s name will be cleared.”

Ryan was a member of the Navarro College squad featured in “Cheer” but is not on the current roster.

Scianna a two-time World Champion cheerleader was arrested in Virginia after soliciting sex from a juvenile online through a social media platform according to Chesterfield County Police.

Scianna 25 is charged with taking indecent liberties with a child and using an electronic communication device to solicit sex police said. He arranged to meet a juvenile whom he came to know through social media for sex police said in a statement.

He was being held in the Chesterfield County Jail without bond police said.

CNN has reached out to Scianna for comment. It was unclear if he has an attorney.

Chesterfield County Police are still investigating and asked anyone with information to contact them.

Scianna’s website says he is a National Cheerleaders Association Champion Majors Champion and a two-time World Champion who has cheered for numerous programs in the US and traveled to more than 13 countries coaching and choreographing routines.

Scianna appeared in one episode of “Cheer” where he posed for a late-night photo shoot with another famous cheerleader Gabi Butler.

In December Harris was indicted on new federal charges of allegedly enticing minors to engage in sexual activity including soliciting them to send him sexually explicit photos or videos of themselves according to court documents.

A lawsuit filed by two accusers in September alleged that Harris “exploited his popularity and position of fame with young male cheer athletes” and that he often attempted to make them “meet Harris in secluded locations at various competitions soliciting sexual conduct with these boys.”

A spokesperson for Harris said in September: ‘We categorically dispute the claims made against Jerry Harris which are alleged to have occurred when he was a teenager.”

A Netflix spokesperson in a statement after the lawsuit was filed said: “Like everyone we are shocked by this news. Any abuse of minors is a terrible crime and we respect the legal process.”

CNN has reached out to Netflix for comment on the latest arrests."

Another says that the best place to find a new mine is near an existing mine. Exploration investors might be mindful of these expressions when considering which companies to invest in. North American investors are fortunate that there are many opportunities in their own backyard.

Canada and the United States are blessed with an abundance of natural resources enabling investors to focus on opportunities closer to home. Mining companies are in a constant search for new opportunities and often find them in faraway lands. Developing countries often seek help from developed countries to boost their economies and often the best mechanism to unlock a country’s economic viability is by exploiting its resources.

Exploration companies often receive favourable incentives such as tax deferrals to prospect in underexplored jurisdictions and it can often result in higher profitability for mining operations. Fortunately for North American investors Mexico is in the vicinity and it is one of the world’s premier mining jurisdictions while being an economic powerhouse in its own right.

Mineral Production In Mexico

The arrival of Spanish Conquistadors in Mexico 500 years ago was marked by an intense search for gold and silver to provide the capital Spain required for its global adventures and expansion abroad. Gold and silver were sent home on ships. As the territory evolved into present-day Mexico mining became one of the principal contributors to the Mexican economy and helped transform the country into the economic giant it is now. In addition to gold and silver copper zinc tin and other metals are actively mined.

Today Mexico is the world’s largest silver producer with 17% of the world’s silver production and the worlds 8th largest gold producer. While mining occurs throughout Mexico this article will focus on the two primary mining regions in Mexico Sonora and Zacatecas.

The states of Sonora and Zacatecas collectively account for roughly 55% of Mexico’s mining GDP. In 2019 the state of Zacatecas produced 2124.48 metric tonnes of Silver accounting for 36.4% of Mexico’s silver production followed by Chihuahua which produced 1.2 million metric tonnes Sonora state accounted for one third of Mexico’s gold production in 2019 with 36.2 metric tonnes produced followed by Guerrero state with 18.7% from 20.4 metric tonnes of gold.

Sonora has a climate that enables year-long operations well established infrastructure and a skilled workforce to support the mining industry including an abundant supply of water and power and an excellent road system. The Mexican government is very mining friendly as the industry employs hundreds of thousands of workers and it collects a steady stream of royalty payments from producers.

The Regulatory Framework

Mining is enshrined in Mexico’s constitution with mineral exploration and exploitation having a preference over any other land use. Laws exist to provide a well defined mining regime which operates under a concession system whereby concessions are required for exploration or extraction.

Once a concession is granted the holder must negotiate with the surface landowners to be able to conduct subsurface exploration. Exploration concessions have a 6 year timespan and are not renewable. However mining concessions run for 50 years and are renewable for another 50 years. This encourages active and efficient exploration activity geared toward development and mineral production.

Concessions commonly have specified expenditure requirements as well as provisions for conforming to established standards for health safety and environmental protection. Mexico has stringent environmental laws and all mining companies must meet environmental impact permitting regulations that include tailings and water remediation plans before being allowed to commence operations. The duties for mining companies are 7.5% tied to a form of EBITDA and 0.5% of gold and silver sales.

The Geology

A key feature of Mexico’s geology is the Sierra Madre Occidental a high plateau which is part of a mountain range system that runs from western Antarctica up through South America Central America through Mexico and into the western United States. The plateau was formed through volcanic activity and sits atop a sedimentary basement composed of metamorphic rocks.

The basement is considered to be part of the Older North American basement which itself sits atop the Precambrian basement and is intertwined with Paleozoic-era sedimentary layers. The Sierra Occidental runs from the northern part of Sonora state and south where it intersects the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that stretches from east to west across central and southern Mexico. This belt consists of mineral-rich high-sulphidation epithermal deposits that host eleven mines with reserves of over 563 million ounces of silver and several copper-lead-zinc mines.

Geology in the state of Zacatecas in north-central Mexico comprises a number of marine beds of the Lower Cretaceous era and Upper Triassic greenstones lava and sedimentary rocks. Silver mineralization occurs mainly in epithermal veins which are prime targets for precious metal exploration.

Zacatecas is located within the Mexican Silver Belt which is considered to be the world’s largest silver region. The Fresnillo area in Zacatecas state has seen significant mining activity since the 1500’s having produced more than 12 tons of gold 775 tons of silver and approximately 1000000 tons of lead and zinc.

Mexico’s Mining Activity

Zacatecas is host to two of the world’s largest silver mines that have collectively produced over 1.5 billion ounces of silver the Zacatecas Silver Mine operated by London-based Fresnillo Plc (LSE: FRES) with reserves of 277.6 million ounces of silver and 677000 ounces of gold and Mexico’s largest open-pit mine the Penasquito Polymetallic Mine operated by Goldcorp now Newmont Corp (TSX: NGT).

Other notable mines in the region are:

Sonora is home to Mexico’s oldest and largest open-pit mine the Cananea copper mine operated by Grupo Mexico which is also considered to be one of the world’s largest with reserves estimated at 4.52 billion tonnes of copper with a grade of 0.42% copper. It began production in 1899 but operations were suspended in 2007 due to a strike by workers seeking better and safer working conditions and legal battles are continuing.

The Sonora Lithium Project operated by Sonora Lithium Ltd a joint venture between Ganfeng Lithium Ltd. (22.5%) and Bacanora Lithium Plc (LSE: BCN)(77.5%) is considered to be one of the world’s largest clay lithium deposits.

The Mulatos Gold Mine operated by Alamos Gold Inc. (TSX: AGI) has produced over 2 million ounces of gold since 2005 and according to the company’s financial report has proven and probable reserves of 1.56 million ounces of gold and measured and indicated resources of 2.6 million ounces of gold.

Exploration Activity In Mexico

There are a number of companies actively exploring in Sonora. Sonoro Gold Corp. (TSXV: SGO) is a Vancouver-based junior gold exploration and development company which is advancing its flagship Cerro Caliche gold project to early stage production. It is initiating a heap-leaching pilot operation which it hopes will generate cash flow to fund continuing exploration and development work on the project.

Magna Gold Corp (TSXV: MGR) is a Canadian gold exploration company with operations in Sonora Mexico. The company’s flagship asset is the past-producing San Francisco property which consists of two previously mined open pits the San Francisco and Chicharra located 1000 km west of the San Francisco pit and associated heap leaching facilities.

The project is located 150 km north of Hermosillo Sonora’s state capital. It has reserves of 611000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 0.84 g/t and Magna is planning to reopen the pits in the near future. Magna also has several exploration stage projects in Sonora; the San Judas La Pima and Mercedes projects.

Canuc Resources Corporation (TSXV: CDA) is developing its flagship San Javier Silver-Gold Project in Sonora State located within the prolific Sierra Madre Silver Belt. The San Javier mineral deposits have been identified as Iron-Oxide-Copper-Gold (IOCG) deposit type and these deposits typically contain high grades of copper gold and silver and are known to contain substantial mineralization. They can be very valuable deposits and create very profitable low cost long life mines.

The goal of Canuc’s work programs is to uncover more silver-gold bearing breccias building upon earlier discoveries from work undertaken in 2017 and 2018. This is to help delineate the size and scope of the mineralized zones and will build upon the discovery of three silver-gold bearing breccia bodies.

On January 7 2021 Canuc announced that a recent magnetic survey identified 3 large magnetic high features measuring 1000 by 600 m 800 by 600 m and 600 by 600 m respectively. The data suggests that stronger magnetic features within the larger target areas could be areas of higher-grade mineralization. The company is currently conducting detailed ground magnetic surveys on these targets and results could be forthcoming in the near future.

The San Javier area has also been the subject of activity by another junior exploration company Barksdale Resources (TSXV: BRO). Barksdale has some noteworthy shareholders such as Eric Sprott US Global Investors and Teck Corporation. Barksdale announced on August 6th that they were acquiring ground at San Javier and raising $4M for exploration. On September 1st Barksdale announced that the financing had been increased to $6.35M and that Teck Resources would be exercising its full rights to equity participation.

Colibri Resource Corporation (TSXV:CBI) has several gold exploration projects in the Sonora region from grassroots exploration to advanced development. These include the Evelyn Pilar El Mezquite Jackie and Pitaya projects. On November 30 2020 Colibri entered into an agreement with Silver Spruce Resources Inc. (TSXV: SSE) enabling Silver Spruce to earn a 50% interest in the Jackie property by completing USD$100000 in exploration and drilling expenses including a minimum of USD$50000 within 12 months and pay to Colibri total cash payments of USD$50000 and CAD$50000 in common shares within 12 months.

Once these terms are completed the project becomes a 50/50 joint venture between Silver Spruce and Colibri. On January 18 2021 it was announced that Silver Spruce has started its planned Phase 1 exploration program on the Jackie Property.

Toronto-based gold miner Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM) meanwhile is developing its advanced stage Santa Gertrudis Project located in the Magdalena Mining District in Sonora 180 km north of Hermosillo. The 44145 hectare property’s heap-leaching operations produced 565000 ounces of gold from 1991 until 2000 and has infrastructure in place with buildings pre-stripped pits roads and water sources.

Previous exploration work determined initial open-pit indicated mineral resources of 5.1 million tonnes grading 0.64 g/t gold or 104000 ounces of gold as well as inferred open-pit and underground mineral resources of 22.1 million tonnes grading 1.64 g/t gold or 1.2 million ounces of gold.

In addition Agnico Eagle reported that the high-grade Amelia deposit located in the northern portion of the property continues to grow with an inferred mineral resource of 70000 ounces of gold or 1.6 million tonnes grading 1.38 g/t gold in oxides at open pit depth as well as an initial underground inferred mineral resource of 451000 ounces of gold or 3.1 million tonnes grading 4.58 g/t gold) in the high-grade sulphide mineralization.

The high-grade gold and silver discovery at Espiritu Santo which is 500 metres east-southeast of Amelia shows high-grade gold and silver mineralized structures at shallow depth. The company is currently considering a production strategy that will use heap leaching for low grade ore and building a mill to process the high-grade ores.

Advance Gold Corp (TSXV: AAX) is actively exploring its 100% owned Tabasquena Silver Mine in Zacatecas that it acquired in 2017. It recently initiated an exploration program on a 3500 metre long continuous high chargeability Induced Polarization (IP) anomaly. as well a 2000 by 400 metre section where a number of high-grade gold bearing epithermal veins were discovered. The past-producing Tabasquena Mine is in close proximity to the and shares the same geology with the nearby Milagros Silver Mine. On December 29 2020 Advance Gold announced that assay results showed 240 g/t Silver over 2.30 metres in Hole 18 and 383 g/t Silver over 0.80 metres in Hole 19 at the Tabasquena Mine.

Defiance Silver Corp (TSXV: DEF) is exploring its San Acacio Silver Deposit that is found within the historic San Acacio mine located within the Zacatecas Silver District. Consisting of 24 mineral concessions the project appears to be on trend of the Veta Grande vein structure with historic workings located on a 1200 metre strike length and also 4.4 km along strike to the southeast with no exploration to date. The company created an initial resource estimate from 10200 metres of drilling over 44 holes that indicates 6.9 million ounces of Silver.

On December 15 2020 Silver Viper Minerals Corp (TSXV:VIPR) announced results from exploration drilling at its flagship La Virginia project in Sonora state. Drilling from the El Rubi discovery zone returned assays of 38 g/t Silver and 20.7 g/t gold. Indications are that the main mineralized structure shows thin high-grade structures mixed in with lower grade ores. To date 27000 metres have been drilled over 100 holes on the La Virginia property and work at the El Rubi discovery zones have totaled 15408 metres from 54 drill holes. Silver Viper continues to actively work the project to expand the mineralized zones and look to build a resources estimate.

The Social Aspects

While Mexico is a very mining-friendly jurisdiction Mexico has serious crime and violence issues related to the drug cartels throughout the country but particularly in the northern parts closer to the US border. The federal government has ramped up its enforcement capabilities but rampant poverty in many parts of the country makes it difficult to eradicate the cartels who often recruit the poor into their operations.

Mining companies have to be particularly vigilant and security is a high priority at most mining projects. Like in any country with an active mining sector Mexico experiences rising energy costs as well as variable pricing from milling operators that can impact operating costs and profitability.

In Conclusion

Mexico is a prime exploration destination for the mining industry. Minerals can be found throughout the country and the mineral-bearing geological structures that run through the country make exploration success a reasonably high probability. Mexico’s mining laws encourage focus on projects that can be quickly developed into operating mines. With today’s near record high gold prices and demand for gold and silver it makes sense to re-examine past producing mines that were abandoned due to low metals prices and poor extraction technologies.

Mining and exploration techniques today help reduce exploration risks and can provide for a more efficient path to production. This makes it compelling for exploration companies to aggressively develop properties to a pre-production stage so that they can generate an exit opportunity by selling the developed properties to larger producers and creating a windfall for their shareholders in the process.

Therefore it may be beneficial for junior exploration investors to keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Mexico especially companies that appear to be rapidly positioning their projects for an exit.

Fox News’ official reason for canceling Lou Dobbs’ show – a post-election programing adjustment – doesn’t quite add up.

Dobbs was the highest-rated host on Fox Business. He often doubled his lead-in’s ratings.

Although Fox isn’t saying the timing of Dobbs’ cancellation Friday appears to be no coincidence: It took place 24 hours after Dobbs and Fox were named in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit filed by voting technology company Smartmatic.

Fox may see Dobbs as an acceptable sacrificial lamb.

NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik said on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” Sunday that the network’s decision to cancel Dobbs’ show reminds him of the way Rupert Murdoch’s news tabloids in London handled their phone-hacking scandals about a decade ago.

“They would throw somebody over the side and see if that was enough” he said. “This is an effort to cauterize the wound to distance Fox from this feverish conspiracy theory.”

Murdoch’s media company News Corp. faced a sequence of scandals beginning in 2005 after journalists at British newspapers were accused of hacking into the phones of celebrities lawmakers royalty murder victims and other figures in the news. As lawsuits rolled in Murdoch attempted to put out a series of fires issuing an apology for phone hacking via full page ads in seven national newspapers in 2011.

Now Murdoch is attempting to put out the fires that were attached to Lou Dobbs and his pro-Trump rhetoric. “Lou Dobbs Tonight” is off the air effective immediately a Fox spokesperson confirmed Friday and an interim show will take Dobbs’ place starting Monday.

But Dobbs wasn’t the only one espousing conspiracy theories on air. Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo who were also named in the Smartmatic lawsuit remain on Fox.

“Dobbs is going away. That’s one show on one channel. There are many other shows like him” CNN’s Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter said on “Reliable Sources.” “There is no sign that Fox is moving toward the center back to the kind of centrist reality-based middle. No sign of that at all. Dobbs seems like an anomaly.”

Demand for shows like Lou Dobbs’ remains high Stelter noted. So why cut ties with Dobbs and not another host?

“I think he was partly dismissed just ‘cause management had enough of him” Stelter said. “They were just tired of his BS. But they’ve got a lot of other people there selling the same story.”

Driven by “truthiness and intuition” networks like Fox “cloak themselves” in the freedom of speech provided by the first amendment University of Delaware professor Dr. Danna Young told Stelter. “Lawsuits have a way of forcing people and entities to reckon with empirical fact and reality” she said.

But sources at Fox indicated that the Smartmatic lawsuit was just one factor in the decision to cancel Dobbs’ show. His weak performance with advertisers was also a significant factor one source said.

Dobbs was one of Trump’s most vocal on-air supporters which kept his show’s ratings high.

Folkenflik says Fox is being led by its viewers right now. “It doesn’t have a clear sense of how it wants to operate in the post-Trump world when Trump still commands so much loyalty from his core viewers” he said.

An annual report on hazing within the military obtained via a public-records request shows that the Marine Corps the smallest Defense Department service by population with the exception of Space Force owns the lion's share of hazing complaints and substantiated hazing incidents. The data from fiscal year 2018 shows that 256 of 291 total hazing complaints that year more than 88% were made in the Corps and 91 of 102 substantiated hazing incidents took place among Marines.

The Navy was a distant second with 17 complaints and 10 substantiated incidents; then the Army with 13 complaints none substantiated; and finally the Air Force with five complaints one substantiated. At the time of the reporting 71 total complaints had been found unsubstantiated 110 were pending a decision and eight were inconclusive or unknown.

The data released to Military.com this month provides what could be a troubling snapshot taken shortly after the Marines faced national scrutiny over hazing episodes at boot camp in Parris Island South Carolina. Recruit Raheel Siddiqui reportedly jumped to his own death in 2016 from the third floor of a Parris Island building after abuse at the hands of a drill instructor who received 10 years for maltreatment and other crimes at a Parris Island court-martial. Other Marines who trained recruits were found to have inflicted chemical burns requiring skin grafts -- the result of forced physical training on a bleach-covered floor -- and ordered naked trainees to run back and forth then jam together against the walls of a shower.

In all eight drill instructors faced some level of punishment over the Parris Island hazing scandal amid national attention and investigations resulted in a slew of recommendations for change. And that same year a crackdown on hazing within 1st Marine Division in California resulted in at least 18 Marines getting kicked out of the Corps and 30 spending time in the brig.

Amid all that the 2018 data seems jarring.

But some say the information paints a more complicated picture: one of a service that is aggressively tracking abusive behavior while others overlook the problem.

New Accountability Measures

The 2018 report is the first-ever Pentagon-wide survey of hazing. It was mandated by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis earlier the same year as part of a sweeping new policy implemented to deter harassment and abusive behavior in every form within the ranks. Mattis' order building on a previous 2015 memo from then-Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work set a Dec. 31 2018 deadline for services to turn over the first 18 months of hazing data they'd collected and required annual reports to follow.

The order also set a definition for hazing: a ""form of harassment that ... physically or psychologically injures or creates a risk of physical or psychological injury ... for the purpose of: initiation into admission into affiliation with change in status or position within or a condition for continued membership in any military or DoD civilian organization.""

The newly obtained report does not contain details on specific hazing incidents or complaints but does break substantiated episodes into categories: physical psychological written verbal and nonverbal.

In the Marine Corps 60% of hazing incidents were physical and 32% verbal with the remainder nonverbal. The other services had a similar breakdown; only the Navy had substantiated episodes of psychological hazing with six incidents.

While the report doesn't indicate the origin of hazing complaints or the dates they were made it does contain some information on when hazing happens and who it happens to.

Unsurprisingly almost all substantiated hazing happened on duty in 2018. Nearly 100% of military hazing victims were junior enlisted service members in the ranks of E-4 and below and with few exceptions under the age of 25. While most of the perpetrators were also junior enlisted some 20% were E-5s and E-6s and eight offenders were senior enlisted troops or junior officers.

Within the entire Defense Department only eight of the troops who reported being hazed were female.

Data Shortfalls

While the majority of hazing offenders and complainants were white the data does fall somewhat short. There's no indication of the racial breakdown of victims and offenders in specific incidents or what conditions lead to certain kinds of hazing. There's no information either to indicate the severity of hazing incidents or their short- and long-term impact on victims.

What does seem evident though is that the 2018 data regarding the ratio of hazing reports by service is not an anomaly. A data sketch from fiscal 2017 also obtained by Military.com shows 233 out of 299 hazing reports that year came from the Marine Corps and 109 out of 136 substantiated incidents occurred in that service.

While DoD did not release fiscal 2019 data and a fiscal 2020 report has not yet been provided to the services Marine Corps officials did provide data showing that reports of hazing decreased markedly within the service in 2019. That year there were 188 total complaints in the Corps and 47 substantiated hazing cases officials said.

""Hazing has no place in a disciplined and professional military force and is not tolerated in any form in the Marine Corps. Hazing degrades our warfighting capabilities by destroying our Marines' confidence and the trust they place in their fellow Marines and in their leadership. All complaints of hazing are taken seriously"" Yvonne Carlock a spokeswoman for Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs told Military.com.

Carlock added that all hazing complaints are tracked ""from the initial complaint/allegation through adjudication"" and that the service stresses bystander intervention and urges Marines and sailors to report all hazing they observe.

A 2015 study by the Rand Corporation did find that the Marine Corps was the most consistent of any service apart from the Coast Guard at providing specific anti-hazing training and offering additional training at various career intervals with annual refreshers. Gaps were still present at that point however; the report found anti-hazing instruction in the Corps was lecture-only and lacked group discussion and structured assessment.

But the grim wake-up calls from the recent high-profile hazing incidents may mean the Marines track the issue better and more consistently than other services. That's the contention of Rep. Judy Chu a California Democrat who has made it a priority to end military hazing and increase accountability.

Chu's nephew Marine Lance Cpl. Harry Lew took his own life during a deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 following hazing by his peers. Three Marines faced criminal charges in the wake of his death; two were acquitted and one was sentenced to 30 days in a plea agreement.

""The real truth is that hazing in the military is still obscured by bad and incomplete data"" Chu told Military.com in a Feb. 5 statement. She cited a Government Accountability Office report she had required showing that as of early 2016 the Corps alone consistently tracked both substantiated and unsubstantiated hazing reports.

""This doesn't mean that the Marines are more likely to have a hazing problem but that the other branches fail to report theirs"" she said in the statement. ""Still what this troubling data reveals is that hazing and disunity are still pervasive problems in our military which is bad for our national security and the health and safety of the men and women in uniform who risk everything for us.""

Cultural Influences

It's likely however that culture also plays a role in the picture the data shows. The Marine Corps has the youngest average age of any service the most male and the most junior in rank. The service prides itself on being the most physically demanding as well and many recruits arrive at boot camp with a perception of the Corps informed by films like Full Metal Jacket and A Few Good Men -- movies in which brutal Marine Corps hazing incidents are main plot points.

In a 2020 law review article in the Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal authors Gregory S. Parks and Jasmine Burgess explore the psychological cultural and organizational causes of military hazing.

In one notional example underscoring their research they profile ""Darrius Ima"" a Marine Corps drill instructor who himself was hazed as a recruit and believes he's justified in passing down the tradition.

""Darrius believes not only that there is a low probability of him being caught and reprimanded for the hazing but also that and erroneously so that the majority of the Marines community values hazing"" the authors write. "" ... In sum Darrius is morally disengaged around the issue of hazing. He tries to justify his conduct by offering a purely positive rationale for hazing -- e.g. that it builds bonds.""

Parks a professor of law at Wake Forest University and expert on all kinds of hazing who spoke to Military.com Feb. 5 said changing a cultural perspective on an issue such as hazing can be a lengthy process.

""Organizational culture is crucial"" he said. ""What are the dynamics at play within an organization over the course of maybe decades or generations and why is it hard to disentangle that. It makes it very difficult to swim upstream and buck the system when you receive a lot of critical feedback from peers.""

He added that the military and particularly the Marine Corps which demands and prizes high levels of physical prowess and mental toughness may be more prone to training and rituals that cross the line into hazing.

""There are these physical components but there's also the psychological aspect of putting people through the paces"" he said. ""It's probably easier to amplify that.""

The newly obtained data does indicate that being found to have hazed a peer or subordinate will affect a service member's career even if it doesn't end it. For fiscal 2018 100% of substantiated hazing offenders received some sort of discipline.

In the Marine Corps 174 perpetrators received a total of 365 corrective or disciplinary actions. One-third of all disciplinary actions for Marines were at the administrative level and a little more than half consisted of non-judicial punishment. Unit-level punishments are shielded from public release and therefore difficult to track.

Some 44 Marines faced hazing-related charges at various levels of court-martial; the Corps was the only service to send anyone to court-martial over hazing.

""We continue to train and educate all Marines and instill in them that these behaviors are inconsistent with our core values and we will hold perpetrators accountable"" Carlock the Marine Corps spokeswoman told Military.com. ""A failure to act and respond is not only inconsistent with who we are but it also degrades our traditions threatens our cohesion and morale and detracts from mission accomplishment.""

Fox News’ official reason for canceling Lou Dobbs’ show – a post-election programing adjustment – doesn’t quite add up.

Dobbs was the highest-rated host on Fox Business. He often doubled his lead-in’s ratings.

Although Fox isn’t saying the timing of Dobbs’ cancellation Friday appears to be no coincidence: It took place 24 hours after Dobbs and Fox were named in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit filed by voting technology company Smartmatic.

Fox may see Dobbs as an acceptable sacrificial lamb.

NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik said on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” Sunday that the network’s decision to cancel Dobbs’ show reminds him of the way Rupert Murdoch’s news tabloids in London handled their phone-hacking scandals about a decade ago.

“They would throw somebody over the side and see if that was enough” he said. “This is an effort to cauterize the wound to distance Fox from this feverish conspiracy theory.”

Murdoch’s media company News Corp. faced a sequence of scandals beginning in 2005 after journalists at British newspapers were accused of hacking into the phones of celebrities lawmakers royalty murder victims and other figures in the news. As lawsuits rolled in Murdoch attempted to put out a series of fires issuing an apology for phone hacking via full page ads in seven national newspapers in 2011.

Now Murdoch is attempting to put out the fires that were attached to Lou Dobbs and his pro-Trump rhetoric. “Lou Dobbs Tonight” is off the air effective immediately a Fox spokesperson confirmed Friday and an interim show will take Dobbs’ place starting Monday.

But Dobbs wasn’t the only one espousing conspiracy theories on air. Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo who were also named in the Smartmatic lawsuit remain on Fox.

“Dobbs is going away. That’s one show on one channel. There are many other shows like him” CNN’s Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter said on “Reliable Sources.” “There is no sign that Fox is moving toward the center back to the kind of centrist reality-based middle. No sign of that at all. Dobbs seems like an anomaly.”

Demand for shows like Lou Dobbs’ remains high Stelter noted. So why cut ties with Dobbs and not another host?

“I think he was partly dismissed just ‘cause management had enough of him” Stelter said. “They were just tired of his BS. But they’ve got a lot of other people there selling the same story.”

Driven by “truthiness and intuition” networks like Fox “cloak themselves” in the freedom of speech provided by the first amendment University of Delaware professor Dr. Danna Young told Stelter. “Lawsuits have a way of forcing people and entities to reckon with empirical fact and reality” she said.

But sources at Fox indicated that the Smartmatic lawsuit was just one factor in the decision to cancel Dobbs’ show. His weak performance with advertisers was also a significant factor one source said.

Dobbs was one of Trump’s most vocal on-air supporters which kept his show’s ratings high.

Folkenflik says Fox is being led by its viewers right now. “It doesn’t have a clear sense of how it wants to operate in the post-Trump world when Trump still commands so much loyalty from his core viewers” he said.

An annual report on hazing within the military obtained via a public-records request shows that the Marine Corps the smallest Defense Department service by population with the exception of Space Force owns the lion's share of hazing complaints and substantiated hazing incidents. The data from fiscal year 2018 shows that 256 of 291 total hazing complaints that year more than 88% were made in the Corps and 91 of 102 substantiated hazing incidents took place among Marines.

The Navy was a distant second with 17 complaints and 10 substantiated incidents; then the Army with 13 complaints none substantiated; and finally the Air Force with five complaints one substantiated. At the time of the reporting 71 total complaints had been found unsubstantiated 110 were pending a decision and eight were inconclusive or unknown.

The data released to Military.com this month provides what could be a troubling snapshot taken shortly after the Marines faced national scrutiny over hazing episodes at boot camp in Parris Island South Carolina. Recruit Raheel Siddiqui reportedly jumped to his own death in 2016 from the third floor of a Parris Island building after abuse at the hands of a drill instructor who received 10 years for maltreatment and other crimes at a Parris Island court-martial. Other Marines who trained recruits were found to have inflicted chemical burns requiring skin grafts -- the result of forced physical training on a bleach-covered floor -- and ordered naked trainees to run back and forth then jam together against the walls of a shower.

In all eight drill instructors faced some level of punishment over the Parris Island hazing scandal amid national attention and investigations resulted in a slew of recommendations for change. And that same year a crackdown on hazing within 1st Marine Division in California resulted in at least 18 Marines getting kicked out of the Corps and 30 spending time in the brig.

Amid all that the 2018 data seems jarring.

But some say the information paints a more complicated picture: one of a service that is aggressively tracking abusive behavior while others overlook the problem.

New Accountability Measures

The 2018 report is the first-ever Pentagon-wide survey of hazing. It was mandated by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis earlier the same year as part of a sweeping new policy implemented to deter harassment and abusive behavior in every form within the ranks. Mattis' order building on a previous 2015 memo from then-Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work set a Dec. 31 2018 deadline for services to turn over the first 18 months of hazing data they'd collected and required annual reports to follow.

The order also set a definition for hazing: a ""form of harassment that ... physically or psychologically injures or creates a risk of physical or psychological injury ... for the purpose of: initiation into admission into affiliation with change in status or position within or a condition for continued membership in any military or DoD civilian organization.""

The newly obtained report does not contain details on specific hazing incidents or complaints but does break substantiated episodes into categories: physical psychological written verbal and nonverbal.

In the Marine Corps 60% of hazing incidents were physical and 32% verbal with the remainder nonverbal. The other services had a similar breakdown; only the Navy had substantiated episodes of psychological hazing with six incidents.

While the report doesn't indicate the origin of hazing complaints or the dates they were made it does contain some information on when hazing happens and who it happens to.

Unsurprisingly almost all substantiated hazing happened on duty in 2018. Nearly 100% of military hazing victims were junior enlisted service members in the ranks of E-4 and below and with few exceptions under the age of 25. While most of the perpetrators were also junior enlisted some 20% were E-5s and E-6s and eight offenders were senior enlisted troops or junior officers.

Within the entire Defense Department only eight of the troops who reported being hazed were female.

Data Shortfalls

While the majority of hazing offenders and complainants were white the data does fall somewhat short. There's no indication of the racial breakdown of victims and offenders in specific incidents or what conditions lead to certain kinds of hazing. There's no information either to indicate the severity of hazing incidents or their short- and long-term impact on victims.

What does seem evident though is that the 2018 data regarding the ratio of hazing reports by service is not an anomaly. A data sketch from fiscal 2017 also obtained by Military.com shows 233 out of 299 hazing reports that year came from the Marine Corps and 109 out of 136 substantiated incidents occurred in that service.

While DoD did not release fiscal 2019 data and a fiscal 2020 report has not yet been provided to the services Marine Corps officials did provide data showing that reports of hazing decreased markedly within the service in 2019. That year there were 188 total complaints in the Corps and 47 substantiated hazing cases officials said.

""Hazing has no place in a disciplined and professional military force and is not tolerated in any form in the Marine Corps. Hazing degrades our warfighting capabilities by destroying our Marines' confidence and the trust they place in their fellow Marines and in their leadership. All complaints of hazing are taken seriously"" Yvonne Carlock a spokeswoman for Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs told Military.com.

Carlock added that all hazing complaints are tracked ""from the initial complaint/allegation through adjudication"" and that the service stresses bystander intervention and urges Marines and sailors to report all hazing they observe.

A 2015 study by the Rand Corporation did find that the Marine Corps was the most consistent of any service apart from the Coast Guard at providing specific anti-hazing training and offering additional training at various career intervals with annual refreshers. Gaps were still present at that point however; the report found anti-hazing instruction in the Corps was lecture-only and lacked group discussion and structured assessment.

But the grim wake-up calls from the recent high-profile hazing incidents may mean the Marines track the issue better and more consistently than other services. That's the contention of Rep. Judy Chu a California Democrat who has made it a priority to end military hazing and increase accountability.

Chu's nephew Marine Lance Cpl. Harry Lew took his own life during a deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 following hazing by his peers. Three Marines faced criminal charges in the wake of his death; two were acquitted and one was sentenced to 30 days in a plea agreement.

She cited a Government Accountability Office report she had required showing that as of early 2016 the Corps alone consistently tracked both substantiated and unsubstantiated hazing reports.

""Still what this troubling data reveals is that hazing and disunity are still pervasive problems in our military which is bad for our national security and the health and safety of the men and women in uniform who risk everything for us.""

About Daytona International Speedway

Daytona International Speedway is the home of The Great American Race – the DAYTONA 500. Though the season-opening NASCAR Cup Series event garners most of the attention – as well as the largest audience in motorsports – the approximately 500-acre motorsports complex boasts the most diverse schedule of racing on the globe thus earning it the title of World Center of Racing. In addition to eight major weekends of racing activity rarely a week goes by that the Speedway grounds are not used for events that include civic and social gatherings car shows photo shoots production vehicle testing and police motorcycle training.",,,,,,,,,
NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzA3L2NvdWxkLW5pa2UtYmUtYS1taWxsaW9uYWlyZS1tYWtlci1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Nike Be a Millionaire-Maker Stock?,"Investors shouldn't underestimate the growth potential of the sportswear giant.

Nike (NKE -0.28%) has been a consistent winner for shareholders over the years. Even though the sneaker giant is approaching $40 billion in annual revenue the swoosh just keeps growing.

Over the last five years the stock has more than doubled in value but what we want to know is this: Can Nike sustain its momentum long enough to turn a small investment into a million dollars?

Nike's past returns and growth

The first thing to consider is Nike's historical rate of return. Since the company has had a very similar main product line throughout the nearly 50 years it has been selling shoes under the Nike trademark we shouldn't expect the stock to deliver a higher return than what it has historically.

A $10000 investment in Nike stock in 1990 would have grown to be worth $1.58 million today including dividend reinvestment.

Keep in mind Nike was growing revenue much faster in the 1990s than it is today. In fiscal 1995 revenue grew 25%. At the time revenue had climbed fivefold over the previous 10 years from fiscal 1985.

Since fiscal 2010 Nike's revenue has only doubled which reflects a slowing growth rate as Nike's business gets larger.

The important thing to remember is that while stocks can do anything in the short term there is a high correlation between a company's growth in profits and the return of the stock price over a long period of time.

Nike's long-term goal is to grow revenue at a high-single-digit rate and grow earnings per share in the mid-teens range. If Nike can sustain that level of earnings growth over 30 years it's certainly possible that a $10000 investment could be worth more than $600000 in 30 years.

Any company that is growing over a long period of time can deliver massive gains if you hold the stock long enough. That's the beauty of compounding interest and why stocks are great wealth-building tools.

Nike's revenue target is a reasonable goal given that the athletic apparel industry continues to show signs of expansion. Other fitness brands like lululemon athletica and Peloton Interactive are also showing strong growth. One estimate placed the sports apparel market at $167 billion in 2018 and expected to reach $248 billion by 2026.

Nike has been growing in line with the industry. Between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2019 Nike grew revenue at a compounded rate of 6.5% but revenue growth was accelerating above that rate in fiscal 2020 right before the pandemic hit. Earnings per share didn't grow as much over those three years due to investments to support the growth of the digital business.

If Nike can deliver on its long-term outlook you could turn a small investment into a million bucks or at least get within striking distance. Here's how Nike can deliver.

Nike's strategy

Nike's investments in the direct-to-consumer business are laying the foundation for improving margins and growing profits.

The swoosh remains a hot brand which is driving explosive growth through Nike's mobile apps particularly SNKRS where Nike drops highly anticipated sneakers in limited quantities that sell out quickly. For the fiscal second quarter ending in November Nike reported that its mobile apps grew 200% year over year.

Nike's total revenue growth clocked in at 7% in the last quarter excluding currency consistent with management's long-term target. Nike's digital channel now makes up more than 30% of the business and management sees it reaching 50% in the near future.

Nike is now a digital-first company and since digital sales generate higher profits than sales through wholesale channels earnings per share should grow faster than Nike's single-digit revenue target over the long term. This is why analysts are currently forecasting Nike to post annualized growth in earnings per share of 34% over the next five years.

During the fiscal second-quarter conference call CEO John Donahoe summed up the key drivers that should fuel this growth stock higher over time. ""The structural tailwinds we're seeing including permanent shifts toward digital athletic wear and health and wellness continue to offer us incredible opportunity"" he said.

Not many consumer discretionary companies can sustain a mid-teens level of earnings growth over several decades but I will never say never about any great business. Look at it like this: Nike has been around for about 50 years and management is still talking about growing earnings at double-digit rates.

So yes Nike is a millionaire-making stock but you must be willing to hold the shares for a long time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC05MC1jejE2MTctMTAwLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 90 CZ1617-100 Release Date,"Nike Sportswear is getting ready to launch several Easter-themed offerings of their iconic Air Max models including the Air Max 90 and this upcoming colorway.

Since sending the Air Foamposite One down the runway with CdG Nike made their plans to bring back the silhouette very very clear. And as if somewhat inspired by that contorted version the brand is bringing out an offering brimming with warped glitchy graphics.

This pair not only comes in adults — a size already teased by Penny Hardaway himself — as official images confirm sizes from GS all the way to TD. Thankfully nothing is dramatically taken away from this trio of Little Posites as everything from the print itself to the details are all accounted for. Underfoot the colorway features an icy blue tread that compliments the heel pulls as well as the heel tab’s basketball-shaped insignia. Elsewhere the construction runs with neutrals with black dyeing the leather overlays mesh tongue and the grid graphic that twists across the white shell.

Grab a close-up peek at these right here. A release should be hitting Nike.com and select retailers on March 6th.

FROM PARLIAMENT

COMMENT

I want to thank the Waitangi National Trust and Ngapuhi for repositioning the role of women leaders speaking on the marae at Waitangi.

On Thursday the Waitangi National Trust hosted the parliamentary pōwhiri at the upper marae at Waitangi. It's an occasion steeped in tradition and ceremony on the Treaty grounds set against the whare rūnanga and Busby's house.

The speaking protocol for visitors is for a male representative of the main parties to speak from the paepae and then the Prime Minister of the day always has speaking rights.

As a woman the Prime Minister speaks from the mahau (verandah) in front of the meeting house entrance.

The challenge this year was that for the first time in 20 years the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition are both women and the question was how to accommodate them both in speaking positions.

For the Prime Minister there was a clear pathway but not so for the leader of the Opposition or indeed other women co-leaders.

What many will not know is that for many months the trust and I worked on exactly this issue. We diligently went back and forth testing variations against protocol and key stakeholders.

My preference was for the leader of the Opposition to speak from the mahau and this had support from many including previous rūnanga chairpeople. The accommodation that was reached was for speaking positions for all remaining women leaders to be after the main pōwhiri when people had returned from lunch.

This was not perfect but I do want to thank and acknowledge the trust for shifting and making an accommodation.



Waitangi can be a time to not only challenge the Government but to also challenge ourselves and so with direction from Judith Collins and speaking on her behalf I included in my whaikorero a challenge to the trust and Ngāpuhi for further change to allow women leaders to speak from the mahau.

Here is a precis of what I said: ""There is an issue. I stand here as the voice for our leader Judith Collins. Please take no offence but there is a sadness in the National Party because she is not allowed to speak. Why is that? Is it because she is a woman? Don't forget the mana of women or their place in the house of life. I leave these words for you to think and ponder.""

The final speaker was kaumātua Waihoroi Shortland who said Ngāpuhi had heard the call and would take up the challenge and do things differently for women next year. Indeed there was almost an impromptu invitation for Judith Collins to speak from the mahau on that very day.

As I passed across the taumata to hariru and hongi dear and trusted people on the other side nearly every person made the same commitment.

We don't take lightly the nature of this change but we are also the captains of our own ship and can bring the best of the old and the new together in ways that respect our women even more than we venerate them now.

On behalf of women who have paved this path not just in Tai Tokerau but throughout the motu thank you and we look forward to Waitangi next year.

I cannot resist writing to congratulate you and the Board of Media Trust Ltd chaired by Alhaji Kabiru A. Yusuf for facilitating the recent great debate on Restructuring: Why? When? How? Alhaji Kabiru Yusuf himself is a distinguished and patriotic pioneer newspaper publisher from the northern part of Nigeria.

He is among the very few people from the northern part of Nigeria who have succeeded in the newspaper managing and publishing business. May Allah (swt) continue to guide him and bless his efforts in this business of his choice. Amin.

Titled Restructuring: Why? When? How? Media Trust Ltd has somehow succeeded in removing the characteristic acrimony tension and unhealthy politics in the national question/restructuring debate by cleverly picking/choosing only five national leaders with well-known pedigree and current status to discuss restructuring from their rich and well informed perspectives and the five chosen leaders and speakers are proper representatives of Nigeria’s diversity.

Knowing their backgrounds and keeping in mind the saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder the speakers: former President Goodluck Jonathan; Chief Ayo Adebanjo Afenifere leader; Chief John Nnia Nwodo former President-General of Ohanaeze-Ndigbo; Prof. Attahiru Jega well known professor of Political Science a great/charismatic former ASUU president VC Bayero University Kano and dynamic chairman of INEC. Next is Chief Audu Ogbeh not the least by any means. He is highly educated and cerebral former minister of communications in the 2nd Republic and also minister of agriculture in this dispensation. He is a well-respected leader from the North-Central zone and chairman ACF socio-cultural umbrella organization of the 19 Northern states.

If you add the remarks of former President Goodluck Jonathan as chairman of the occasion and also Kabiru Yusuf as Chairman of Media Trust Ltd to that of the four speakers the National Assembly and the State Houses of Assemblies have sufficient material to guide them to make any urgent/necessary constitutional amends. Of course they can also carefully study the reports of the 2005 political reforms conference and 2014 constitutional conference.

Finally Nigerians and the Nigerian political class need to be reminded that there is no generation in any country of the world which can resolve/find solutions to all the problems/crises arising from the nation building process and governance processes of their time. Every generation must pass on certain unfinished matters to coming generations. Just see what is happening all over the world today. May Allah (swt) guide our leaders along the right path. Amin

Leonardo has been involved in the design and manufacture of airborne HF systems for decades. Leonardo’s experience dates back to the 1970s having sold thousands of its previous generation RT-170 (170W) RT-270 (200W) and RT-470 (400W) to customers around the world.

Leonardo’s extensive research and development activities in the high frequency airborne radio field has led to the design and production of the state-of-the-art HF Single Side Band system SRT-400 which is suitable for fixed and rotary wing aircraft. A patented Leonardo technology reduces TX power consumption by more than 40 percent compared to previous designs reducing heat dissipation and greatly improving reliability. Both transceivers can be interfaced with multiple Antenna Tuning Units (ATU) matching all kinds of existing antennas (loop wire or notch). The SRT-400 and its low power variant the SRT-200 combine high flexibility and simplified operations into a reduced size and weight package achieved through innovative electrical and mechanical design.

Variants of the E-2 Hawkeye have been in operation since the early 1960s.

The U.S. Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber could fly as early as 2021. And at least one Air Force general believes the new Northrop Grumman-made bomber could gain air-to-air capabilities in order to help it fight its way to its target.

There is some precedent for a bomber aircraft with a secondary air-to-air mission. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the U.S. Navy paid General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas billions of dollars to develop the A-12 Avenger II a stealthy carrier-launched medium bomber that was supposed to replace the Navy’s A-6 Intruders.

The A-12 was designed to carry two AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles in addition to air-to-ground weaponry. But the U.S. Defense Department canceled the A-12 in 1991.

What went wrong? For one the world changed -- and the secrecy surrounding the A-12 didn’t help either according to James Stevenson former editor of the Navy Fighter Weapons School’s Topgun Journal.

“After the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989 pressure for a ‘peace dividend’ increased” Stevenson wrote.

In July 1990 one month before Iraq invaded Kuwait Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney asked Congress for more A-12 money but his request was rebuffed — an indication that the military budget decline was serious. After Iraq invaded Kuwait the budgeteers had to scramble for even more money. This fight for funds combined with the impending military action guaranteed that some programs would be radically slowed reduced or eliminated. The A-12 ended up as one of those terminated programs. Cheney withdrew his support for the A-12 contract on Jan. 5 1991 freeing more than $500 million for the impending war effort that began 10 days later. On the other hand the F-22 squeaked through even though the Air Force did not procure its original requirement of 750 F-22s. It eventually managed to squeeze 187 of them out of the budget. In this case when black and gray programs competed the gray program — a lighter shade at that — survived in Darwinian fashion. Even though the A-12 was predicted to cost much less Congress bankrolled the F-22 while the Navy watched in tears as its A-12 program was carted away. And since the A-12 was secret the branch couldn’t mount a public defense.

Which is not to say the A-12 program was in good shape otherwise as David Montgomery explained in Air Force magazine in 1991. In fact workers were having a hard time building the prototypes.

“The biggest problem say officials stemmed from the difficulties of creating and applying highly advanced composite material in the radar-evading stealth plane” Montgomery wrote.

The two contractors had inadequate experience with this material to carry out the project smoothly and with a minimum of delay.

Evident mutual suspicion between the two contractors compounded the problem. One Pentagon analyst who studied the issue said the two A-12 contractors appeared loath to share sensitive technology to further the A-12 program. The reason: They were competitors on another project -- the program to build the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter. ""There were technologies that could have helped in the overall [A-12] effort but they weren't willing to share those"" said the analyst. ""If you have a technological advantage how willing are you to share that if ... it could help you in some other program?"" An overly ambitious schedule exacerbated the problem. Under the original timetable the contractors planned first flight for June 171990. They mapped out a design-to-assembly schedule of only nine months far shorter than the fourteen months normally allotted for such an effort. Workers in top-secret areas of plants operated by General Dynamics in Fort Worth Texas and by McDonnell Douglas in Saint Louis Missouri would spend four and a half months on subassembly. Sections would be shipped to Tulsa Oklahoma for final assembly. According to the report the manufacturers were only feeling their way along. They lacked proper tooling missed key target dates at various steps in the development process and were forced to issue ""stop work orders"" because of engineering problems. Delays in the arrival of parts further delayed production.

By contrast the Air Force insists that B-21 development is proceeding without any major complications. Of course the B-21 program also is highly secret meaning it’s impossible for outsiders to verify the Air Force’s sanguine claims.

But if the B-21 does fly in 2021 as planned and ends up including the air-to-air capabilities that have been proposed it could finally fulfill the A-12’s multi-role promise from nearly 30 years ago.

Of particular note are inventions by the somewhat mysterious Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais whose tech claims to be able to “engineer reality.” His slate of highly-ambitious borderline sci-fi designs meant for use by the U.S. government range from gravitational wave generators and compact fusion reactors to next-gen hybrid aerospace-underwater crafts with revolutionary propulsion systems and beyond.

Of course the existence of patents does not mean these technologies have actually been created but there is evidence that some demonstrations of operability have been successfully carried out. As investigated and reported by The War Zone a possible reason why some of the patents may have been taken on by the Navy is that the Chinese military may also be developing similar advanced gadgets.

Among Dr. Pais’s patents are designs approved in 2018 for an aerospace-underwater craft of incredible speed and maneuverability. This cone-shaped vehicle can potentially fly just as well anywhere it may be whether air water or space without leaving any heat signatures. It can achieve this by creating a quantum vacuum around itself with a very dense polarized energy field. This vacuum would allow it to repel any molecule the craft comes in contact with no matter the medium. Manipulating “quantum field fluctuations in the local vacuum energy state” would help reduce the craft’s inertia. The polarized vacuum would dramatically decrease any elemental resistance and lead to “extreme speeds” claims the paper.

Not only that if the vacuum-creating technology can be engineered we’d also be able to “engineer the fabric of our reality at the most fundamental level” states the patent. This would lead to major advancements in aerospace propulsion and generating power. Not to mention other reality-changing outcomes that come to mind.

Among Pais’s other patents are inventions that stem from similar thinking outlining pieces of technology necessary to make his creations come to fruition. His paper presented in 2019 titled “Room Temperature Superconducting System for Use on a Hybrid Aerospace Undersea Craft” proposes a system that can achieve superconductivity at room temperatures. This would become “a highly disruptive technology capable of a total paradigm change in Science and Technology” conveys Pais.

Another invention devised by Pais is an electromagnetic field generator that could generate “an impenetrable defensive shield to sea and land as well as space-based military and civilian assets.” This shield could protect from threats like anti-ship ballistic missiles cruise missiles that evade radar coronal mass ejections military satellites and even asteroids.

Dr. Pais’s ideas center around the phenomenon he dubbed “The Pais Effect”. He referred to it in his writings as the “controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma) via accelerated spin and/or accelerated vibration under rapid (yet smooth) acceleration-deceleration-acceleration transients.” In less jargon-heavy terms Pais claims to have figured out how to spin electromagnetic fields in order to contain a fusion reaction – an accomplishment that would lead to a tremendous change in power consumption and an abundance of energy.

According to his bio in a recently published paper on a new Plasma Compression Fusion Device which could transform energy production Dr. Pais is a mechanical and aerospace engineer working at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) which is headquartered in Patuxent River Maryland. Holding a Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Ohio Pais was a NASA Research Fellow and worked with Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. His current Department of Defense work involves his “advanced knowledge of theory analysis and modern experimental and computational methods in aerodynamics along with an understanding of air-vehicle and missile design especially in the domain of hypersonic power plant and vehicle design.” He also has expert knowledge of electrooptics emerging quantum technologies (laser power generation in particular) high-energy electromagnetic field generation and the “breakthrough field of room temperature superconductivity as related to advanced field propulsion.”

Suffice it to say with such a list of research credentials that would make Nikola Tesla proud Dr. Pais seems well-positioned to carry out groundbreaking work.

The patents won’t necessarily lead to these technologies ever seeing the light of day. The research has its share of detractors and nonbelievers among other scientists who think the amount of energy required for the fields described by Pais and his ideas on electromagnetic propulsions are well beyond the scope of current tech and are nearly impossible. Yet investigators at The War Zone found comments from Navy officials that indicate the inventions are being looked at seriously enough and some tests are taking place.

The B-1B Lancer B-2 Spirit and B-52 Stratofortress were seen flying over the city of Tampa as the Buccaneers and Chiefs faced off in the NFL championship game.

The tri-bomber flyover the first of its kind replaced the traditional fighter jet flyover typically seen at sporting events.

Capt. Sarah Kociuba was responsible for the flyover and led the group in the B-2 Spirit also known as the stealth bomber WDAF reported.

'It is difficult but we make it happen with just a ton of practice' Kociuba said.

Kociuba took off in the B-2 from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and met up with the other bombers over the Gulf of Mexico.

The B-52 took off from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and the B-1 from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.

A KC-135 Stratotanker refueled each bomber mid-air before they got into formation for the flyover WTSP reported.

Kociuba said she was inspired to join the Air Force after seeing her first B-2 flyover at the Rose Bowl parade when she was 11 years old.

She became the eighth female B-2 pilot in July 2017 according to the Air Force.

'We'll be rooting for the Chiefs and we'll be on time we'll see you there' Kociuba said.

The B-1 B Lancer also called the Bone was initially developed as the B-1A by Rockwell International which is now a part of Boeing as a replacement for the B-52.

The program was discontinued in 1977 – but the Reagan administration initiated the improved B-1B variant in 1981.

The Air Force awarded Rockwell two contracts worth a combined $2.2billion for the development and production of 100 of the bombers in January 1982.

The first B-1B was delivered in June 1985 to Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and the last was delivered May 2 1988.

The B-1B was first used in combat in support of operations against Iraq during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998.

The bomber is unique from the other two in that it can hit supersonic speeds fly inverted and its wings can change their position as it operates Popular Science reported.

The Air Force boasts 62 of the bombers but the fleet has been 'overtaxed' and officials hope to eventually phase it out the outlet reported.

'We overextended the B-1 in the fight on terror' said General Timothy Ray who leads Air Force Global Strike Command.

The $317million plane weighs approximately 190000 pounds and is known for its incredible payload of 75000 pounds.

Development of Northrop Grumman's B-2 Spirit started during the Carter administration at the height of the Cold War -- and was one of the reasons behind the cancellation of the B-1A program.

The Spirit is known for its stealth technology and 'flying wing' design that makes it nearly invisible to radar CNN reported.

The plane was designed to penetrate Soviet air defenses while carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons according to the outlet.

The military only has 20 of the $1.157billion bombers in its fleet according to Popular Science.

The B-2 first flew on July 17 1989 and completed its first combat deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom

The plane weighs about 160000 pounds and is among the military's top first choices at the beginning of new conflict because of its ability to evade radar Popular Science reported.

'The B-2 Spirit remains an engineering marvel and combat proven aircraft that will continue to pave the way forward for years to come' according to the Northrop Grumman website.

The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing after the company won the development bid in 1946 and has been continuously in service by the military since 1955.

The plane has been described by the USO as 'the plane that the Air Force just can't say goodbye to.'

It has played key roles in everything from the Cold War and Vietnam to Desert Storm and the Global War on Terror.

The Air Force has recently extended service life of the B-52 through the 2040s according to the armed forces non-profit. By then some of the airframes will have reached a whopping 90 years of age.

The eight-engine 390000-pound plane was America's 'first long-range swept-wing heavy bomber' according to the Boeing website. It has commonly become known as the 'Big Ugly Fat F**ker.'

In all 744 of them were produced between 1952 and 1962 and the Air Force currently has 76 of them in its fleet.

The B-52 each cost $84million and more than $70000 to fly per hour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9uZXctc3BhY2VjcmFmdC10by1iZS1uYW1lZC1hZnRlci1sZWdlbmRhcnktbmFzYS1tYXRoZW1hdGljaWFuLWthdGhlcmluZS1qb2huc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New spacecraft to be named after legendary NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rollingout.com/2021/02/06/new-spacecraft-to-be-named-after-legendary-nasa-mathematician-katherine-johnson/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9uZXctc3BhY2VjcmFmdC10by1iZS1uYW1lZC1hZnRlci1sZWdlbmRhcnktbmFzYS1tYXRoZW1hdGljaWFuLWthdGhlcmluZS1qb2huc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

This comes from @kopite7kimi (as spotted by VideoCardz) on Twitter who shared some new info including tweaks to the spec details provided previously by the well-known hardware leaker.

Things have changed. Maybe the current spec is 10240FP32 12G GD6X. 😃February 6 2021

As you likely recall rumor had it that the purported RTX 3080 Ti would run with 20GB of video memory but now @kopite7kimi believes the amount will be 12GB. That 12GB loadout of GDDR6X VRAM would point to a 384-bit memory bus.

Furthermore 10240 CUDA cores will be present in the card as opposed to the previous speculation which suggested 10496 cores.

Interestingly @kopite7kimi is apparently 95% sure that 12GB will be the loadout of the RTX 3080 Ti according to a follow-up tweet.

VideoCardz notes that it has heard the same thing from its sources in terms of the hardware spec of this flavor of Nvidia’s GPU and adds that the supposed release date for the new spin on the RTX 3080 will be April. That’s going by the most recent update to Nvidia’s product roadmap apparently but the potential April launch hasn’t been confirmed by the site’s other sources yet.

At any rate take that and all this rumored info with a seriously healthy amount of skepticism. Indeed speculation has been floating around about the RTX 3080 Ti for a long while now with the rumor mill even declaring that the GPU had been abandoned at one stage. Of course it still could be.

Memory configuration

If 12GB sounds like too slight a memory count for the 3080 Ti especially compared to the previous rumor of 20GB bear in mind that Nvidia will need to differentiate the graphics card considerably from the RTX 3090 – the latter will need a reason to be much more expensive (assuming the Ti doesn’t hike the price too much above the vanilla 3080 which would surely be the intention).

Ultimately a lot will depend on exactly where Nvidia pitches the price of this purported incoming GPU and of course performance will also depend on where the card is clocked (and its power envelope) compared to the RTX 3090. Whatever the case as mentioned there will need to be some considerable differentiation here.

If the April release date doesn’t change – which VideoCardz admits it could well do – then we may hear more about this graphics card before long. Until we get more concrete leaks though we’d still stay very cautious around this particular thread of speculation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1cnUzZC5jb20vZG93bmxvYWQvZ2Vmb3JjZS00NjEtNTEtaG90Zml4LWRyaXZlci1kb3dubG9hZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeForce 461.51 hotfix driver download,"GeForce Hotfix display driver version 461.51 is based on our latest Game Ready Driver 461.40.

The graphics card has been in the rumors even before the GeForce RTX 30 series was introduced and has seen various spec changes but it looks like as we get close to an introduction NVIDIA has decided to revise the core and memory configuration once again.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Now Rumored To Feature 12 GB GDDR6X Memory & 10240 CUDA Cores Expected To Launch in April

In his latest tweet Kopite7kimi reports that NVIDIA has once again modified the specifications of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. We know that GPU makers plan out several GPU configs prior to their release but in this generation we have got to see just how much different variants a graphics card sees prior to finalization and production. This has to do with GPU yields production & stock & the latest specifications while a small downgrade core-wise will still net almost similar performance as the GeForce RTX 3090.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / RTX 3080 20 GB 'Rumored' Graphics Card Benchmarks

NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / RTX 3080 20 GB FE (Founders Edition) graphics card is expected to feature the PG133-SKU15 PCB design and the GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core. The GA102-250 GPU has also changed since the last time we saw them and will now feature 10240 CUDA cores within a total of 80 SM units. Since the main core configuration is entirely brand new the previously leaked clocks & TMU/ROP counts should now be dismissed.

Things have changed.

Maybe the current spec is 10240FP32 12G GD6X. 😃 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) February 6 2021

As for memory the card will feature 12 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090 the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting 12 GB memory the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be using a 384-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 912 GB/s. So while we see an 8 GB VRAM reduction over the previous spec the larger bus interface should drive higher memory bandwidth. The TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts. That's definitely needed to feed the extra cores so NVIDIA might have to optimize the clocks a bit here.

As for the launch date Videocardz has suggested that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is likely to launch sometime in April though the date isn't 100% guaranteed. The reason stated is that the same roadmap that lists down April also has other dates mentioned. But with that said the RTX 3080 Ti still aims to compete against the Radeon RX 6900 XT at a lower price point. It is likely the changes to the memory design could've been made to offer the card at a more attractive price point which will still end up being closer to $999 US the same as AMD's flagship graphics card.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9OZXctbGVhay1zYXlzLXRoYXQtdGhlLU52aWRpYS1HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC0zMDgwLVRpLXdpbGwtZmVhdHVyZS0xMkdCLW9mLUdERFI2WC1WUkFNLWFuZC0xMC0yNDAtQ1VEQS1jb3Jlcy41MTg1NjEuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New leak says that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will feature 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM and 10240 CUDA cores,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is now speculated to come with 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM and 10240 CUDA cores. Its 320-bit memory interface will allow for 730Gb/s of memory bandwidth identical to that of the GeForce RTX 3080.

4 Reviews

At this point there have been several speculations about what the yet-to-be-launched Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti could have in store for us. Some time ago we stumbled upon some alleged benchmarks that showed the card in action. However there were several discrepancies in the test methodology and the actual card itself such as different GPU-Z versions Nvidia drivers and more (H/T Tomshardware). Therefore it is very likely that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti tested there is fake.

Some new alleged Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti specs have surfaced via Twitter user @kopite7kimi who has been relatively spot-on about several Nvidia releases in the past. On several occasions the user suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti would come with 20GB of GDDR6X RAM now says that Nividia has cut it down to 12GB. The number of CUDA cores still stands at 10240 same as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090. Other parameters such as memory bandwidth bus width and clock speed are expected to be closer to the GeForce RX 3080's values.

12GB of VRAM is the ideal sweet spot for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Not only does it offer an incremental upgrade over the vanilla GeForce RTX 3080 but is also further enough from the GeForce RTX 3090 to warrant the nearly US$400 price difference. Furthermore GDDR6X memory modules are somewhat rare so 8GB fewer VRAM will help OEMs manufacture more GeForce RTX 3080 Ti units. Regardless of the amount of VRAM it has one will still be hard-pressed to get their hands on one given the massive global shortages and all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU2NzcwLzIwMjEwMjA2L252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLWxhcHRvcC1ncHUtcmV2aWV3LW1vYmlsZS1hbXBlcmUtZmVhdHVyZXMuaHRt0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU2NzcwLzIwMjEwMjA2L252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLWxhcHRvcC1ncHUtcmV2aWV3LW1vYmlsZS1hbXBlcmUtZmVhdHVyZXMuaHRt?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU Review: Improved Performance With Mobile Ampere and Other Features,"(Photo : Youtube/ The Tech Chap) Nvidia gaming laptop performance

Every laptop manufacturer that you can think of is currently updating refining and redesigning their 2021 list of products around NVIDIA's new Ampere-based mobile RTX 30 Series Laptop GPUs and the latest in CPU technology from AMD and Intel.

Mobile Ampere will boost laptop space in 2021 for gaming creative endeavors. It can serve as the engine that connects all of the different parts together.

Just like it desktop version mobile Ampere is portable too. Third-generation Max-Q technology regulates power between the GPU and the CPU and it also decreases the impact of noisy fans and save battery-life with new PCI Express optimization.

Also it utilizes the RTX 30 Series' artificial intelligence based Tensor cores that can be leveraged for DLSS according to GamesRadar.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU Mobile Ampere

There is a difference between a desktop graphics-card and one that is made for a gaming laptop. You will only need to look at the size and the real-estate of the fans and the cooling attached to most desktop graphics cards with spinning blades and heat sinks as well as pipes and RGB lights to know it.The laptop GPU is below the keyboard doing all of the work.

In the laptop space there have been remarkable innovation over the past few years as NVIDIA brought its 10-series to laptops in a very massive way followed up by the 20-series that are ray-tracing powered.

Going mobile meant that users no longer need to sacrifice performance or visuals to a degree that the desktop and the laptop experience could not be compared.

Also the new GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU brings the frames ushers in the age of the QHD or the 1440p laptop according to The Verge.

The increased resolution on a 15-inch or a 17-inch display is crisp and more natural as well as inspiring when users see the DOOM Eternal pushing close to 200 frames-per-second.

Just like the desktop variants Mobile Ampere presents the latest in the NVIDIA GPU design. This means second generation RT-Cores for advanced real-time ray-tracing effects in video games such as ""Cyberpunk 2077"" ""Control"" ""Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War"" ""Fortnite"" and more.Third-gen Tensor Cores and DLSS rendering contributes to a generational performance leap.

3rd Gen Max-Q

Before the release of the GeForce RTX30 Series of Laptop GPU's ""Max-Q"" referred to a specific type of NVIDIA's mobile GPU design a variant made for thin light and power-efficient laptops according to PCGamer.

For some Max-Q meant lowering the power-draw and clock speed basically sacrificing some performance to be able to get a high-powered GPU inside a thin and portable device. Something that fits into a bag unlike some of the thicker gaming laptops in the market.

However Max-Q was more than that it was a design philosophy. The innovation that took the portability side of the gaming laptop and made sure that was always kept in mind when designing the features.

Now things like Advanced Optimus which is the automatic switching between discrete and on-board graphics to conserve battery and to help increase efficiency and Dynamic Boost arrived in selected hardware configurations and laptops.

The world was in the early throes of a mysterious pandemic which first obliterated demand then super-charged internet and mobile computing when economies regained their footing. That about-face -- in a span of months -- laid the seeds for potentially the most serious shortage in years of the semiconductors that lie at the heart of everything from smartphones to cars and TVs.

Auto and electronics makers that cut back drastically in the early days of the outbreak are now rushing to re-up orders only to get turned away because chipmakers are stretched to the max supplying smartphone giants like Apple Inc. This week Qualcomm Inc.’s Cristiano Amon head of the world’s largest mobile chipmaker flagged shortages “across the board” citing the industry’s reliance on just a handful of players in Asia.

Amon joined a growing chorus of industry leaders warning in recent weeks they can’t get enough chips to make their products. Carmakers appear in direst straits and have spurred the U.S. and German governments to come to their aid -- General Motors Co. this month was forced to mothball three North American plants and Ford Motor Co. is bracing for a 20% drop in near-term output. But more industries have lately copped to shortages emphasizing how Covid-19 and a boom in a new breed of 5G-ready smartphones like the iPhone 12 is exacerbating a shortage of capacity plaguing the entire consumer industry. Chip shortages are expected to wipe out $61 billion of sales for automakers alone but the hit to the much larger electronics industry -- while tough to quantify at this early stage -- could be far larger.

Apple a major Qualcomm customer said recently that sales of some new high-end iPhones were hemmed in by a shortage of components. Europe’s NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG -- whose roles near the top of the supply chain grant them visibility over global chip flows -- have both indicated the constraints are no longer confined to autos. And Sony Corp. said Wednesday it might be unable to fully sate demand for its new gaming console in 2021 because of production bottlenecks.

“The virus pandemic social distancing in factories and soaring competition from tablets laptops and electric cars are causing some of the toughest conditions for smartphone component supply in many years” said Neil Mawston an analyst with Strategy Analytics. He estimates prices for key smartphone components including chipsets and displays have risen as much as 15% in the past three to six months.

PC makers were among the first to hint in the spring of 2020 at an impending crunch a warning echoed by Lenovo Group Ltd. on Wednesday. At the heart of the crisis sits Taiwan and its largest company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. the chipmaker of choice to the world’s technology and auto giants. It spent billions in past years ensuring it remains at the forefront of semiconductor production technology -- a costly exercise that’s both paid off and also thrust it into the middle of a global geopolitical dogfight.

On Friday Qualcomm and Corning Inc. joined Biden administration officials to discuss the gathering storm with their Taiwanese counterparts and the island’s top industry representatives including TSMC. Both sides repeatedly stressed their interdependence Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-Hua told reporters. The presence of several senior U.S. officials and the Semiconductor Industry Association -- which represents America’s biggest chipmakers -- emphasized the urgency of the situation.

The current crisis stems from several factors that converged last year. Like most every chip designer on the planet Qualcomm outsources production to Asian companies foremost among which are TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. The pair are increasingly the only recourse for producing the most advanced semiconductors. But their capacity takes years to plan and billions of dollars to build in tandem with customers and the post-Covid 5G phone and internet boom took their clients by surprise.

Industry executives also blame excessive stockpiling which began over the summer when Huawei Technologies Co. -- a major smartphone and networking gear maker -- began hoarding components to ensure its survival from crippling U.S. sanctions. Led by Huawei Chinese imports of chips of all kinds climbed to almost $380 billion in 2020 -- making up almost a fifth of the country’s overall imports for the year.

Rivals including Apple worried about their own caches responded in kind. At the same time the stay-at-home era spurred sales of home appliances from the costliest TVs to the lowliest air purifiers all of which now come with smart customized chips. TSMC executives said on its two most recent earnings calls that customers have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against uncertainties a maneuver they see persisting for some time.

“There’s a chip stockpiling arms race” said Will Bright co-founder and chief product officer at Drop which uses custom chips in headphones and keyboards.

All that has dried up the spigot for smaller-volume buyers such as the makers of cars and gaming consoles: Nintendo Co. Sony and Microsoft Corp. have struggled to make enough Switches PlayStations and Xboxes for about a year. The game hardware industry is bracing for supply to get worse before it gets better in 2021 potentially even affecting the next holiday season people familiar with the matter say.

It didn’t help that automakers -- the most visible cohort to be affected -- misjudged the situation. Some industry observers blame their predicament on near-sighted planning and under-estimation of a post-Covid rebound in auto demand. Others argue chipmakers are prioritizing higher-volume and more lucrative consumer electronics such as smartphones.

On Friday Minebea Mitsumi Inc. -- a vital supplier to the transport and electronics industries -- suggested shortages may plague even more sectors including aviation. “Demand is springing up everywhere at a faster-than-expected pace” CEO Yoshihisa Kainuma told analysts on a call. “Airlines around the world are scrapping old aircraft to slim down their balance sheet. And people’s desire to travel will explode after the pandemic.”

It’s anybody’s guess when production will catch up with demand. But a growing number of industry observers don’t see quick or simple resolution.

“A lot of it can be traced back to the second quarter of last year when the whole world basically shut down. Many auto companies shut down manufacturing and their suppliers re-prioritized” said Mario Morales an analyst with IDC. “Not until the second half will we see relief for some of these markets.”

""How do straight white men react to other straight white men who are no longer acting how they believe straight white men should act?"" Armie Hammer mused in a 2019 interview with the Independent. Fast forward two years later and the Call Me By Your Name actor isn't being congratulated for addressing white male privilege and tackling toxic masculinity. What's happened with Armie Hammer and his ""cannibal"" DMs has become one of the most salacious Hollywood scandals in recent years.

What happened with Armie Hammer that's caused so much controversy?

If you aren't up to speed on Armie's ""cannibal DMs"" controversy then you're in for a wild ride. The Social Network star had private messages he had sent to women he was allegedly seeing — while still with now ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers by the way — in which he stated he had a predilection towards ""eating"" his sexual partners. ""I am 100% a cannibal. I want to eat you"" he reportedly wrote in one text message conversation.

There were references to other acts of human consumption that came out in light of the controversy — and in the wake of the rumors ex-girlfriends and other partners spoke up saying they believed the messages Armie sent were real. Jessica Ciencin Henriquez said as such and Courtney Vucekovich said in an interview with Page Six that ""He said he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it. F*** that was weird.""

It didn't help that the allegations came around the same time as Hammer's divorce from Elizabeth Chambers who finally addressed the rumors in a carefully worded Instagram post ""For weeks I’ve been trying to process everything that has transpired.

Okay which of Armie Hammer’s 14 mates leaked his finsta pic.twitter.com/ZN9Tq2R8X1 — Alex Bruce-Smith (@alexbrucesmith) January 15 2021 Source: Twitter

She added ""I support any victim of assault or abuse and urge anyone who has experienced this pain to seek the help she or he needs to heal."" Her response came shortly after screenshots and recordings of an alleged ""burner"" Instagram account of Hammer's popped up over the internet. In the clips Hammer shows off a room in the Cayman Islands as a woman dressed in lingerie is sitting motionless on all fours on the bed. He casually acknowledges her as he continues to show off the room.

He posted pictures of drug tests drinking beer while driving and a video clip of him hitting what he says is DMT from a vaporizing device. He curls his eyes to the back of his head and then proceeds to fall back into bed after hitting the vape. The collected controversy appears to have propelled Armie's decision to pull out of the action comedy Shotgun Wedding in which he was supposed to star opposite Jennifer Lopez.

BBC reports that a spokesperson for the film stated that they supported Hammer's decision to step away from the film which corroborates Hammer's announcement that Lionsgate respected his wishes to leave the film and spend time with his children in the Cayman Islands instead. Then there's the business of Armie's familial wealth which doesn't just include oil money from Occidental Petroleum but from an alleged art forgery scheme.

""We try to provide a safe environment for our customers. Some of them haven't been out since March.""

NORFOLK Va. — Tony Brothers opened a restaurant in downtown Norfolk on Tuesday. But he's not allowed to eat there.

For 15 years or more the Booker T. Washington High School and Old Dominion University grad had dreamed of opening the sort of place he likes to go while traveling all over the country and world for his day job: tender steaks live jazz fine wine and small-batch bourbon.

And now finally his name is on the sign. Brothers Chops Seafood and Spirits held its grand opening this week at 200 E. Plume St. with an opening menu of lamb chop lollipops and seafood gnocchi seasoned steaks and lump crab cakes.

But these days his other job makes going to restaurants a little bit complicated. For 27 years Brothers has been a referee for the National Basketball Association. He's one of the most recognizable and longest-serving referees in the sport one of the few to have officiated in the finals for each of the past nine years.

And during the coronavirus pandemic the association's quarantine rules mean he can't stop by his own Norfolk restaurant even when he's on a break.

""We're still quarantined even when we're home"" he said. ""If we end up doing something or going somewhere we're going to taint the pool. It's a different life; a different world.""

He's tried every dish in the restaurant he said served up personally by executive chefs Kevin Jenkins and Douglas Silva the latter of whom arrived at Brothers after a tour as head chef of Rockafeller's in Virginia Beach.

But he won't be able to sit down for a meal in his restaurant until July after the next NBA champions are already wearing their rings.

In the meantime Brothers said he's there virtually. More than one of his NBA Finals jackets hang on the wall. And he's able to join his 5000-square-foot restaurant via FaceTime.

""I talk to the guests see how people feel ask them questions"" he said. ""From the music to the ambiance of the restaurant it's a place I'd want to go. It's reflective of the things I like.""

The restaurant was conceived mostly during the pandemic he said after he was approached with the opportunity last year by partners Corey Foreman and Terry Webb. Webb has been a prodigious restaurateur opening spots that include Krush restaurant and Mansion Allure nightclub in Portsmouth and Entourage nightclub in Norfolk.

But if those nightclubs were known for raucous late-night parties Brothers is a spot for upscale dining and chiller vibes. Tony Brothers hopes to eventually host bourbon and wine tastings and attract the sort of jazz artists he admires such as South African singer-guitarist Jonathan Butler or Grammy winner Gerald Albright.

""Once a month they could come in for a weekend set"" Brothers said. ""That's something that doesn't exist here: dinner at a fine dining restaurant with a concert afterwards.""

In addition to the main dining room where entrees often crest $30 the restaurant is also home to an upstairs area called the Loft which offers a more casual place to check in for a wine or a cocktail.

Brothers said he views the restaurant the same way he sees the NBA: as a source of respite and entertainment during troubled times.

""Like with the NBA we provide some relief"" he said. ""We try to provide a safe environment for our customers. Some of them haven't been out since March.""

The grand opening was this week but the restaurant served its first invitation-only dinner in December. And so far he said visitors to the restaurant have been a lot nicer than fans of the NBA tend to be to a referee.

Brothers said he doesn't mind NBA fans' ire — All-Star Carmelo Anthony's wife once took to Twitter even after Brothers ejected her husband from a game — because it means he's making tough calls.

""If your team lost and you're mad at me that probably means I've done something right"" he said. ""If I walked out and they're cheering me that's a problem.""

But for now he said nobody's mad at the restaurant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaG9raWVzcG9ydHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8yLzYvd29tZW5zLXRlbm5pcy1ob2tpZXMtaGFuZGxlLXZjdS1hdC1ob21l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hokies handle VCU at home,"Thanks for visiting !

Izzo deemed it a “precautionary measure” and said Kithier’s COVID-19 antigen test Saturday morning produced a negative result.

Izzo said Kithier will isolate at the team hotel overnight and take a polymerase chain reaction test Saturday or Sunday to determine whether he is COVID-19 positive. After disclosing his symptoms to the trainer Kithier was immediately pulled for an evaluation and MSU officials began spreading the word Izzo said.

“Our people did a great job. Nebraska was notified immediately” Izzo said. “Officials were notified. Administrators were notified. Standby official was notified. I think the only guy that wasn’t notified was me which was fine. So I don’t know what that’ll bring. It’s been an amazing month. But we’ll try to figure that out.”

Kithier played seven minutes against the Cornhuskers first checking in with 16:41 left and subbing out for the last time at the 9:35 mark of the half. He grabbed two rebounds and did not attempt a shot.

Saturday’s win snapped a four-game losing streak that began Jan. 8 against Purdue. The Spartans would then go 20 days between games following a series of COVID-19 cases within the program. Five players tested positive between Jan. 10-25: freshman center Mady Sissoko sophomore guard Steven Izzo fifth-year senior guard Joshua Langford freshman guard Davis Smith and junior wing Gabe Brown. Four members of the program’s staff have tested positive since mid-January: strength coach Marshall Repp graduate manager Lourawls “Tum Tum” Nairn Jr. assistant coach Dane Fife and recruiting coordinator Doug Wojcik.

Each of the five players who tested positive last month have since cleared the mandatory 17-day quarantine and recovery period. Brown just became eligible to appear in a game Saturday and played 18 minutes in his return scoring six points and grabbing seven rebounds against the Cornhuskers.

If Kithier tests positive for COVID-19 he’ll have to complete the same return-to-play procedures. If it’s something less serious he could be back at practice Sunday.

“So these are some of the things we’re dealing with” Izzo said. “All I can hope is that he’s safe.”

Semiconductors are a critical part of the modern world. They're used in everything from iPhones to fighter jets and without them much of the technology that makes daily life possible in 2021 simply wouldn't be able to exist.

Every time you step into a car or send an email you're using semiconductors. So when the global supply of these precious chips begins to wane it can be a big problem.

Take the auto industry as an example. These days electronics account for roughly 40% of a vehicle's value according to a comprehensive analysis from Deloitte. And in order for those electronics to function properly automakers need semiconductors. Without them production lines stall and supply can't keep up with demand.

Over the past few months it's become clear that there is a global shortage of semiconductors. Some blame the problem on poor planning supply-chain complexities and a tradition of keeping chip inventories low in key industries due to expense.

However others argue the chip shortage is more a function of the world's growing demand due to 5G developments the expansion of online gaming and video streaming and the increasing complexity of modern automobiles.

Whatever the reason one thing is clear the world needs more chips. Without them production in key industries will begin to fall and that could mean serious consequences for the stock market or even national security.

Here are 9 quotes that help explain what the chip shortage means for stocks:

""We're seeing such tight demand across the entire semiconductor supply chain right now which we think is an important issue that the United States needs to work with partners around the world to address…We've seen GM shutting more production lines down this week. Having cars not manufactured is a bit of an annoyance but if we can't get critical chips we need for fighter jets military applications and artificial intelligence applications that the economy is increasingly running on it's a big problem. "" - NZS Capital Cofounder Brad Slingerland on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" ""Despite our mitigation efforts the semiconductor shortage will impact GM production in 2021. We are currently assessing the overall impact but our focus is to keep producing our most in-demand products. Semiconductor supply for the global auto industry remains very fluid."" – General Motors in a statement to Reuters. ""It's early days we're doing a lot. Ford knows how to scramble. We're adjusting yield management moving the chips that we do have to the most profitable vehicles our electric vehicles. You know protecting production of strategically important vehicles. We're working through it right now."" - Jim Farley Ford CEO on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"". ""We write to express our concerns about the impact that the global shortage of automotive-grade semiconductor chips will have on auto manufacturing in the United States. This shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery the consequences of which stand to be especially acute in dominant auto manufacturing states like ours. We believe that the incoming administration can continue to play a helpful role in alleviating the worst impacts of the shortage on American workers and we urge you to work with us to address the global semiconductor shortage.""- Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and a group of bipartisan Senators in a letter to Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese. ""We expect semiconductor industry supply constraints on both wafers and substrates to only partially ease in second-half 2021 with some leading-edge (computing 5G chips) tightness to extend into 2022."" - BofA Securities semiconductor stocks analyst Vivek Arya in a note to clients. ""We have seen I think probably shortage across the entire industry. There is a couple of factors driving that. One is the shape recovery I think across many of the sectors that were present now. We saw acceleration of digital transformation also consistent with this trend of the enterprise transformation of the home...So that's driving a situation that demand is outpacing supply."" - Cristiano Amon President of Qualcomm in fiscal year Q1 2021 earnings call. ""This is one that President Biden really has to get involved in because he can make a difference. We need all (companies) at work in order to be able to meet this incredible chip shortage."" - Jim Cramer on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" ""While there's been some debate about whether shortages will be good or bad for the (semiconductor) group our view is that such a supply/demand imbalance is unquestionably positive for the semi suppliers. Historically when semis are in shortage it has been favorable to pricing."" - Raymond James semiconductor stocks analyst Chris Caso in a note to clients. ""It is difficult for us to increase production of the PS5 amid the shortage of semiconductors and other components. We have not been able to fully meet the high level of demand from customers (but) we continue to do everything in our power to ship as many units as possible to customers who are waiting for a PS5."" - Hiroki Totoki Sony's CFO in the company's FY Q3 2020 earnings call.

In large part that's due to an ongoing global shortage affecting semiconductor foundries. As it turns out the problem is even more pronounced in the auto industry. In fact it's getting so bad that a number of OEMs including Ford and General Motors have had to go as far as idling shifts and even entire factories.

Ford had to stop production in Kentucky in December of 2020 and in January it ordered a month-long pause at a German factory. Stellantis (the new company formed by a merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot) reduced output at factories in the US Mexico and Canada around the same time. As did Audi which had to idle 10000 employees in Germany CEO Markus Duesmann said telling the Financial Times that the problem involved ""a very long chain with different supply levels on the components that we are short."" Subaru's Gunma factory in Japan has been affected. Production of Toyota's Texas-produced Tundra has too.

This week more hits keep coming. Mazda just announced it might have to cut output by 34000 units this year due to a lack of chips. Nissan's truck factory in Mississippi has reduced its hours. And on Wednesday GM said it will halt production at factories in Kansas Canada Mexico and South Korea. In many cases the automakers are trying to prioritize their more in-demand products but as some of those closures show that isn't always possible.

Why Is This Happening?

As you might expect the problem has its roots in the coronavirus pandemic. As countries around the world imposed new public health rules automakers cut output and car dealerships and showrooms closed to stop the spread of the disease. As sales dried up the OEMs scaled back orders for semiconductor chips dozens of which go into every new car to control just about everything. Similarly the chipmakers scaled back their production of these chips in response to dropping demand.

As Covid-19 restrictions have eased in certain places demand for new vehicles has returned but the automakers have a problem. In the absence of automotive orders foundries and fabs switched their capacity to fulfilling other orders instead. And despite its size the auto industry is actually a bit of a minnow when it comes to buying chips accounting for roughly a tenth of global semiconductor fab output. Consequently the bottleneck is expected to last for months.

Is Everyone Affected?

The problem has not affected the entire auto industry equally. For example Toyota says it diversified its supply chain and increased inventory of components after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. And Hyundai Motor Group didn't cancel any of its chip orders in 2020 due to Covid-19 so it is virtually unscathed. But the hit to the industry has been estimated at $61 billion.

Don't expect the problem to be constrained simply to the auto industry either. On Thursday morning Qualcomm warned that ""the shortage in the semiconductor industry is across the board.""

‘INTERDEPENDENCE’: A meeting of Taiwanese and US officials focused on how to bolster the nations’ supply chains a Taiwanese official said

By Angelica Oung / Staff reporter





US semiconductor industry leaders yesterday called for Taiwan and the US to sign a free-trade agreement and for Taiwan to enter the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.

More than 100 Taiwanese and US semiconductor industry leaders and government officials joined a virtual meeting which included “prominent” officials from US President Joe Biden’s administration the ministry said.

Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花) told reporters in Taipei yesterday that she would not name the US officials out of a “longstanding mutual understanding.”

“Today’s meeting was mainly between industry leaders in the Taiwanese and US semiconductor supply chains” Wang said.

On the US side participants included Qualcomm Corning the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and the Semiconductor Industry Foundation.

Representatives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) — the world’s biggest contract chipmaker — SEMI (a Taiwanese semiconductor industry association) and other companies and associations also participated.

TSMC general counsel Sylvia Fang (方淑華) and United Microelectronics (聯電) chief financial officer Liu Chi-tung (劉啟東) were among the participants.

The attendees pushed for closer cooperation between the two nations Wang said.

“The word that came up over and over again is ‘interdependence’” Wang said. “US and Taiwanese semiconductor supply chains rely on each other.”

“On the US side it was suggested that Taiwan and the US should sign a free-trade agreement to deepen our cooperation” Wang said.

“They would also like to see Taiwan and [South] Korea join the CPTPP as well as the US” she added.

She said that they want the US to push for an information-technology agreement within the WTO which would “further reduce tariffs on semiconductors.”

TSMC also presented its plans to establish a manufacturing facility in Arizona she said.

The meeting which was conducted through videoconferencing was the first supply chain cooperation meeting held by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US and the American Institute in Taiwan Wang said adding that more would follow.

A shortage of chips used in auto production was not a main topic at the meeting she said.

However the US relayed its thanks to Taiwanese chipmakers for agreeing to give automotive chips priority to try to ease the shortage she added.

“Industry leaders and government officials thanked Taiwan for our help with regard to auto chips” Wang said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzcwYzQyYzA4LWNhYjItNDc5OC1iNTBlLWUyZTA2YzJjZjRjOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renesas to buy Apple supplier Dialog for $6bn,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

Yes last week the San Francisco School board voted 6-1 to remove Lincoln’s and dozens of other historical names (see the board’s spreadsheet here) that committed transgressions from public schools in this case Abraham Lincoln High School.

Sounds crazy I know but it turns out there’s actually something to this.

FILE — In this Jan. 8 2021 file photo California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlines his 2021-2022 state budget proposal during a news conference in Sacramento Calif. On Monday Jan. 25 2021 Newsom and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon and Senate President Pro Tem Tempore Toni Atkins announced a proposal that would extend pandemic eviction protections through the end of June and pay up to 80% of some tenants' unpaid rent. The proposal must still be approved by the state Legislature. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli File Pool)

Lincoln the school board determined pursued policies that “were detrimental to American Indian Nations and Native peoples” including a mass hanging of 38 members of the Sioux tribe. I didn’t know anything about this so I started reading about Lincoln his administration and American Indians and frankly it was pretty shocking.

Having said that and with deep respect to Native Americans I don’t agree with stripping Lincoln’s name from the school. I understand the move would call attention to our nation’s horrific treatment of American Indians but taking Lincoln’s name down would mitigate Lincoln’s great achievement of ending slavery. Calling attention to this stain on Lincoln's legacy is fine (and students should study it) but renaming a school because of it doesn’t make sense.

To many Californians of a certain stripe—those with a Tesla in the driveway and a Peloton in the den—this Lincoln controversy is one more sign that their home state has gone around the bend and that they should pack up and leave. For others the Lincoln story is actually a validation because as you have likely heard millionaires and billionaires have fled California in droves and they’ve taken their companies with them.

I've wondered though to what degree is this just the usual California-rich-people-bellyaching thing (akin to tech celebrity Chamath Palipatiya and others trying to recall Governor Gavin Newsom) or if there’s something more consequential going on right now. And if so why?

As it turns out and like the Lincoln case the answers aren’t so simple.

First yes of course it’s true that many high-profile Californians and companies have left and/or have announced they will be leaving—mostly from the Bay Area and to the likes of Texas Florida and Colorado—including Elon Musk and Tesla (TSLA) Larry Ellison and Oracle (ORCL) Palantir (PLTR) and co-founder Joe Lonsdale Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) to name some of the biggies. More high-profile moves are said to be on the way. (We’ll get to one individual a bit later.)

Beyond the heavy-hitters a number of other lower-profile but key players have also left such as the highly influential Stanford computer scientist David Cheriton billionaire PeopleSoft and Workday co-founder David Duffield (who’s had his battles with California tax authorities) and media-personality-of-the-moment Joe Rogan. And ordinary folks in tech and other businesses have moved too which Nellie Bowles chronicled nicely in the New York Times.)

Story continues

(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)

Why they’re leaving has been the subject of millions of news stories podcasts documentaries Twitter rants and public hearings. Namely: Taxes onerous regulations the high cost of salaries rent insurance and real estate as well as perceived political correctness an alleged lack of work ethic the homeless problem in San Francisco the wildfires and finally the prospect of even more taxes.

Adding to that remote work during COVID-19 has demonstrated that anyone who works by a computer and phone can do so from anywhere. Further the pandemic coincided with and accelerated an explosion of cloud services and fostered the adoption of products and tools like Zoom (ZM) Slack (WORK) and Clubhouse.

In a way Silicon Valley has created technology that is obviating itself.

All this has given Bay Area denizens permission to pack up their wine cellars and their $10000 hand-painted Italian bicycles and go. But is this urge to leave the Golden State really new or is it just another chapter of a much older story?

“I just left last month” says Jim Davidson co-founder and former CEO of the giant private equity tech firm Silver Lake Partners who moved to Montana where he’s had a vacation home for 20 years. “There's a lot of people who think it's different this time. And there's a lot of politicians who think it's not. I don't know if it's different this time or not. But it feels like it.”

More on Davidson’s musing in a moment but first I should point out that disillusionment and apocalyptic visions are nothing new when it comes to California. Exhibit A might be Joan Didion’s chilling takedown of San Francisco “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” written 53 years ago. (Another favorite of this genre: the work of Jello Biafra lead singer of the “Dead Kennedys'' who penned the punk anthem “California Über Alles” then ran for mayor of San Francisco in 1979—his platform included forcing businessmen to wear clown suits within city limits—finishing third in a 10-person race won by guess who Dianne Feinstein.)

In short California and San Francisco in particular has always been off-kilter and difficult but at the same time remarkable and inspiring. (Maybe what’s different now is just that there’s more money.)

There’s a camp that downplays this recent exodus arguing for one thing that there are no hard numbers to measure the scale or import of people leaving.

“I feel like it’s too early to know and anybody who claims they know for sure is doing that based purely on anecdote” says Molly Turner a professor at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business focused on tech and urban policy who co-hosts the podcast “Technopolis.” “My gut tells me it’s mostly just a couple of loud people leaving and throwing a tantrum on the way out. I don’t think it will have a significant impact on the Bay Area as the global center of the tech industry.”

OK that’s the gut but what does a moving guy say? “Typically in years past [moving jobs have] been about 50% outbound 50% inbound” says Steve Komorous who since 1988 has co-owned King Relocation Services a moving agency in Los Angeles California. “In 2020 it was 59% outbound 41% inbound.”

Is that imbalance the biggest Komorous has ever seen? “I think that’s going too far” he says. “I’ve been in this business since 1982. There have been big funky years. This cycle of the mad dash leaving California that will subside. It may take another year or so. It’s just a cycle.”

In fact people have become fed up and left California for decades. 3Com founder legendary technologist and “Father of the Ethernet” Bob Metcalfe exited Silicon Valley in the early 1990s and ended up in Maine.

Jim Clark founder of Silicon Graphics and co-founder of Netscape decamped in 1999. “I had these huge gains after the AOL Time Warner merger [AOL had bought Netscape]” Clark tells me “and I was thinking of moving to Monaco but that wasn't going to work. Then I went to Florida and bought a house over the weekend and began to sell my stock.” And did he ever. Clark bought one of the biggest houses in Palm Beach. (I beg you to take a peak.)

Another point many companies leaving nowadays aren’t exactly highfliers. They’re mature businesses growing through price increases cost cutting outsourcing or by buying smaller companies rather than through innovating. “The Bay Area still has Google Apple Facebook Salesforce Genentech Airbnb Twilio etc.” says Turner of Berkeley. “The biggest tech companies in the world are still headquartered here and expanding here.” (Plus there’s Turner’s university and Stanford.)

Dee Dee Myers former press secretary for former President Bill Clinton hired in December to head Gov. Gavin Newsom’s business and economic development office agrees the exodus is overstated but with some caveats. “Every few years somebody writes ‘California is over’ ‘Silicon Valley is over’ ‘the tech boom is over’ — there’s always some reason” she says. “It always ends up not being true. There are too many big pieces in place here that make this a big place to live and do business.” But she adds “The cost of living is high. There are some challenges to being in a place where a lot of people want to live. We need to continue to try to address the challenges that come with the incredible assets we have. We can’t rest on our laurels.”

That’s for sure because that aforementioned laundry list of issues is very real. You could write a book about each one: fires homelessness and what people consider political correctness. (“You hear that teachers are teaching our kids that we’re evil” a Silicon Valley executive told me.)

But let’s just drill down and take a quick look at taxes in California because they are eye-popping. First California has the highest marginal tax rate in the country 13.3% for income over $1 million. Not surprisingly then it’s estimated that California’s top 1% of income earners already pay most of the state’s personal income tax revenue some 46%. (These are ultra-rich people mind you.) On the other hand Proposition 13 (passed in 1978 remember “I’m Mad as Hell”?) caps property taxes: “Annual valuation increases for locally assessed property are capped at the lesser of the inflation rate or 2% and the tax rate cannot exceed 1% of the property’s assessed value” according to KPMG.

Then there are proposed taxes like a corporate tax which would fund solutions for homelessness. And another so-called “Hotel California” tax where any person who stayed in the state for more than 60 days in a year would be subject to California tax for the next decade. (Get it? “You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave.”) And now a new bill calls for hiking the top rate to 16.8% and adding a 0.4% wealth tax (which if approved would be the nation's first.) The wealth tax would be levied “on all net worth above $30 million” and would apply to some 30400 residents and raise $7.5 billion” the bill’s authors say.

(Also remember thanks to Donald Trump’s tax reform which targeted high-tax blue states read California and New York state and local tax deductions are capped at $10000.)

Myers says talk of new taxes is just that. Talk. “The governor has no intention of raising personal income rates or creating some kind of wealth tax” she says. “[He’s] not interested in increasing corporate taxes. It’s not going to happen.”

But the most recent stay-at-home order allows some businesses to remain open frustrating shuttered business owners who say officials keep sending mixed messages. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)

For those Californians who want to move to avoid taxes they better really mean it. Tax experts point to a lengthy checklist in order to prove you no longer really live in California including which state issues your driver’s license and where your dentist is located.

“I am concerned for California” says Sandy Murray a partner and private client services co-leader at the San Francisco accounting firm BPM who’s done accounting for wealthy people in California for more than 30 years. “More people have left in the past six months than ever in my career. It’s always been a theoretical conversation for clients—should I break domicile? Now it’s become an actionable conversation. I see a snowball effect. When one guy moves and talks about it then I get a call from three colleagues at the same company. If only a small percentage of those folks move it’s a huge tax base that moves.”

I understand people complaining about huge taxes but the fortunes are pretty huge too. And more millionaires never mind billionaires are minted in California every quarter. Even No. 438 on the Bloomberg rich list software CEO Tom Siebel is worth a cool $6 billion. Speaking of Siebel he recently spoke to our subject:

“I think every responsible chief executive officer has to consider moving their company out of California” Siebel told the Silicon Valley Business Journal recently. “My family is here and I love California so for now we're here. But there's not a dinner party that I go to where I see yet another job creator—some of them among the greatest job creators in history—leaving the state and taking their employees with them.""

What will it take to stem the exodus? ""You are going to have to have a business-friendly environment with a reasonable tax structure” Siebel said.

Speaking of high profile people possibly leaving California a knowledgeable source told me Marc Andreessen—Silicon Valley’s alpha male venture capitalist—is making noises about moving to Miami. When I emailed Andreessen to see if that was the case I got back: “No word on Marc leaving CA.” from Andreessen’s spokesperson.

Andreessen has deep ties to Silicon Valley through his investments and through his wife Laura Arrillaga who’s from Palo Alto (her father John Arrillaga retired now was one of the largest property developers in Silicon Valley.) Still Andreessen may want to emulate his old Netscape running mate Jim Clark and move to Florida as he sells some of those big gains he’s made over the years.

And then there’s the political environment which Andreessen addressed back in 2017 when he said “Silicon Valley is extremely left-wing extremely liberal."" You wonder if our partisan environment has been bringing out their inner more Libertarian (dare I say neocon) in the likes of Andreessen Larry Ellison and Elon Musk. It’s also a fact that as people get older and richer they often get more conservative.

As for their destinations “it’s abundantly clear most of these tech executives who are leaving for other cities are in for a rude awakening” says Turner of Berkeley. “They don’t know anything about the politics in these other cities. San Francisco may not have been as poorly managed as they thought it was.”

On that note let’s check back in with one of our first movers Jim Clark. Turns out that after a decade in Florida Clark moved again. “I lived in Miami for 10 years. I got remarried. Once we had kids I didn’t want them growing up in redneck Florida” he says. Ah that.

Clark actually tried California again briefly buying “an ordinary” $40 million home in Atherton. How did that work out? “It’s not the same anymore” Clark says. “It was during the height of the unicorn thing and everyone thought they walked on water and were pitching me things like I was a gullible.” So Clark ultimately settled in New York City establishing an irrevocable trust as a tax shelter.

Would he ever go back to California? “No” he says. “There’s climate change plus Facebook Apple and Google have made everything so crowded and expensive the real estate situation is out of control. And I’m a Democrat but the Democrats there don’t fully get it. I love New York but I do miss the technology conversations of the Bay Area.”

Lessons? How about some oldies but goodies. To wit: “The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.” And “you can’t have your cake and eat it too.”

Bottom line is yes some more tech moguls and their companies will leave California which as it turns out will be that state’s loss but America’s gain. “The silver lining is it’s probably going to distribute tech jobs to more cities across the country” notes Turner of Berkeley. Sure Austin will become a big time tech hub and Seattle already is but the Bay Area will remain the center of the nation’s tech industry. Like Myers says there’s just too much going on there for it to be over. Having said that California does need to get its act together.

A few days ago I was delighted to stumble across a Time Magazine interview with none other than Joan Didion now 86 who has a new collection of essays. The interview was well perfect:

Q: Do you fear death?

A: No. Well yes of course.

Q: Do you have hope?

A: Hope for what? Not particularly no.

I had to laugh. And then I wondered: Does Joan Didion still live in California?

In fact no.

She left in 1988 and moved to New York.

Though she still goes back and forth.

And maintains a California driver's license.

There is a new big rig in town – the redesigned Peterbilt 579! We have seen several prototypes of this new semi-truck testing in the wild before but the truck makes its official world debut this week. The overall styling may not seem new at first but look closer. The new truck’s nose is much lower and narrower than ever before. The truck is much more streamlined for better aerodynamics and Peterbilt says all the changes (including the latest turbo-diesel engine and a smart cruise control system) result in a 7% fuel economy improvement over the older generation. A 7% improvement in efficiency is a very big number in the world of big and heavy Class 8 trucks. At current fuel prices the added efficiency can save around $2000 per year if driving around 100000 miles annually.

Power

The latest truck still offers a wide variety of turbo-diesel engines. One of the most powerful and efficient is the new PACCAR MX-13 engine that can be configured to 510 hp and 1850 lb-ft of torque @ 1000 rpm. The power can be sent to the ground via several transmission choices. PACCAR offers a 12-speed automated transmission among several others.

Technology

The new Peterbilt 579 aims to offer more technology options than any other model. Monitoring all major systems of a semi-truck is critical to its safe operation and the new 15-inch digital gauge cluster delivers the information and allows for different configurations.

The dash console and steering wheel are much like on a new pickup truck. The buttons and switches on the steering allow the drive to set and control the adaptive cruise control function gauge selections menus stereo system and much more. Let us know what you think about this layout and the digital gauge cluster itself in the comments below.

Peterbilt also made the truck quieter at speed and more comfortable than before. Here are several other looks at the new truck’s features and interior appointments. Oh yea the rear sleeper cab can be equipped with a 32-inch TV as well.









TFLtruck looks forward for an opportunity to drive the new Peterbilt 579 soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PYPL,PayPal,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNS1uZXctcGF5cGFsLXByb2R1Y3RzLWNvbWluZy1pbi0yMDIxLTIwMjEtMDItMDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 New PayPal Products Coming in 2021,"2020 was a transformative year for PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). A surge in online commerce led to a record number of new users more than 72 million and a substantial increase in total payment volume. On top of that PayPal introduced key new products like cryptocurrency investing QR codes and the option to buy now and pay later.

""We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year and we will step up that pace in 2021"" CEO Dan Schulman said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. Here are five products the company has planned for 2021 and what it all means for investors.

1. Investing

PayPal launched its cryptocurrency investing service in October last year and management says it's seen excellent traction so far. This year the company will expand the ability to buy sell and hold cryptocurrency to new international markets and increase the number of investment options. Additionally Schulman says the investing product won't be limited to cryptocurrency leaving the door open for PayPal to facilitate stock trading this year as well.

Rival payments company Square is way ahead of PayPal when it comes to making investing easy for its users. Square saw strong adoption among its Cash App users when it introduced bitcoin investing in 2017 and it expanded to stocks last year. Management says users that invest through Cash App generate much more gross profit for Square than those that merely use it for peer-to-peer payments.

PayPal can expect similar user behaviors to result in similar financial outcomes. But with a much larger user base than Square it can benefit more from its scale.

2. Spending cryptocurrency

When PayPal introduced the ability to buy cryptocurrency in its app it promised the ability to use crypto as a funding source for payments at some point in the future. Schulman said that capability will start rolling out later this quarter.

The ability to spend cryptocurrency through PayPal could lead to even greater adoption of the platform as a wallet to store funds. The number of merchants currently accepting direct payment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is extremely limited. The process of exchanging cryptocurrency for an exact amount of fiat currency can be cumbersome and fees on small transactions currently make it impractical. PayPal could make spending cryptocurrency simple.

3. Enhanced bill pay

The company has been working on getting bill payments off the ground since it entered a strategic partnership with Paymentus at the start of 2019. It's seen growing engagement in bill pay transactions over the back half of the year and investors can expect 2021 to be the year bill pay comes to the consumer PayPal app.

Bill pay will give PayPal access to payments it historically hasn't been able to capture. While the take rate for billers is lower than its standard take rate for retail merchants the cost is much lower as well. Bill payments are usually made with ACH or a debit card instead of a credit card. CFO John Rainey told analysts to focus on transaction margin instead of take rate during the buy-side analyst call after PayPal's third-quarter earnings report.

4. Budget and savings tools

PayPal could introduce budget and savings tools to its wallet in 2021. It's likely PayPal would offer those tools free to its users as such features would encourage users to store more funds in their PayPal wallets and then use those funds for transactions instead of more expensive (for PayPal) card payments.

Adding services and features users can't get with most banks will make it more likely they switch from a traditional bank to something like a PayPal Cash Plus account. The company can generate additional revenue from those accounts with its linked debit card and other bank-like services.

5. Honey's shopping tools

PayPal acquired Honey at the end of 2019 and Schulman had a grand vision for how Honey's shopping tools can fit into PayPal. In 2021 we'll see the early integrations of Honey with PayPal including wish lists price monitoring deals coupons and rewards.

Notably Schulman said he wants to offer those features both online and when shoppers use PayPal in stores. Automatically using an offer from Honey would be one more reason for people to use PayPal in stores instead of a credit card. The company has made similar progress by working with credit card companies' rewards products.

On the merchant end Honey's integration with PayPal gives merchants the ability to target offers to specific demographics and spending profiles. And ultimately Schulman sees Honey as being able to develop a demand curve for any product on the internet and PayPal will help people automatically purchase it when it hits their price.

What all these new products mean for investors

PayPal is quickly evolving from an online payment solution to a financial super app. It's a strategy that's worked well for Square which once said it wants to replace your bank but PayPal is quickly catching up and outshining its smaller competitor.

""Each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value"" Schulman said on theearnings call ""Consequently I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates.""

More engagement across the app means more transaction volume and more revenue for PayPal. This scale drives operating leverage and CFO John Rainey expects modest operating margin expansion this year.

You can refer up to 5 friends and get up to $50 with this promotion.

The Deal

PayPal is offering a $10 credit for both sides when you refer a friend or family member who does not have a PayPal account after you send them $0.01 and they set up their account with bank / debit card information and spend or send at least $5 with their account

Direct link to more information

Key Terms

To be eligible to earn rewards through the Program each referrer and referee must have a U.S. personal (including PayPal PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus) or premier PayPal account in good standing (“Valid Account”) at the time of participation through when his/her reward(s) are issued.

A referrer may refer a referee by sending $0.01 to the referee via “Send Money” payment in the app or web by providing the referee’s phone number or email address. The referrer can claim a reward for a maximum of 5 referees per calendar year that satisfy the following “Reward Criteria”: (i) access and complete the PayPal sign up process to claim the referrer’s $0.01; (ii) link his/her bank credit card or debit card to their PayPal account; (iii) verify their cell number linked to their PayPal account; and (iv) complete an Eligible Transaction (defined below). An “Eligible Transaction” means: (a) an online PayPal checkout payment of $5.00 USD or more using the referee’s new PayPal account that is marked as “complete” in the referee’s account; or (b) a person-to-person payment of $5.00 USD or more using the “Send Money” feature within PayPal (sent to anyone other than the referrer) using the referee’s new PayPal account that is marked as ‘received’ by the recipient.

Transactions that have been cancelled refunded or reversed by either the referee referrer or the seller do not count as Eligible Transactions.

You may only refer family and personal friends and acquaintances. Additionally you must not publish or distribute the invitation to participate that you received from PayPal in public locations (online or otherwise) where the audience is likely to include people who are not your family or personal friends/acquaintances. If you do so PayPal may disqualify you from participation in the Program and any successful referrals will be void in PayPal’s sole discretion.

Quick Thoughts

While it certainly feels like most people have a PayPal account at this stage of the game I definitely have a few friends and family members who do not (though I’m not sure that $10 will be enough incentive to change their mind on that). I could see this possibly being an easy fifty bucks for a student whose friends may not yet have PayPal accounts though keep in mind that the person you refer will need to set up their PayPal account verify their cell number and spend or send $5. Maybe that will all make sense if you’re referring someone to the 100K + 10x Platinum card offer who doesn’t yet have a PayPal account (since they will want to set one up to take advantage of the $30 in monthly PayPal credits on the consumer Platinum card for the next few months).

They have offered this incentive in the past though it appears that it expired and came back. This was the first time I had seen it advertised when logging into my account. Keep in mind that the terms clearly state that you shouldn’t post your referral information publicly or refer people you don’t know and there is a cap of $50 per year in referral bonuses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzIvNi8yMjI2OTk3MC9jb25zdW1lci1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWFnZW5jeS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW5nLXZlbm1vLXBheXBhbC1jb2xsZWN0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Consumer protection agency investigating Venmo's collection practices,"The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is investigating money transfer app Venmo over the way it handles collections a new regulatory filing shows. First reported by The Wall Street Journal the filing shows Venmo owner PayPal received a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB on January 21st “related to Venmo’s unauthorized funds transfers and collections processes and related matters.”

PayPal said in a statement emailed to The Verge that it was working “productively with the CFPB to provide information as requested on our practices and processes.” The statement added that Venmo “remains deeply committed to its compliance obligations and the company works closely with regulators around the world.”

A Venmo user’s account may be referred to collections if it becomes overdrawn; while money transfers within the app usually occur immediately sometimes the funds don’t leave the user’s bank account for more than 24 hours. So Venmo covers the amount of the payment in the interim. But if the user’s account doesn’t have the funds available when their bank processes the payment Venmo tries to recoup the amount it covered.

The WSJ has covered Venmo’s collection practices in the past reporting in 2019 that the company even pursued collections against users who may have been the victims of scammers. Last year the WSJ reported that Venmo pursued collections at the same rate during the coronavirus pandemic.

Venmo says its user agreement details its potential use of collections and that it complies with all applicable laws when it pursues collection activity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3doeS1wYXlwYWxzLWRlY2lzaW9uLXRvLWNhbGwtaXQtcXVpdHMtaW4taW5kaWEtZG9lc250LWNvbWUtYXMtYS1zdXJwcmlzZS9hcnRpY2xlMzM3NjE4MDMuZWNl0gGQAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvd2h5LXBheXBhbHMtZGVjaXNpb24tdG8tY2FsbC1pdC1xdWl0cy1pbi1pbmRpYS1kb2VzbnQtY29tZS1hcy1hLXN1cnByaXNlL2FydGljbGUzMzc2MTgwMy5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why PayPal’s decision to call it quits in India doesn’t come as a surprise,"PayPal’s decision to shut down domestic payment operations in India at a time when digital transactions are hitting new records every month may come as a surprise but it was just a matter of time.

While PayPal did not give the reasons for existing the booming Indian market experts who have been tracking the company in India say that the existing business model based on UPI and regulations around it was not in sync with the American company’s ambitions.

Troubles with RBI

The company which has been offering cross-border payments in India for over a decade had launched its domestic operations in India in 2017. But its troubles with RBI had begun in 2011 when the company was forced to suspend personal payments to and from India and transfers to local banks in India. This came after the RBI asked the company to comply with Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999. PayPal remained in the cross-border transaction business for several years after that until 2016 when the company appointed Anupam Pahuja as the country head for India. Pahuja’s mandate was to expand PayPal’s operations in India. In 2017 the company took a bunch of Indian journalists to its headquarters in San Jose California where the company showcased its services in the US market indicating that some of the services could make their way to India.

In an interview with BusinessLine  PayPal’s President and CEO Dan Schulman said that after giving merchants the opportunity to grow their businesses by connecting with customers outside of India PayPal wants to give Indian merchants an opportunity to grow domestically as well. There were also reports about the company acquiring a stake in Indian payment company but that it never fructified. In 2019 Pahuja identified travel sector as one of the key areas for the company in India. “It is high up on the priority list. We are dominant in most of our core developed markets thus we started looking at other markets. We saw a layer of growth that India provides. Our expectation is to be one of the top three players in India in the travel segment in the coming year or so” Pahuja had said then. Then the Covid pandemic happened and the travel industry came to a standstill.

Legal battle

Meanwhile Delhi High Court issued a notice over a petition filed by Abhijit Mishra alleging that the global payments major had violated Section 4(1) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007. Amid this legal battle other global players including Google launched payment services in India and cornered a large share.

In the middle of 2020 Paypal realised that it will have to link up with UPI if it wants to offer a meaningful service in India. “If it had a choice PayPal would have wanted to roll out payment services on its own. It wasn’t comfortable with the UPI model. This is one of the reasons why it delayed the launch even as other players got into the market quickly” said an executive who worked with PayPal earlier.

Final nail

Just when it was planning to roll out its UPI platform the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) came up with a new set of rules in November 2020 that imposes a cap on the share of Unified Payment Interface transactions that a single payment application can process. NPCI said that third-party applications providing payments services via UPI can process a maximum of 30 per cent of the transaction volumes starting Jan. 1 2021. This seems to have been the final nail in PayPal’s plans for India.

“From 1 April 2021 we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses and shift focus away from our domestic products in India” PayPal said in a statement without giving a reason for its decision.

The mobile payment apps are here to create a world where the cashless economy shines.

E-wallet apps available in current times not only allow users to make payments effortlessly but they also offer several other financial services i.e. book movie tickets savings recommendations buy bonds and securities et cetera.

Most developed as well as developing economies are distancing themselves from using physical currency. The developed economies in particular are very committed to this culture shift of utilizing payment technologies. For instance in the United Kingdom NFC technology is used to enable contactless payments at bus and tube stations.

The e-wallet trend grew further while the entire world was locked down due to the pandemic. To be precise many countries across the world realized a decrease of 80% in the use of ATMs. Even the ‘grey’ and ‘black’ markets saw a downfall in the cash usages. A cashless society has many advantages such as transparent financial status and taxation crime reduction convenience and hygiene.

Indeed the cashless society is a nearby reality and the usage of e-wallets and peer-to-peer mobile payment apps will continue to rise. While you might already know what e-wallets are the peer-to-peer mobile payment might seem a new term to you. Hence let’s dig further into the rabbit hole of mobile payments:

What are P2P Mobile Payment Apps

Peer-to-peer mobile payment apps are designed to enable individuals to make instant payments to friends relatives contractors shopkeepers and many others. We consider them modern e-wallets if they incorporate features among mobile recharges movie ticket booking and also offer virtual credit/debits cards.

The p2p mobile payment apps allow users to transfer funds to the receiver’s wallet or bank account. The wallet to wallet transfers are instantaneous but if there is any bank included in the transaction it can take between seconds to days to transfer the funds.

4 Business Models for P2P Mobile Payment Apps

Currently the FinTech ecosystem has four business models for p2p mobile payment apps. These are Bank-Centric Standalone Payment Services Social or Messaging Platforms and Mobile Device or OS Manufacturers. Let’s find out more about the top three in detail:

Bank-centric p2p mobile payment apps

Apps like Dwolla Zelle clearXchange are built on the bank-centric business model. Instead of storing money into the app these p2p mobile payment apps directly draw money from the user’s bank account and make payment to the merchants.

Standalone payment services

The most popular examples of standalone payment services are Ant financial PayPal Vodafone M-Pesa Airfox and Square Cash. Many countries worldwide allow these standalone payment services providers to officially mediate in financial transactions. This allows standalone payment service providers to offer both online and in-person p2p and c2b payments.

Standalone mobile payment apps often have a digital wallet that enables seamless payments without requiring users to draw money from bank accounts. Considering low penetration of conventional banking services in many underdeveloped and developing nations standalone payment services are the best way to bank the unbanked.

Social and messaging platforms

Payment platforms like Square Cash Snapchat G Pay WeChat Facebook Messenger and the most popular one Whatsapp operate under this business model. As social platforms have gained popularity among the majority of the population worldwide social platforms have seen a huge potential in introducing payment features into their social apps.

What made them Successful? – PayPal and Alipay

The pioneer and #1 – PayPal

Elon Musk was very quick to anticipate and respond to the potential of money transfer through the internet. Earlier Elon Musk founded x.com an online bank which later bought PayPal and gained more board members who cumulatively paved the way for a successful online payment industry.

The most crucial success factor for PayPal was its timely acquisition of rising companies in its ecosystem. They acquired Braintree Venmo Xoom Modest VeriSign and Paydiant and also tied up with MasterCard which established them as a successful player in the online payment industry.

PayPal’s critical success factors were:

Blue ocean business strategy

Early anticipation of internet potential

Timely acquisition and partnership within the ecosystem

Harnessing network intelligence

Focusing on standing as a credible business on an international level

The critical success factors that paved success for Paypal are:

Alipay: Chinese PayPal… quite better

Recently the global FinTech market was in shock when the world’s biggest IPO (potentially $34.5 billion) got canceled. Alipay is a subsidiary of the same company Ant Group. Although the USA may brag about its success in financial technology implementations China has proved to be the largest market for P2P mobile payments.

During the first ten months of 2020 Mobile payment transactions in China reached a record $12.8 trillion which clearly is far greater than the $49.3 billion of transactions for the USA in the same period.

The following are the success factors for Alipay:

Good Artists Copy – Alipay had the advantage of Alibaba’s ecosystem and Ant Group’s financial core. The mobile payment solution was launched in 2004 to provide online payment and escrow services in the market. It all began with a similar feature and business model as PayPal but later on Alipay expanded its reach and became a one-stop solution for online payments.

Leveraged versatility – Alipay provided the escrow service almost free of cost. With more and more businesses utilizing their escrow services (as they were very inexpensive) Alipay started having a bulk of funds in their working capital. Alipay utilized these billions of dollars to offer credit and money-market funds to earn interest. All of this was supported by the sister companies – Ant Cash Now and Ant Credit Pay."

The chairman of entertainment at Walt Disney Television was honored with a lifetime achievement trophy from Harvard Women in Business during the group’s Intercollegiate Business Convention. The one-day event featured Walden in a Fireside Chat on the program alongside keynote speakers like Pfizer’s Angela Hwang Bank of America’s Cathy Bessant Microsoft’s Amy Hood and Pepsico’s Paula Santilli.

Walden’s showing was significant in that she was the first and only woman from Hollywood to be participating in the annual event. Moderated by Intercollegiate Business Convention chairs Jeanne Lauer and Lucy Lu (class of 2022) Walden’s conversation covered a lot of ground in 45 minutes including how Netflix disrupted the TV industry managing production with COVID-19 protocols the status of Disney’s diversity and inclusion efforts the benefits of leaning into fear and what she would tell her younger self.

Lu noted the theme of the conference “Be Heard Be Heard” and asked Walden to recall a time during her career when she worked to make sure she was. Walden offered a story she previously told The Hollywood Reporter about how as a young publicity executive at Fox in the mid-1990s she kept running into then-CEO Peter Chernin. Every time he’d say “Nice to meet you.” After about the tenth time she knew she wasn’t making the right impression so during a company retreat she decided to shoot a shot by offering something meaningful to get his attention in an honest and candid way.

During a presentation she took the risky move of saying that Fox was in her opinion not making the right kinds of deals. “We weren’t in business with the right kinds of storytellers” she said adding that the studio kept submitting “little offers” but as soon as agents would counter Fox backed off “and one of our competitors would get the deal.” Walden laid out a strategy to turn that around and she wound up getting Chernin’s attention because later that night she found herself seated next to him at dinner. Back at the office Chernin then moved Walden out of publicity and effectively set her on path into the creative area where she’s gone on to become one of the highest-ranking content executives in the world.

Worth noting that Walden said her original pitch was done in a judicious manner that took into account what her colleagues had already presented. “One of the most important things that everyone in a meeting can do is listen to each other” she also said noting how common it is for people to be stuck in their own heads while thinking of what they want to say that they aren’t staying present. “It’s critical to listen.”

Speaking of Walden was asked to identify elements that make for a successful show. She name-checked Buffy The X-Files The Simpsons and 24 for the reason that those series shared a common thread of inspiring a bit of fear. In today’s streaming world Walden said the dialogue can often center on algorithms and data but nothing can replace a great executive’s gut instincts. “Over time what I learned was when I feel that fear and [when] my heart does a second beat I can feel it pumping out of my chest lean into that” she said. “Lean into ideas that make you afraid.”

Other times it can be just the right elements. She said sitting in the room listening to Liz Meriwether pitch New Girl or Chris Lloyd and Steve Levitan pitch Modern Family it was impossible to keep a straight face. “They were hilariously side-splittingly funny stories about their lives” she said. “If they can achieve what they are describing here those will be really funny shows and those are the situations that occurred.”

Walden was then asked to offer her take on how subscription-based services — Netflix Amazon HBO Max and her company’s Hulu and Disney+ and others — have changed the TV industry and content production. “Well they’ve changed everything” she said simply before detailing how “formidable competitor” Netflix disrupted the TV game by allowing consumers to dictate how and when they would consume content. “It changed our industry forever and I think it really has changed it for the better. It’s given so many different creators the opportunity to tell their stories because there are so many more platforms now. When we talk a lot about diversity of content and creators and inclusion and making sure that so many different stories are being told there’s now the opportunity to have a platform for virtually any type of story.”

Lu then asked Walden to open up on how COVID-19 has impacted the industry and specifically Walt Disney Television. “It’s been an unthinkably difficult year” Walden explained noting that across Walt Disney Television (now called Disney General Entertainment) 150 shows were shut down and in the division she oversees that included 65.

“We then spent the next several months developing protocols and working together with the various guilds that protect the actors the directors the writers the below the line crew members who we work with we worked with various medical professionals specialists infectious disease specialists to create protocols that would enable us to put our shows back in production” she said adding that they did so as a way to support the business but also the livelihoods of all those who work on the shows.

Walden then praised General Hospital and the Bachelor franchise for being “real trailblazers” in terms of navigating protocols and kick-starting production. “I’m deeply indebted to the team at General Hospital. They put their show back into production very early after the start of quarantine” she said. “We got to learn so much about what the best practices were how many times a week we needed to test how many people could be together in the same room as we were producing what the distance that we had to keep people away from each other again to keep our teams and our employees safe. We learned so much.”

The second show back into production was The Bachelorette and it was accomplished by taking over La Quinta Resort near Palm Springs which allowed for a bubble operation. “I’m very proud when I think about the transmission rate of the virus in somewhere like Los Angeles where the numbers through the spike were hitting 7 8 9 percent transmission rate. On our shows we’ve maintained less than 1 percent” she said. “The environments on our shows have become some of the safest places in this city and in the places where we’re doing production just because of a very motivated workforce. Everyone wants to be back at work. Everyone wants to be able to have their shows in production. No one wants to go too long without shows being available to our viewers.”

The final question before the chat was opened up for an audience Q&A focused on diversity and inclusion. Walden was asked what Disney TV is doing to ensure representation of diverse perspectives both on-camera and off. She said she’s really proud to be a part of the Disney team.

“Over the past year we have welcomed in amazing creative and business leaders who are executives of color who are decision-makers at the highest level because I really think that’s where this all has to start if we want to see genuine meaningful sustained change is that the people who are in positions like my own and the presidents of organizations are truly diverse” she said. “Our company is starting to shift and it’s starting to become a place where when leaders are people of color they’re magnets for the best executives and the best talent in the world who want to come and be with us. It starts with leadership and recruiting the most formidable executives of color and then it goes directly to our talent.”

One of the audience questions found Walden opening up on what advice she would give her younger self: “I would tell myself to relax. Everything is going to be fine. Throughout my career I put a lot of pressure on myself I would not say to be perfect but to try to avoid failure. … I think successful leaders embrace discomfort because discomfort is necessary to change and to evolve and to lead and to make good decisions.”

She was then asked to focus on a crystal ball and offer predictions on what the business will look like in 10 years. She said the current period of contraction — a period that has been punctuated by high-profile mergers and acquisitions and widespread layoffs — will pave the way for opportunities down the line. “I think once the contraction is at a certain point and particularly I think when we’re out of COVID and a lot of opportunities open again there will be greater opportunity for smaller production companies over time” she said. “Some artists will again want to be with a smaller company to curate their ideas and figure out exactly what’s right. That will lead to all sorts of other opportunities.”

She said while it’s impossible to truly know based on how much the ground has shifted already but “what I know for sure is if you are a viewer of great content you’re going to be really happy because the next 10 years is going to bring significantly more artists storytellers and great consumer products to viewers.”

What the audience got to see next was the close of the program with a sweet mother-daughter moment. Walden was presented with a lifetime achievement award from Harvard Women in Business and her daughter Casey entered the frame to hand her the trophy. Walden said Casey “is going to be a future woman in business for sure.” She then thanked her hosts for the “incredible day” and the honor of sharing the program with all the women they chose to highlight. “Organizations like this are just critical. I wish there were more of them when I was growing up in the industry for women to support each other and to mentor each other. Ultimately if I leave this industry and there is not a woman right behind me ready to take my job I will not consider myself to have been successful and organizations like you are going to ensure that that happens.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYWxhYmFtYW5ld3NjZW50ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvc3VwZXItYm93bC1jb21tZXJjaWFscy1haW0tdG8tZ2V0LW5vdGljZWQtYnV0LWF2b2lkLWlya2luZy12aWV3ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Bowl commercials aim to get noticed but avoid irking viewers,"Super Bowl commercials aim to get noticed but avoid irking viewers

When Mountain Dew released a teaser of its new Super Bowl commercial last week the clip featured a computer-animated dog made of watermelons – and no people.

That was by design. With COVID-19 still spreading Mountain Dew’s ad agency made the spot with as small a crew as possible and as far apart as the team could keep them. Producers watched the shoot from home. A backup crew was ready to replace anyone who tested positive.

“We created the majority of it in CGI” said John Doris head of integrated production at TBWA\Chiat\Day New York the Omnicom Group Inc. division that made the spot for PepsiCo Inc.’s Mountain Dew brand.

In ways big and small this year’s Super Bowl commercials have been shaped by the pandemic — from who advertises and who doesn’t to the messages they deliver for brands that have chosen to take the plunge at $5.5 million per 30-second spot. No one wants to anger COVID-weary consumers on a national scale with one pricey ad or become the object of social-media scorn.

A few Super Bowl stalwarts – like Budweiser and Coca-Cola – have decided to sit out. Meanwhile some first-time advertisers will highlight how their products are relevant in the social-distancing era.

The Super Bowl is the most-watched television event of the year giving advertisers a rare chance to reach a mass audience in a fragmented media world.

But the number of viewers watching the game has been declining after hitting a record in 2015 when 114.4 million people tuned in. And with streaming services drawing away much of traditional TV’s audience even the Super Bowl is a tougher sell.

CBS said last week it had “virtually sold out” its inventory for the Feb. 7 matchup between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs. But that’s much later than Fox Corp. a year ago a sign that demand may have been tepid. The pandemic-fueled economic upheaval – marked by restaurant closings and a collapse in the movie and travel businesses – has forced advertisers to cut their budgets.

‘Harder to justify’

“In an environment where businesses are scrutinizing every investment a $5.5 million Super Bowl unit becomes harder to justify” said Jason Kanefsky chief investment officer at the ad agency Havas Media part of the French media giant Vivendi SA.

For the first time in 37 years Budweiser won’t air a Super Bowl ad. Instead the beermaker famous for its Clydesdale horses will donate to a vaccine-awareness ad campaign. Its owner Anheuser-Busch InBev NV still bought commercial time for other brands like Bud Light Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade and Michelob Ultra.

Coca-Cola Co. which has struggled with the closing of movie theaters and restaurants said it’s sitting out this year to invest “in the right resources during these unprecedented times.” PepsiCo won’t have a Super Bowl ad for its flagship product this year though it will sponsor the halftime show and have spots for Mountain Dew and Frito-Lay.

Pandemic dilemma

Hyundai Motor America decided to pass on the big game after winning praise for a funny Boston-themed commercial featuring the Alabama-built Sonata during last year’s Super Bowl. The timing of vehicle launches played a role in that decision but as the carmaker made its marketing plans last year the pandemic had created too much uncertainty.

“Six months ago we didn’t even know where we’d be with the Super Bowl in February” Chief Marketing Officer Angela Zepeda said in an interview. “It was a big thing to bank on.”

Still every year brings first-time advertisers hoping to generate buzz. This year’s group includes several companies referencing the pandemic. Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. will use its first Super Bowl ad to remind viewers that backyards can provide a refuge for people stuck at home allowing them to socialize safely exercise and work remotely.

Vroom Inc. an online used-car marketplace will use its first Super Bowl commercial to highlight how consumers can have a vehicle brought to them “contact-free.”

Its Super Bowl ad features a man being physically tortured at a car dealership then cuts to him sitting on his front lawn as a car is delivered.

“We’ve seen considerably more interest in the model during this pandemic” said Peter Scherr the company’s chief marketing officer noting many car dealerships have been closed. “We’re looking to bring mass awareness to the brand and there’s no bigger stage to do that than the Super Bowl.”

Real-life couple

Meanwhile many Super Bowl advertisers have been forced to adapt as the pandemic placed limits on productions. Mercari Inc. an online marketplace for clothing electronics and other products employed actors who were already living together.

“We were able to capture authentic interactions between the actors by featuring a real-life couple and roommates” said John Lagerling chief executive officer of Mercari U.S.

DraftKings Inc. said it purchased the sports-betting industry’s first ads for the big game. It will air two 15-second commercials designed to drive fans toward a free-to-play contest that will ultimately award $55 million to contestants who answer the most questions correctly. It makes more sense for the company to advertise on the Super Bowl now because sports betting is legal in more states. DraftKings can accept wagers in 14 states up from one in 2019.

Every year Super Bowl advertisers try to strike the right tone. Some attempt to address current events without saying something that could spark a political backlash or ridicule on social media. With much of the country struggling from the pandemic and deeply divided the stakes are particularly high.

That’s a perfect backdrop for humor – giving viewers a diversion in hard times.

“People have had a tough year” said Doris from TBWA/Chiat/Day New York. “They may be looking for relief – to have fun and enjoy the game and have something make them laugh.”

Why is that?

The answer sort of depends on what each of those companies and brands has said. In the case of Budweiser — per USA TODAY — the brand announced it won’t have an ad this year last month and it said “in a news release that instead of paying to air a Super Bowl ad it will instead be ‘reallocating the media investment’ to raise awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the year in partnership with the Ad Council.”

Coca-Cola announced (via Variety) “it would not run ads in CBS’ broadcast of Super Bowl LV citing a ‘difficult choice’ made to ‘ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times.'”

Pepsi is still the sponsor of the halftime show but there will be no ad as PepsiCo concentrates on that.

Other brands you won’t see include Hyundai Little Caesars and Olay.

The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer had decided to make a vaccine to fight COVID-19 the new disease caused by the novel coronavirus spreading with frightening speed in the U.S. The factory Calitri ran in Kalamazoo Michigan would play a key role in getting it made.

""I was really excited"" he told USA TODAY. ""I've been working in pharmaceutical manufacturing for almost 40 years and I've never been on a project like this.""

His facility would be responsible for the last few production steps in a vaccine that could help quell the pandemic and save lives.

The reality however soon sunk in. It normally takes years to devise a manufacturing process and develop a new vaccine or drug. He'd been given mere months. The vaccine formula wasn't even finalized.

""I sat down on the couch a half-hour later and I was horrified"" Calitri said. ""My head was spinning.""

During the last 10 months Calitri and his peers at a handful of other drug companies have managed to pull off what they would have considered impossible a year ago: producing tens of millions of doses of a novel vaccine.

And he and others at Pfizer are on the verge of cutting production time for their vaccine nearly in half – from 110 to 60 days.

Although Americans are clamoring for more vaccines people who understand the manufacturing process are amazed at how quickly so many doses have been made.

""Vaccine manufacturing is an endeavor where an almost infinite combination of things have to work perfectly"" said Prashant Yadav a health care supply chain expert at the Center for Global Development an international think tank that aims to reduce poverty.

There's variability in the raw materials the microorganisms needed to grow vaccine products the conditions of the culture in which those microorganisms are grown and more Yadav said. ""It is science with established principles but sometimes is more idiosyncratic than art.""

The two vaccines rolling out across the country since late December have made the vaccine development and production process look easy.

Moderna had a vaccine ready to be tested in people in just over two months. Pfizer which partnered with a German company BioNTech had a 44000-person clinical trial finished before Thanksgiving.

The two teams both of which use a technology called mRNA have delivered more than 59 million doses to the federal government since Dec. 11.

But the vaccine development and manufacturing process doesn't always go smoothly.

Merck another pharmaceutical giant dropped out of the race recently when its early vaccine candidates failed to live up to their promise.

And AstraZeneca which is collaborating on a vaccine with Oxford University in England has stumbled a few times. In a global trial effectiveness figures were muddied by giving some participants a different vaccine dose. Not enough older people were included to make it clear whether they'd be protected.

Now the company is struggling to meet its production commitments in Europe because starting up a factory in Belgium proved harder than anticipated.

""People don’t understand manufacturing vaccines is extremely complicated"" AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said at a recent news conference. ""It’s not like (making) orange juice.""

All the competitive COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers have been pushing to produce more doses faster. But no matter how much engineers like Calitri have worked to shave weeks days and hours off the vaccine-making process it still takes time.

For Pfizer-BioNTech a batch can make anywhere from 1 to 3 million doses of vaccine per production run which the company says will soon take just 60 days.

The time per batch from start to finish was originally about 110 days but as engineers learn how to make the process more efficient the company thinks it will get down to just 60 days per batch.

Still vaccine arriving at hospitals and clinics today comes from batches started just before Halloween.

Even at the current 110 days Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine production time is more than two months faster than that of the influenza vaccine. The Salk polio vaccine takes a full 18 months to make said Robert Van Exan a 40-year vaccine industry veteran who now does consulting out of Ontario Canada.

More than half of the production time for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is devoted to testing and quality assurance – making sure the resulting product at each stage is safe pure and exactly the same as the tested vaccine that proved effective.

Vaccines are given to healthy people so companies must err on the side of caution Van Exan said.

“We don’t have recalls"" he said. ""Nothing problematic could get out the door because it’s such a strict regulatory process.”

Both the end product and the production process are heavily regulated by the Food and Drug Administration said Dr. Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

""When the FDA licenses a vaccine they license the building they license the product and they license the process"" he said. ""The vaccine is the process.""

Most of the companies haven't been forthcoming about their vaccine manufacturing process. Moderna has not publicly revealed details.

But Pfizer executives opened their doors virtually to USA TODAY to walk through the painstaking and time-consuming process of making a messenger RNA or mRNA vaccine.

For Pfizer this takes place in three distinct phases in three places: Chesterfield Missouri; Andover Massachusetts; and Kalamazoo Michigan.

While it might seem inefficient to use separate specialized facilities for each of the steps it’s a common practice in the pharmaceutical industry.

“We used the facilities that were best suited to each of these independent operations” said Margaret Ruesch Pfizer’s vice president for worldwide research and development based at the Andover plant.

Birth of a vaccine: Chesterfield Missouri

Pfizer-BioNTech's American vaccine is born in Chesterfield not far from St. Louis where the raw ingredients begin the process of becoming a vaccine.

It starts with circular snippets of DNA called plasmids. These carry the genetic material that codes for the notorious spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19. The virus uses the spike to hook onto cells so it can infiltrate them and reproduce.

The DNA is made in large vats said Christine Smith vice president of Pfizer's division of BioTherapeutics Pharmaceutical Sciences Medicinal Sciences. These hold hundreds of gallons of an amber-colored solution containing specially designed E. coli bacteria.

Using a process called biosynthesis these bacteria churn out trillions of the DNA plasmids over the course of two weeks.

When completed the solution goes through a purification process – akin to straining spaghetti through a colander – that removes everything but the microscopic loops of DNA.

Next the loops are straightened out or ""linearized"" using enzymes to cut the circles. The lines of DNA in the now-clear solution are then packed into special high-tech bags about the size of a grocery bag and frozen to minus 112 F for storage.

Pfizer must vet the bag producer and check every lot that comes in so it can verify they meet federal manufacturing guidelines. The bags can’t fail because each contains the building blocks of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Then come days of checking and quality assurance in which the DNA material is tested to ensure it meets the strict requirements of the vaccine. There can be nothing extraneous in the purified mixture and the DNA strands have to all be exact copies.

Once the DNA templates have passed the necessary tests the frozen bags of active ingredient are placed in specially-designed containers and shipped 1200 miles away to Pfizer’s Andover plant.

Turning DNA into RNA: Andover Massachusetts

In Andover the lines of DNA are transcribed into messenger RNA the “mRNA” in the name of the vaccine technology and what makes the vaccines unique.

In a cell RNA acts like a ""messenger"" carrying the instruction of the DNA to the part of the cell where a protein is made. In this case it is encoded with the message to churn out the distinctive SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

In effect it enables the body to produce its own vaccine.

The body's immune system can ""see"" these foreign proteins and begins creating antibodies to fight them. That way when a person is exposed to COVID-19 their immune system will already know how to fight it off and they will be protected.

In a highly technical process the linear strands of DNA are turned into RNA in 40-liter (10-gallon) vessels full of enzymes and chemicals over the course of three to four days said Ruesch.

“That one 40-liter batch depending on sampling and things like that can make up to 10 million doses of vaccine” she said.

All this happens in an extremely high-tech manufacturing suite. The air is filtered the equipment constantly tested and all employees wear head-to-toe cleanroom coveralls to ensure nothing is introduced into the vaccine as it’s made.

Currently the Andover plant runs two batches a week but it is gearing up to add more in 2021.

“We’ve added an additional suite sort of a twin to the current one so we can double our production. We’ll move from two to four or possibly five batches in 2021 and that will enable us to meet our growth targets for the year” Ruesch said.

At that point it will be able to produce enough mRNA for 40 million doses per week.

As the mRNA is being made in Massachusetts samples are constantly taken and tested. Detailed records are kept and reviewed by Pfizer’s quality assurance team and can be accessed by the FDA to ensure the plant is maintaining necessary standards.

Next the mRNA must be separated from the liquid it was created in and the excess chemicals used to make it. At this stage it is less spaghetti and more dried angel hair pasta because it’s thinner – though it's all microscopic of course.

Most of the purified mRNA is packed in the grocery bag-sized packages and frozen. The rest undergoes a second period of intense testing to ensure product quality. Only lots that pass stringent quality assurance tests can be sent on to the next phase.

Add fat fill and finish: Kalamazoo Michigan

This is where the frozen mRNA is turned into a vaccine and vials are filled for distribution.

The process happens in Building 41 at Pfizer’s enormous Kalamazoo plant.

The COVID-19 vaccine uses most of the 1 million-square-foot building as it goes from start to finish. Three shifts of 30 to 40 people work 24 hours a day seven days a week. The lines are continuously staffed and didn't stop for the holidays.

Just to get into the formulation portion of the plant workers must first change into scrubs then enter the facility and completely strip donning an aseptic gown and finally gear that resembles spacesuits.

“Very few people go in there. They’re all monitored environmentally because we’re controlling those conditions very stringently” said Calitri vice president of Operations for Sterile Injectables for the United States and the European Union.

Workers at Pfizer's manufacturing site in Kalamazoo Michigan fill buckets with dry ice that will be poured into thermal shipping containers holding the COVID-19 vaccine. The thermal shippers are used to ship vaccines from Pfizer plants to their intended destinations at the required subzero temperature. Photo provided by Pfizer

This is all to protect the purity of the vaccine. Any impurity would render the whole batch worthless setting back the company and leaving millions of people waiting for promised shots.

During the encapsulation process the fragile strands of mRNA are enclosed in tiny balls of fat known as lipid nanoparticles. This makes them stable enough to travel from the syringe into the bloodstream and then into cells before they dissolve.

Without the balls of fat the vaccine would disintegrate before it could deliver its payload. It's a bit like enclosing M&Ms in candy coating so they melt in your mouth not in your hands.

For that to happen the lipids which is the chemical name for fats are diluted with ethanol and then fed together with the mRNA into about 100 specially-produced hockey puck-sized mixers using ""a maze of piping” Calitri said.

The perfectly functional but less-than-optimal layout is one example of how quickly things needed to be put together. One giant mixer would have been easier to operate but there wasn't time to design one and get it made.

When the vaccine is ready to go into vials it is thawed and sent into a high-speed vial filling machine which puts a precise amount into six-dose vials about the size of a thimble.

The entire process manufacturing of the vaccine and the fill and finish into vials takes just three days.

The vials move to an inspection line where they are checked to make sure they are pure and don't leak. Those that pass go to packaging and then back into the subzero freezer.

Quality control and testing take weeks. Each lot of vaccine is tested to ensure product quality – identity potency purity and safety. During this time the vials are also packaged and labeled.

When orders come in from the federal government and the packages are put into specially-designed thermal shipping boxes 50 pounds of dry ice is poured on top to keep them cold enough and they're shipped out to the states. This takes between one and two days.

Seven batches are in process at any one time so there’s always one ready for fill and finish Calitri said.

Pfizer is on track to produce the 200 million doses it promised the U.S. government by May but hopes to have more available as engineers improve systems on the fly.

In Kalamazoo they've already doubled batch sizes so another vial filling line needs to be added. That's in the works. To encase more of the mRNA in the vital fat layer prefab formulation suites have been built in Texas and will be delivered to the plant next week.

""I'm really proud that we've been able to get to this place"" Calitri said. ""When you get everybody pulling in the same direction with the same goal it's like magic. Stuff really can happen fast.""

As the nation revs up its vaccination programs the increase could help relieve bottlenecks caused by vaccine shortages.

""We call this 'Project Light Speed' and it's called that for a reason"" said Chaz Calitri Pfizer's vice president for operations for sterile injectables who runs the company's plant in Kalamazoo Michigan. ""Just in the last month we've doubled output.""

The increased speed and capacity is not unexpected said Robert Van Exan president of Immunization Policy and Knowledge Translation a vaccine production consulting firm.

“Nobody’s ever produced mRNA vaccines at this scale so you can bet your bottom dollar the manufacturers are learning as they go. I bet you every day they run into some vaccine challenge and every day they solve it and that goes into their playbook” he said.

From DNA to doses:The COVID-19 vaccine life cycles

Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is made at threePfizer plants: starting in Chesterfield Missouri moving to Andover Massachusetts and finishing in Kalamazoo Michigan. As of Saturday about 20.6 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine had been administered nationwide.

Pfizer based its production system on how the vaccine was developed in the laboratory Calitri said. Normally engineers would spend years improving efficiencies and cost-effectiveness. That's not what happened with COVID-19.

""We just went right to commercial production"" Calitri said.

As soon as vials of vaccine began coming off the production line engineers started analyzing how production could work faster and better.

""We made a lot of really slick enhancements"" he said.

Production is getting faster. For example making the DNA that starts the vaccine process first took 16 days; soon it will take nine or 10. Though quality control and testing has accelerated company officials say FDA regulations and best manufacturing practices are still being met.

Along with improving speed Pfizer also is increasing output by adding manufacturing lines in all three plants.

As the vaccine effort continues more efficiencies are expected.

""There are going to be profound shifts in the way we do business"" Calitri said of what he's experienced since his boss first called him on March 20 2020 and said the Kalamazoo plant would play a key role in the rapid production of the vaccine.

""We just demonstrated to ourselves that we can go from a phone call in March to having now delivered 50 to 60 million doses.""

The Russian campaign has focused on Latin American nations including Mexico which this week signed a deal to acquire millions of doses of the Russian vaccine and Argentina which last month began vaccinating its citizens with it.

Conducted on Spanish-language social media and reinforced by the official Twitter account of the Russian Embassy in Mexico City the campaign signaled a new wrinkle in Russian influence operations promoting Russian industry and scientific cachet over its competitors as governments around the world race to vaccinate their populations.

The Russian vaccine Sputnik V was named after the first satellite to orbit the earth which the Soviet Union launched in 1957. Sputnik V is considered less expensive and easier to transport than vaccines made by the American companies Pfizer and Moderna.

This case study is part of a collection developed under the Quality of Relationships stream of Shift’s Valuing Respect Project. It explores how Philip Morris International (PMI) a global tobacco company used participatory evaluation tools to gather information in order to address the “root causes of the most prevalent and persistent issues that keep surfacing” – specifically child labor in their agricultural supply chain.

Over the years PMI has been gathering data through regular assessments and farm visits which help the company to monitor the implementation of its labor standards including zero child labor. However it is its latest strategy Step Change that has provided complementary information about local awareness challenges customs and societal attitudes that normalized children working on tobacco-growing farms. In driving this change PMI has set itself an ambitious target to eliminate child labor from its leaf supply chain by 2025. Addressing incidences of child labor is important due to the hazardous nature of the agricultural work which can pose increased health and safety risk to children. This case study describes how a combination of participatory methods allowed local and affected people to express in their own terms any local realities that run counter to the company’s efforts to reduce the use of child labor on farms.

Specifically the evaluation uncovered that:

workers are more accepting of children working on farms than farmers;

child labor is seen as part of a widespread societal norm of communal work; and

strong cultural beliefs ingrained in the society including of some local leaders educators and community representatives weakening the company’s messaging about child labor.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Trial cycling sensation Danny MacAskill has just released a new video of his latest death-defying ride in the Cuillins on his native Skye.



Six years after ‘The Ridge’ attracted millions of views on YouTube ‘The Slabs’ was uploaded last week and shows the 34-year-old climbing up to and then navigating his way down a 900 metre route on Sgurr Dubh Beag.

The descent took him over a very steep ledge system of black ‘boiler-plated’ Gabbro slabs exposed steps and drop offs buttresses and grassy clefts to the shores of Loch Coruisk at sea level.

At the start of this week the film had been watched over 1.78 million times.

Danny told the Free Press that he first learned about the ‘Dubh Slabs’ from John Smith and Matt Barratt of Skye Adventure. When he went off to do his own research he found surprisingly few photos of such a spectacular place.

He added: “I was pretty nervous tackling a lot of the obstacles on the route. The most challenging part was definitely the final 200 metre slab vertical section which on the first day was just not possible to ride. It was very exposed and had a very difficult run out. This made the grip braking and balance very difficult. You literally feel gravity just pulling you down the rock and when the only thing stopping you is your brakes you really feel how steep it is.

“Luckily it all worked out and I managed to get off the slab onto the grass reasonably controlled.



“As much as I enjoyed riding the Dubh Slabs the most memorable emotion was the relief and satisfaction heading back over the loch on the boat after finishing the filming. I really hope everyone enjoys this video and we hope it inspires some fun bike adventures when we are allowed to properly explore Scotland again.”

While filming on the Slabs last September with the ‘We are Peny Media’ production company directed by both Robbie Meade and Danny they ended up filming another short piece set around the north Skye area which will come out later in the year.

He told the Free Press he is not sure what’s next.



He added: “I am semi homeless because we gave up the flat in Glasgow. I am in Wales at the moment filming for a US TV show X Games Real on MTV. There will be six different riders in the mountain bike section. This will air in the US in late spring.



“I am looking for a barn and some land to buy to make more videos but the market is very quiet just now. I would love to build a house on Skye but I need to be close to airports at the moment so will probably look at somewhere in Stirlingshire/Perthshire.”



Danny from Dunvegan is widely known as one of the most entertaining content creators the world has to offer. More than 11 years after his breakthrough video ‘Inspired Bicycles – April 2009’ that included mind blowing stunts filmed at iconic locations across Edinburgh was uploaded to the internet this and his many other video projects have racked up well over 300 million views on various YouTube platforms. The Ridge (October 2014) Danny’s last feature video filmed on Skye where he tackles the ‘Inaccessible Pinnacle’ on the Cuillin Ridge has been watched at least 74.5 million times.

We’re opening 2021’s LEED-based series with the top LEED-certified buildings in Texas in 2020.

Data from the U.S. Green Building Council shows that 139 projects received the certification from the organization’s program in the Lone Star State last year. Combined these projects represent more than 41.7 million gross square feet of space. Offices continued to lead rankings followed by educational facilities and warehouses/distribution centers. Take a look at the list below featuring some of the highest-scoring office projects in the state.

Rank Project Name Certification Date Certification Rating System Certification Level Gross Area (sqft) Street Name City 1 USAA Bank Services Building 2020-02-06 LEED v4.1 O+M Platinum 600754 9800 Fredericksburg Road San Antonio 2 816 Congress 2020-04-10 LEED v4.1 O+M Platinum 470389 816 Congress Ave. Austin 3 The LORD Green Building 2020-05-10 LEED v4.1 O+M: EB Platinum 6663 10807 E.

1. & 4. USAA Bank Services Building & USAA Home Office Building San Antonio – LEED Platinum & Gold

A 600754-square-foot component of the massive 4.5 million-square-foot office asset located at 9800 Fredericksburg Road—better known as USAA’s headquarters—earned the highest level of LEED certification in February 2020. The award is in fact a recertification following two LEED Gold recognitions received in 2012 and 2019. The remaining square footage of the property was also recertified at the same time to the gold level also following two other certifications in 2013 and 2019 respectively. The McDermott Building is also the largest financial office building in the U.S. to earn Energy Star certification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency an award it has received every year since 2009.

USAA’s commitment to the environment is reflected on multiple levels: Through recycling efforts the company saves more than 130 million gallons of Edwards Aquifer water every year at its San Antonio corporate office which is crucial to the region considering it is the source of drinking water for 2 million people and is the primary water supply for agriculture and industry. About 70 million gallons are saved annually as the company has used recycled water for landscaping since 2004. Nowadays USAA also uses recycled water for the building’s cooling towers which conserves another 60 million gallons per year. In fact USAA Real Estate the company’s real estate investment arm has instituted an energy and water analytics program that uses metering to measure energy and water consumption and efficiency at 15-minute intervals. Using that data it benchmarks its properties to detect trends outside normal patterns.

Since 1977 the company has provided employees with the USAA Vanpool Program which is an affordable ride to and from work. Moreover the company’s members have opted for online document delivery since 2019 which helps reduce paper consumption and overall expenses.

2. 816 Congress Austin – LEED Platinum

Cousins’ 470389-square-foot asset was recertified in April 2020 to the Platinum level following two LEED Gold awards received in 2018 and 2019. It is also Energy Star labeled.

This 1.2 million-square-foot building received its third LEED certification in September 2020. Previously the USGBC had recognized its sustainability commitments in 2010 and 2015 with LEED Silver and LEED Gold certifications respectively. Trammell Crow Center received Energy Star recognition from 2008 to 2016.

After three years under construction the 50-story postmodern skyscraper designed by Skidmore Owings and Merrill opened in 1985. Its granite facade and black pyramid on top made it one of the most identifiable buildings in the U.S. Since 2011 the tower is owned by JP Morgan Asset Management according to Commercial Edge data. In 2019 a $140 million two-year renovation led by HKS and HOK adapted it into a mixed-use property by adding a multifamily component and a hotel.

8 & 9. Two & Three Lincoln Centre Dallas – LEED Gold

The two phases of the massive Lincoln Center at 5420 and 5430 Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway were completed in 1981 and 1984 respectively. Spanning 664100 and 602056 square feet the office assets are both at their second LEED certification. Prior to the LEED Gold award received in October 2020 Nuveen Real Estate’s buildings first received a LEED certification to the silver level in 2015. In addition Lincoln Centre has been an Energy Star-certified building from 2009 to 2018 and a BOMA360-designated building from 2011 until 2017. Notable tenants in the building include MetLife Societe Generale Northwestern Mutual Washington Federal and North Dallas Clinic.

The property’s park-like landscape prompted the management team to hire Banyan Water to calculate and deliver the needed amount of water. As such more than six years ago they installed on-site controllers flow monitors and weather tracking technology that integrated with the property’s existing irrigation system. This translated into a drop of 66 percent in irrigation water use. Moreover real-time monitoring of water management tracked down leaks which once resolved resulted in more than 500000 gallons of water preservation per year in addition to the prevention of leak-related property damage.

Star architect to the PM reveals latest project

Chris Irons spent more than five years as the Body Corporate and Community Management Commissioner before joining law firm Hynes Legal as a strata advisor in 2020.

He said one of the most sensitive issues during his tenure for new and existing owners was body corporate fees as well as maintenance programs animal by-laws and committees.

Prospective owners should always be wary of any abode listed as having low body corporate fees as they can literally change overnight he said.

“I think it should raise red flags straightaway as body corporate fees can change in an instant and go up dramatically” he said.

“The best example of that is if there are serious works that are needed such as a new lift a cooling tower or the swimming pool needs to be fixed.

“They are never cheap especially if they are not foreseen and not budgeted for.”

He urged anyone who buys a strata title property to make themselves familiar with all aspects of ownership.

That includes their obligations to a body corporate while encouraging any unit owners to be proactive and join the committee when the opportunity arises.

He said too many people are lackadaisical about or believe it’s too much work joining a body corporate committee.

“The only way forward whether you like it or not is to be part of the body corporate and being involved is not as hard as people may think it is” he said.

“It’s the surest way possible to ensure everything you have invested is protected.”

Mr Irons said unfortunately Queensland’s body corporate watchdog had failed to keep pace with an explosion in apartment living and was grossly understaffed.

Between September 2015 and September 2020 there were more than 5000 new registered bodies corporate and 80000 new strata title lots.

During that period there was also a 33 per cent spike in disputes lodged with the BCCM and yet the watchdog did not employ one additional staff member.

“My former office is running on the smell of an oily rag. I can say that now I am not there” Mr Irons said.

“There is one office for the entire state and the number of people in that office has not gone up in proportion to the number of body corporate and strata title owners each year.”

Figures obtained by The Gold Coast Bulletin show that the BCCM employed 30 staff in 2015 and that number has remained stagnant despites apartments relentlessly popping-up across the state.

A representative from the Department of Justice and Attorney-General which oversees the BCCM said staffing levels would remain at 30 this financial year.

While the number of dispute applications has increased so has the number of matters resolved in the BCCM Office they said.

“In 2019/20 the BCCM Office resolved 1644 disputes the highest number previously recorded.

“The BCCM Office continues to explore options for improving the efficiency of its services.”

“It also maintains an active community education program that includes free public webinars and online resources to raise awareness about rights and obligations under body corporate legislation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

David Hogg a Parkland school shooting survivor who has become a leading advocate of gun control announced plans to launch his own pillow company to put MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell out of business.

Hogg said he is teaming up with William LeGate a progressive tech entrepreneur to compete with Lindell who is a fervent Trump supporter and has spent the last few weeks repeatedly promoting baseless claims of election fraud.

Taking to Twitter on Thursday the 20-year-old said the company is still in the ""early stages.""

It aimed to ""run a better business and make a better product all with more happy staff than Mike the pillow guy while creating US-based Union jobs and helping people.""

""This pillow fight just got very real"" Hogg added.

The 20-year-old said that he and LeGate are hoping to ""sell $1 million of product within our first year"" Axios reported.

""[W]e would like to do it sooner but we have strict guidelines on sustainability and [U.S.] based Union producers"" Hogg said.

The company is expected to launch in about six months. Hogg said he would only have an advisory role for now to concentrate on finishing college. He currently attends Harvard University.

Responding to the news of his possible competitors Lindell told Axios: ""Good for them...nothing wrong with the competition that does not infringe on someone's patent.""

Hogg recently found himself back in the spotlight after a video emerged showing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene harassing him on Capitol Hill as he walked toward the Capitol in March 2018 to advocate for gun control.

The video shows Greene calling Hogg who was 17 at the time a ""coward"" just weeks after he survived the deadly February 14 shooting.

Hogg responded to the video going viral on Twitter saying it's an example of the kind of intimidation fellow gun-violence survivors face while trying to prevent other mass shootings.

""As we fight for peace we also face massive amounts of death threats and armed intimidation simply for not wanting our friends to die anymore"" Hogg wrote.

If you’ve spent time on a golf course in the last 12 months here’s some incredibly unsurprising news: golf had a historic year in 2020.

After a summer filled with packed tee sheets and afternoon 18s for work-from-homers a report from the National Golf Foundation confirmed what many already knew. Even in a pandemic-shortened playing season golf witnessed unprecedented growth — up everywhere from total rounds played (a 14 percent gain on 2019 or a little over 500 million total rounds) to on-course golfers (500000 more players than the year before the largest increase in 17 years).

The benefits of such a surge in play are demonstrable. Course closings are down and renovations are up while equipment manufacturers managed to overcome a rough sales stretch during the first portion of the pandemic to record year-over-year gains. They’re also theoretical — a surge in new golfers could spell a racial demographic or socioeconomic shift in the makeup of the sport which could open the floodgates for broader growth.

In short it’s a good time to be in the golf business. And if you’re a company like Adidas it’s a great time to be in the golf business.

Rounds of golf for 2020 finished up 14% year over year an all-time record!! Pretty awesome news from @golfdatatech.



Digging into the numbers these changes came largely thanks to uhh two factors:



-""an ideal activity during a pandemic""

-""a warmer and drier climate"" pic.twitter.com/JQlMvLw68O — Dylan Dethier (@dylan_dethier) January 25 2021

In 2017 Adidas Golf welcomed new leadership into the fold in the form of Jeff Lienhart a veteran golf executive who previously worked at TaylorMade to become the footwear and apparel giant’s new president. Lienhart brought with him a surprising new vision.

“Our mission for our brand is to be the most progressive golf brand in the world” Lienhart told GOLF.com. “Our focus is on creativity sustainability versatility and inclusivity.”

The most progressive golf brand in the world. That’s an interesting challenge for an apparel company in a sport frequently criticized for its stodginess and recognized for the ascending age of its recreational constituents. Is it possible to remain profitable in golf while catering your product to younger more diverse audiences? If it is possible is it smart?

While Adidas’ strategy has already yielded some notable success — the company gained market share in the footwear space in 2020 with the help of its fashion-forward CodeChaos line — perhaps the best example of its potential for long-term success rests in the hands of Adidas’ biggest competitor.

Fashion-forward product lines like the CodeChaos and new ZG21 shoes have driven Adidas’ growth in the footwear space. Getty Images

Nike saw the potential vested in targeting younger golf audiences of color in the early 2000s when it first made Tiger Woods one of the pillars of its brand. With Woods at the figurehead Nike embraced atypical golf audiences to stunning success crafting out space as a younger edgier adversary to its golf counterparts.

Of course in those days Nike wielded the advertising power of a golfer-turned-worldwide phenomenon. It’s true that Adidas does not possess the same promotional ammunition provided by a young Tiger Woods nor has it pushed the boundaries in the same ways Nike once did. But perhaps some of that is by design.

Rather than cultivating an image behind a singular athlete Lienhart and the Adidas Golf team have centered the brand’s attention on its product line. With the environmentally friendly Primeblue and Primegreen lines Adidas created golf products using recycled materials in the hope of capturing “social investment” from younger more socially cautious consumers.

“Our highest standards are primegreen and primeblue for sustainability” Lienhart said. “We’re striving by 2024 to have recycled polyester in all of our products. For us there’s not a product we create that sustainability is not a cornerstone of our development principles.”

As for capitalizing on the sport’s explosion in 2020 the same way Nike did in the early 2000s Adidas sees its mission as much about selling its message of progressivism to newer younger golfers as it is about cultivating products that meet their needs.

“Golf is a lifestyle category and while you have the uniform for golf that shows up in a lot of our product we now see a huge trend toward versatility” he said. “You don’t necessarily want to play a round and then go pump gas into your car and be identified as a golfer. A lot of the products that we’re building today you could go right from the course to the gas station and people wouldn’t know where you were.”

Lienhart says his company is uniquely positioned to reach scores of first-time golfers entering the game many of whom fit squarely into the company’s target demo. The key as ever is to keep them coming back.

“For the industry as a whole and certainly for Adidas golf I think what’s really important is working on retention programs for all these new golfers who came to the game” he said. “Ensuring they’re comfortable they’re feeling included that we’re building products that meet their needs and we keep them around.”

Lienhart’s vision manifests itself on Adidas’ Tour staff the same way he hopes it will with consumers: as a differentiator an image worth rallying behind.

“Everything Adidas has done as a company their stance on preserving the environment has been the biggest recent stand in my opinion and ties into my own stance” Xander Schauffele said. “My foundation that is slowly being set up is also taking a stance in terms of preserving the environment — tying that into golf and junior golfers. Trying to educate everyone on how we can make this planet last a little longer is a very big step for a massive company.”

“With how the world is going and everything we’ve gone through it’s our job to adapt” offered Collin Morikawa. “So how do you look to the future and how do you adapt to everyone around you to move forward? The word progressive — many people can look at it as a different definition — but it’s all about moving forward and getting better.”

On the heels of a historic year for the sport Lienhart wants to build the most progressive golf brand in the world. It’s a lofty goal sure but there’s never been a better time to dream big.

“We feel we’re positioned well to tap into the thing that golf found out about itself with new golfers showing interest in the game” he said. “It’s hard but in a way of us being Adidas it’s something that’s a little bit easier for us because we’re able to tap into a bunch of technology that exists around the brand and bringing it to golf. We’re leading the consumer on a journey.”

Hogg now a 20-year-old gun control advocate announced on Thursday (4 February) that he and progressive tech entrepreneur William LeGate would be teaming up for a new bedding venture challenging MyPillow.

“This pillow fight just got very real” he declared on Twitter. It appears that the business idea started as a joke between the pair but Hogg later confirmed they’d decided to go all in. He tweeted a list of goals for the future company which included supporting progressive causes and hiring formerly incarcerated Americans. Key parts of the company

-Union made in America to create good jobs that support American families.

-Have an emphasis on supporting progressive causes

-Not attempt a white supremacist overthrow of the United States government So you can sleep at night Relieved face — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) February 4 2021

That alone would be more than enough to set their rival company apart from MyPillow but Hogg went a step further.

When responding to a troll who sent him an explicit homophobic meme the young entrepreneur simply turned into another business idea.

“Anybody interested in a Pride limited edition pillow?” he asked.

“If we sold this pillow we could give all of the profits from it’s sale to LGBTQ orgs and Sex Ed. These trolls are awesome they’re free advertising and they have great ideas keep them coming guys.”

He added that he and LeGate “can and will run a better business and make a better product all with more happy staff than Mike the pillow guy while creating US based Union jobs and helping people. This pillow fight is just getting started”.

It’s hard to know exactly what the MyPillow Guy thinks of this development because his persistent claims of voter fraud saw him permanently banned from Twitter this week. We’ll all sleep a little easier for it."

Industry watchers expect 11Street to utilize its offering of direct overseas purchases to enhance its business competitiveness which will lead to a rise in its valuation.The Korean company is also seeking to raise up to 300 billion won ($270 million) to foster its mobility firm T Map Mobility as the country’s largest mobility service. The final bid is set to take place this month.Under the country’s Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act (MRFTA) a second-tier subsidiary must own a 100% stake in the third-tier subsidiary. Currently the world's second-largest DRAM maker SK Hynix is a second-tier subsidiary which makes it difficult for the chipmaker to make equity investments or set up joint ventures to expand its size.If SK Telecom becomes an intermediate holding company then it would make SK Hynix a first-tier subsidiary allowing the chipmaker to carry out strategic investments and M&A activities.Restricting things further a revised MRFTA is set to take effect at the end of this year in which newly established holding companies will be required to hold a 30% stake in a listed subsidiary and a 50% in a non-listed subsidiary up from the current 20% and 40% respectively.Under the revision SK Telecom would need to increase its shareholdings in SK Hynix from the current 20.1% to 30% with the additional 9.9% stake estimated to cost around 9.2 trillion won ($8.2 billion) based on its current market value.For this reason industry watchers expect SK Telecom to begin its transition soon to complete it before the the new law takes effect.The company is expected to split up into two entities; an investment company and an operating company -- and the investment company is likely to secure an additional stake in the operating company to acquire it as an affiliate. In this case the investment company is expected to issue new shares to the operating company's shareholders in exchange for shares.Jin-sung Kim at jskim1028@hankyung.com Danbee Lee edited this article.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29ub215L3BvbGljeS9tYWpvci1wb3J0LXRydXN0cy1hYWktb3V0LW9mLXRoZS1zY29wZS1vZi1wc2Utc3RyYXRlZ2ljLWRpdmVzdG1lbnQtcG9saWN5L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgwNzMxOTI3LmNtc9IBlgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29ub215L3BvbGljeS9tYWpvci1wb3J0LXRydXN0cy1hYWktb3V0LW9mLXRoZS1zY29wZS1vZi1wc2Utc3RyYXRlZ2ljLWRpdmVzdG1lbnQtcG9saWN5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MDczMTkyNy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Major port trusts AAI out of the scope of PSE strategic divestment policy,"

He said the state government is ready to work with the Steel Ministry to protect the Public Sector Enterprise which provides employment to 20000 people directly and many others indirectly. “The Government of Andhra Pradesh is ready to work with the Ministry of steel to protect the jewel of Andhra Pradesh.



Therefore I request you to kindly reconsider the disinvestment plans of RINL Visakhapatnam and explore other opportunities to put the plant back on track” he said in the letter written on Saturday.

RINL the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) a Navratna Company under the Ministry of Steel currently has a capacity of 7.3 million tonnes per annum and took up plant modernisation and capacity expansion borrowing loans from banks.

Recently the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has given in-principle approval for 100 per cent strategic disinvestment of the Centres shareholding in RINL along with management control by way of privatization.



The Chief Minister said the Cabinets clearance for the privatization has become a point of discussion among people of the state and a cause of concern. Owing to the unfavourable steel cycle globally the company was making losses since 2014-15 and was finding it difficult to service the debt he said “One of the major structural issues that also leads to high cost of production is the absence of a captive mine thereby affecting the profitability” he said.

Reddy suggested that the PSEs short-term loans along with long-term loans be converted into equity taking off repayment pressures and interest burden. He also suggested that RINL be allotted captive Iron Ore Minister in order to reduce the input cost.

Two Confederate statues were removed from public locations in the state of Georgia this week.

This comes as cities across the nation have grappled with how to handle statues of historical figures with troubling pasts including Confederate generals slave owners and colonizers.

As calls for social justice rang out throughout the country following the death of George Floyd at the hands of former Minneapolis Police officers many monuments were vandalized spray painted or even torn down by the public.

Monument put in storage

One such vandalism was the catalyst for the removal of the Confederate monument that stood outside the Gwinnett County Courthouse in Lawrenceville.

The stone monument inscribed with “1861-1865 Lest We Forget” and installed in 1993 was removed and put into storage Thursday according to CNN affiliate WXIA.

Lawrenceville about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta is the county seat of Gwinnett County.

The Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners voted in January to have the monument moved into storage until court proceedings were finished determining its fate a press release from the board said last month.

According to the release the 28-year-old monument was vandalized during protests in June 2020 prompting a lawsuit filed by Gwinnett County Solicitor-General Brian Whiteside that sought to have the monument declared a public nuisance and have it removed.

It was vandalized again on Thanksgiving which led to the board making the decision to put it in “an appropriate storage facility for protection and preservation until the court provides further direction or the lawsuit is resolved” the release said.

“A monument celebrating the Confederacy on county property is inconsistent with the message of welcome and inclusion that the County is sending to the world. We should place it in storage to avoid further provocation and to help the cause of tranquility for the benefit of all” Chairwoman Nicole Hendrickson said in the press release.

Commissioner Kirkland Carden said in the release that it was “time to remove this monument of hate that has been a stain on Gwinnett County since it was erected in 1993” adding that “removing this monument is a step in the right direction.”

Statue moved to historic house

A statue of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston was relocated from downtown Dalton to the historic Huff House Saturday by the United Daughters of the Confederacy who own the statue city of Dalton spokesman Bruce Frazier told CNN.

Dalton sits just 16 miles south of the Tennessee border in the northwest corner of Georgia.

“The statue of General Johnston is the property of the United Daughters of the Confederacy which commissioned it and placed it downtown in 1912” Dalton told CNN.

The historic Huff House was the headquarters of General Johnston “during the Confederate Army of Tennessee’s winter encampment in Dalton for about six months from December 1863 to May 1864” Robert D. Jenkins Sr. attorney for the United Daughters of the Confederacy said in a statement to CNN.

“It is a logical place for the statue where the history of the man the statue and the house may all be interpreted and visited” Jenkins explained.

Jenkins said that the removal process didn’t require any votes or come after any attempts to destroy the statue.

“No one involved in this process has intimated or attempted to tear down or destroy the statue or the history of it” he said adding that the United Daughters of the Confederacy “simply wanted it moved from a public property and were willing to pay for its relocation.”

“In many communities across our country unfortunately similar circumstances have led to violence” said Jenkins. “In Dalton however the various parties have worked together to find and to carry out a good solution. We hope that the new location of the statue will lead to greater interest to and support of the Huff House” Jenkins said.

Frazier confirmed to CNN that the measure was never voted on by a mayor or council and “the issue never appeared on any city agenda.”

Confederate monument to be replaced with John Lewis statue

These are not the first Confederate monuments in the state of Georgia to be removed.

In June last year the city of Decatur east of Atlanta removed a 30-foot Confederate obelisk from the Decatur Square after a DeKalb County judge ordered it to be relocated.

The city had argued the statue had become a threat to public safety during recent protests and wanted it to be put in storage until they could find another place to put it.

Despite numerous impacts up and down the construction pipeline — everything from skyrocketing material prices to widespread labor shortages — the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t constrained the amount of development in downtown Vancouver.

The city is in the midst of an unprecedented construction boom with seven major projects underway or recently completed and many more waiting in the wings. The past decade has seen a consistent ramp-up in construction activity as the economy moved past the recession and the current crop of projects is larger than at any prior point.

“We’re on track to have twice as many (residential) units come online as have been built since 2007 which is pretty amazing” said Vancouver economic development director Chad Eiken. “We’ve never seen this level of activity in the downtown.”

The Waterfront Vancouver has been the main focal point of development in downtown Vancouver in the past few years but it only accounts for two of the projects currently under construction — aside from one at the Port of Vancouver’s Terminal 1 redevelopment site the remainder are all on the north side of the BNSF Railway tracks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5YXR0c3ZpbGxld2lyZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8wNi9tZWRpbmEta2l0Y2hlbi1kb21pbmljYW4tc3VzaGkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Fusion Restaurant in Mount Rainier Serves Dominican Sushi,"The latest trend in fusion cuisine has come to Mount Rainier: Dominican sushi.

The National Conservation and Storage Centre built on the former Szabolcs Street Hospital has won the “Development of the Best Public Building in Europe” category in one of the world's most international real estate awards.

The National Conservation and Storage Centre (OMRRK) built as part of the Liget Budapest Project has been named best public service development in Europe at the International Property Awards (IPA) – László Baán Ministerial Commissioner for the Liget Budapest Project announced.

“With this the Liget Budapest Project has become a unique development in the history of such prizes as it is the first cultural urban development project the elements of which have won three prestigious awards: before the OMRRKthe new Museum of Ethnography was named the best public building in the world in 2018 and the House of Hungarian Music won the award for the best international public building in 2019"" noted Benedek Gyorgyevics CEO of Városliget Zrt. the contractor in charge of the Liget Budapest Project.

The building constructed as part of the Liget Budapest Project based on the plans of the Narmer Architecture Studio is one of the largest museological background institutions in Europe. The centre houses the collections of the Museum of Ethnography the Museum of Fine Arts and the Hungarian National Gallery. Located in Szabolcs Street next to Városliget the centre was opened in 2020.

“The panel's decision also reflects the fact that with the construction of the OMRRK not only will our public collections be stored in better conditions than ever before Hungary has closed a decade-old gape to the rest of Europe. The Hungarian project can be compared to the newly completed facilities of the British Museum in London and the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg and the background institution under construction at the Louvre in Paris in terms of equipment tools and capacity” claimed László Baán Ministerial Commissioner for the Liget Budapest Project.

The Liget Budapest Project has won several awards

The prestigious award is not the first success achieved by the project that aims to renew City Park. Europe's largest cultural investment has been in focus many times in recent years. In 2019 the House of Hungarian Music was named “Best International Public Building” at the International Property Awards after winning the “Best Public Building in Europe” award. This year it was chosen as the best music-themed real estate development in the world at the Music Cities Awards.

In 2018 the new building of the Museum of Ethnography was named not only the best public building in Europe but in the world at the International Property Awards and even received the World’s Best Architecture Award.

The project aimed to achieve a symbiosis between the old and new buildings through plans drawn up by the Ybl-Prize-winning architect Zsolt Vasáros and the Narmer Planning Studio. The two valuable buildings on the site designed by Vilmos Freund were renovated according to historical monument conservation laws. The new building's structure and materials fit into the 19th-century surroundings of the smaller pavilion-like buildings of the hospital. Its simple construction and classic proportions are meant to evoke the character of timelessness and stability. The complex also includes a new 13000 square metre park called Bókay Garden that the public can visit freely during opening hours” added Attila Sághi Chief Technical Officer of Városliget Zrt.

This year's Snapdragon 888 is being manufactured by Samsung Foundry using the latter's 5nm process node. After TSMC Samsung Foundry is the planet's second largest contract foundry.

Apple will responsible for 53% of TSMC's 5nm chip production this year says Counterpoint







On Friday Counterpoint Research released some data based on its estimates of the 2021 Foundry industry. Revenue in the Foundry industry was up 23% last year to $82 billion. Counterpoint shook its Magic 8 ball and is now calling for growth of 12% this year bringing revenue to $92 billion. TSMC should grow 13% to 16% this year staying pretty much in line with the industry's overall growth rate. Including chips ordered for other Samsung projects and those shipped to firms like Qualcomm and NVIDIA Samsung Foundry is expected to post a 20% gain in 2021 revenue. Driving the growth in the industry this year will be gains in wafer shipments and a hike of about 10% in like-to-like wafer prices.









TSMC and Samsung Foundry both deliver cutting-edge chips made using the 5nm and 7nm process node. Based on transistor density (the number of transistors in a square mm) the lower the process number the more powerful and energy-efficient a chip is. The industry just started shipping 5nm chips this year with Apple's A14 Bionic the first 5nm integrated circuit found on a smartphone.





Counterpoint Research expects that Apple will be TSMC's top 5nm customer this year accounting for 53% of production thanks to the A14 and A15 Bionic chips and the M1. 5nm production will account for 5% of 12-inch wafers this year up from less than 1% last year. Counterpoint sees Qualcomm accounting for 24% of TSMC's 5nm chip manufacturing as Apple is expected to use Qualcomm's 5nm Snapdragon 5G X60 modem in the iPhone 13 . Both TSMC and Samsung are forecast to have 90% of their 5nm equipment booked for 2021 with the former grossing $10 billion from 5nm business this year.









Unlike 5nm wafers 80% of which are used for smartphones 7nm chips are used more widely with only 35% of production used for smartphones. 7nm will account for 11% of 12-inch wafer use this year forecasts Counterpoint. Both TSMC and Samsung manufacture a variety of 7nm chips including those made using EUV. Extreme Ultraviolet lithography uses beams of UV light to etch out extremely thin patterns on wafers to help engineers create circuits. The use of EUV has helped foundries take their process nodes down to the current 5nm with 3nm volume production starting next year.





This year TSMC's top customer for 7nm will be AMD; the latter will account for 27% of such production according to Counterpoint. NVIDIA is next at 21% followed by MediaTek at10% and Intel with 7%. Yes the latter does have its own fab but its capabilities are behind TSMC and Samsung Foundry when it comes to process node. The research firm says that Intel's decision to outsource is one necessary to maintain the long term survival of the chip maker.Apple will take 6% of TSMC's 7nm output this year as it still needs 7nm chipsets for some of its older handsets.





Counterpoint notes that higher inventory of chips now up to 79 days from 70 days since 2016 is due to the pandemic global trade battles and other issues. As a result the chip industry will get acclimated to higher levels of inventory over the course of the year. Counterpoint sees annual revenue in the industry reaching $100 billion by 2022-2023.

That's because smartphone users across the pond have received devices powered by Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon processor instead of the Samsung-designed Exynos brains we receive here in Britain.

Tests have shown time and time again that Snapdragon chipsets in the same Galaxy phones offer faster performance and better battery life. In fact the difference has been so stark in the past that Samsung was forced to limit the performance of the Qualcomm-designed chip to avoid it showing up its own Exynos variant too much.

As an example when the flagship Galaxy S20 launched last year processor performance tests from Geekbench revealed that the Snapdragon 865 variant produced a higher power score than the model driven by the Exynos 990. Thankfully things could be a little different this year and those in the UK might feel pretty smug about getting the new Samsung powered Galaxy S21 rather than the same device driven by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888.

A new test performed by YouTube channel PBKreviews has put the new two variants of the Galaxy S21 Ultra through a battery drain test and it appears that the Exynos version comes out on top.

Fun facts to know about the NFL's Super Bowl prize,"Vince Lombardi once said it best:

""Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing.""

Lombardi did plenty of winning as an NFL head coach including leading the Green Bay Packers to victory in each of the first two Super Bowls. More than 50 years after those wins Lombardi's name remains a big part of the Super Bowl festivities. The winner of the NFL season's final game hoists the Lombardi Trophy high into the air in celebration.

Many watching the postgame celebrations know that the trophy is named after Lombardi and plenty of NFL fans are well aware that their team's goal is to hoist that shiny silver award at the end of the season. But there's probably plenty you don't know about the Lombardi Trophy so we're here to fill in the gaps.

Who makes the Lombardi Trophy?

The Lombardi Trophy is made by Tiffany & Co. a luxury jewelry company based in New York City. They've created the trophy from the very first Super Bowl.

It wasn't initially named after Lombardi — that only happened in 1970 — but it's always been there for the Super Bowl champion. Tiffany & Co. vice president Oscar Riedener sketched it out on a napkin for NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle in 1966.

The Lombardi Trophy takes four full months to create in a workshop based in Cumberland Rhode Island according to Tiffany & Co. They make a new one every year unlike with the Stanley Cup so each team gets to keep its iteration of the Lombardi Trophy.

How big is the Lombardi Trophy?

The Lombardi Trophy measures 22 inches high and weighs seven pounds.

The football that's featured at the top of the trophy is made the same size as a regulation NFL football (although it weighs more since it's made out of sterling silver). To create the trophy sterling silver is heated to 1000 degrees before being molded into its shape.

Who has won the Lombardi Trophy?

Entering 2021 there have been 54 Super Bowls played. A total of 28 franchises have played in the Super Bowl and 20 have won the big game. These are the champions who've gotten to raise the shining silver trophy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9zdG9yeS94aWFvbWktYmxhY2stc2hhcmstNC1nYW1pbmctc21hcnRwaG9uZS1jZXJ0aWZpZWQtaW4tY2hpbmEtY291bGQtYmUtYW5ub3VuY2VkLXRoaXMtbW9udGgtMTc2NjgyNy0yMDIxLTAyLTA30gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9zdG9yeS94aWFvbWktYmxhY2stc2hhcmstNC1nYW1pbmctc21hcnRwaG9uZS1jZXJ0aWZpZWQtaW4tY2hpbmEtY291bGQtYmUtYW5ub3VuY2VkLXRoaXMtbW9udGgtMTc2NjgyNy0yMDIxLTAyLTA3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xiaomi Black Shark 4 gaming smartphone certified in China; could be announced this month,"The brand CEO had already mentioned that the Black Shark 4 codenamed ‘Kaiser’ will be backed by a 4500 mAh battery. The device supports 120W fast charging which can completely top up the phone in 15 minutes.

According to a TENAA listing the phone is equipped with a 6.67-inches Full HD+ AMOLED. Speculations say that the screen could support a 120Hz refresh rate just like its predecessor. The device clocked 780000 in an AnTuTu benchmark which coincidentally confirmed that the Xiaomi Black Shark 4 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor. The smartphone dimensions measures 164.83 x 76.35 x 10.33mm.

The specifications of Xiaomi’s Black Shark 4 are as follows:

Display: 6.67-inches Full HD+ AMOLED 120Hz

Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 octa-core

Battery: 120W fast charging 4500 mAh

Dimensions: 164.83 x 76.35 x 10.33mm

It is also surprising that Black Shark is going ahead with the number ‘4’ since many Chinese brands including OnePlus and iQOO have skipped the number in the past. This is because of the superstition prevalent in China and East Asia that consider the number ‘4’ to be unlucky. The superstition is so prevalent that several buildings skip the 4th floor altogether. Moreover ASUS is planning to skip it too and launch the ROG Phone 5 as a successor to the ROG Phone 3. It is said to launch next month."

The concession stands at Raymond James Stadium which offered a wide range of options for the most part kept with the traditional pricey Super Bowl fare.

The cheapest item offered was a $3 cheese cup. The most expensive: an $18 reuben sandwich. Fans could buy an $8 hot dog $13 Greek salad $15 roasted turkey club and $14 burger and fries in between. A single burger went for $10 and an Italian sausage for $10 as well.

(CBS NEWS) - As the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs take their marks on the 50-yard line Sunday at Super Bowl LV 70 federal state and local agencies will be flanking Raymond James Stadium.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers including 500 personnel from the Department of Homeland Security are descending on the most sparsely attended National Football league championship ever amid a pandemic that has been raging in the U.S. for almost 11 months.

Roughly 22000 people will file into the stadium Sunday — under a quarter of the usual Super Bowl crowd — a number that includes 7500 vaccinated health care workers hailing predominantly from Central Florida with tickets courtesy of the NFL.

While the in-person attendance will be severely limited the Super Bowl is the most watched televised event of the year attracting 100 million viewers or more. For that reason the security stakes are exceptionally high.

“It’s a nationwide event. It’s watched around the world so it could be a platform that if someone wanted to exploit it for their message someone wanted to do some type of attack it could be an arena where you’d want to do it” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Michael McPherson said this week.

The Super Bowl marks the nation’s largest national security event since President Biden’s inauguration. And it also happens to be the first Super Bowl in which one of the teams will be playing at home which could raise other security concerns.

“If you had told me 12 months ago that we would have Tom Brady as our quarterback and the Buccs would be playing in a home Super Bowl during a pandemic I probably would have told you that you were crazy” Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said Wednesday.

Dugan who recovered from COVID-19 last month conceded that law enforcement has been tested in the run-up to the big game. “It’s brought a different dynamic to hosting the Super Bowl when your home team is here. Clearly in Tampa we don’t like to do anything easy” he quipped.

But the biggest challenge remains the pandemic.

“There was just so much uncertainty with regard to what the game would look like” Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent in Charge for Tampa Kevin Sibley told CBS News. That uncertainty extended to how many people would be vaccinated in time. “We really had to refocus efforts. As you know rumors of a vaccine have come out and that’s changed things. The NFL has had been forced to make some difficult decisions regarding game day attendance.”

Officials from more than a dozen agencies will operate out of an intelligence operation center stationed at FBI’s Tampa field office.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has classified Sunday’s game as a SEAR-1 event requiring “extensive” federal interagency report. Black Hawks from Customs and Border Protection will patrol the night skies enforcing a “no fly zone” above Tampa. Florida residents have already spotted low-altitude helicopter flights over downtown Tampa in the run-up to the game while the Energy Department National Nuclear Security Administration measures for radiological anomalies.

Hundreds of law enforcement officials traveling by foot golf cart bike and golf cart will patrol the stadium’s security barrier — some with explosive detection canine teams in tow. The Tampa Police Department is the lead agency for the Super Bowl.

The game also follows the first terrorism advisory bulletin published by the Department of Homeland Security in over a year. Last month DHS Acting Deputy Secretary David Pekoske issued a Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) bulletin warning the public of a “heightened threat environment” in the wake of the U.S. Capitol siege. That bulletin however concerned the threat of domestic violent extremism rather than foreign or foreign-inspired terrorism. Pekoske noted that while there is no specific or credible threat ahead of Super Bowl LV officials continue to monitor online chatter from potential bad actors.

One routine constant ahead of Sunday’s game is law enforcement’s take-down of sex trafficking rings and counterfeit game-related sportswear and tickets attracted to the big crowds. Homeland Security Investigations confiscated 284 fake sports championship rings from a memorabilia store in Florida last month. The agency announced Wednesday it had seized 169000 counterfeit sports memorabilia so far totaling $44 million dollars ahead of Super Bowl LV.

Sibley warned fans about the downsides of bartering for cheap counterfeit items. “If you think you’re going to buy a jersey to remember Super Bowl 55 for the next five years there’s a good chance after your second wash that counterfeit good is going to fall apart” he noted. “The second thing is where does your money go? I don’t know anyone out there that would willingly send their money to a criminal-origin organization or a terrorist organization.”

Crowd control could pose an unusual challenge for the Super Bowl this year because Tampa’s home team will be playing. Public health officials worry that local residents will be going to restaurants and bars to cheer on the Buccaneers.

Tampa Mayor Jane Castor issued an outdoor mask mandate for during Super Bowl week. But Chief Dugan noted officers will likely stick to enforcing social distancing guidelines. “We really don’t want to get into being the mask police” Dugan added. “We’re just going to rely on people being responsible citizens.”

The graphics card titled GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition respectfully pays homage to the blower design.

The GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition isn't the only blower-style GeForce RTX 3090 on the market though as both Asus and Gigabyte have both released similar offerings. Emtek's version checks in with a dual-slot design and dimensions of 268.6 x 112 x 38.5mm. The graphics card features a gold metallic exterior that's complemented with a matching backplate. The GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition is equipped with an internal copper vapor chamber for cooling and its only option of active cooling comes as a single 72mm cooling fan.

The graphics card is based on Nvidia's GA102 (Ampere) silicon and brings 10496 CUDA cores and 24GB of 19.5 Gbps GDDR6X memory to the table. The GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition comes with an 18-phase power delivery subsystem. The specification table doesn't expose the graphics card's base clock speed but does confirm that the boost clock is rated for 1695 MHz which is the same boost clock as the Founders Edition.

The PCB for the GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition appears to be a reference design with a small daughterboard to relocate the 8-pin PCIe power connectors to the rear of the graphics card. Asus and Gigabyte also shifted the power connectors to the back as well.

The GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition respects a 350W TDP envelope so it's still fed by a pair of 8-pin PCIe power connectors – you won't find Nvidia's 12-pin PCIe power connector on the GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition. However it's still recommended to pair the graphics card with a decent 750W power supply at a minimum.

The display outputs on the other hand conform to Nvidia's reference specifications. There are one HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs. This configuration allows for up to four 4K monitors or two 8K monitors of your choice.

The GeForce RTX 3090 Blower Edition retails for 2797000 South Korean Wons which equals approximately $2502.35. The price tag seems hefty but it actually is right in the alley of what many custom GeForce RTX 3090s are selling for given the situation that we're in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy83NzcyMy9wbnktcmVsZWFzZXMtbG9uZ2VzdC1uYW1lZC1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkLWV2ZXItaW4tbmV3LWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNjAvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PNY releases longest-named graphics card ever in new GeForce RTX 3060,"PNY has just unveiled its new custom and super-small GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card which I'm sure has one of the longest names for a graphics card that I've ever seen.

Meet “PNY GeForce RTX 3060 12GB XLR8 Gaming REVEL EPIC-X RGB Single Fan Edition”. This product name itself would probably deserve a separate article because it is simply ridiculous however let’s focus on the graphics card.

This PNY model is actually the third RTX 3060 listed by the company. It is also the first in Mini-ITX form factor. The card measures 17 x 12.5 x 4 cm (6.69″ x 4.92″ x 1.57″) and it is kept in a dual-slot design. It would appear that the card is semi-custom which means full custom cooler design but reference PCB however no pictures of the PCB have been shared by the company. We do learn from the specs that this model will require a single 8-pin power connector though.

Now when it comes to the specifications. When NVIDIA announced RTX 3060 graphics cards we noticed that PNY is the only manufacturer to list different specifications different from other AIBs and NVIDIA themselves. Since the SKU was announced last month the company has not changed the specs in fact it is now a third card listed with the exact same clock speeds. Thus we will assume that PNY has plans to sell this card with such specs and the frequencies listed on the website are not a mistake.

Officially RTX 3060 has a base clock of 1320 MHz and a boost clock of 1777 MHz. PNY’s XLR8 RTX 3060 model has a base clock of 1627 MHz and a boost clock of 1852 MHz. Interestingly it would also have a memory clock of 14 Gbps which is slower than NVIDIA’s. We have heard that the specs listed by PNY were actually the original specs for RTX 3060 but they were changed by NVIDIA shortly before launch. It is possible that the company has simply not updated the specs which is simply hilarious.

Apart from the confusing frequencies we have the GA106 GPU with 3584 CUDA cores and 12GB GDDR6 memory across a 192-bit memory bus. The card is designed for 170W TDP.

Cryptocurrency Miners Gobble Up NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 Laptops Set up Massive Ethereum GPU Mining Farm in China

Due to the explosion in the rate of Ethereum since last year GPU mining has once again become popular and miners are trying to get everything they can get hands-on especially NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs. So far we have only seen cryptocurrency mining farms that utilized desktop graphics cards but since no one can buy those in bulk quantities anymore users are now getting their hands on the latest laptops that feature the same chips.

NVIDIA announced its GeForce RTX 30 GPUs back at CES 2021 and several models are now being sold at various retail outlets around the globe. However just like the desktop-side shortages the laptop market could also see severe shortages in the coming months and quarters as the crypto boom continues and miners make the supply run dry.

2 of 9

The mining rig that has been pictured consists of over 40 laptops from Chinese brand Hasee and features the GeForce RTX 3070 mobility GPU. The GeForce RTX 3060 laptop solution is definitely not similar to the desktop variant which offers much better specifications and doesn't come at a lower price either. According to NVIDIA themselves the RTX 3060 laptops start at $999 US & the miners can save a penny by purchasing in bulk but they end up paying at least $600 US more for the laptop variant. Plus they also end up with unnecessary hardware that the laptops feature. At the same time the laptop variants do feature reduced TGPs which might save electricity costs & offer higher crypto mining rates.

The leaker mentions that the laptops need to be put in tent mode to provide optimal cooling for the GPU as these would be running 24/7. You can also see a very interesting exhaust vent that is made out of 32 120mm fans fitted within the window to exhaust hot air out of the room. This is definitely insightful information to help his other fellow miners but not good for the industry that faces severe gaming GPU shortages.

In addition to that a content producer and creator at Bilibili has showcased how easy it is to mine with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 based laptop. The graphics chip was able to mine Ethereum at 0.00053009 rates in 2 hours while sitting at Starbucks so we are talking free electricity over here.

A more detailed earnings analysis is provided by TechARP who suggests that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 can earn up to 2.3217942 ETH per year. That's around $3700 US which means that you will be able to recover the cost of your laptop pretty easily and even earn a small profit considering that these laptops don't consume as much power as the desktop variants as mentioned above.

You can see the full earning breakdown below:

Based on her experience we can guesstimate that the average GeForce RTX 3060 laptop can produce : 0.000265045 ETH per hour

0.00636108 ETH per day

0.1908324 ETH per month (30 days)

2.3217942 ETH per year So that mining rig with 20 Hasee laptops you saw up there could make at current prices about : $8.908 per hour

$213.80 per day

$6413.87 per month (30 days)

$78035 per year Chinese electricity costs about RMB 0.545 or about US$0.084 per kWh. Assuming each laptop uses about 250 watts of power (including whatever external fans he may have) that works out to about US$3679.20 per year. So his net profit for the 20-laptop mining rig would be US$74356 per year at current prices. That’s an incredible ROI of 30.8% per month which means he will recover the cost of the entire rig ($20100) in just under 3.5 months! This is actually 2.9X higher ROI than the 78-card GeForce RTX 3080 mining rig!

Well we would say this is definitely some interesting stuff from the Chinese people & for the mining community but at the same time we know a lot of fellow gamers who will now also be unable to get an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPU based notebook adding to their frustration in regards to GPU shortages and price hikes.

But in some regions the release was mutilated by Ethereum miners purchasing them directly from the manufacturers.

The price of Ethereum increased fourfold in 2020 and after a sudden acceleration in January it exceeded its previous all-time high from late 2017. The rise has helped the cryptocurrency mining industry experience an unfortunate renaissance that could lead to a repeat of the 2017 disaster.

Normally it's only possible to mine profitably with desktop GPUs sold alone. Prebuilt systems and laptops have a higher markup and include components that aren't helpful to miners. But those disadvantages have recently been negated partly because of crypto rising prices and partly because of improved performance offered by new Nvidia GPU releases.

So it's become profitable to mine with cheap gaming laptops. Some miners in China have purchased shipments of new laptops and installed them in dedicated mining racks. The images below are of brand new laptops possibly with RTX 3070s and RTX 3060s inside.

Mining has also gotten easier. A mining rig can be configured in just a few minutes with the aid of simple (evil) software and informative (evil) articles from disreputable news sites. It's so easy that you can do it on the go as one Chinese content creator demonstrates in this hilarious video.

If you don't want to watch the video in Chinese here's a rundown: she's just bought a new Asus laptop with an RTX 3060 and she's taken it into a Starbucks. Plugged it in. Started mining Ethereum. Brought a coffee. Done some work. And two hours later she's recouped the cost of the coffee and she goes home. It's ridiculous.

Fortunately laptop mining is unlikely to be profitable except at scale in specific regions so it shouldn't affect global availability. But it does highlight the potency of cryptocurrencies."

With tens of billions of dollars flowing into her thematic ETFs and returns that easily surpassed 100% last year Cathie Wood has gone from being a relatively unknown investor to one of the world’s best known money managers. Ark even took the mantle for largest active ETF from JP Morgan last year. But don’t call her company a behemoth.

“The word ‘behemoth.’ We are like a startup still and we still have that feel and I never want to lose it” she told Yahoo Finance Presents.

Wood doesn’t think Ark’s soaring assets under management have impacted her drive or Ark’s culture. But the pandemic certainly has changed her typical day and the way her firm does business.

“When the Coronavirus started” she recalled “I brought the team everyone in the firm together at the beginning of every day. And we're still doing that.”

Morning Meetings

Wood says she gets to sleep in a little longer these days since her commute is “a few feet.” She’s up at about 7:00am and begins reading research.

“8:45 we bring the entire firm together and I think this has helped our cohesion as a firm which I didn't think was possible because I thought we were really close before” she said. “We have an open office. Everybody can hear everything going on. So I didn't think it was possible. But I think what happened is the parts of the firm that were not involved with the investment process were fascinated by the kinds of discussions we had. And so the whole firm has coalesced.”

Eventually some of the team moves on to other tasks.

“Most people who are not in research will drop off at about 9:15am” Wood says. “We continue til about 10:30am. And then every day we will have between stock meetings where we do a deep dive into our portfolio tracker which has our scoring system. That was Monday. That is always Monday.”

Getting Outside

After over five hours of virtual meetings Wood tries to get some air.

“I need to go out and walk” she says. “I'll sometimes do them on video if they want to watch me walking around. But for the afternoon. And those will be business. They will be company management they will be analysts they will be business opportunities.”

Even as the firm has grown she is trying to keep her time laser focused on the investing side of Ark.

“I would say 80% is on investing” she says. “And because I am our Chief Investment Officer it is my core competency. And I've delegated the management of the firm to other very capable people.”

Story continues

“We're growing right now including people to go out and represent me” she added. “So I've gotten used to this. I think my productivity has skyrocketed here. And I think our investing has gotten better because we can pounce on every opportunity in real time as we’re Zooming with each other.”

Earnings Season

While Ark has a team of analysts Cathie Wood still loves to dig into earnings season.

“Sometimes we'll have 10 20 sometimes 30 companies reporting. And what I will do is I'll say ‘Okay’ to the aftermarket team. ‘Which are getting hurt the most that's where I'll spend my time.’ And I will go on too and I'll toggle among the conference calls and listen particularly to the Q&A. Listen to what's bothering other analysts out there. Remember I told you we like to see the other side of the story. Listen to what's bothering to them. And think ‘Have we integrated that risk? Or does that matter to us?’ And usually it doesn't.”

If you couldn’t tell from her 2018 call on Tesla (TSLA) to go to $4000 in five years Wood likes being on the opposite side of many in the analyst community.

“They're worried about the 30 basis points and operating margin miss” she says. “We don't care about that because that's this quarter.

“We've got our eyes on the prize. It's a five year time horizon. And actually a margin miss is actually for us a good thing. Because what does it usually mean? It means a company has decided to invest aggressively now to capitalize on this opportunity. And we think that's the right thing to do. Those who are not investing aggressively enough — who are buying back their shares leveraging their balance sheets paying dividends leveraging their balance sheets — they're going to be the losers.”

Somehow it took all this time for these two enduring competitors to meet in the cage. The veteran lightweights squared off Saturday night on the main card of UFC Fight Night 184 and it was a bout worth the wait.

After 15 minutes of solid action Guida (35-20 MMA 15-14 UFC) earned scores of 30-27 across the board for a unanimous decision victory at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas in a bout more competitive than the score would seem to indicate.

“Michael Johnson is a a gamer he hits like a truck.” Guida said. “It felt good to get my hand raised finally.”

The fight started as a fast pace as Guida implemented his trademark unorthodox movement and looping right hands to set up his takedown attempts. Johnson (19-16 MMA 11-12 UFC) still has fast hands and did his best to parry Guida with counter combos. He also cut Guida open with a head kick. But Guida pressed on and eventually took things to the mat.

He was successful there but the second round was the fight’s closest as Johnson did a better job of defending the takedowns and in scrambling back to his feet when Guida did manage to haul him to the mat.

While Johnson’s defense improved in the second he still never really managed to get off any sustained offense in the round. Guida seemed to sense this and picked up the pace in the third. After scoring another takedown Guida got Johnson’s back on the mat and put his foe in a spot in which he needed to defend submission attempts when he needed a finish of his own. The clock wound down and Guida secured his win.

With his 15th career decision win Guida is now 2-2 in his past four fights. Johnson has dropped four in a row.

The lightweight bout was part of the UFC Fight Night 184 main card at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas. It streamed on ESPN+.

And it's in near original condition too!

The mid 1960’s were arguably one of the most pivotal times in the automotive world. With an incredible lineup of great and innovative minds on hand Ford had positioned itself to shape the course of the industry with the creation of some of the most iconic vehicles ever made. Icons for the road icons for the track and one for any course or terrain imaginable: the Ford Bronco.

As is with most of the great automobiles despite its great success from the beginning the Bronco was originally offered with many options that set it apart but weren’t the most popular. However by the end of the first generation the Bronco with its V8 powered 4x4 rugged ‘do it all’ attitude had solidified it as the most iconic all-terrain utility vehicle ever.

Venturing not too far from its original form this stunning blue 1974 Ford Bronco features what is believed to be the original 302 V8 backed by a floor shift manual transmission.

While the interior has more to offer comfort wise than Ford’s original blueprints it would take a trained eye to spot the upgrades. Likewise the exterior is also very thoughtfully done with a bright color scheme that calls the eye yet doesn’t seem to insinuate that anything is different than when this Bronco rolled off the lot.

Currently listed through Maxlider Brothers Customs this classic 1974 Ford Bronco is up for sale with brand new 33-inch BFG KO2 All-Terrain tires and lots of life left in it. Considering the incredible condition vintage feel and great drivability this Bronco seems to be well worth the $65000 price tag.

On Jan. 20 Kamala Harris was sworn in as the first woman of color elected vice president alongside President Joe Biden. Roughly 191500 U.S. flags covered the National Mall representing the people who could not be at Inauguration Day due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.

Many women who watched the inauguration from home opted to wear pearls in a show of support for Harris.

Find Out: How Much Is President-Elect Joe Biden Worth?

Harris’ trademark jewelry dates back to her days at Howard where she majored in political science and economics. After graduating in 1986 she went to the University of California Hastings College of the Law. She went on to become the first Black attorney general of California in 2011 and served until 2017. She also served as a United States senator from California from 2017 to 2021.

But what sort of financial outlook does Harris have as she gears up for the next four years?

Here’s a closer look at Kamala Harris’ net worth.

Kamala Harris’ Net Worth: Around $1.7 Million

Kamala Harris’ net worth falls around $1.7 million. In her latest Senate financial disclosure Harris reported she made $277763 in income in 2019 entirely from book publishing advances.

She keeps a significant portion of that in cash with a Wells Fargo savings account that has between $250001 and $500000 in it. However the biggest chunk of her reported wealth would come in the form of her retirement plan through the city of San Francisco. Her City & County of San Francisco 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan could be worth as much as $800000. She also has between $115002 and $300000 in debt from a mortgage — 30 years with a 3.75% APR — and a home equity line of credit — 20 years at a 4.75% APR.

Focusing just on Harris’ personal reported wealth does not paint a complete picture however. The California senator’s disclosure also includes assets held by her husband — Doug Emhoff — that could add up to as much as $6.3 million. Emhoff recently left his position as a partner at the international law firm DLA Piper. Harris’ most recent tax returns show that her husband reported nearly $1.9 million in adjusted gross income in 2018.

Kamala Harris’ Pricey Properties Add To Net Worth

Before moving to Number One Observatory Circle in Washington D.C. Harris and Emhoff lived in Brentwood California in a home that is worth upwards of $5 million. Harris also purchased a two-bedroom condo in D.C. for $1.775 million that is now worth between $1.8 million and $2.1 million. In 2004 Harris bought a condo in town for $489000. Its value has nearly doubled since then.

(WVIR) - Virtual learning is hard enough for many high school students. Conducting life-saving health research is even harder. One Albemarle County Public Schools student is doing both.

Rachel Field a senior at Monticello High School was recently named a 2021 Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar for her potentially ground-breaking research in ALS a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Her findings may actually help slow the progression of the disease.

“To hear the news that I was joining this community of amazing scientists that has so much history and so many accomplishments under their belts I was shocked and utterly ecstatic” Field said.

As part of the award Field won $2000 which she will put toward college. The high school will also receive $2000 to go toward its Health and Medical Sciences Academy which Field is a part of.

“When we introduced the Health and Medical Science Academy we knew that it could be a powerful experience for students paving the way for future careers and experiences that will have long lasting impacts on our community locally and also globally” said Jeremy Dove the director of the school’s Health and Medical Sciences Academy.

Field is continuing to conduct her research through Regeneron remotely on top of her school work and extra curricular activities. Both she and Dove say her work is a testament to what students are able to accomplish even if they’re learning from home.

“Albemarle County has a rich set of opportunities for all of our students and they’re just ripe for the picking so take advantage of those opportunities because you never know how that’s going to impact you now and into the future” Dove said.

Field is encouraging students to take advantage of the opportunities available in school and to not be discouraged by the remote aspect of research and learning.

”A lot of the time a high school student or even someone older than that would doubt that they have that capability and that adaptability to this new scary situation but if you put in the work and you look for these opportunities you have connections with amazing mentors and teachers in your field of study I promise that these people can accomplish what they want to” Field said.

Better Days Ahead? Local Advertisers to Spend More in 2021

Local business owners are planning to increase advertising spending by an average 35 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 according to Borrell Associates’ most recent survey.

As reported by Inside Radio an industry trade news service many local businesses drastically cut back or outright cancelled advertising expenditures during the 2020 pandemic year. However the Borrell research firm said two-thirds of small- and medium-size businesses which represent the backbone for most local radio stations indicated their ad spending will be the same or more in the New Year.

In addition Inside Radio reported that media sales people and sales managers who worked remotely at home during the pandemic year felt they were more productive as they devised new ways to interact with clients and prospects according to a Center for Sales Strategy survey. The majority of media sales people gave the work-from-home experience four out of four stars and 91 percent they do not want to return to the office full-time.

“Despite a tumultuous year one thing remains certain: sales teams are optimistic about the future of the industry and ready to adopt new tactics” said the CCS study. Respondents included sales managers in radio TV digital newspaper and cable with the majority having at least 11 years of media sales experience.

Kim Kardashian West and Khloé Kardashian talked more about dating Black men in the interview

In 2009 Kim and her younger sister Khloé did an interview with Howard Stern. The reality TV stars spilled a lot of juicy details about their love life. In one particular instance Stern asked them about their pattern of dating Black men which led the sisters to talking about their dating preferences.

Khloé shared that she only liked to date Black men and she even said that she did not have eyes for white men until recently at that time.

Meanwhile Kim said that she was “totally half-and-half”—meaning she did not have a strong preference for either Black or white men. However Khloé pointed out that at the time of the interview many of the people she dated had been Black.

Kim Kardashian West’s father told his daughters to stay clear of Black men

Because Robert is descended from Armenian immigrants Kim shared that their father “always wanted us to be with an Armenian guy.” She revealed that he was not supportive of them dating Black men and even told them something “racist.”

“I would say my dad had issues with it and then after the whole O.J. thing he was like ‘This could happen to you guys’” Kim said. “He got really protective.”

Stern noted that Robert “got sort of racist” in this situation.

However Kim shared that Robert eventually realized his advice was futile and that “it was just going to be the way it was.”

Many fans are extremely uncomfortable with the interview

The interview was over 10 years old but many fans are still uncomfortable with what Kim and Khloé shared.

One person on Reddit wrote about Kim and Khloé’s apparent preference for Black men “Wtf is this they talk about black men like they’re not humans like they are sex toys.”

Another user said “Man I couldn’t even finish it only got halfway thru because it’s so painful. Wtf man. I really… I don’t even know what to say. EVERYTHING is bad about this the questions the answers everything.”

Some people also commented on the advice Robert gave his daughters and showed their disapproval of it.

“The part about their dad is also crazy. Kim says that Robert Sr. didn’t want them to date black men ESPECIALLY after OJ’s trial saying to them ‘It could happen to you’ meaning he KNEW OJ killed Nicole!” one person speculated. “And also wtf does that mean? Like there’s no white violent men beating their wives? It’s confirming what we thought: Robert Sr. was racist.”

Meanwhile other fans criticized Stern for asking the sisters “inappropriate” questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time it was another notable Chillicothe business that was forced to vacate after a series of national closures and downsizing.

Since then commercial real estate company Colliers International has been working to fill the storefront vacancies of North Bridge Street. But the arrival of discount fashion retailer Gabe's — set to open in mid-March —may signify a new era of vibrancy for the shopping plaza.

An apparel home travel and footwear retailer Gabe's will take the place of the former Elder-Beerman in a 55000 square foot shop located at 1080 N. Bridge St. #6 in Chillicothe. Items available for purchase include clothing for men women and children workwear footwear toys games tech and home garden and kitchen supplies. Because of the coronavirus offerings have also been expanded to include face masks baby and pet gear cleaners disinfectants a large selection of food staples and other critical products.

At the store shoppers will be able to find popular brands but for prices up to 70% off compared to department stores according to marketing director Louisa Milligan. This location will also offer layaway payment options for shoppers.

Scheduled to be open daily from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. the grand opening of the Chillicothe location will be March 13. With this new store Gabe's will have 113 locations in 13 different states across the east coast and midwest. Eight more openings are planned for the business into 2021.

Prior to Gabe's both Goodwill and a Tesla charging station opened in Zane Plaza. In March 2019 Brokerage Vice President of the Greater Columbus Region of Colliers International Gilli Zofan said that the commercial real estate company is actively working to find tenants and bring business to the plaza. At the time he said there were a strong interest and a strong market with businesses ranging from food and beverage to soft and hardline goods considering leases.

It's taken so long to fill vacancies because of negotiations with prospective tenants according to Zofan in 2019. There are also considerations to modify larger rental spaces into multiple lots as previously considered with the former Elder-Beerman space.

The news of the grand opening comes just days after Chillicothe-based Petland announced an expansion of its own.

In collaboration with JobsOhio Ohio Southeast Economic Development (OhioSE) and Greater Chillicothe and Ross County Development Petland Inc. announced plans to expand its Ross County footprint in several different locations including the Nier Spec Building on River Road.

Petland was founded in 1967 and is headquartered in Chillicothe. Since then it has more than 240 retail stores throughout the United States and internationally. In 2015 Petland reopened its distribution center and launched a fixture design and manufacturing program in 2016. The company's expansion will add new manufacturing and distribution jobs to meet the growing needs.

As part of the JobsOhio Economic Development Grant Petland will receive $50000 toward building and equipment costs. The investment will add 21 new jobs and give the company additional opportunities to expand according to a news release.

Joe Watson the company's president said that keeping Petland in Chillicothe has always been a priority. He added that they are excited to develop a footprint in Southern Ohio and that the expansion will allow them to remain competitive in the pet industry while also providing jobs and supporting the local community.

“Petland improves the quality of life for their customers through pet ownership and experiences. We are proud to support this employer who has given so much to our community” said Director of Greater Chillicothe & Ross County Development Tammy Eallonardo.

After the emotional roller-coaster of this past trickster Rat year we certainly could use an Ox year. While horse-power was the 19th Century transportation choice in Old Santa Cruz the Ox was the tractor or Mack Truck for the heavy jobs. In the Chinese calendar an Ox year symbolizes hard work slow plodding progress patience and integrity.

Today a recently constructed Dragon Gate at the pedestrian bridge commemorates our last Santa Cruz Chinatown where such celebrations were once common.

Front Street used to be called Main Street in the 1850s but this business district was only a couple blocks and couldn’t expand south of Mrs. Williams apple orchard who didn’t want a road cutting her off from river water for irrigation. Unable to expand downtown merchants shifted to new business addresses on Pacific Avenue around 1866. By 1872 the small Chinese colony moved from Pacific Avenue and Lincoln to the abandoned Front Street buildings overhanging the river until the block between the Lower Plaza and Cooper Street became known as Chinatown.

With the depression in the 1870s the Anti-Chinese Workingmen’s Party formed in San Francisco in 1877 opening a club in Santa Cruz in 1878 headquartered at “The Workingman’s Saloon” in Chinatown. Some prominent Santa Cruzans joined the local club saying “The Chinese Must Go” because they’re stealing jobs from “real Americans” born in Europe.

Yet young Ernest Otto always looked forward to celebrating the Chinese New Year. His father

George F. Otto built the first brick building on the flats in 1852 dead-center on the west side of the block. Above Otto’s Store was a meeting hall popular for banquets balls and theater. The Ottos not only saw the Chinese every day as neighbors but supported their church in its 1869 Chinese Sunday School with a Congregational Chinese Mission opened at the south end of Chinatown in 1881. While only 10% of the Chinese joined the Church a majority of local Chinese came to Rev. Pon Fang’s classes to learn to speak and read English and socialize with other Chinese. Rev. Fang’s wife known as “Little Foot” walked with two canes due to bound feet.

George Otto became County Treasurer at the Cooper Street Courthouse while running his store. The Santa Cruz Courier and Penny Press newspapers were published at the Otto Building with Ernest and his older brother Georgie delivering them. Many locals including the Chinese also paid the boys as letter couriers to-and-from the train since there was no postal home delivery at the time. In this way the Otto’s became well acquainted with those on their delivery route. Ernest would later become a newspaper reporter recalling this history in his articles.

Lunar New Year

The three days before the Lunar New Year were the only holidays the Chinese took. But this was three days of housecleaning repairs refurbishing business signs and cleaning seldom-washed windows. New perforated red paper was hung over interior doors to baffle the devil who had to pass through each hole if he wanted to enter. Red paper good-luck signs with Chinese inscriptions were placed in stores and household shrines.

Few westerners realized the red paper sign placed by their Chinese cook behind the stove pipe made their oven a shrine to the Stove God. When last year’s decorations were burned the Stove God followed the smoke to make his year-end household report in heaven. His three-day absence required much noise-making to chase evil spirits away then sprucing up to welcome him back with the New Year.

Chinatown’s 10 laundries were the ultimate source of stove shrines running 24-hours-a-day. A blast of heat hit you on entering the door of Hop Lee’s Laundry smelling of charcoal and incense. The incense gave the clothes a distinct perfume but came from a small shrine alcove each stove had this one dedicated to the God of Wealth. An octagonal stove in the center of the room had flatirons constantly warming on it. The side walls had a dozen long padded table-like ironing boards each with a bowl of water. Holding the cloth with one hand and ironing with the other the laundryman would bend down fill his mouth with water then spray it onto the clothes. Under each ironing board was a man sleeping before the next shift.

Chinese New Year is sometimes called the “Narcissus Festival” as this is the chief symbol of New Year’s renewal. The Chinese called the local plant “sui sin far” in Cantonese while Americans called them “China lilies.” The plants grew profusely along the San Lorenzo River near Chinatown where bulbs were collected weeks before the new year and tended in rock-filled bowls to make them bloom on New Year’s Day. The flowers were then used to decorate household alters and as gifts to friends and employers. Such gifts ended up in many non-Asian gardens.

A center of New Year activities was the Joss Temple in the only brick building on the east side of the street (opposite Otto’s Store). The temple was behind a back gambling room and managed by Ham Git called Wong Kee because he was proprietor of the Wong Kee Store. As he sometimes spoke on behalf of the Chinese community he was one of two people dubbed the Mayor of Chinatown. Those who entered the temple would bow before the shrine burn incense in a gravel bowl and sprinkle wine on the floor where a roast pig sat with red booties. There were several other Chinese gambling houses in other nearby stores where games of dominoes pai gow fan tan cards and checkers were played most of which were invented in China. But mah jongg had yet to be imported. The general public only played the Chinese Lottery.

Chinese Zodiac

It was the year of the Ox in 1889 when Ernest was 18 years old. The Chinese Zodiac got its animals when the Jade Emperor said the first 12 creatures who arrived would be made knights of his palace. Rat tricked a Cat to sleep through the challenge then came to a river Rat couldn’t cross. When he hitched a ride on the Ox’s back the two became first and second at the Emperor’s palace. Speedy Tiger and Rabbit came in third and fourth with Dragon and his adopted son the Snake coming in fifth and sixth. Then the kind and modest Horse and Sheep joined them as seventh and eighth ahead of Monkey who kept stopping to play arriving ninth. Rooster Dog and Pig came last. The Emperor was impressed with their characteristics making them a Zodiac of 12 year cycles.

Under the sign of the green basin Ernest and Georgie looked into Sing Lee’s barber shop as men spruced-up for the New Year. Sing Lee waved at the boys with a sixth finger protruding from his right thumb then set to work. He unbraided the interwoven ribbon from the customers long pigtail “queue” and hung it on a nail while running a wooden comb through the hair. The face was dipped in a basin of very hot water and shaved without soap. The razor was made of roughly hammered triangular steel with one side highly sharpened. A small board was held in the other hand to catch the hair. Lastly he shaved the space between the eyebrows.

On the afternoon of New Year’s Eve the Chinese dressed in their most colorful silk finery going door-to-door with sacks of silver dollars for all debts must be paid before the New Year. The Otto boys had learned to say “Gong Hey Fat Choy!” which was Cantonese for “Happy New Year!”

While doing their rounds Georgie jumped at the sudden bursts of firecrackers popping up in unexpected places. Ernest laughed and said “Well it must be 4 o’clock” for that was the time when a racket announced the home where different groups would feast.

Chinatown celebrated New Year’s Day with an open house at shops and homes. Merchants gave customers China Lily bulbs with bags of mixed Chinese candy and lychee nuts for the children and bags of firecrackers for the older kids. Homes were decorated with bowls of grapefruits and oranges and lacquer boxes of sweetmeats while non-Asians often gave New Year’s cakes as a sign of friendship. During one New Year celebration a lottery winner broke the bank and spent all his winnings on the finest fireworks show ever seen in the Santa Cruz Chinatown.

Since Chinatown overhung the river high water was sometimes part of the season. Chinese legend has it that in ancient times land and sea were completely divided with a drought killing crops and livestock and causing people to starve. Four dragons went to the Jade Emperor’s Heavenly Palace and told him people were praying for rain. The Emperor was offended they had burst into his palace and said he’d send rain tomorrow. But after 10 days without rain the dragons realized the Emperor didn’t know what human suffering was.

Since they lived in the sea the dragons decided to share their wealth of water with humanity and they breathed out clouds that rained upon the earth ending the drought and making the land flourish. The Emperor was furious that the dragons made rain without his permission so he imprisoned them under four mountains. But each dragon sent springs of water out of the mountain and they turned into four great Chinese rivers. The Jade Emperor learned that water is the soul of freedom and can escape all barriers.

""Small-ship cruising"" is actually a completely different class of sailing encompassing everything from a yacht with a few dozen passengers to ships carrying as many as 1300 guests.

Small ships distinguish themselves from mainstream cruise ships in more ways than just physical size -- which allows them to sail into small harbors and shallow channels. Lower passenger counts make for easier embarkation and an absence of queues. No matter how small the ship you can expect more inclusive fares interesting and unusual ports of call high-end amenities excellent cuisine and wine and polished personal service.

If small ships sound more appealing to you than their larger floating-city counterparts choices abound. How do you know when small is too small -- or which small ships are still too big for your taste? For the sake of this discussion we'll use the following classifications:

Small Yachts: Up to 110 passengers

Large Yachts: 140 to 400 passengers

Ultra-Small Ships: 450 to 625 passengers

Small Ships: 650 to 1300 passengers

Read on to find out which of the four small-ship size groups will offer your dream cruise.

Small Yachts

Cruise lines: The ""small yacht"" category includes ships that accommodate no more than 110 passengers. Here you'll find yachts that range in length from 120 to 360 feet brought to you by UnCruise Adventures Crystal Cruises SeaDream Yacht Club Grand Circle Cruise Line Variety Cruises and Emerald Yacht Cruises' (part of Emerald Waterways) debut into ocean sailing with Emerald Azzurra. Ponant's entry to this category is Le Ponant a three-masted motor-yacht; a trio of windjammers from Sea Cloud Cruises and Island Windjammers' fleet of two ships round out the list.

Vibe: You won't enjoy a voyage aboard a yacht in this category unless you love traveling with a very small group of people. If you wish to hobnob with a different group of people each night look to a larger ship.

The onboard experience is also more like that of sailing on a private yacht. You'll get to know your fellow passengers -- who tend to be well off and well traveled -- and the crew will cater to your every need quickly learning not just your name but your likes and your dislikes.

Destination focus: Small-ship cruising in general is all about the destination and that's even more the case aboard small yachts. These downright tiny vessels can anchor in hidden-away bays and harbors and can visit some truly off-the-grid destinations such as Alaska's Kuiu Island or Curieuse in the Seychelles.

Plus small yachts put a premium on getting passengers close to amazing sites. For example take Alaska's Inside Passage; while mainstream cruise ships sail past Dawes Glacier in Endicott Arm yacht passengers don marine survival suits board skiffs and get within feet of seals sitting prettily atop icebergs floating in the strait.

Most port visits focus on the natural habitat or local culture of the destination and many of these cruise lines hire well-educated naturalists and historians to interact with passengers each day offering onboard lectures and leading shore excursions (which are included in the cruise fare in the case of UnCruise Adventures' trips). These experts are on hand to answer questions and provide a level of education about the region that makes the trip special.

Ship amenities: Cabins tend to be well-decorated but on the small side and lack balconies or adjoining sitting rooms. Your stateroom will be well tended to and it will include amenities like luxurious linens and designer-brand bath products but you'll likely want to spend more time out of your cabin than in it.

Restaurant choice will be limited to one dining venue (with breakfast and possibly lunch served as a buffet only) and a limited selection of dinner entrees (typically a meat fish and vegetarian option). Though seating is open mealtimes are set but can change based on what's going on outside. For example if there are whale sightings in Alaska dinner could be delayed in order to allow everyone to get on deck and have a look.

On the bright side the chef will incorporate locally sourced ingredients -- salmon in Alaska pineapple in Hawaii -- at mealtime and can customize the menu to a certain degree for your personal tastes.

Activities: Because the itinerary is so paramount on small yachts daytime activities are pretty non-existent. Passengers generally need to entertain themselves. While the sun decks are nice on all of these ships only Crystal Esprit SeaDream I and II and Emerald Azzurra have pools; the other ships only have on-deck hot tubs.

The spa (if any) usually consists of one or two small treatment rooms. Some yachts do have a few fun high-tech toys -- like the submarine aboard Crystal Esprit or the golf simulator on SeaDream yachts. There are no theaters on these ships and the ""casino"" -- when there is one -- is often just one game table with a slot machine located in a nearby corner.

One of the most appealing aspects of small yachts are their water sports platforms which enable passengers to get right into the water rather than simply gazing at it from 10 decks up. All of the ships in this category with the exception of SeaCloud and Island Windjammers have them. From the platform you can go swimming or snorkeling right from the ship or borrow a personal watercraft such as a kayak or canoe. SeaDream also has several Jet Skis for passenger use and there are paddleboards on Emerald Azzurra.

While some larger yachts and ships have similar onboard marinas it's a different experience when you're sharing the facilities with so few people. It feels as if the yacht is yours alone and you're simply enjoying the water with a handful of friends.

Large Yachts

Cruise lines: ""Large"" yachts are those that accommodate between 140 and 400 passengers and feel more like small-scale cruise ships than pumped-up private yachts.

Large yachts in this category include Windstar Cruises' three motor-sail yachts and its three 212-passenger yachts; Pearl Mist from Pearl Seas Cruises; Scenic's first 228-passenger all-suite super yacht Scenic Eclipse (which comes with two helicopters and a six-passenger submarine); six mega-yachts and an expanding fleet of 13 explorer vessels (some with underwater lounges) from the French-flagged Ponant; Paul Gauguin's Paul Gauguin and Aranui Cruises' Aranui 5 which both sail exclusively in the South Pacific; three clipper ships from Star Clippers; six ships from Silversea ; and Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection's three yachts that accommodate 298 passengers. The French company CroisiEurope best known for their river cruises also has two oceangoing ships carrying up to 198 passengers.

New additions to the large yacht scene are Tradewind Voyages' 272-passenger Golden Horizon the world's largest square-rigged sailing vessel. Plus a well-known name to U.K. cruisers Swan Hellenic has been revived under new ownership -- with cruises now sold internationally -- which is debuting three all-new vessels carrying between 152 and 196 passengers.

Vibe: These capacities are ideal for travelers who want an intimate experience but prefer sailing with more than a few dozen other people. These ships are also a good bet if you don't like feeling the movement of the ocean; because they are larger the ride is usually a bit smoother than small yacht options.

Destination focus: These large yachts can visit some additional destinations that the small yachts can't visit safely (due to their size) but larger ships might be too big to access. Look for itineraries to the Arctic and Antarctica -- destinations that require larger ships with certain navigational equipment and strengthened hulls for sailing in areas where ice is prevalent. Large yachts also offer some compelling South Pacific itineraries.

Ship amenities: There are some nice perks when you sail a large yacht. First of all you'll have more choice when it comes to cabins. Some cabins on large yachts will have balconies with sweeping ocean views while none of the ships in the ""Small Yacht"" category aside from Emerald Azzurra offer accommodations with verandas.

Most of the ships in this category also offer a variety of suites that give you more square footage space to dine in your cabin and outdoor furniture to enjoy on your veranda. Ships from Silversea offer butler service with every stateroom which equates to an ultra-luxurious experience for all.

These larger ships offer more dining venues onboard. Silversea ships in this category for example offer three fine dining options -- The Restaurant main dining room La Terrazza for authentic Italian flair and specialty restaurant La Dame featuring French cuisine -- in addition to the on-deck Pool Bar & Grill. Many lines -- including Windstar Silversea and Paul Gauguin -- also stage elaborate BBQs on deck or on a beautiful stretch of beach and Star Clippers has a daily cocktail hour with generous snacks and canapes

Activities: The public areas of the ship offer more variety on a large yacht as well. You can expect amenities that could include at least two bars and even a standalone cigar lounge; a spa swimming pool beauty salon and full-fledged fitness center; a small theater; a casino; a library and internet/card room; and maybe even a small boutique selling clothing jewelry and sundries.

Ultra-Small Ships

Cruise lines: While previous ship size categories have been referred to as ""yachts"" the Ultra-Small Ship category covers larger vessels with capacities that range from 450 to 625 passengers and all of these lines are positioned squarely in the luxury cruise market.

There are three 450-passenger ships from Seabourn on this list -- Odyssey Quest and Sojourn -- and two 600-passenger ships Encore and Ovation. While Regent Seven Sea Cruises has several ships in its fleet only the smallest -- Seven Seas Navigator -- belongs in this category. Silversea's Silver Spirit Silver Muse Silver Moon and Silver Dawn are also ultra-small ships.

Vibe: This grouping consists of unique ""boutique"" cruise ships that all offer a high-end all-inclusive experience with more amenities than those offered on yachts. Yet these offerings retain a sense of intimacy without being so large that you never fully learn the deck plan.

Destination focus: Like all small-ship cruise companies those listed here offer itineraries around the globe with an emphasis on ""greatest hits"" destinations such as Barcelona Venice and Athens as well as more hard-to-reach or unusual ports of call like Croatia's Hvar or French Polynesia's Rangiroa. You'll also find longer voyages lasting 10 to 14 nights as well as ""grand voyages"" that can keep you traveling for a month or longer.

Ship amenities: There's more choice of restaurants on ultra-small ships when compared to the yachts with main dining rooms buffet venues and specialty restaurants. For example all Seabourn ships are outfitted with The Grill by Thomas Keller -- the first and only American-born chef to hold multiple three-star Michelin ratings -- in addition to the main dining room casual venue pool grill and room service. Its larger ships also have a sushi restaurant. Silversea's latest ships are showcasing the all-new S.A.L.T. Kitchen (standing for sea and land taste) serving food and wine reflecting the destinations being visited.

All the ships in this range have open bars serving complimentary wines and spirits and you'll have a choice of places to imbibe; for example Seabourn's ships in this category have three lounges plus a pool bar.

Activities: Extra onboard pastimes -- such as mini-golf and shuffleboard -- are also the norm on ultra-small ships. Spa and fitness centers are expanded on ultra-small ships and the sun decks are downright impressive with larger pools and several hot tubs. Some even have on-deck jogging tracks.

Daytime activities are plentiful with more visiting lecturers and trivia as well as additional entertainment in the evenings from shows in the theater to ballroom dancing in the lounge. Most of Seabourn's ships also have waters sports marinas.

Small Ships

Cruise lines: While the largest ""small ships"" on our list will never be in the league of behemoths like Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas they do cater to anywhere from 650 to 1300 passengers.

In this category we welcome the 930-passenger sister ships from Viking Ocean Cruises' ever-growing fleet which is on course to reach 16 vessels by 2027. All of Oceania's ships -- Insignia Nautica Regatta Sirena Riviera and Marina -- fall into this grouping as do Azamara's ships (Journey Quest Pursuit and the recently acquired and yet to be renamed Pacific Princess). Crystal's two traditional cruise ships -- Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony -- are small ships and most of Regent's Seven Seas fleet -- Seven Seas Explorer Voyager and Mariner -- are in this category.

Vibe: You can expect a high level of service throughout these vessels but the largest ships in this category will feel like scaled-down cruise ships rather than yachts with lots of activity choices. As the passenger count ticks up on these ""larger"" small ships you might encounter a few downsides. The hot tubs get more traffic so it's not so easy to get one to yourself. And it can be marginally more difficult to get to know fellow passengers; it's impossible to meet every single passenger on a ship with a capacity around 1000 people.

Destination focus: These ships all tend to offer a plethora of itineraries that are longer in duration than seven nights. In the spirit of destination immersion cruises include one or more overnights in popular ports and stay later than normal in other ports so cruisers can see more on land and maybe even sample some of the destination's nightlife. These ships also visit a mix of popular and more unusual cruise ports than the larger mass-market ships do. The off-the-beaten-path spots often end up being the highlight of a voyage.

Ship amenities: Each of these ships offers beautifully appointed cabins and suites some of which offer access to a concierge or personal butler service. High-end suites might come with additional perks like ensuite afternoon tea or an invitation to dine with the officers. The top suites are also incredibly spacious such as the 2917-square-foot Regent Suite on Seven Seas Explorer.

You'll also find a large variety of dining options on most of these ships. Regent's largest ship has seven restaurants; Oceania's largest have eight. Crystal teams up with celebrity chef Nobu Matsuhisa for a popular Japanese-fusion restaurant while Oceania's menus are created in collaboration with famed chef Jacques Pepin. You'll definitely want to make reservations for specialty dining on all these ships since you'll be competing for the best tables and dining times with hundreds of other travelers.

Activities: You'll benefit from the larger size of the ships by way of larger spas and pool decks full-size theaters for staging Broadway-style revue shows multiple performers and evening entertainment options throughout the ship more game options in the casino and lots of enrichment options some with dedicated facilities.

For foodies some of these ships have high-tech demo kitchens for onboard classes. Oceania Marina and Riviera have the impressive Culinary Center that includes individual cooking stations for classes that will teach you everything from how to cook the perfect tomato sauce to how to design a meal around a series of tapas. Regent's Seven Seas Explorer has a similar venue while Viking Ocean Cruises' ships all feature the Kitchen Table which is part demo kitchen part dining venue.

Crystal's ships have dedicated facilities for computer classes and bridge play. Viking Orion and Viking Jupiter even have planetariums.

When a Small Ship Isn't the Best Choice

We've outlined the myriad ways in which small yachts and ships can offer amazing cruise vacations. However small isn't always the right option. Families looking for dedicated kids clubs character meet-and-greets and water parks and other amenities will be better off booking a high-end suite aboard a mass-market line that caters to all ages.

Some of the mega-ships also have pretty spectacular VIP suites that include access to private sun decks/pools lounges and restaurants. The ""wow"" factor on ships like that can be compelling. And finally mass-market lines definitely offer more itineraries that embark from easy-to-reach ports in the United States and beyond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWNyaXRpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY29tcGFyZS10aGUtMTctYmVzdC1zbWFsbC1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcC1saW5lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Compare the 17 Best Small Cruise Ship Lines,"Best for Expedition Cruises

1. Lindblad Expeditions

National Geographic Explorer

Lindblad Expeditions allied with National Geographic and Natural Habitat Adventures offers soft-adventure cruises on a fleet of 10 capable vessels (as well as several charters like the Sea Cloud masted sailing ship and Lord of the Glens vessel that sails around the coast and islands of Scotland) that carry from 48 to 148 passengers. Serving more as base camps for exploring the world's waters the line's ships cruise to all seven continents including the Galapagos South Pacific Antarctica and the Arctic.

Topflight naturalists historians undersea specialists and expedition leaders accompany each trip; many itineraries also have National Geographic photographers or at least a Lindblad-National Geographic-certified photo instructor. Besides kayaks and Zodiacs for landings ships are equipped with scientific tools like hydrophones (to listen in on marine mammals) underwater cameras and video microscopes.

The ships are comfortable with some great touches like the local organic foods used in meals and LEXspa treatment rooms for some well-deserved relaxation. (Endeavour even has a floating platform with a massage table for open-air treatments.)

2. Hurtigruten

Roald Amundsen (Photo: Hurtigruten)

Norwegian-based cruise line Hurtigruten plies the poles with 16 ships of varying sizes. The fleet's latest vessels -- the 530-passenger MS Fridtjof Nansen and MS Roald Amundsen -- are eco-friendly hybrid propulsion ships that reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 20 percent. The ships feature suites and cabins with balconies as well as ocean-view cabins. The largest Expedition Suites even have private outdoor hot tubs.

Don't let the trappings fool you though -- these cruises (indeed all Hurtigruten sailings) are all about nature. Vessels are equipped with small landing craft that take passengers to incredible locations. Passengers are an international mix and the ships -- which operate in English and Norwegian -- add other languages such as German or French if needed.

3. Silversea

Silver Galapagos

Silversea's four-vessel expedition fleet (Silver Origin Silver Cloud Silver Explorer and Silver Wind) upholds the line's luxurious all-inclusive image. All passengers -- on ships accommodating 100 to 274 -- enjoy spacious suites complete with butler service and high-end touches (Prastesi linens and amenities from Ferragamo Bulgari or SebaMed).

Expedition cruising with Silversea means you'll visit a good mix of mainstream and less-crowded destinations (Galapagos Polynesia Micronesia and more) throughout the world's seven continents. Itineraries include complimentary shore excursions such as Zodiac tours nature hikes with certified guides snorkelling and kayaking.

But what really sets Silversea expeditions apart is its level of access to experts like Dr. Birute Mary Galdikas the ""Jane Goodall of orangutans"" mountaineer and explorer Haraldur Orn Olfasson and Dr. Chadden Hunter a producer and director who has worked on natural history series including BBC's ""Frozen Planet"".

4. Quark Expeditions

50 Years of Victory

Whether you want penguins or polar bears Quark Expeditions which specializes in Arctic and Antarctic journeys is a great choice. The line's newest ship Ultramarine has a pair of onboard helicopters and all six ships in the fleet include kayaking cross-country skiing and mountaineering equipment (not to mention the ever-present Zodiacs). The line's 128-passenger expedition vessel 50 Years of Victory is one of the world's most powerful icebreakers and has nuclear-powered capabilities to go through nearly 10 feet of ice to make the voyage to the North Pole.

Quark's Antarctica trips often go longer and farther south with more varied itineraries than other lines. Days at sea are full of lectures and presentations from scientific experts and on some vessels photographers. Solo travelers can avoid a single supplement by opting for the Request-Share program where they will be matched with a same gender passenger to share a cabin.

5. Scenic

Scenic Eclipse (Photo: Scenic)

Australian river cruise and tour company Scenic made its ocean cruising debut with the 228-passenger Scenic Eclipse offering all-inclusive itineraries to destinations including Antarctica the Arctic South America and the Baltic. The ship combines all the trappings of luxury with the thrill of expedition sailing. Standout features include two onboard helicopters and a submarine Scenic Neptune which can carry six passengers and dive to a depth of nearly 1000 feet.

Onboard facilities include 10 dining experiences including a Champagne bar and private dining room for just eight people the Senses Spa and suites with private hot tubs. Water sports include an inflatable trampoline paddle-boards and kayaks and the ship has Zodiacs for wildlife spotting and shore excursions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyaWJiZWFuLmxvb3BuZXdzLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L3VzLWdyb3VwLWNvbmRlbW5zLWZvcmNlZC10ZXJtaW5hdGlvbi1ndXlhbmEtdGFpd2FuLWFncmVlbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US group condemns 'forced' termination of Guyana-Taiwan agreement | Loop Caribbean News,"The Brooklyn New York-based Caribbean Guyana Institute for Democracy (CGID) has strongly condemned what it describes as the “forced” termination of the agreement between Taiwan and Guyana to establish a Taiwan Office in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member state blaming the termination at the insistence of the US Ambassador to the country Sarah-Ann Lynch.

“The agreement was announced by the US Ambassador and not the Government of Guyana” said CGID Director of Communications lawyer Richard Millington in a statement.

He said “it is an embarrassment to the Guyanese people” that the Guyanese Government “continues to allow the US Ambassador Sarah-Ann Lynch – to dictate Guyana’s foreign policy.

“Worst announcements of new foreign policy decisions are also made by the US Embassy while the Government of Guyana remains silent – an act of gross disrespect to our nation” Millington claimed.

“The PPP (People’s Progressive Party) administration has surrendered Guyana’s sovereignty to Ambassador Lynch who continues to operate as if Guyana is her ‘cotton picking plantation’ and Guyanese are in servitude to her as slave master” he added.

Millington said that the US Embassy in Guyana made a statement on February 4 2021 announcing that the PPP Government has agreed to establish a Taiwan Office in Guyana stating that it was “incredibly stunning.”

“This reckless policy will severely damage Guyana’s relation with China” Millington warned.

The Government of Guyana announced on Thursday the termination of an agreement with Taiwan to establish an investment office in Guyana.

The announcement was made less than a day after Taiwan said that it had an investment office in Georgetown and this led to questions surrounding Guyana’s commitment to the One China Policy and its diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China.

In a statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said the decision to terminate the agreement was as a consequence of “miscommunication”.

“The Government of Guyana has noted various media releases on the matter of a Taiwan office in Guyana” the statement said. “The Government of Guyana wishes to clarify that it continues to adhere to the One China Policy and its diplomatic relations remain intact with the People’s Republic of China.

“The Government has not established any diplomatic ties or relations with Taiwan and as a result of the miscommunication of the agreement signed this agreement has since been terminated” added the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

On Wednesday the United States Embassy in Georgetown announced the establishment of a Taiwan office in Guyana and welcomed the move as Washington has long expressed growing concern about China’s deepening influence in the Caribbean and Latin America.

While there had been no formal announcement by the foreign ministry in Georgetown Taiwan said it signed the agreement on January 11 and started operations on January 15.

Historically Guyana has supported China and the “One China” policy – which does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state.

But on Friday Taiwan squarely blamed China’s interference in preventing the establishment of a trade office with Guyana stating that China had put enormous pressure on Guyana to rescind the agreement.

“Our government expresses deep regret toward this” said the Taiwan Foreign Ministry in a statement.

“China’s bullying and efforts to isolate Taiwan and shrink its international space only emphasize more clearly its evil nature and drive the people of the two sides further apart” it added.

Amid the confusion Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali maintained: “We very highly value our relations with China and will maintain that policy 100 percent.”",,,,,,

A Total of 21 CPUs Are Expected To Launch Under Intel's Next-Gen Arrow Lake-S ""Core Ultra 200"" Desktop CPU Portfolio

Intel's Arrow Lake-S ""Core Ultra 200"" Desktop CPU family is fast approaching its launch. The lineup is expected to get a formal unveil at Computex 2024 and we should expect a launch sometime by the middle of 2H (2024). So far we have learned details about a few SKUs including the Unlocked ""K"" family which will include the Core Ultra 9 285K Core Ultra 7 265K and the Core Ultra 5 245K. It was also reported yesterday that the lineup is unlikely to include any Core Ultra 3 variant the successor to the Core i3 series.

Now new information has been revealed which suggests that the company plans on launching a total of 21 SKUs in its Arrow Lake-S ""Core Ultra 200"" series. In addition to the three ""K"" series chips the lineup will include 5 Non-K chips rated at the 65W (PL1) TDP and a total of 13 chips featuring a TDP of 35W (PL1). These SKUs are expected to launch slightly later than the ""K"" series 125W (PL1) parts.

On the other hand what we know about the Intel Core Ultra 2 series of Arrow Lake-S product plans is that there will be three products of the 125W K series processors covering Intel Core Ultra 9 Core Ultra 7 and Core Ultra 5 of which Intel Core Ultra 9 will be processors in 24C/24T (8 + 16) configurations followed by 20C / 20T (8 + 12) and 14C / 14T (6 + 8) configurations. As for the non-K series that is the 65W part of the processor planning in principle it is the same as the K series except that a 10C / 10T (6 + 4) configuration processor will be provided in the Intel Core Ultra 5 part. Already known information Intel Core Ultra 2 will have a total of 8 Arrow Lake-S generation processors in 125W and 65W. As for the 35W products there will be 13 processors; Arrow Lake-S only provides Intel Core Ultra 9 Core Ultra 7 and Core Ultra 5 series processors. Benchlife

Intel is expected to utilize two main dies for its Arrow Lake-S ""Core Ultra 200"" chips. One of these will be the higher-end H0 die with 8 P-Cores and 16 E-Cores while the other will be a more toned down 6 P-Core and 8 E-Core configuration known as C0. All dies will feature Lion Cove as the P-Core architecture and Skymont as the E-Core architecture. These chips will be compatible with the LGA 1851 socket. Following is what we know about Arrow Lake-S Desktop CPUs so far:

LGA 1851 Socket Longevity Planned Uptill 2026

DDR5 Only Compatibility No DDR4 Support

Kicks off With 800-Series Motherboards

Support For Up To DDR5-6400 Memory (Native JEDEC)

Increased PCIe Gen 5.0 Lanes Through CPU & PCH

Launching In 2H 2024

As for the platform itself we will first see the launch of the high-end 800-series boards such as the Z890 products which are expected to feature native Thunderbolt 4 capability. Intel will expand its 800-series portfolio with H870 and B860 options with the 65W and 35W SKUs. Only the unlocked ""K"" SKUs will be able to support DDR5-6400 (native) memory while the Non-K chips are expected to feature support for up to DDR5-5600 (native) speeds. Expect more information in the coming days.

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZG9uZXNpYS1wcm9wb3Nlcy1jdXR0aW5nLXBheW1lbnRzLWtvcmVhLTAyMTczODg2OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indonesia proposes cutting payments for S.Korea fighter jet project Yonhap reports,"FILE PHOTO: A full-scale mockup of South Korea’s KF-X fighter jet is displayed at the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition in Seongnam

SEOUL (Reuters) - Indonesia has proposed to cut its share of payments for a joint fighter jet development project with South Korea to about one-third of the originally agreed amount South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Monday.

Indonesia recently suggested to the South Korean government that it would pay about 600 billion won ($442.47 million) for the KF-21 joint fighter jet project Yonhap reported citing multiple unnamed government sources.

The original amount due for Indonesia's share of the joint fighter project was set to be at about 1.6 trillion won by June 2026 the report said.

""In order to successfully complete the development of the KF-21 system the governments of both South Korea and Indonesia are conducting final negotiations to resolve the current cost sharing issues"" South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration said in a statement to Reuters.

Indonesia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The KF-21 fighter jet developed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) in a project partially backed by Indonesia is designed to be a cheaper less stealthy alternative to the U.S.-built F-35 on which South Korea relies.

Indonesia said it would receive fewer technology transfers from South Korea as part of its move to cut its financial contribution Yonhap reported.

South Korea and Indonesia resolved in 2022 a dispute over funding for the joint fighter jet project worth more than 8 trillion won after Indonesia had halted payment of its 20% share of the development costs.

The Indonesian government's latest proposal comes after South Korea police raided KAI's head office in March in connection with two Indonesian nationals accused of leaking technology related to the KF-21 fighter jet project.

In Netflix's live production of the 'Greatest Roast of All Time' Ross delivered a line that referenced when Brady introduced himself to Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

'Tom became a Patriot moved up to New England and on the first day of training camp that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said I'm the greatest decision your organization has ever made... would you like a massage' Ross joked.

It drew laughs from the room but Brady appeared unimpressed by the joke and went up to Ross in the middle of his set.

'Don't say that s**t again' Brady said with a smile while his hand poorly covered up the microphone.

Tom Brady interrupted Jeff Ross's roasting set after he took exception to a joke he said

The joke involved a fake scenario where Brady asked Kraft if he wanted a massage

That's a reference to when Kraft was charged with soliciting a prostitute back in 2019

“Don’t say that shit again”

That joke of course was a reference to when Kraft was one of 25 people facing a misdemeanor charge for soliciting prostitution at a Florida day spa back in February 2019.

Kraft pled not guilty. Later the charges were dropped in September of 2019 after a Florida appeals court ruled his constitutional rights were violated.

That's because Kraft's attorneys revealed hidden cameras were installed at the spa before Kraft visited under the guise of a response to a bomb threat.

'I am truly sorry' Kraft said in a March 2019 statement about the case. 'I know I have hurt and disappointed my family my close friends my co-workers our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.

'Throughout my life I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being.

'…As I move forward I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words but by my actions. And through those actions I hope to regain your confidence and respect.'

Social media reaction seemed to be in favor of Ross with some saying that the incident felt like it would boil over into a sequel of when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars.

Social media seemed to find the joke funny but thought it could turn into a Will Smith moment

Ross was not the only person who roasted Brady. Several comedians - including Kevin Hart Nikki Glaser and Bert Kreischer - were on the dais.

So were a number of Brady's former teammates - such as Drew Bledsoe Randy Moss Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman.

Edelman also made a joke at Kraft's expense. He said 'I think the next time I see you all will be at Kraft's funeral.' When Kraft got the mic later he retorted 'Julien I'm not inviting you to my funeral.'

Among the many topics for jokes were Brady's divorce from Gisele Bundchen the Patriots' multiple cheating scandals his sexuality and his looks.

Kim Kardashian who was once rumored to be dating Brady gave a toast at the roast.

'I know there were some rumors of Tom and I dating and I'd never say if we did or not I'd just release the tape' she opened poking fun at her leaked sex tape with Ray J.

'But I do know it would never work out' she went on. 'An ex-athlete high cheek bones silky hair... you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you'd want to undress me just to try on my clothes.'

Later in the evening Bill Belichick made a surprise appearance after rumors suggested he wouldn't show up.

'I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10 part Apple doc' Belichick joked in reference to the Apple documentary series 'The Dynasty'.

After he arrived Julian Edelman went into his set. 'Remember when you used to yell at us ""Look a**holes the f**king kids down at Foxborough High can make that f**king play. I've been waiting for this for so long: ""Look a**hole [Belichick] Foxborough High's the only job offer you f**kin' had.'

At the end of Rob Gronkowski's set the former Patriots tight end joked that he never took a drink with Brady and Belichick - before the three all took a shot of alcohol together.

Then Gronkowski took his shot glass and spiked it on the stage - sending glass shards all over the place."

The result was VAMS a vaccine administration management system built by the firm Deloitte which has been spurned by most states and become an object of scorn. And now an immunization expert who had offered the government her own mass vaccination tracker at a lower price than Deloitte’s is accusing the company and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of stealing her intellectual property.

The expert Tiffany Tate the executive director of the Maryland Partnership for Prevention made the allegation in a cease-and-desist letter obtained by The New York Times and later confirmed its authenticity in an interview with her lawyer on Friday. Ms. Tate who has spent two decades running immunization clinics in underserved communities said she previewed her platform in May for Deloitte officials who were identified by the C.D.C. as consultants.

The C.D.C. expressed interest in buying it she said. But the centers instead asked Deloitte without a competitive bidding process to build its own system dismissing warnings from state and local health officials and immunization managers that it was unwise to roll out an untested platform in the middle of a crisis.",,,,,,,,,

How will the stock do going forward? Varun Anand of Starlight Capital says while BCE is solid investors might want to look beyond the telecom providers to an infrastructure play like cell towers.

“We do like Telus Rogers and BCE” said Anand portfolio manager at Starlight Capital who spoke to BNN Bloomberg on Thursday. “But our preferred way to play the cellular tower space is through the tower companies.”

“Remember with Bell Rogers and Telus they own the network and they also have the towers but then they also have very price competitive consumer businesses like the cellphone plans home internet and whatnot” Anand said.

BCE reported a solid fourth quarter on Thursday to wrap up what it called an overall good year considering the challenges posed by COVID-19. The company saw revenues fall by 2.8 per cent year-over-year to $6.102 billion for the Q4 2020 while adjusted EBITDA dropped by 3.2 per cent to $2.404 billion. Earnings came in at $0.98 per share compared to $0.74 per share a year earlier while analysts had called for earnings of $0.74 per share on a topline of $6.16 billion.

For the year BCE’s revenue dropped 3.8 per cent to $22.883 billion and adjusted EBITDA fell 4.0 per cent to $9.607 billion.

“In every successive quarter since COVID-19 began Bell has delivered sequential quarterly improvement in our operating results underscoring the stability and resiliency of our company and the strength of our financial position” said CFO Glen LeBlanc in a press release.

Management spoke of the company’s resilience in the face of social and economic impacts of the pandemic but the focus in its commentary was on the future specifically its plans to add another $1-1.2 billion in capital spending over the next two years. BCE aims to step up its fibre-optic and fixed wireless network buildout and double its 5G wireless capacity during 2021 saying that shareholder value will be enhanced through the infrastructure layout.

“Bell plans to increase the number of new locations covered with fibre and WHI by as many as 900000 in 2021 – bringing the combined footprint to up to 6.9 million homes and businesses by the end of the year – while doubling the population coverage of Canada’s fastest 5G network” the company said in the Q4 press release.

“Funded by proceeds from the sale of Bell data centres in 2020 the investment acceleration is in addition to Bell’s typical capital expenditures over the last decade of approximately $4 billion a year (growing to $4.2 billion in 2020 due to added investment in network capacity and digital platforms in response to unprecedented usage demand during the COVID crisis)” BCE said.

The company even provided guidance for the year ahead a big of a rarity these days as companies grapple with a host of pandemic-related unknowns. BCE expects both revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow by between two and five per cent in 2021.

“Overall revenue is expected to reflect a gradual economic recovery in 2021 combined with subscriber revenue growth and strategic pricing on advertising sales. However revenue performance is expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on many sectors of the economy” the company said.

BCE’s share price has been flat to trending downward since last spring finishing 2020 down 9.5 per cent and so far trading up two per cent for 2021. By comparison Telus (Telus Stock Quote Chart News Analysts Financials TSX:T) ended the year at even while Rogers Communications (Rogers Communications Stock Quote Chart News Analysts Financials TSX:RCI.B) dropped almost eight per cent.

Anand says he leans towards cell tower holding companies some of whom had a mildly better year than the Canadian telcos. Of the bigger players in the US Crown Castle ended 2020 up 12 per cent American Tower lost three per cent and SBA Communications finished up 17 per cent. Not yet established in Canada where the big telco companies own their own towers these REITs (real estate investment trusts) in the US have done well over the past decade.

“We’d rather play that through tower companies that just own the towers and collect the contracted cash flows from the carriers because there’s more leverage in that business and it’s more stable and as a result you don’t have as much price competition” Anand said.

“So a company like American Tower or SBA Communications would be our preferred play rather than a telco incumbent like BCE” Anand said.

Of the cell tower REITs Jim Cramer of CNBC’s Mad Money recently picked Crown Castle as his preferred choice saying that while the company has spent billions in building out its 5G network in densely populated areas these investments “have yet to pay off in a 4G world.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Elon who last month passed up Jeff Bezos to become the richest man in the world cryptically captioned the post: 'The Second Last Kingdom.'

It is unknown whether he was making a joking reference to The Last Kingdom a BBC show based on the historical fiction novel of the same name by Bernard Cornwell.

Elon has shared some of his entertainment tastes before on Twitter including his love of the 2015 Bollywood historical romance Bajirao Mastani.

When Grimes first gave birth to his baby last May it was initially announced that they had named their child X Æ A-12.

However they then discovered that the California constitution only allows legal names to contain characters from the English alphabet.

As a result they eventually changed the name to X Æ A-XII replacing the Hindu-Arabic numerals '12' with Roman numerals signifying the same number.

Elon - who shares five sons with his first wife Justine Wilson and was married twice to his second wife Talulah Riley - has explained how to pronounce X Æ A-XII.

Irish actor Barry Keoghan has shared a cosy snap with a beautiful blonde named Alyson - and it looks like she could be his new girlfriend.

The Love/Hate star took to Instagram to post a photo of himself with his arm around her as they pose in front of a bridge.

And he made it clear that he has strong feelings for her tagging her with a love heart emoji beside her name.

Barry 28 was previously dating and living with make-up artist Shona Guerin from Kerry.

The pair unfollowed each other on social media during the summer last year sparking rumours their relationship was over.

Barry spoke to Lucy Kennedy about his appreciation for Shona in the episode of Living with Lucy she filmed at his home in Los Angeles in 2019.

""I’d be lost without her I’m telling you that. I wouldn't be the man I am now without her"" he said.

""With this game rejection comes as well and that can be hard. Flying away almost getting a part and then losing it. It’s draining.

""I’d be down on myself and she’d pick me right up and remind me what I’m doing. She’s made me a man. She’s the girl I want to be with for the rest of my life.

""Any of the lads I work with Colin [Farrell] Cillian [Murphy] they're always like 'Don't mess this up. They see how important she is.""

Shona previously told Evoke.ie about how she and Barry met in her home town of Killarney.

“We met on Good Friday in a pub in Kerry when we shouldn’t have been in a pub.

“I was working in the pub at the time and he was actually there with another girl which is a debate we have quite a lot because I wasn’t aware and then I was aware and it was too late. But yeah he just wouldn’t take no for an answer [when he asked Shona out] and now I’m still stuck with him!”"

The historic photographs selected for the show which opened at 1200 N. Broadway on Feb. 2 trace the outlines of the land and the people who have moved through it with stunning intimacy and scale.

But the show is also a project that spans multiple History Colorado museums and it plans to stick around for quite a while.

“The Arkansas River in Colorado (or Rio Nepesta) once carved the border between the United States and Mexico” History Colorado officials wrote. “Our El Pueblo History Museum marks the site of the original El Pueblo established in 1842 along the border.”

The exhibition looks at the big moves — populations and borders — and small ones such as the daily lives of the indigenous Mexican and American people who have called the region home. The exhibition includes a virtual speaker series featuring food writer Gustavo Arellano (Feb. 11) and others starting this month and scheduled to continue at least through April.

The exhibition will be presented in English and Spanish organizers said and is included with museum general admission.

He was 95.

Mr. McNear started with Southern Pacific as a rodman in the Sacramento division in 1948. He climbed through the ranks to the top post staying with the company through the acquisition by Rio Grande Industries becoming vice chairman and working in El Paso Texas. He retired in 1990.

In the 1980s as chief executive of Southern Pacific Mr. McNear worked with Marin County Supervisor Robert Roumiguiere Golden Gate Bridge district manager Carney Campion and U.S. Rep. Doug Bosco for the public acquisition of the mostly dormant tracks and plans to bring back trains. The tracks would become part of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit network.

Mr. McNear was born in Petaluma on July 20 1925 to Ezekial Denman and Mary Kittredge McNear. He is the grandson of George P. McNear and the great grandson of John A. McNear who in 1968 purchased land at Point San Pedro in San Rafael. Today the land includes the Glenwood and Peacock Gap neighborhoods McNears Beach county park China Camp State Park Miwok Meadows and Back Ranch. The McNear family has been known in Sonoma and Marin counties for businesses in the food and grain banking and brickyard industries.

After graduating from Tamalpais Academy in San Rafael in 1942 Mr. McNear attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His schooling was interrupted when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1944 and served as radio technician in the Pacific at the end of World War II.

He returned to MIT and graduated in 1948 with a degree in civil engineering. He began his career at Southern Pacific the same year. Two years later he attained a master’s degree in business administration from Stanford University.

He married Susan Anderson in 1962. They lived in San Francisco and then Kentfield where they raised their three sons Denman Jr. Stephen and George.

The couple divorced and Mr. McNear married Barbara Gaillard an old friend and the widow of a college fraternity brother. They split time between Kentfield and Maryland where Gaillard had a home. She died in 2012 and he remained in Maryland.

Mr. McNear was longtime supporter organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America the California Chamber of Commerce the Yosemite Conservancy and others.

“I respect and value our family’s long connection to Marin and Sonoma” his son George said. “As a father he was very caring dedicated and working as much as he did he did a tremendous job being there for all of our life events. He was a warm-hearted person.”

Jay McNab Mr. McNear’s nephew described Mr. McNear as a “consummate railroad man.”

“He knew the industry backwards and forwards” he said. “But above all he was a family man.”

Mr. McNear died on Jan. 5. In addition to his children and first wife Mr. McNear is survived by his grandchildren Sam and Rachel McNear and a large extended family.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZXdib3VuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3ZvLWJyYXppbC1icmV3aW5nLWNvbXBhbnktcmVsZWFzZXMtZ3JhcGVmcnVpdC1kb3VibGUtaXBhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Novo Brazil Brewing Company Releases Grapefruit Double IPA,"SAN DIEGO – Novo Brazil Brewing Company is bringing back a limited-release fan favorite just in time to end your dry January the right way!

But years before Naval pilot and former Southwest Airlines Captain Tammie Jo Shults blazed a trail for women like Captain Kociuba.

Her struggle to fight her way through the ranks of Naval Aviation and becoming a fighter pilot then transitioning into a commercial airline pilot is documented in her new book “Nerves of Steel.”

Those nerves were put to the test on Southwest Flight 1380.

“Is your airplane physically on fire” the air traffic controller said.

“No it’s not on fire but part of it is missing” Captain Shults said.

Captain Shults made headlines worldwide when she safely landed Flight 1380 with 149 people on board after the left engine blew out.





“We had an engine seizure at least and with the rapid depressurization it was pretty obvious there was an explosion” Captain Shults told CBS News.

The explosion sent shrapnel through one of the plane’s windows causing the cabin to lose pressure.

“I thought I was cataloging the last moments of my existence” Marty Martinez a passenger on Flight 1380 told CBS News. “It felt like it was free falling.”

Passenger Jennifer Riorden was killed when she was partially sucked out of the broken window.

Unaware of the chaos in the cabin Captain Shults went into emergency mode and safely landed the plane in Philadelphia. One passenger said she had nerves of steel.

On a recent trip to Austin Shults talked to CBS Austin about one of her biggest take-aways from that day disciplined habits.

“How habits on a good day do become our instinct on a bad day” Shults said. “And we have this amazing gift of choice of what we decide to take on as a habit and groom to become an instinct.”

Shults says the airline industry has taken a big hit during the pandemic.

“When you’re losing $20-million dollars a day one company is losing that much a day you can see eventually there will be jobs impacted even by the best companies unless we have some change in our economy” Shults said.

But she says the industry will get through this turbulence.

“I definitely think they’re going to bounce back” Shults said.

And despite past safety concerns with the Boeing 737 Max American Airlines has started flying them again. Shults says she believes it’s a safe aircraft.

“Ohh I would have flown it before they remodeled it” Shults said. “It was an incredible aircraft. And its predecessor the one I flew on April 17th kind of proved how sturdy and redundant Boeing makes their aircraft and its systems. So I do think the 737 every copy they make of it have been safe and will be even safer.”

She says like many of us she’s had some down days during this pandemic. But Shults says she puts her hope in her faith to get through it just like she did on April 17th 2018 on Flight 1380.

“It’s foundational” Shults said. “Just as foundational as a launchpad to a rocket. Or a runway to an airplane or a branch for a bird. We all launch from something. Having a solid foundation you have the ability to have a direction when you launch.”

Now Shults is flying into retirement but she’s still busy with community service flying for Angel Flight and encouraging young pilots to take to the skies. And she hopes her story helps launch more women into the world of aviation and flying fighter jets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYWNpb25hbGRpYS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMS8wMi9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWxyZWFkeS1kYXRlLXRvLXJlc3VtZS1mbGlnaHRzLXdpdGgtNzM3LW1heC5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9hdmlhY2lvbmFsZGlhLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIxLzAyL3NvdXRod2VzdC1hbHJlYWR5LWRhdGUtdG8tcmVzdW1lLWZsaWdodHMtd2l0aC03MzctbWF4Lmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest already date to resume flights with 737 MAX.,"Southwest Airlines announced this weekend that it will resume flights with the Boeing 737 MAX beginning March 11 starting with a flight scheduled to take off at 7 a.m. from Denver to Chicago/Midway.

See also: Southwest Airlines posts its first annual loss since 1972.

The Dallas-based carrier has a total of 32 flights scheduled with the MAX for that day according to Cirium data.

Southwest’s MAX deployment plan is much broader than that of other airlines. American Airlines was the first U.S. carrier to resume flights with the aircraft on Dec. 29 with daily service between Miami and New York/LaGuardia. Since then American has expanded its schedule with the MAX to cover an average of 45 daily flights.

See also: When will Boeing make first deliveries of the 737-7 and 737-10?

In addition to American and Southwest Alaska Airlines and United have the 737 MAX in their fleets. On Thursday February 11 United will resume MAX operations flying 24 flights nationwide.

For its part Alaska just took delivery of its first 737 MAX and the airline’s first MAX is scheduled to enter service on March 1 with daily round-trip flights between Seattle – San Diego and Seattle – Los Angeles. The airline is expected to take delivery of its second 737 MAX 9 by the end of March.

For Boeing Southwest’s decision is good news. Unless plans change all U.S. airlines will have the MAX back in the air on March 11. All eyes will then turn to other major markets such as China which has yet to recertify the aircraft.

(NYSE:SWK) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (NYSE:SWK) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2 2024

Stanley Black & Decker Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.56 expectations were $0.55. Stanley Black & Decker Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.95%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics."

Let's be honest: If you're a true coffee snob then chances are you're not pulling up to either of these drive-thrus anytime soon. We're willing to bet you keep your coffee local or maybe even make your own cold brew at home – any chance we can have a cup?

For the rest of us average amateur coffee-lovers who just need a caffeine fix to get by (or a snap of our Frappuccino to post on your Instagram story) there are plenty of fast casual options to grab a cup of joe.

Two of the most popular options in the U.S. are Starbucks – of course – and believe it or not McDonald's. The hamburger chain has grown in the decade since its introduction selling nearly 1 billion cups of coffee per year (via USA Today). That's nothing on Starbucks' 7 roughly billion cups (via CNBC) but it's substantial enough to make you wonder: Just how good is McCafé coffee after all?

The internet is quite divided on whether or not the taste of a McDonald's coffee outranks Starbucks. One Redditor said the fast food joint's coffee seemed watered down while others said it's at least better than the cheap stuff you'll find at a local gas station. A few even prefer it to Starbucks and said McDonald's offers ""an excellent brewed coffee"" that ""certainly kicks [Starbucks'] butt.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81NDA4OS1zdGFyYnVja3Mtc2Vlcy1zaG9ydGFnZXMtaW4tYmFrZWQtZm9vZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks sees shortages in baked foods | 2021-07-02,"SEATTLE — A record volume of customers visiting its stores has put some pressure on the supply chain at Starbucks but reports the Seattle-based company is running short on key supplies is not necessarily true said Kevin Johnson chief executive officer.

“No shortage of cups no shortage of coffee” Mr. Johnson told Jim Cramer during a June 24 appearance on CNBC’s “Mad Money.”

Mr. Johnson did acknowledge though that Starbucks is experiencing some challenges in its food offerings.

“Our supply chain in our breakfast sandwiches and some items in the bakery case they have had to ramp up staffing and so we’ve had some shortages in the bakery case that’s certainly true” he said. “If you look at what we’ve done over the last couple of months to really get us in a much better position. And you just think about it. When you turn this on so rapidly it really tests the elasticity of the supply chain and if there is one area that we’ve been focused on it’s our supply partners who assemble breakfast sandwiches some of the food items in our bakery case.”

Earlier in the interview Mr. Johnson said Starbucks is going through “trade area transformation” a process that includes the repositioning of approximately 600 stores in the United States.

“We’re well into that (transformation)” he said. “In many cases that means where we’ve got a store that maybe could be relocated to better serve the community of customers we’ve made those moves. That is creating more opportunity for us to serve customers it’s enabling us to elevate the customer experience. But that said the volume of customers coming into our stores is a record. So we are doing everything we can to ensure we’re serving those customers in timely fashion certainly drive-thru mobile order but now with our cafes open customers are in the stores and they’re loving it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRocmlsbGlzdC5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFyYnVja3MtdWJlci1lYXRzLXZhbGVudGluZXMtZGF5LTIwMjEtZGVhbHMtZGlzY291bnRz0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhyaWxsaXN0LmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL25ld3Mvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXViZXItZWF0cy12YWxlbnRpbmVzLWRheS0yMDIxLWRlYWxzLWRpc2NvdW50cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks & Uber Eats Are Offering Sweet Deals for Valentine's Day,"It wouldn't be Valentine's Day without receiving a little corporate love and this time it's a Starbucks and Uber Eats collaboration that'll give your wallet a rest.

The Starbucks at Cherry Lane Shopping Centre is yet another victim of the Seattle coffee company’s ‘restructuring.’

Starbucks closed its doors permanently on Feb. 1 despite being a bustling coffee house. The closure is another blow to Cherry Lane which has also seen Subway and EB Games close.

In January Starbucks announced its plan to close up to 300 coffee shops across Canada. They said they would complete closures by the end of March.

The Seattle-based coffeehouse chain announced the acceleration of its five-year “transformation strategy” last year as it responded to changes in consumer habits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most stand-alone Starbucks that didn’t accommodate a drive-thru like the one at Cherry Lane are the ones being eliminated.

The drive-thru at Main and Industrial and the drive-thru at Highway 97 and Riverside Drive are still open.

For now the Starbucks inside Safeways will remain open as is the case with Penticton’s Safeway.

Starbucks shut down its downtown Penticton location last year leaving an empty storefront in the 200 block of Main St.

But then Tickleberry’s took over the space and just opened up on Feb. 1 much to the delight of many eager to get ice cream from the locally famous shop.

Mostly tolls.,"ST. PETERSBURG — Driving through Pinellas County’s busy Gateway Area lately it’s nearly impossible to avoid detour signs bright orange cones and heavy machinery dotting the roadways.

Some of the county’s highest trafficked roads are undergoing reconstruction of a dramatic magnitude. The work stretches from the Bayside Bridge and St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport to the Howard Frankland Bridge and down toward St. Petersburg. It consumes many of the area’s most popular corridors including Interstate 275 U.S. 19 and 118th Avenue.

It’s all part of the state’s greater vision to add nearly 100 miles of toll lanes to the area’s interstates through the next decade and beyond. Pinellas County is the launching ground for the first wave of these projects meant to make room for the nearly 100000 people expected to move here in the next 25 years.

Construction on the first toll facility — the Gateway Express which will build two elevated toll roads — started in 2018. Now construction of a new Howard Frankland Bridge span is also underway which includes the removal of the 4th Street exit on southbound I-275 and other work along that span of highway.

The work surrounding the two projects which combined total nearly $1.5 billion continues to catch the eye of drivers — many of whom don’t understand the greater scheme to add tolls throughout the region.

Even those who know tolls are coming say it’s hard to make sense of the plans. At times it looks like they’re building a road to nowhere St. Petersburg resident Mary Charlotte said.

“It’s so confusing” Charlotte 33 said. “There just seems to be random pillars all over the place.”

Local Florida Department of Transportation Secretary David Gwynn said all of the work is part of a plan to help prepare Tampa Bay for the unprecedented growth it’s expected to see.

“When you’re looking at the amount of future traffic that’s predicted on our roads it’s just huge” Gwynn said. “We’re already behind. Trying to catch up is hard.

“When this is done we’re going to have a transportation infrastructure there that’s going to serve us well for many years.”

Construction of the Gateway Expressway gives Tampa Bay its first glimpse of Tampa Bay Next.

Formerly known as Tampa Bay Express the multi-billion-dollar program is the state’s vision for the region’s interstates. Originally all facets — including toll lanes on Interstates 275 75 and 4 and rebuilds of the West Shore interchange and Howard Frankland Bridge — were linked as one package. In order to get one job done local politicians had to approve all of it.

That changed in 2017 after public outcry caused the Florida Department of Transportation to scrap some of its plans. Tampa Bay Next was born. The reboot includes most of the same segments but allows some to move forward while others are still in contention.

The heart of that opposition was grounded in Hillsborough where citizen groups mounted a campaign against expanding the interstate especially with toll lanes. But similar pushback has not been found in Pinellas.

“I’ve been here for a little more than five years and heard almost no complaints about these being toll roads” said Whit Blanton executive director of the county’s transportation planning organization Forward Pinellas.

“I think people realize that we need to get a handle on moving traffic. If that’s the way we have to do it so be it.”

Both four-lane elevated roads under construction as part of the Gateway Expressway will be tolled. The cost is expected to be between 75 and 80 cents per trip said Richard Moss director of development for the local department of transportation office. The final rate will be set at a public hearing later this year.

When the work is done there will be about 30 new structures built in the area ranging from 200-foot long bridges to large flyovers connecting to the new elevated highways. But drivers shouldn’t plan on using the new roads until early 2023. So far about 60 percent of the work is done.

At the northern end of the project the new State Road 686A will connect the Bayside Bridge to just west of I-275. Further south the new State Road 689 will be constructed from U.S. 19 to west of I-275. It will generally be located in the median of existing 118th Avenue North and includes flyover bridges connecting to mainline US-19. It will be elevated over portions of 118th Avenue N as well as 49th 47th 34th and 28th streets north.

The new Howard Frankland Bridge will also have a toll option. In addition to the four general traffic lanes that exist now two lanes in each direction will be managed lanes which will require the driver to pay to use them.

Unlike the elevated toll roads the cost to use these lanes changes based on demand. The worse the traffic the higher the toll.

Transportation officials didn’t have an answer recently for how much the tolls would cost but previous estimates from the state said the toll would automatically fluctuate between 15 cents and $2 a mile as traffic gets better or worse. That means it could cost more than $10 to drive between 4th Street and the West Shore interchange on a busy day.

But Gwynn said the vision for the managed lanes could evolve over time and maybe not include the same dynamic toll pricing. The lanes would also be available to buses carpools and even self-driving vehicles whenever that technology arrives.

“Everyone should see a benefit” Gwynn said even with tolls in place. “What we found when we constructed managed toll lanes we also see improvement in general purpose lanes. That’s largely in part because we’re taking traffic out of those general purpose lanes.”

Overall Gwynn said all the construction that’s happening now should reduce travel times and make the roads safer. Several of the future projects include taking bends out of the roads and extending lanes which eliminates dangerous merging.

“I think the biggest benefit we’ll see is what this is going to do for highway safety” Gwynn said. “We have a lot of crashes related to merges and weaves.”

Pinellas County Commissioner Janet Long said she’s excited to see any changes that help people move around in a more timely manner. She said she particularly appreciates how these local projects are tied to a more regional vision.

“We’re moving the dial to build a system that we’ve never really focused on before that connects the region” Long said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zeXJhY3VzZS5jb20vY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8wMi9tYW4tb3JnYW5pemVzLWRyaXZlLXRvLWRlbGl2ZXItdmFsZW50aW5lcy1kYXktY2FyZHMtdG8tZXZlcnktY2VudHJhbC1ueS1udXJzaW5nLWhvbWUtcmVzaWRlbnQuaHRtbNIBngFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zeXJhY3VzZS5jb20vY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8wMi9tYW4tb3JnYW5pemVzLWRyaXZlLXRvLWRlbGl2ZXItdmFsZW50aW5lcy1kYXktY2FyZHMtdG8tZXZlcnktY2VudHJhbC1ueS1udXJzaW5nLWhvbWUtcmVzaWRlbnQuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man organizes drive to deliver Valentine’s Day cards to every Central NY nursing home resident,"If you live in a nursing home the last year has been lonely and sometimes depressing.

The coronavirus pandemic has locked down nursing homes with few visitors allowed and residents often stuck in their rooms.

It has cancelled holiday and other celebrations.

And the virus has killed at least 12743 nursing home residents in the state and made many other residents sick.

“It’s been a crappy year all around for us’' said Thomas Phillips 62 who is a resident of Grand Rehabilitation and Nursing home in Rome. “No holidays no celebrations no getting together no visitors. Masks and lockdowns.”

So Phillips decided to do something about it: He wants to send a Valentine’s Day card to every resident in a nursing home or skilled care facility in the region and beyond if possible.

Phillips joined with Ky Reardon - a person he connected with on social media - to get Valentine’s Day cards signed and delivered to the more than 11000 nursing home residents across the “315″ area code region.

The two dubbed it ‘”Operation Valentine” and soon had 22 nursing homes on board sending cards to nearly 3000 residents. Most are in Madison and Oneida counties but they have sent cards to North Carolina and Virginia. The list keeps growing as more want to participate Phillips said.

Phillips who has lived at The Grand for five years said he has serious heart problems and tries to connect with the outside world by writing Facebook posts about life in a nursing home.

An aide purchased 600 Valentine’s Day cards for Philips which he signed and then had someone deliver to drop boxes set up at two local coffee shops. Volunteers pick them up from the drop boxes and deliver them.

Another group of more than 125 volunteers who lived outside the nursing home have created their own homemade cards to send to nursing homes. Some of the cards are being dropped off and others are being mailed.

Phillips said the nursing homes participating have agreed to distribute the cards to residents.

“I just want to bring a smile to their faces and maybe they can hang in their windows and know someone cares’' he said. “We are all Cupids and we just want do do a nice thing for everyone who has had such a really tough year.”

If you want to help

Phillips doesn’t have a formal way to collect cards from the public to distribute so he suggests anyone who wants to help to send cards to area nursing homes with the words “Operation Valentine” on the envelope. Valentine’s Day is Feb. 14.

They said they never would have guessed the pandemic would make homes sales skyrocket.

But that's what sales did.

""We were all thinking 'Oh my god we're not going to be able to build any homes'"" said Moses Mostaghasi of MPM Homes Inc. ""And as people realized that they need to be at home stay at home lifestyles probably have changed. Mindsets have changed.""

""People are investing in their life and their future by purchasing homes more than ever. So the housing market has not slowed down. During the pandemic it's probably only picked up.""

Even with a three-month shut down nearly 1200 more homes were sold -- a total of 6985 -- in the Corpus Christi metropolitan statistical area in 2020 compared with 5809 homes in 2019.

The median price of homes also jumped by roughly 13 percent from $200000 in 2019 to $225000 in 2020.

That means the average family in Corpus Christi can't afford the average-priced home said Iain Vasey president/CEO of the Corpus Christi Regional Economic Development Corp. The median household income in Corpus Christi is $56333 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""Can we say $60000 a year buy the median house using traditional financing? And they can't"" Vasey said.

That's not all the tight market has caused. Builders can't keep up with the high demand for new houses. COVID-19 challenges are a big part of that.

Prices of materials have also drastically increased which factors into the increase in home prices along with the demand. Lumber costs have gone up 50 percent to 150 percent Mostaghasi said. Plumbing prices have increased roughly 20 percent and shingles by about 9 percent.

He also said it used to take builders about 10 days to get a window package order. Now it takes around 10 months.

""Where everybody gets their windows they went from like 5000 employees to 1000 employees because of the pandemic"" Mostaghasi said. ""The problem right now is the price of goods or materials.""

""And the labor force just being an unknown because from one day to the next you don't know who's got COVID (and) who's tracing it.""

The current market

Being a large developer has been an advantage for MPM Homes during the pandemic.

""We've got good suppliers. We've pre-planned meaning we've already given them insight on what we're anticipating so they can prepare for that"" Mostaghasi said.

Mostaghasi develops roughly 200 lots and builds 100 homes a year. In 2020 his company met the 100 home-build mark for the first time.

""We grew by 20 percent last year even with a two to three month void that we had with no homes being sold"" he said.

MPM Homes is developing roughly 3000 homes in the London area over a 10- to 15-year span. At least half of those houses will be priced at an average of $325000.

Jim Lee director Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi's South Texas Economic Development Center has been tracking the pandemic's impacts on the Coastal Bend economy.

""The housing market is the brightest if not the only bright spot in the COVID economy"" Lee said. ""While the market looks solid across the nation it is very fragile because falling income and job losses will sooner or later raise the foreclosure and bankruptcy rates.""

New home prices are currently increasing at a record pace above 15 percent Lee said. The pace of price rises during the final quarter of 2020 was the highest ever recorded even higher than the pace during the housing boom in the mid-2010s.

The current housing inventory has dipped to 2.3 months compared to historically 5 to 6 months which is considered a balanced market Lee said.

The housing shortage will only be amplified once Steel Dynamics Inc. finishes building a $1.9 billion steel mill near Sinton in late 2021 or early 2022. As employment growth of the plant's campus ramps up the CCREDC expects more than 100 homes a year could be acquired by the plant's employees.

""It's going to further drive up housing prices"" Vasey said. ""We need to see more houses being built total and more affordable houses being built. Which means we need to see houses being built between $150000 and $250000.""

The CCREDC also projects Corpus Christi needs 2000 to 4000 more residential units a year to come online. Of those at least 1500 should be houses.

""Things are afloat but prices keep going up"" said Navid Zarghoon owner of Devonshire Custom Homes. ""That's going to push out the affordability for new homes. As prices keep going up that affordability is going to get harder and harder to build.""

Low interest rates

One reason for the increase in sales during 2020 is the slide in mortgage interest rates. They are averaging 3.11 percent in 2020 compared with 3.94 percent in 2019 said Paige Silva research associate at the Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&M University in College Station.

Silva expects interest rates to increase slightly in 2021 due to the economy heating up.

""While we expect housing demand to remain strong in 2021 the lack of inventory will be a contributor to a deceleration in sales in 2021"" she said.

Demand expands housing shortage

Texas and Corpus Christi faced a very tight housing market due to limited new home construction even before last year Lee said. He expects the tight housing market trend to continue at least for a while.

Realtor Candy Crisman-Lopez's business has had more traffic than normal since Hurricane Harvey. And the housing industry has gotten even more active because of the pandemic.

""I know this kind of sounds cliche but it's been crazy busy nonstop"" she said.

Half of the residential sales at Crisman-Lopez's office The Crisman Group with Keller Williams Coastal Bend are new home construction.

""We have (homes) in framing and we're getting them under contract"" she said.

Crisman-Lopez doesn't foresee the market slowing down in 2021. The Coastal Bend is still in the five- to seven-year rebuild phase following the hurricane's wrath in 2017. That also contributes to the shortage of homes.

""There's never a crystal ball"" she said. ""We never know for sure what's going to come up. We can just go by things that we've known from history in the past.""

""I tell people all the time corpus is in its own little world.""

Local industry changing

John Tamez of Tamez Development is developing between 600 and 800 homes in the London area that would be priced between $225000 and $425000.

His company is roughly eight months behind schedule because of the pandemic.

He's currently building a waste water system for his subdivision. But doesn't know yet what his future moves for the development will be. Tamez will decide during the next six months while the lift station is being built.

""D.R. Horton is coming to town. And I think they're changing the industry"" he said. ""We'll start making our decision on what kind of product we would want to put out and what the consumption rate will be.""

Late last year national homebuilder D.R. Horton acquired Braselton Homes the largest homebuilder in Corpus Christi.

Things have also been difficult for smaller family-owned companies.

Zarghooni started Devonshire Custom Homes a homebuilding company in Corpus Christi more than a decade ago. He builds roughly 25 homes a year.

One of the biggest challenges he's faced is finding lots to build on. Many large developers now build on the plats they own instead of selling them. This is a trend that started several years ago before the pandemic several years ago Zarghooni said.

""Now what's happening is that the developer is becoming the builder and not allowing other builders to come into buy lots and controlling the market"" he said. ""So basically the only way you're going to be able to build in the next couple of years is if you have your own land.""

Homer Rylan Jr. qualified this past week as an independent candidate for mayor. He and Jennifer Renee Harper who qualified last week as a Constitution Party candidate will proceed to the general election and will not appear on the primary ballot. They will face the winner of the Democratic primary between Rod Bobo Cole Bryan and new candidate Tammy Parkerson who also qualified within the last week.

Rylan has run for mayor of his hometown before and said several of the ideas he outlined in his previous campaign such as bringing Peco Foods to West Point were put to use by past administrations.

“I know my ideas are feasible and that’s been proven because my ideas have been used” he said.

He worked as the campaign manager for his father Homer Rylan Sr. who was a selectman for 20 years and he has also worked as an engineer at Steel Dynamics in Lowndes County.

Parkerson co-owns J. Parkerson Jewelers in Starkville with her husband Jamie and owns Image Makers Hair Salon in West Point according to her Facebook page.

She did not return calls from The Dispatch by press time.

Primary elections are April 6. The general election will be June 8.

Selectmen primary challenges

The Democratic incumbents in Wards 2 3 and 5 all received primary challengers in the week before the filing deadline. Ward 2 Selectman William Binder will face Bryson Gandy Ward 3 Selectman Ken Poole will face Jonas Robinson and Ward 5 Selectman Jasper Pittman will face Colby Pennington.

Robinson the outgoing mayor’s 45-year-old nephew cited a desire to serve his hometown and make it a better place for his children as his reasons for running.

“I want to work with other elected officials to help West Point prosper and continue on the path it’s going and to bring jobs and industry to West Point” said Robinson a carpenter with Harrell General Contractors.

Pennington 30 said he wants to effect change in West Point that he has not seen over the years. In addition to his job as an electrical journeyman lineman at Mississippi State University in Starkville he is a longtime volunteer coach for several youth sports and said he wants the city to make a stronger investment in young people’s futures.

West Point closed its parks last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Pennington said the city should come up with a plan to reopen them.

“It seems every board meeting it’s pushed to the side” he said. “Our youth will be our future someday and we’ve kept our kids inside for about a year. Not only is it bad for them mentally but physically too.”

Pennington said he also wants the city’s government to communicate more actively with the public.

“Whether it’s what they want to hear or not I want to be transparent and open with people because we’re working for them and people deserve to know what’s going on at these board meetings and what’s happening in the city” he said.

Gandy could not be reached for comment by press time.

Other races

Additionally Ward 1 Selectwoman Leta Turner faces a challenge from fellow Democrat Linda Hannah who previously held the seat. The winners of all four competitive primaries will automatically win the seats in June.

Ward 4 Selectman Keith McBrayer is unopposed for re-election.

They weren’t there to see “Slash” explode onto the scene. They weren’t there for the meteoric rise of a Colorado quarterback as a do-it-all offensive weapon for Bill Cowher’s Steelers.

They also weren’t there for Stewart’s struggles on the field. The AFC Championship game losses and of course the rumors.

In 1998 I was a freshman in High School in Wheeling WV. For those who don’t know where Wheeling is geographically compared to Pittsburgh it is about 45-50 minutes way from the Steel City in the northern panhandle of West Virginia the small part pinched between Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Wheeling is Pittsburgh through and through when it comes to professional sports teams but fans of the Steelers Penguins and Pirates who reside in the mountain state are always considered a distant relative to the “real” black and gold fans in the keystone state.

But even in Wheeling the rumors of Kordell Stewart swirled. I remember talking to friends about Stewart and wishing he was more “Slash” and less Kordell the quarterback. Their response?

“You didn’t hear about Kordell?”

“No. What are you talking about?”

Their answer was about the rumor of Stewart being caught with another man in a vehicle in Pittsburgh. Immediately his sexuality was questioned and so was his ability to lead the Steelers to the Super Bowl as crooked as that may seem.

From that moment on the fan base didn’t view Stewart the same. It is horrible to even suggest but that is just the fact of what it was like during that 1998-1999 season. This week Stewart spoke about it publicly writing a piece for The Players’ Tribune about that season. I can’t suggest reading this article enough for those who were alive for it and to hear the story from Stewart’s perspective.

Here are some of the excerpts from the article:

Stewart on hearing the rumors himself

I had absolutely no idea what it was going to become. Next morning I get to Three Rivers Stadium and our PR person is waiting for me at the front door. And she’s looking at me like she’s seen a ghost. She says “Hey Kordell how you doing? Listen before you go to the meeting Mr. Rooney wants to see you.” I said “Haaaahhh???” The big fella wants to see me??? The owner???? I’d never been called to the principal’s office before. And honestly Mr. Rooney was like a father figure to me. So I’m thinking to myself Man I’m going to the bench? And they gotta have Mr. Rooney tell me? For real???

Stewart’s conversation with Dan Rooney

I said “What’s up big fella?” He said “Oh nothing I just wanted to make sure you’re doing O.K.” “Yeah I’m good Mr. Rooney.” But now I’m putting the pieces together and I’m like — “Wait Mr. Rooney this isn’t about some crazy rumor you heard about —” He cut me off and he said “No no no I don’t care about that nonsense. I just wanted to make sure you’re O.K.” “I’m good. I’m just trying to go watch some film and get ready for next week.” “Well when you get a minute Coach wants to see you.” Coach wants to see me??? Now I’m starting to think O.K. What’s really going on????

His conversation with Bill Cowher

He said “How you doin’ kid?” I said “Come on coach. For real? Seriously?” “I know I know I know. This is some malicious bleepity-bleep. I’m sorry kid.” “Wait does the team know about this b.s.?!” “Yeah Slash. They all heard.” “Well what are we supposed to do about it?” “Maybe you should address the team.” In my head I’m like Address the team???? And say what?????

Just to think this was before the internet was in everyone’s homes. When cell phones could only do one thing make phone calls. This was before Twitter Facebook or any other social media platform which would have taken this story and blown it even more out of proportion.

Throughout the article which I can’t recommend reading enough you get a glimpse into what Stewart was seeing hearing and reading throughout the ordeal and how it shaped his career. As I said earlier from that moment on things were never the same with Stewart and this after he had some great seasons as the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

When you talk about the bridge from Terry Bradshaw to Ben Roethlisberger you gloss over names like Bubby Brister Mike Tomczak Kent Graham Tommy Maddox and even Stewart. But of all those quarterbacks which not all were listed Stewart is the one who should garner the most attention. He was as dynamic as they come and some would suggest he was ahead of his time.

Criticize Stewart all you want for his play on the field but no one and I mean no one deserves what he endured off the field during his career in Pittsburgh. No one.",,,,,,

The Panay Films-produced ad was originally meant to air alongside another 60-second spot with a similar premise starring the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski. But the carrier claims that the ad was rejected at the last minute over an advertising rights deal between the NFL and Verizon.

In",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9uZmxfcmVqZWN0c190bW9iaWxlX2FkX2Zyb21fYWlyaW5nX29uX3N1cGVyX2Jvd2xfc3VuZGF5LW5ld3MtNDc2MTQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL rejects T-Mobile ad from airing on Super Bowl Sunday,"On Friday morning T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert Tweeted that one of the carrier’s ads set to air during this Super Bowl Sunday was banned by the NFL.

The ad was instead published on YouTube and debuted on Today Show. You might be wondering exactly why the ad was rejected from appearing during the Super Bowl on Sunday. There was nothing controversial or obscene contained in the ad. There wasn’t even any name dropping. The ad simply boasted that T-Mobile’s network was more stable during video calls and the NFL’s headlining sponsor didn’t like that. That sponsor is Verizon Wireless.

Well this is fun... one of our @TMobile commercials was BANNED from the big game on Sunday. Want to see it anyway…? 😉



You're in luck! We’re giving it to the @TODAYshow to air today at 8am ET!! #TheGOATin5G — Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) February 5 2021

Even after submitting a second draft of the ad the first of which may or may not have mentioned Verizon by name it was still not allowed to air.

In 2017 Verizon and the NFL signed a $2.5 billion deal to sponsor the National Football League for 5 years. The carrier has used the Super Bowl’s venue to boast about it’s 5G capabilities over mmWave and the T-Mobile ad about 5G just didn’t sit right with the partnership. Both T-Mobile and Verizon invested heavily to upgrade 5G network capacity in ahead of this year’s Super Bowl taking place in Tampa Florida this Sunday.

The Super Bowl is the United States most viewed sporting event all year and the Super Bowl is historically known for airing American companies’ most outrageous/funniest/weirdest commercials during the commercial breaks. These days Super Bowl ads are more expensive than they are controversial – usually featuring A-list celebrities or very creative ad productions.

In a hilarious new ad for T-Mobile Buccaneers stars Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski poke fun at their decision to join the Florida NFL team after years with the New England Patriots — and retirement for the latter.

At the beginning of the clip — marked as one year ago — Brady 43 FaceTimes with Gronkowski (who is golfing in Florida) and asks ""What do you think my next move should be? Give it to me straight. Maybe it's just time I hang 'em up.""

""I got one word for you: retirement"" replies his former teammate. ""If you retire now you're gonna be walking on soft sand in a week. Just come to Florida and feel the wind in your hair. Retirement is like winning another one. Maybe I'll even join you.""

But Brady's network connection is rough so he only hears part of Gronkowski's response: ""If you retire now you're soft and weak. Just come to Florida and win another one. Maybe I'll even join you.""

Feeling challenged Brady announces at a press conference that his ""goal is to win one more. And Gronk's coming with me.""

""I'm retired from retiring?"" a shocked Gronkowski learns as he watches Brady's announcement.

At the end of the clip Brady also assures ""I'm not soft or weak either.""

Gronkowski 31 came out of retirement following several seasons with the Patriots to join Tampa Bay in April 2020 a month after Brady revealed he was also leaving the Massachusetts team to sign with the Buccaneers.

Super Bowl LV marks Brady's 10th Super Bowl appearance and Gronkowski's sixth all of which were during the duo's tenure with the Patriots prior to joining the Buccaneers last year.

The Buccaneers and the Kansas City Chiefs are facing off at Super Bowl LV on Sunday in Tampa. The game is airing on CBS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYWRhZ2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnQtc3VwZXItYm93bC93aHktY2FuYWRpYW5zLWNhbnQtd2F0Y2gtbW9zdC1hbWVyaWNhbi1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWNvbW1lcmNpYWxzLzIzMTE4OTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Canadians can't watch most American Super Bowl commercials,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/why-canadians-cant-watch-most-american-super-bowl-commercials/2311896 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYWRhZ2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnQtc3VwZXItYm93bC93aHktY2FuYWRpYW5zLWNhbnQtd2F0Y2gtbW9zdC1hbWVyaWNhbi1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWNvbW1lcmNpYWxzLzIzMTE4OTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTM1NDQwMjYyL3RvbS1icmFkeS1yb2ItZ3Jvbmtvd3NraS1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWFkLXQtbW9iaWxlLXZpZGVvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski's Hilarious Super Bowl Ad,"Quarterback Tom Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski have been long-time teammates in the NFL first with the New England Patriots and more recently with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The pair also partnered up this year on a new commercial for carrier network T-Mobile; the Super Bowl ad fills in the fictional backstory of how and why both players ended up playing for the Buccaneers.

Set a year ago the minute-long film shows Brady and Gronk catching up via video chat with Brady pondering his next move and considering retirement. Gronk (who retired from the NFL in real life) encourages him to do so singing the praises of a life of leisure in sunny Florida. ""If you retire now you're going to be walking on soft sand in a week"" he says. ""Retirement is like winning another one! Maybe I'll even join you.""

The central conceit of the ad however is that the two legendary athletes are talking over a poor cell connection meaning what Brady ends up hearing is: ""If you retire now you're soft and weak... Just come to Florida and win another one maybe I'll even join you.""



While the ad manages to make a pretty decent gag of Gronk's recent career trajectory (""I'm retired from retiring?!"") it most definitely won't be airing with the rest of this year's Super Bowl TV spots due to some legal issues relating to a ""protected telco rights deal.""

""We made this amazing ad starring the amazing Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski"" a T-Mobile spokesperson stated. ""Even after editing the spot was still banned."""

Take a look.,"BLOOMINGTON — Downtown Bloomington got its first look at Rivian's R1S SUV as the electric vehicle company prepares to roll its launch-edition trucks off the production line in Normal.

Rivian was there Friday afternoon to test-run an SUV validation prototype the first of its kind built at its Normal assembly plant.

""It's just exciting that this is all coming into being for the community"" said Zach Dietmeier a Rivian spokesman. ""There's going to be a whole lot more coming down the line.""

The blue SUV was sporting a special wrap that made the vehicle appear to change colors — from a light blue to a dark purple — as it made its way around the old McLean County Courthouse.

""It's an incredible vehicle"" said Normal Mayor Chris Koos who caught a glimpse of the SUV driving through uptown Normal. ""To see that on the streets of Normal it's just a realization of how far they've come and how close they are to being in full production.""

Check it out! #Rivian test ran its R1S SUV through downtown Bloomington this afternoon. #MadeinNormal pic.twitter.com/4OJcXrAxkN — Sierra Henry (@pg_sierrahenry) February 5 2021

In the past month the Irvine California-based company has already test run its R1T pickup which Bloomington-Normal residents may have seen driving around the area.

Excitement surrounding Rivian's long-awaited launch continues to build with the company expecting to deliver its first batch of special-edition electric trucks as early as June.

Construction at its Normal factory has yet to slow as Rivian continues investing billions into building out the former Mitsubishi plant. The factory will eventually employ 1000 workers.

Founded in 2009 Rivian recently secured $2.65 billion in the first round of 2021 investments and has raised a total of $8 billion in the last two years. Backers include T. Rowe Price and Ford.

Now the company plans to open a showroom in a Chicago neighborhood one of 10 stores the company will open across the country this year.

The company intends to open in a building at 932 W. Randolph St. in the Fulton-Randolph Market district. A former warehouse meatpacking and warehouse area west of downtown Chicago Fulton-Randolph Market has been converted into residential units and other developments in recent years.

The company bought the Normal plant in 2017 for $16 million.

Alexander has done Orton's ink between 2003 and 2008 and claims she owns copyrights to the original designs she's done on the WWE Superstar. She's accused WWE and 2K of copyright infringement declining WWE's $450 offer for the rights to the designs back in 2009.

The tattoos include tribal art on Orton's forearm a Bible verse on his arm a dove a skull and a rose. Alexander's original suit claimed that all of her tattoos on Orton are her original designs and that she never gave the defendants permission to recreate them in WWE video games. She also stated that the designs done between 2003 and 2008 are ""easily recognized by his fans and members of the public.""

The Long Song airs Sundays at 9:00 pm and is available to stream. Recap the previous and following episodes.

Celebrations over the end of slavery are breaking out across Jamaica. And yet: while slaves in the British Empire are now free their former owners are to be compensated while the freedmen receive nothing. Furthermore the freedmen’s houses are owned by the people on whose land they labor—even though the freedmen built their dwellings themselves—so they must continue to work in the fields for wages to pay rent.

Freedmen are now free to leave at least and several have. Caroline tells July that she has a good “protected” life however so why would she leave? Where would she go? Caroline has even taught July to read and write to take care of the accounts of the plantation. Caroline still calls July “Marguerite.”

But there is a new overseer with antipathy towards slavery. Robert Goodwin is concerned with the wellbeing and lodging of the fieldworkers to Caroline’s surprise. His father is a minister who sent him to Jamaica to help dispel the evils of slavery. Yet his attitude is still paternalistic. Addressing the fieldworkers he tells them to “prove you’re worthy of the kindness shown to you” to their disgust.

He is unmarried and handsome so Caroline sends July—through a downpour—to invite him for a beef dinner. July finds Robert frantically ordering a worker to catch and kill cockroaches. As the worker leaves Robert speaks kindly to July learning her real name and vowing to call her by it. He gives her an umbrella for the walk back to the great house.

While running errands in town July runs into a mulatto woman who gloats about her status and new marriage to a white man. As Robert pulls up in a carriage and offers July a ride back to the plantation she hatches a plan.

She tells Robert that her father was from Scotland and praises her mother. When she mentions that both parents died in the Christmas rebellion—eliding the fact that Kitty killed Tam to save July—Robert acts tenderly towards her. Robert offers to show her a book about Scotland. Caroline witnesses it all.

July dresses up to visit Robert and look at his Scotland book. The meeting quickly turns intimate and they kiss—but Robert pulls back before they go any further. His father has always castigated white men who take advantage of “Negroes” and Robert will not give into temptation. He asks July to leave: “You’re too beautiful too good” he says.

He avoids the great house for weeks but leaves the book for July with a pressed flower inside. Finally Caroline forces the issue and surveys the fields with him swooning into him. Later he waits amongst trees to speak to July clandestinely telling her that he loves her and has a plan.

And yet: when July returns to the great house Caroline is ecstatic. She’s to marry Robert. His father has been urging him to marry and start a family. Marrying July would break his father’s heart.

Robert’s plan? On his wedding night he goes to sleep with July leaving Caroline lonely and devastated in their marital bed. Caroline is silent the next day when July brings her breakfast and when Robert tells her he must attend to work. She screams after they both leave.

Robert continually excuses himself from spending evenings with Caroline begging work. He includes July in a portrait of him and Caroline. He reads at supper with Caroline. He eventually tells Caroline to call “Marguerite” by her true name. But inviting July to sit at table with them is a step too far for Caroline. In private he tells July that she is his “true wife.”

July soon gives birth to a girl. They name her Emily after Robert’s mother.

The harvesting has been slowing down as workers leave the plantation and the freedmen demand better treatment. As Christmas approaches Robert asks the fieldworkers all those age 10 or older to work seven days a week lest the crop rot in the field. But the workers have been planning to visit their families over the holiday and demand just five days a week of work. Robert threatens to withhold wages if they won’t work seven days and calls one of the leaders James “boy.”

As Robert walks away James tells July who has been watching with Caroline to warn Robert not to push the fieldworkers. He’s no different from any other white overseer he says but July defends Robert.

Later she asks Robert to be kind and prove that he’s different from all the white masters who lied and mistreated the workers. So Robert tries to talk to workers individually promising that they can have time off to visit their families as soon as the crop is harvested after Christmas. The fieldworkers begin laughing at Robert and singing a Christmas song. He storms away fuming nearly leaving July behind.

Caroline disparages “Negroes” to July as they watch Robert pace outside that evening. July tries to encourage Robert to come see Emily but her entreaties fall on deaf ears. I’ll make them beg to work for me Robert says ominously.",,,

[Peter Ochieng Standard]

For the second consecutive month Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) surpassed its revenue collection target managing Sh142 billion against a target of Sh138 billion. This was a 6.7 per cent growth over the same period last year.

The performance rate was 102.6 per cent and surpassed their target for the first month of the year by Sh3.53 billion.

In December the taxman brought home more than Sh166 billion in taxes beating the Sh164 billion target - a performance rate of 101.3 per cent.

KRA attributed the two months’ positive performance to the resurgence of the economy.

According to the Quarterly Gross Domestic Product Report by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics the economy contracted by 1.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2020 which was an improvement from a contraction of 5.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2020.

""In addition the relaxation of the stringent Covid-19 containment measures the implementation of the Post Covid-19 economic recovery strategy 2020-2022 by the government and the sustained implementation of enhanced compliance efforts by KRA in the month of January 2021 have continued to drive this performance"" said KRA Commissioner General James Mburu.

In the month taxes on international trade boosted collection of the Customs and Border Control Department to Sh54.9 billion a growth of 9.7 per cent and a revenue surplus of Sh6.053 billion.

""The customs revenue was achieved through a sustained daily average of non-oil revenue at Sh1.7 billion compared to Sh1.744 billion in December 2020 which was the highest ever daily average collection for customs revenue. Exemptions and remissions in customs declined by 4.8 per cent positively impacting the revenue base by Sh283 million.""

The domestic taxes also registered an improved performance at 97.1 per cent of the target which albeit short of hitting the monthly target was the best return since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The department recorded an improved growth of five per cent in January 2021 after suffering a decline of 10.4 per cent in December 2020.

Excise domestic taxes recorded a growth of 42.8 per cent after collecting a surplus of Sh3.422 billion while withholding tax surpassed the target by Sh396 million a growth of 8.2 per cent.

Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes recorded a performance at 98.6 per cent reflecting an uptick in employment coming into the new year.

Corporation taxes levied on resident companies recorded a revenue collection growth of 44.4 per cent. This was a performance rate of 119.4 per cent against the target an improvement from December 2020 performance rate which stood at 93.5 per cent.

The Value Added Tax (VAT) domestic remittances grew by 8.5 per cent. This was a huge improvement after a decline of 19.8 per cent achieved in December 2020. The performance is expected to further improve as businesses continue to convert purchases to sales.

With the implementation of the Post Covid-19 Economic Recovery Strategy 2020-2022 the tax authority expects revenue collection performance to accelerate further within forecast rates.

""With a positive forecast on the economic growth which is projected to bounce back at 6.4 per cent in 2021 from the projected growth of 0.6 per cent in 2020 KRA remains positive on the response of revenue to the economic resurgence"" Mburu said in a statement.

KRA says that it will continue to build up compliance enforcement efforts by driving the implementation of the new tax measures as it broadens its tax base.

New requirements include digital service tax minimum alternative tax and voluntary disclosure programme.

It will also focus on trade facilitation and enhanced compliance “through the implementation of post clearance audits review of the end use of exempt products comprehensive audit of exemptions profiling and targeting enhanced scanning and conducting intelligence-led verification of import cargo will continue to play a critical role in maintain revenue performance”.

“In addition KRA will also continue to escalate its fight against tax evasion and leverage on technology to support tax collection. These among other measures will support enhancement of revenue collection and ensure economic sustainability in the country.”",,,,,,

You can certainly base your primary plan on superchargers and HPWCs but there are plenty of L2 options as well as backups. If you're staying in Springdale for instance your hotel might have an in-use HPWC but a hotel down the street might have an open L2.--Form an anxiety perspective its not a bad idea to big-charge at superchargers even if that means you're only hotel charging for a few hours...like if you're staying in Springdale its still a good idea to 95% charge in St George on the way in. That way you know that if you can't get a charge at a hotel that night you'll still be good to get to Bryce the next day and then hopefully you can get a hotel charge when you get back (if that's your itinerary) and you'll certainly have enough to bail out to Cedar City.--RV parks are a plentiful worst case solution so even if you end up wasting a few hours to get enough to limp to a supercharger or hotel charge its not like you're going to be totally up the creek.--A few years ago we did a heat-of-August leg in our M3 that started with a near full charge at the *sugar*-show Beaver Supercharger-->Over to 89 down to the Zion East entrance-->Hotel in Virgin that night (Without charging)-->Back to Zion the next day (including a drive up through the tunnel and back)-->Back to St George supercharger (the dumb one on the other side of town before they opened the new one on I-15).

For years Tesla has caught heat over quality control issues — whether it's improperly affixed roofs loose bolts or shoddy bodywork — with one of the most vocal critics being Sandy Munro an auto-manufacturing expert who once likened the build quality of a 2018 Model 3 to a Kia from the 1990s.

In a one-on-one interview with Munro published this week Tesla CEO Elon Musk fessed up to some of the company's production hiccups and recommended the best time of year to buy a new Tesla.

Asked how the fit and finish of two Model 3 sedans Munro had examined could be so vastly different — even though they were built only a month apart — Musk admitted that build quality tends to be worse when Tesla is working to rapidly scale up production.

""Friends ask me when should they buy a Tesla. Well either buy it right at the beginning or when production reaches a steady state"" Musk said. ""But during that production ramp it's super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get everything right on the little details. It's just a super difficult thing.""

Last year and especially in its final months Tesla pushed hard to deliver 500000 vehicles an aggressive sales target that the company missed by only a few hundred cars. But racing to accelerate production came with drawbacks Musk said.

The CEO told Munro that as Tesla sped up manufacturing one problem it faced was that ""the paint wasn't necessarily drying enough"" leading to quality issues. He said that Tesla did ""improve gap and paint quality quite a bit towards the end of last year even in the course of December.""

Musk who tends to be overly optimistic about Tesla's ambitions acknowledged in the interview that mass-producing cars is no easy task. A testament to that he said is that Tesla is the first US car startup to reach volume production since Chrysler was founded in 1925.

He certainly made it his own over the years investing early on and then overseeing its growth from niche luxury carmaker to mass production adding on a solar business and pushing self-driving technologies. However the tech titan -- and now the world's richest man -- was actually Tesla's 4th CEO when he took that role in October 2008.

They first met with Musk at a gathering for Mars Society members and bonded through their shared love of space exploration. (That was even before Musk had started his re-usable rocket company SpaceX.)

Eberhard was eventually ""voted off the island"" he said resulting in a contentious lawsuit and eventual settlement. But he is still rooting for Tesla believes electric vehicles are key to protecting the planet and remains a Tesla shareholder.

An electrical engineer and inventor at heart Eberhard is working on technology to make electric vehicle batteries more affordable than they are today without sacrificing safety power or quality.

Tarpenning said he still speaks with Musk occasionally and resigned from Tesla just as they were developing their flagship Model S sedan. Looking back he said he has no regrets. ""The whole thing was wonderful from the beginning to the end. It was you know the worst and the best. And it's worked out great.""

Tarpenning is now mentoring the next generation of environment minded startups and investing in them as a venture partner with Pierre Omidyar's Spero Ventures.

Tesla Model 3 customers who are taking delivery of the newest builds of the all-electric sedan are reporting that their vehicle has a heated steering wheel a feature Tesla included in some of the “refreshed” versions of its mass-market cars.

It has long been speculated whether the Model 3 would be receiving a heated steering wheel. In early December 2020 Tesla hacker green discovered some upcoming features that would be included with the refreshed Model 3 including the powered liftgate new USB-C ports and a heated steering wheel. In fact some owners of newer Model 3 production models felt that their steering wheel had become noticeably thicker compared to previous iterations setting off speculation within the community that Tesla would be adding the feature within its vehicles. Additionally owners in other countries like Switzerland stated that their cars had been given heated steering wheels.

On New Years Day Tesla launched a refresh to the Model Y crossover including some new door panel designs and also adding the heated steering wheel. Speculation regarding U.S. Model 3s also grew when Tesla added the feature to sedans built in China at the company’s Giga Shanghai production facility.

Now owners taking delivery of new Model 3 builds are showing their vehicles do include the heated steering wheel a desirable feature for cold weather climates.

Tesla Motors Club member 808BOB took delivery of their Model 3 on Thursday noticing that his new car did include the heated steering wheel feature. The car was built in February 2021 the original posting says. According to photographs uploaded by the user the button to activate the heated steering wheel feature is within the “Seat Heaters” menu and can be turned on by pressing the button with a picture of a steering wheel.

808BOB said in their posting:

“Hi all just had my M3 delivered on Thursday… Love the car!

BUT just wanted to confirm that my M3 HAS a heated steering wheel. I’ve been wondering if/when the car would get it…

I was surprised to “find” this option (still finding stuff). Located in the butt warmer section.

RED means it is turned on (it gets pretty warm in the 3/9 locations… you cannot adjust the heat). It was about 67F today so I didn’t have it on for more than a minute.

Hope this puts an END to all of the speculation?

Oh VIN 902xxx

Delivered in the Bay Area.”

The difference between the heated steering wheel and the heated seats is that the steering wheel only has one temperature option while the seats have three settings. 808BOB stated in their posting that some parts of the steering wheel especially the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock locations seem to be warmer than others.

Some users in the forum stated that new software updates could allow for variable temperatures like the seats. Currently the vehicle is operating with Software v10.2 (2020.47.101.1).

808BOB stated that they had their car delivered in the Bay Area so this is likely one of the first Model 3s outfitted with a heated steering wheel. Owners who live nearest to Tesla’s Fremont factory will usually be the first to experience new features because they live so close to the production facility. It is likely that owners outside of the area will soon begin taking delivery of Model 3 units with the heated steering wheel feature included.

Production should start soon (the new Model S is expected in March while the new Model X in April) after a period of a break to upgrade the Tesla Factory in Fremont California. The Model S Plaid+ version will appear a little bit later in ""late 2021.""

According to Tesla the new Model S/ Model X are equipped with a new powertrain (including battery modules battery packs and drive units shared with Model 3/Model Y) an entirely new interior exterior updates and ""other improvements"". Those other improvements are for example a lithium-ion 12V auxiliary battery heat pump (all new Tesla models have one now).

Tesla explains that both the battery pack and modules have been fully redesigned. Together with other changes it improved energy efficiency and allows Tesla to increase the number of high-speed quarter-mile runs by 5-times compared to the prior architecture.

There is no word about change in the cells which means that both models are still equipped with cylindrical 18650 type compared to 2170 in Model 3/Model Y and upcoming 4680.

The Model S Plaid and Plaid+ as well as the Model X Plaid are equipped with three electric motors with high speed high-power ""carbon-sleeved rotors"" (one in the front for the front axle and two separate for the rear wheels with torque vectoring system).

2021 Tesla Model S 2021 Tesla Model X

Thanks to three electric motors and higher system output the Plaid versions will become the quickest production cars ever introduced.

In terms of interior some changes were quite surprising including the yoke steering wheel lack of a typical gear selector or turn signal lever. Others like the new 17” center display (horizontal) and an additional 8” second-row display are kind of cool. The entire interior looks more modern but remains minimalist.

We would like to note a few of the features:

Heated seats for every passenger heated steering and heated windshield

Ventilated front seating

Still skeptics rightly point out that plenty of other places have made a bid to become the new Silicon Valley and never come close.

Texas though may be different and not because of the recent high-profile relocations. Unlike other would-be innovation hubs the state has been quietly nurturing high-tech industry for decades.

Ratings are based on a 5-point scale: 1.0=very dissatisfied 3.0=OK 5.0=very satisfied. H-E-B received an overall rating of 4.4 with employee reviews praising H-E-B as a “super fun work environment” and referencing “great benefits” and a”flexible work schedule.” 90 percent of reviewers said they would recommend the company to a friend and 96 percent approved of H-E-B’s Chairman and CEO Charles Butt.

Glassdoor’s 100 best places to work list features employers across a range of industries including technology health care biotech and pharmaceuticals retail travel and tourism consulting and finance. Among large employers (companies with over 1000 employees) H-E-B trailed behind some of the world’s most valuable companies including Google (No.6) Delta Air Lines (No.7) and Microsoft (No.9). Notably the Texas grocer ranked higher than giants like Facebook (No. 11) LinkedIn (No. 13) Mastercard (No. 28) and Apple (No. 31).

This project is developed by FotaHub Inc a company created by Moroccan Abdelghani El-Kacimi. The platform is about allowing everyone to benefit from the technologies that it has been developing for years.

Born in Morocco in the village of Ouagrar in the Ouazzane region this businessman spent his entire childhood in the country. After obtaining his baccalaureate in 1989 he chose to go to Germany despite several challenges.

He enrolled in preparatory classes and then went for the engineering school of the University of the Ruhr in Bochum. «Obviously when you arrive in a country there are challenges to overcome. I was 17 when I arrived in Germany I didn't speak German and was financially-challenged» he told Yabiladi.

Born to a modest family made up of a father working as a teacher a stay-at-home mother and seven little brothers and sisters Abdelghani El-Kacimi was nevertheless convinced that «those who work hard make it against all odds».

And that's exactly what he tried to do during his twenty-year-long career. After finishing school in 1998 he did a short one-year stint at world-renowned Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS the design automation division for a year and a half. From there Texas Instruments a world-class American electronics company in the field of electronic components and semiconductors hired him to fill the position of designer of integrated circuits. His penchant for applications and marketing sparked from then-on an «entrepreneurial spirit» in him.

«I had to convince customers to use Texas Instruments products and I saw their problems and how they start.So I said if they know how to do that why not me one day». Abdelghani El-Kacimi

Computing in the world of on-board electronics

Five years later he left the American company for a start-up based in California Monolithic Power Systems MPS. «It was a business that had just left the garage were it was founded. I stayed there for three years because I told myself that we had to work with them to learn entrepreneurship» he recalled.

The Moroccan on the hunt for new opportunities subsequently acquired shares in a German company called Itemis AG in which he became eventually CEO. Pursuing his ambition to change the world he then tried to «unite the world of embedded and industrial computing and the world of classical computing».

To this engineer the gap existing between the analytical mind of a computer engineer and an electronics engineer is enormous and constitutes «one of the biggest brakes for industrial development because these two worlds do not understand each other».

To solve this problem Abdelghani El-Kacimi launched the very advanced computing technologies in the world of on-board electronics. Technologies thanks to which his company became 9 years later a «world leader in the design of complex electronic systems».

In 2017 he went on to develop the FotaHub platform.»Several thousand hours have been spent on work. I told myself that this service was so innovative that it deserved a company for it. So I made a spin off of the company to create a separate and independent entity in Delaware in the United States» he explained. While since its creation the company was catering mostly to a select few private customers it has become open to the public since Monday.

In the meantime Abdelghani El-Kacimi has not forgotten his country of origin to which he remains very attached. In 2011 he responded when the government created the first clusters to lead the microelectronics cluster. He then started planning «to build a bridge between the Moroccan academic world and the industrial world».

Investing in the knowledge economy

But what drives this Moroccan is his conviction that the economy of know-how is the one Morocco must focus on during this century. «We are way behind the Asians and South Americans. But in our MENA region whether for Arab countries or Africa we still have a head start that must be kept» he said.

«We can be the leaders in the knowledge economy in Africa and position ourselves as a pioneer in technology.It is something that concerns me and in which I would like to invest and therefore start in my country». Abdelghani El-Kacimi

It is in this context that his company FotaHub decided to invest in the first Moroccan robot Chama. In addition to this investment the company has also made a commitment to the Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech.

«Through it other Moroccan universities can dive into the world of artificial intelligence and connected objects and be able to do collaborative work between universities and researchers while going through a global platform created by a Moroccan» he proudly said. Via his company the businessman also intends to «make calculating tools available to all Moroccan universities».

«We must also unite entrepreneurs in our country around the idea of investing in know-how. I have invested several million dollars to get to where I am now. I might have slept better if I had an investor in the beginning who had proposed that I do the work and they provide me with financing» he explained.

To Abdelghani El-Kacimi the current challenge remains to «ensure the succession». «I am 49 years old and I worked for about 20 years to get where I am now. I hope it doesn't just end with personal success at my level and that this know-how is passed on. I would like in the next years to participate to the creation of know-how in my country and promote technological independence» he confides.

To this Morocco-born entrepreneur «knowledge is the only inexhaustible raw material by dint of our investing in it».",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHNwZWN0aXZlLm5ldC8yMDIxLzAyLzA2L3RoZS1oaWRkZW4tcG93ZXItb2YtdGhlLWhwLXBhcnRuZXItcHJvZ3JhbS_SAVNodHRwczovL3RlY2hzcGVjdGl2ZS5uZXQvMjAyMS8wMi8wNi90aGUtaGlkZGVuLXBvd2VyLW9mLXRoZS1ocC1wYXJ0bmVyLXByb2dyYW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hidden Power of the HP Partner Program,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsaW5nL2Z1bm5pZXN0LWhpbGFyaW91cy11bmRlcnRha2VyLWFqLXN0eWxlcy1ib25leWFyZC1tZW1lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Undertaker/AJ Styles Memes That Make Us Laugh,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsaW5nL2Z1bm5pZXN0LWhpbGFyaW91cy11bmRlcnRha2VyLWFqLXN0eWxlcy1ib25leWFyZC1tZW1lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Escapism from the sofa through a growing range of VR travel experiences is whetting appetites for post-pandemic holidays and could be a watershed moment for the technology in tourism say analysts.

“As long as the pandemic increases and we are spending more time indoors we should see adoption keep on growing” said Ralph Hollister a tourism analyst at Global Data and the author of a recent report on VR in tourism.

Oculus launched its Quest 2 headset in October and the most popular experiences include National Geographic VR which takes users to places such as Antarctica – where they can navigate icebergs in a kayak climb an ice shelf and survive a raging snowstorm as they search for a lost emperor penguin colony.

Another app Wander can teleport VR travellers from the pyramids of Egypt to the gardens of the Taj Mahal while Alcove offers immersive experiences from hot air balloon rides to city tours.

When We Stayed Home takes travellers to the heart of Paris Venice Jerusalem and Tokyo as they largely are today. Through the eyes of a local you can witness the calm the beauty and the emptiness of a places on pause during April 2020.

“In this time of social distancing people are looking for different ways to stay entertained connected and active and VR offers that” said an Oculus spokesperson. “Whether you want to transport yourself to different places in the world play with friends get fit or just hang out together and feel like you’re in the same room people are realising they can with VR.”

One prominent adopter of pandemic VR is Germany’s national tourist board which has unveiled a number of immersive projects. The Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation is using VR to showcase experiences such as beach yoga and snorkelling.

Hollister said VR was still seen as a gimmick. “It remains to be seen if increased usage will last beyond when meaningful travel resumes.” But he believes it could.

“I think the increase will be sustained especially with the Gen Z and millennials in coming years as they move into higher-paid jobs and marketers take them more seriously as a consumer group. They will not feel alienated by the technology” he said.

Currently VR is used in the pre-trip “dreamer” stage in tourism with people looking at where they might want to go. Among the tourist operator Kuoni’s offerings potential customers can take a 360-degree tour of the upmarket Sandy Lane luxury resort in Barbados.

Hollister predicts that in the future people could use VR to book trips directly as well as choosing seats on planes and hotel rooms with a click of the controller.

“A lot of travellers and consumers want a seamless experience to go from looking to booking with minimal clicks instant gratification and saving as much time as possible” he said.

It has its limitations. ‘Tourism is also about touch taste smell all those other sensory experiences which is something VR cannot do” he said. The price of high-quality headsets restricts access too.

But as the world seeks more sustainable tourism Hollister said VR also offered a solution. As historic sites are damaged through mass tourism recreating them in VR could help conserve them.

So this could be a watershed moment for VR and travel. “Everyone will be analysing that and working out its real worth to the industry” he said.

‘More immersive than I could have imagined’

Angel Ross hoped to be travelling this year – and he has. He’s been cage diving with white sharks kayaked in Antarctica and played poker in China – all virtually.

Ross who works for a London-based marketing firm invested in an Oculus Quest 2 in January to satisfy his wanderlust after finding himself “stuck at home with the winter getting a bit depressing”.

He said: “I love travelling. I am 22 and these are the years when I have been wanting to do a lot of things and obviously can’t do anything right now. I love the ocean and I love snorkelling. On the Oculus you can dive with all these different animals and it’s super immersive and realistic.

“There’s a great white shark you can get in a cage and it comes up to you. It was pretty terrifying but amazing. Then there’s more friendly animals like dolphins you can play with. I’ve done all of them pretty much.”

To make it more inclusive he can cast what he is seeing on to his computer or TV to share with friends. “You feel quite disorientated when you come out because you are really tricking your brain to think you are there” he said.

On the National Geographic VR app he went on an Antarctic adventure. “I saw whales I was in a kayak and you can climb an ice shelf. You really feel like you are walking and moving and going somewhere. All your senses – obviously not smell and touch – feel they are being completely absorbed.

“I am a big poker player with friends and not for money. And the poker on there is incredible. You can go to all these different locations. And one is this Chinese rooftop garden pool. Really cool.”

He has also been rock climbing in the Alps “which is super realistic – you chalk your hands and you can look around and see the drop. Pretty insane.”

On YouTube VR he went in a drone up to 40000ft to see the curvature of the Earth. “It’s even more immersive than I could have imagined. One hundred per cent” he said .

“Because it’s so immersive and intense you can’t sit on it for hours on end. You need breaks. So you can have an intense fun experience and do so many different things invigorate your senses. And then you just stop have a break. And you don’t need that constant fix.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

For the full year net sales were up 11.6%.

Broken down geographically the company’s net sales were MXN13.78 billion ($680 million) for the quarter an increase of 26.3%. In the United States net sales increased 7.6% to MXN4.55 billion. OK Foods the 16th largest poultry producer in the United States is Bachoco’s U.S. subsidiary.

Bachoco’s net income for the quarter increased nearly 381% to MXN720.3 million.

Rodolfo Ramos Arvizu chief executive officer of Bachoco issued the following comments regarding the quarterly and full-year results: “2020 was a historically challenging year. We faced unprecedented conditions that tested our capabilities for adapting fast to new market conditions while being efficient. Despite the uncertainty that this year brought our solid financial structure and our operating discipline allowed us to end 2020 with positive results in terms of profitability while attending all markets.

“During the last quarter of 2020 we observed some adjustments in demand as a result of remaining lockdown conditions in some sectors. However we consider that the industry was well in line with that reading allowing a good balance between supply and demand which resulted in competitive prices for this time frame.

“On the other hand in the U.S. we kept observing challenging conditions that continued to negatively affect commodity prices particularly on white meat and leg quarters.”

Our reporters are asking Portlanders what they’re doing during quarantine.

Two years ago it seemed like the saga of one of Oregon's most notorious dairy farms had come to an end.

Over its mere 18-month existence Lost Valley Farms in Boardman Ore. racked up over 200 environmental citations and almost $200000 in fines for violations that included manure overflow seeping into soil livestock standing in inches of its own filth and a trailer stuffed with dead cows.

When the dairy declared bankruptcy in April 2018 the Oregon Department of Agriculture demanded a cleanup of the site. Regulators deemed the cleanup complete more than a year later on Dec. 30 2019.

Related: Department of Agriculture Declares Environmental Cleanup of Eastern Oregon Mega-Dairy Site Complete.

But according to Jennifer Hauge and Brian Posewitz of Stand Up to Factory Farms Oregon hasn't learned from the Lost Valley incident.

""Since then what's happened is not a lot"" says Hauge. ""There's been some regulatory reform that's happened but not enough to meaningfully close the holes that we think exist.""

Stand Up to Factory Farms is a coalition of animal welfare groups small farmers and environmentalists—Hauge works for the Animal Legal Defense Fund and Posewitz is an attorney for WaterWatch of Oregon and director of Humane Voters Oregon. The group is advocating for two recently introduced bills that would put a halt on permits for mega-dairies—defined as dairies with over 2500 cows—until stricter regulations are imposed.

The organization formed because its members fear another mega-dairy disaster—the land formerly occupied by Lost Valley could soon be home to another mega-dairy.

Easterday Farms bought the property in 2019 with the intent of housing more than 28000 cows again making the site the second-largest dairy in the state. The company is now in the processes of applying for permits to begin operations.

In a strange twist Easterday Ranches filed bankruptcy earlier this week after Tyson Foods Inc. sued the company for $225 million alleging that Easterday billed Tyson for 200000 cattle that never existed. Easterday Farms owned by the same family but technically a separate entity has not declared bankruptcy.

WW talked to Hauge and Posewitz about what they believe needs to change to prevent another Lost Valley."

The bank handed over financial data 211 of its clients who happened to use credit and debit cards for lodging food and other purchases in Washington in the days before and after the Jan. 6 siege Fox News’ Tucker Carlson reported.

“That’s just not a good reason to hand over private information. If that’s the way they do business now then the people of this country really have something to worry about” said Bernard Kerik a security consultant who headed the NYPD in 2000 and 2001.

Kerik said that during his time with the NYPD the department did seek information about suspects from financial institutions in particular during terror probes.

The distinction he noted was that the department always had a specific suspect in mind when it sought the data said Kerik who tweeted “Move over Russia China and Venezuela” when the news broke.

“I am sure there were people who had nothing to do with the Capitol riots and were profiled as well just because they went to the ATM in Washington” Kerik told The Post.

Only one person among the 211 who had their information snooped has been interviewed by the feds and none have been arrested according to Fox.

Former NYPD sergeant Joseph Giacalone likened the fed probe to a “fishing expedition” in the absence of a subpoena or specific targets.

Giacalone too said he sought information from banks in homicide cases — but only after a suspect was targeted.

Former NYPD head Bernard Kerik says “people who had nothing to do with the Capitol riots” had their financial data probed by the feds thanks to Bank of America. SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images

“If it was an emergency we had a ‘riding DA’ on call who could write up a subpoena on the spot” said Giacalone adding that banking and credit card information could determine the accuracy of a suspect’s alibi.

“For instance a person was murdered and their ATM or credit card was used there may be surveillance video of them individual using it” he said.

The FBI did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment and Bank of America refused to say whether they were complying with a federal subpoena.

“We don’t comment on our communications with law enforcement” said spokesman William Halldin repeating an earlier statement by the country’s second largest bank which is now facing growing calls for a boycott.

He added: “All banks have responsibilities under federal law to cooperate with law enforcement inquiries in full compliance with the law.”

Under the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act financial institutions must cooperate with law enforcement in money laundering terrorism cases “and other criminal acts.”

While not bound by that law companies such as Apple and Google have refused to cooperate with the feds in the past.

In 2016 Apple refused to help the FBI unlock a phone that belonged to a suspected terrorist.

“At stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people and setting dangerous precedent that threatens everyone’s civil liberties” Apple CEO Tim Cook said when he refused to help unlock an iPhone used by Syed Farook one of two shooters in the 2015 San Bernardino attack which killed 14 people and injured 22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcm9iZXJ0d29vZC8yMDIxLzAyLzA3L3Jlbm91bmNpbmctYW1lcmljYW4tY2l0aXplbnNoaXAtaGl0cy1hbGwtdGltZS1yZWNvcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renouncing American Citizenship Hits All-Time Record,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2021/02/07/renouncing-american-citizenship-hits-all-time-record/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcm9iZXJ0d29vZC8yMDIxLzAyLzA3L3Jlbm91bmNpbmctYW1lcmljYW4tY2l0aXplbnNoaXAtaGl0cy1hbGwtdGltZS1yZWNvcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW1mb3JkYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvQS1iYW5rLWFuZC1hLWhvbWVsZXNzLW1hbi10ZWFtZWQtdXAtdG8taGVscC10aGUtMTU5Mjk4NjEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A bank and a homeless man teamed up to help the unbanked get their COVID stimulus checks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/local/article/A-bank-and-a-homeless-man-teamed-up-to-help-the-15929861.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW1mb3JkYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvQS1iYW5rLWFuZC1hLWhvbWVsZXNzLW1hbi10ZWFtZWQtdXAtdG8taGVscC10aGUtMTU5Mjk4NjEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtcGF1c2UtYnV0dG9ucy13aGVuLXRvLXVzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit cards that offer a pause button and when to use it,"Editor's note: This story has been updated with the latest information.

When you've misplaced your favorite credit card what do you do? Everyone who uses credit cards has likely had this happen at least once. You could retrace your steps with the hope of finding the missing card at the last restaurant you ate at or perhaps in the pocket of the pants you wore yesterday.

The safe bet though is to contact the card issuer and report it missing. However this will permanently invalidate the lost card and you'll have to wait until you receive a replacement. This can be troublesome especially if you have high hopes that the card will turn up in a few days.

Fortunately though there is a better option. Many major credit card issuers allow you to temporarily disable a particular card and reactivate it later. As you'll see it has lots of potential uses even beyond a misplaced card.

Major card issuers that offer a pause button

Here's a look at which issuers offer this option.

American Express Freeze Your Card

American Express's Free Your Card option prevents your card from being used for new purchases but allows payment of recurring bills on the account. You can also continue to use for digital wallet transactions like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. However your card will automatically be unfrozen in seven days. Both primary and authorized card holders can use this feature. Amex also makes it extremely easy to freeze and unfreeze your card right in the Amex app.

Bank of America Lock/Unlock

Although Bank of America makes it incredibly easy to lock and unlock your card this feature is only available to Bank of America debit card holders.

Barclays SecurHold™

Barclays allows you to instantly lock and unlock your card from its mobile app. And to go one step further they offer a Control Your Card feature which allows you to set transaction limits and even block certain purchases for yourself or authorized users. This is a great feature since Barclays is one of the few card issuers that gives authorized users unique card numbers. The Barclays app can also notify you of each transaction in real time which can be great for monitoring spending and catching fraudulent purchases as soon as they happen.

Capital One Card Lock

Capital One's Card Lock feature allows you to easily lock and unlock your card straight from the mobile app. It blocks all in-store online in-app and phone purchases for cards. However you can continue to return items make payments and redeem rewards while your card is locked.

Chase Lock and Unlock

This feature allows Chase card holders to lock and unlock their credit card from the Chase Mobile app or on their computer. Locking the card doesn't affect automatic payments so there are no disruptions to recurring charges. You also can still use your digit wallet to make purchases. However when you lock your card it will lock any other cards that share the same account number.

Citi Quick Lock

Citi allows card holders to lock and unlock their credit card online or from its mobile app. Even when your card is locked recurring transactions will still hit your credit card without any disruption.

Discover Freeze it®

Discover was one of the first card issuers to offer a card freeze feature which can be activated online or through its mobile app. Even though Discover will not authorize new purchases cash advances or balance transfers while your account is on hold recurring payments returns dispute adjustments and delayed authorized will still post to your account.

US Bank Lock and Unlock

A relatively new feature to US Bank is that they now offer the capability to lock and unlock your card. The easiest way to do this with US Bank is from their mobile app.

Wells Fargo Control Tower

Wells Fargo Control Tower allows you to turn your cards on and off as well as restrict international use. It will also allow you to view digital wallets and turn digital card numbers stored in your devices on or off. Recurring payments may still be approved or processed even if you turn your card off.

When to use your credit card's pause button

Aside from misplacing your credit card there are many other situations where a pause button can come in handy.

To control spending: Credit cards are so convenient to use that some people overspend. By pressing pause on your credit card it could help you control any impulse purchases. This extra step might also make you think twice on whether or not you actually need to make that particular purchase.

Put your cards in safe mode: If you have cards that you don't use often or you only use for recurring monthly payments then you might want to pause them to prevent unauthorized use. This is an extra measure of security for those cards especially if you don't look at these accounts often enough to pick up on fraudulent charges.

Controlling the use of authorized card holders: Pressing pause can be a good way to prevent an authorized card holder from using his or her card. Just keep in mind that not all card issuers will freeze authorized cards holders when you freeze the primary card members' account.

Bottom line

It's great that most major card issuers now offer the option of temporarily pausing your credit card. Best of all this feature is completely free and typically there is no limit on the number of times you lock or unlock your account.

Of course if it becomes apparent that your card is never to be found again you'll want to call the card issuer to let them know. They'll then send you a new card but unfortunately it will come with a different card number.

It was late in the month when the furloughed Disneyland candy maker noticed a string of suspicious charges totaling $12222.23 on her state-issued Bank of America unemployment debit card. First the money was credited back to her account. Then it disappeared again setting in motion a chain of events that left her and her son homeless.

Behind the scenes California’s Employment Development Department and longtime debit card contractor Bank of America were scrambling to rein in rampant fraud. They froze some 350000 unemployment accounts around the time Hansen’s card was cut off.

The catch: while Hansen and other out-of-work Californians were left in financial purgatory unable to access unemployment money a Great Recession-era contract ensured that the state and the bank kept raking in millions of dollars in merchant fees whenever debit cards still in circulation were swiped. In September the EDD made $5.2 million on a debit card revenue sharing agreement with Bank of America — a sizable chunk of the $22.5 million the state raked in from March to October according to public records requested by CalMatters.

How much money did Bank of America make on its end of the deal? The state says it doesn’t know and the bank won’t say despite a contract requirement to report unemployment debit card fees and revenue each month. “EDD does not track BofA’s revenue” the agency told CalMatters. The bank declined to comment on its unemployment revenue and financial reporting.

“This is essentially a nifty little hidden kickback scheme” said Assemblymember Jim Patterson a Republican from Fresno. “This is becoming far too familiar. EDD just does not tell us what’s going on.”

Basic questions unanswered

In recent weeks California lawmakers rushing to introduce new unemployment reform bills have struggled to get basic questions answered about when and how jobless workers are paid — and who profits in the process.

Under Bank of America’s exclusive 2010 unemployment debit card contract with the state which was first detailed by CalMatters the Employment Development Department does not pay the bank directly for its financial services. Instead the two parties split revenue on merchant transaction fees when the cards are swiped and the bank charges limited consumer fees for things like ATM use or rush shipping on new debit cards. The contract specifies only that the state’s share of the fee revenue will “assist in offsetting program costs.”

The bank was supposed to report at least monthly on any fees earned and its average revenue according to the contract provided by the state. But when CalMatters asked for those reports the state said it did not have any records on bank fees. The agency said only that Bank of America made $37.8 million in transaction fees during 2013 — a figure disclosed as part of a bond estimate in a year when California paid out a sliver of the record $111 billion in unemployment benefits from March to December last year.

“I’m stunned that EDD doesn’t know” Patterson said “and I’m not sure that I believe that they don’t know.”

Bank of America said it suspended some consumer fees including rush shipping charges in the spring. The bank declined to comment on transaction fees. Faiz Ahmad managing director of transaction services for Bank of America told lawmakers last week that despite any money the bank may have made during the pandemic it “lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the contract” last year due to fraud and a need to hire more customer service workers to respond to complaints.

“Bank of America’s contract with EDD belongs to California’s taxpayers” said Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo a Democrat from Los Angeles. “Its contents are not secret. They belong to the public record.”

Lauren Saunders associate director of the National Consumer Law Center has studied unemployment debit card contracts including the one Bank of America has in California. She found that many states are “not paying any attention” to fees earned by banks — a lack of transparency that makes it hard to know how much unemployed workers are paying to use their benefit money — but that California’s revenue sharing agreement appears to be unique.

“Banks have to make money. They are selling a product” Saunders said. “What’s more unusual is the state making money. That’s because California is such a big market and there was so much interchange revenue that the bank was willing to share some with the state but that money should go back into making sure that people aren’t paying fees and to making sure that people get the money where they want to get it.”

A long fight

As fall turned to winter Hansen tried everything she could think of to get her missing unemployment money back. She spent hours on hold with the bank then called the state when she was told it was an identity verification issue. After waiting hours longer to get through to the state agency and often hung up on in the process she was told that she needed to call the bank. She called politicians and posted online and briefly saw the account reopened just long enough for another $672 to post to the account only to have the card frozen again.

By December it was too late. Hansen and her son slept in her Fiat or stayed with friends after they were forced to leave their two-bedroom rental in the Inland Empire to avoid eviction proceedings. There were no Christmas presents that month.

“Nobody helps. They blame it on each other” Hansen said. “I don’t know if they’re trying to make it to where I just don’t fight anymore but that’s $13000.”

Stories like Hansen’s where both the state and the bank have added to confusion make the prospect of unraveling California’s unemployment crisis more daunting. In Sacramento both Democrats and Republicans have proposed legislation to add a direct deposit option for claimants crack down on fraud and strengthen oversight. Bank of America’s current contract ends this summer.

In addition to refunding legitimate unemployment claimants caught up in the mess Patterson worries about tax bills and unsuspecting people asked to repay the government for benefits paid out to fraudsters. He said lawmakers are weighing requirements for the agency to act fast.

Meanwhile unemployment claimants accused Bank of America in a class-action lawsuit filed last month of putting them at risk of debit card fraud. The bank argues that the “vast majority” of fraud during the pandemic involved fraudulent unemployment applications that the state failed to catch rather than debit card fraud. While lawmakers and the state auditor press for more details on up to $31 billion in total fraud Saunders said it’s also possible that federal watchdogs like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could get involved if the bank fails to provide claim documentation or timely credits for fraud as required by law.

“If they’re found not to have complied” Saunders said “then the bank would be responsible to reimburse the consumers.”

With no full reopening in sight for Disneyland Hansen has taken to making boxes of toffee chocolate strawberries and peanut brittle in a friend’s kitchen for anyone who still has $10 or $20 to spend. She was mailed one paper unemployment check for $1000 in January — enough to pay for her son’s medication and the car they were living in — and the family recently moved into a rented room while she fights for the rest of the missing money.

Hansen says “There’s gotta be an easier way.”"

$3.99

It’s enough to buy a loaf of bread or two litres of milk but far from Ontario’s $14.25 minimum hourly wage.

And yet Uber Eats couriers working in the province say they’re earning as little as $3.99 per trip before tips months after the food delivery service implemented a new pay policy in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I’m making so little now that I’m thinking what is the point of even getting out there if I’m just going to make this much and it’s getting worse?” said Spencer Thompson a Toronto man who has been dropping off meals for Uber Eats since 2016.

He spent hours tabulating his 2020 pay and discovered what so many of his fellow couriers have long suspected: their wages are shrinking at a time when people are relying on food delivery more than ever before.

Thompson for example made about $10 per trip — sometimes involving multiple stops — in January 2020 but by December that had sank to as low as $3.99 per trip before tips.

The 60 per cent drop came in a year where Thompson worked in Toronto’s downtown core nearly every day of the week during the lunch and dinnertime windows where pay tends to be higher. He averaged two or three trips an hour.

Couriers like Thompson who are not formally employed by Uber but use its platform to pick up work worry the situation could worsen and they’ll be left with few other job alternatives as COVID-19 continues to spread unemployment remains high and companies increasingly see the benefits of the gig economy.

“We can’t let this go on and we can’t let this happen because if we do then the future will be all work like this” said Brice Sopher an Uber Eats courier and organizer with the Gig Workers United union who recalls making $9 or $10 per trip at the start of 2020 but now averages half that.

While couriers like Sopher and Thompson have long warned of the gig economy’s low pay no job security and lack of coverage for injuries and sicknesses their concerns became even more alarming after last June.

That was when Uber scrapped its earnings structure offering couriers fixed amounts based on pick ups drop offs distance and time and a series of bonuses for using the service during busy periods or in high-demand neighbourhoods. By taking advantages of bonuses and more rewarding orders Thompson would land as much as $12.15 per trip before tips at the start of 2020.

The new system Uber brought in lowered base fares — totals couriers are offered to deliver an order that fluctuate based on time distance pickup and drop-offs — and started including a trip supplement to account for lengthy wait times at restaurants or distances couriers travelled to get there.

At first the lowered base fares didn’t seem so bad because the company would offer high “boosts” which multiplied courier earnings if they delivered food in areas seeing a surge in demand said Sopher.

Under the new system some workers were even making a little more than before but slowly the boosts decreased he recalled.

“They did it little by little so that you wouldn’t notice” he alleged. ‘But you would have this sneaking suspicion.”

The changes made tips more important than ever before but customers are notoriously unreliable when it comes to tipping couriers said Thompson. Some will be generous while others avoid the extra handout altogether.

Uber whose Eats service was first piloted in Toronto in 2015 said in an email to The Canadian Press that it made changes to its wage structure including reducing base fares to better reflect each trip’s total time effort and distance and include travel to the restaurant.

The changes also involved upfront pricing which shows couriers the guaranteed net amount they’ll earn for a delivery before they accept the trip alongside other details like the restaurant name and drop off locations. This allows drivers to decline trips that they feel are priced too low.

A $3.99 trip the company said is extremely short in duration and one priced at that amount with two stops is quite rare but can happen.

“Uber Eats is committed to transparency in pricing: before a delivery person accepts a trip they are able to see the expected earnings for each trip. And as always 100% of tips go directly into their accounts” the company said in an email.

Sopher said he was disappointed with the changes because he and other couriers used to work 20 hours a week last spring and make $500 but now earns $300 over the same time span.

It’s not easy work either he said. Being on a bike for long periods can be exhausting and visiting so many homes and restaurants puts couriers at more risk of picking up COVID-19.

“I feel enraged because it’s really profiteering during a pandemic” he said.

“It’s what we’ve seen with a lot of major companies and with essential workers this pandemic really being told that they’re expendable workers. It’s pretty demoralizing.”

Sopher wants Uber to revert to pre-pandemic pay policies while Thompson prefers a guaranteed minimum trip rate.

Thompson recently enrolled in a web development course in hopes of finding a more stable income source that will allow him to pursue his love of acting on the side.

He loves being out on his bike and is determined not to stop fighting for fair pay but even he has a breaking point.

“I need to have something that can pay me much more per unit time and still give me time to do auditions … and I realized this is not a sustainable paid job” he said.

“I just need to survive.”

Wayne and Garth of ""Wayne's World"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" fame are back along with Cardi B for an Uber Eats Super Bowl commercial. The ad which is now on YouTube shows Wayne and Garth (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) in Wayne's basement doing their cable access show from Aurora Ill.

""As a local access show we want everyone to support local restaurants"" Wayne says.

""But we'd never manipulate you the way all these commercials do"" Garth says as subliminal words ""eat"" and ""local"" flash on the screen.

Then there are repeated attempts to get the message out including having baby versions of Wayne and Garth dressed in shirts that say ""eat local.""

When Wayne says they would ""never shamelessly rely on a celebrity cameo"" here comes Cardi B. The commercial then shows shots of Wayne and Garth dressed like Cardi and vice-versa.

Uber Eats says its ""Eat Local"" campaign is a $20 million effort to support its business partners over the next six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now that the 650-pound $1 million rocket named the Stardust 1.0 has passed its first real test bluShift hopes to focus on smaller-scale launches with limited payloads. CEO Sascha Deri said that while companies like SpaceX could be likened to freight trains he wants to see bluShift become “the Uber of space.” As the company serves its commercial clients students and researchers with more successful smaller payload launches it moves closer to its long-term objective of becoming the first to launch a spacecraft to Alpha Centauri Proxima — the nearest star system.

The company’s success may also pave the way for the Loring Commerce Centre to become a regular launch site for small rockets. bluShfit an affiliate member of the Maine Space Grant Consortium hopes the launch will help establish Loring and Maine as a whole as a viable location for the aerospace industry.

“We’ve put Limestone on the world map” Seth Lockman bluShift communications director said. “We’re really excited to have played a part in raising awareness for the SpacePort.”

The SpacePort Maine project began in 2017 through the Maine Space Grant Consortium’s efforts to utilize the state’s existing Cold War infrastructure for aerospace activity. Its goal is for small rocket launches either from planes or launch pads that would reach sub orbit and polar low-Earth orbit to take place on sites such as the Loring Commerce Centre and Brunswick Landing — both former military bases.

The bluShift team will thoroughly inspect the rocket’s condition to determine whether it can fly again although the skin and fins of the rocket appear to be in great condition Lockman said. The review could be done as soon as Feb. 12 Deri said.

The rocket hit nominal altitude and speed and landed in a nominal zone during flight but the main parachute deployed “just a hair early” Lockman said.

Most of the company’s initial objectives have been achieved — mainly the power of their bio-derived fuel in flight and the use of rockets for smaller payloads he said.

The company’s next step will be to open up to a round of investment and raise money to build a new engine and create the Stardust 2.0.

“The engine in the Stardust [1.0] is highly experimental” he said. “It’s much thicker than a rocket engine would be. There’s steel in there and that’s all to withstand the weather. There are all kinds of things a test motor needs that would be much more than an off the assembly line flight motor.”

He said they want the Stardust 2.0 to go faster and to be able to reach the Karman line — the boundary between the earth’s atmosphere and outer space.

bluShift’s exact path from here depends on the final inspection of the Stardust 1.0.

“But needless to say we can’t stop now” Lockman said. “There will be another launch many more launches and we plan to go higher each time until we hit our service ceiling. Things are going to keep getting bigger faster and better or like the Olympic motto — Citius Altius Fortius [faster higher stronger].”

The Jan. 31 launch came after numerous delays for additional testing and a postponement due to excessive cloud cover. On launch day the early morning temperatures of about 14 degrees below zero affected the equipment causing additional delays. And two other launch attempts just before noon failed because the main valve was under-pressurized in one case and the ignition fluid ran out in the other.

The tension in the air was palpable when the rocket sat motionless on the launch tower for a few moments at the end of the countdown during the third attempt around 3 p.m.

And then the Brunswick-based startup made world history. The 20-foot rocket took to the skies in what appeared to be a flawless launch.

Lockman was running a livestream and audio mixer at the time and said it resulted in a moment of overwhelming catharsis amongst the crew.

“I had total tunnel vision because I was trying to not only do the livestream but also work out some technical issues” he said.

As the launch started he turned down the engineers’ mic and turned his mic up but the adjustments didn’t register in time. Lockman’s mic remained muted and the engineers’ mic stayed on. When the rocket cleared the tower one of the engineers shouted an expletive unable to control his excitement at witnessing the culmination of more than six years of research and development materialize in the skies above.

“That went out to 4000 people across the world” Lockman said. “Everyone was going nuts. It was this beautiful candid moment. Everybody was just hooting and hollering.”

Life for bluShift has been a madhouse since August with the team preparing to show their new proprietary fuel to the world Lockman said. But since the launch they’ve had a chance to rest.

“[Deri] gave the engineers a couple days off which they definitely deserved” Lockman said.

Lockman said he finally reached the bottom of his inbox on Wednesday afternoon three days after the launch. The event put an enormous spotlight not only on bluShift but on Limestone as well.

The launch was covered by international news outlets including the Associated Press and BBC News.

“I couldn’t believe it when I got an email in my inbox from a BBC reporter” he said. “I’ve watched read and listened to all three of their reports and I still can’t believe that it’s happened. BBC is the biggest there is. I feel like I’ve peaked already.”

The crew was especially excited to be covered by space.com.

“Our engineers are now reading about themselves and our mission and company at space.com which is usually where we go to read about other people” he said. “It’s taking a lot of recalibrating to adjust.”

Lockman said much of the credit for Stardust 1.0’s success goes to senior mechanical engineer Luke Saindon and lead test engineer Brook Halvorson who built much of the rocket.

“It’s a real testament not only to Sascha’s vision but to the team he assembled and what they can do and I think we’re just seeing the start of what Maine talent can do. This is just the beginning of what bluShift and what Maine can do” Lockman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRocmlsbGlzdC5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFyYnVja3MtdWJlci1lYXRzLXZhbGVudGluZXMtZGF5LTIwMjEtZGVhbHMtZGlzY291bnRz0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhyaWxsaXN0LmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL25ld3Mvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXViZXItZWF0cy12YWxlbnRpbmVzLWRheS0yMDIxLWRlYWxzLWRpc2NvdW50cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks & Uber Eats Are Offering Sweet Deals for Valentine's Day,"It wouldn't be Valentine's Day without receiving a little corporate love and this time it's a Starbucks and Uber Eats collaboration that'll give your wallet a rest.

The company announced the Ross will serve as the company’s diversity and inclusion adviser a “formalized role to provide counsel inspiration and drive accountability” according to the official press release.

“I look forward to formalizing an already existing dialogue and partnership around diversity and inclusion with Mary Dillon and the Ulta Beauty team” said Ross. “This work requires commitment and accountability from Ulta Beauty to ensure measurable goals are achieved. I am hopeful and optimistic our work together will create foundational change.”

Ulta said that in her role Ross “will provide counsel and insight and drive accountability to Ulta Beauty with a specific focus on BIPOC brand development diverse leadership development and supplier diversity.”

Mary Dillon CEO said Ulta Beauty “has a responsibility to inspire positive change and drive greater diversity inclusivity and equity” said “We are deeply committed to leading purposefully with and for underrepresented voices across retail and beauty on our D&I journey.”

Ulta has outlined their comprehensive plan and introduced a number of actions in their campaign to prioritize diversity and inclusion.

The brand is initiating an advertising campaign intended to highlight and appreciate Black individuals in the beauty space and include various Black women and executives such as Sundial CEO Cara Sabin Briogeo founder Nancy Twine and Carol’s Daughter founder Lisa Price according to WWD.

The company also proclaimed a commitment to Black-owned brands and has resolved to work directly with Black business in order to help their brands thrive. The retailer said it plans to double the amount of Black-owned brands in its collection by the end of 2021.

Ulta said it will devote more than $4 million supporting the marketing of Black-owned brands within the company’s existing collection while around $20 million will be distributed to media investments among widespread multi-cultural platforms to create “more personal connections” with Black LatinX and other communities.

The beauty vendor is also investing a $2 million into regular inclusivity training for its workforce in addition to its existing Race Matters Leadership Training.

“Authenticity as an inclusive brand with welcoming experiences for all and an approachable assortment are tenets of how we champion diversity at Ulta Beauty” Dillon said. “We have mapped these commitments to impact every facet of our work. We look forward to sharing more as we continue on this journey with steadfast commitment from our teams and our newly established advisor Tracee Ellis Ross who brings passion experience and perspective to this important work.”

Meanwhile Ross is releasing more beauty products of her own. A part of her Pattern hair-care brand the actress is promoting a Treatment Mask & Scalp Serum that she said “is inspired by ancestral home remedies passed down from generation to generation.”

“How I care for my hair is genuinely a part of how I actively love myself” she told BET. “After my teen years and early 20s and having a contentious relationship with my hair and constantly wishing that it was something other than it was I realized that when I started to meet it where it was and love it as is and learn how to care for it was one of the ways I started caring for and loving my authentic self.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9wcmluY2UtZWR3YXJkLWlzbGFuZC9wZWktZXllcy1jb3NtZXRpY3MtYmVhdXR5LWNvdmlkLW1hc2tzLTEuNTg5OTAyNNIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS41ODk5MDI0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The eyes have it: Above-the-mask makeup sees pandemic surge,"Over the past 11 months of mask-wearing and smizing (that's smiling with your eyes) beauty counters and estheticians have seen an increased demand for all things eye-enhancing.

In times of crisis it's been said that consumers will turn to lipstick as a retail indulgence to give their mood and mental health a boost. COVID-19 may have turned this ""lipstick index"" on its head since masks are covering people's mouths.

""We have certainly seen an increase in our client's interest in eye-enhancing services"" said Karen Murphy owner of Pure Spa in Charlottetown.

Services such as lash extensions where synthetic lashes are applied to your natural lashes to give a longer fuller look have been popular. So have lash lift and tinting brow shaping and brow henna applications.

Murphy said facials and skin care requests have been surging even more. Many people are experiencing skin breakouts acne blemishes and irritation from wearing masks all day in what some call ""maskne.""

Megan Robertson of Dieppe N.B. is one of a dozen Shoppers Drug Mart beauty pros across Canada.

""Mascara is probably the number-one thing that we're selling the most of"" Robertson told CBC News though Shoppers never gives out specific sales numbers. People have been adding extra layers of mascara to emphasize lashes in a time of masks she said.

Robertson said people are still buying lipstick but they are moving toward long-wearing lip colour as well as smudge-proof eye and face cosmetics.

For the eyes her customers are experimenting with different eyeshadow textures bolder colours shimmer and liquid liner. ""Usually they're just trying to amp up what they've been doing.""

Face and body care and nail care products have also been hugely popular at Shoppers locations Robertson said as people across the country rely on self-care when salons have to shut down.

Eyes are 'focus feature'

The uptick in demand for skin care and eye-enhancing services is being seen by estheticians CBC News spoke with across Prince Edward Island where a light COVID-19 caseload has allowed most businesses to stay open with public health precautions in place.

Jillian DesRoches is an esthetician at Essential Time salon in Summerside and also does foot care.

""Now that that's pretty much all you see is eyebrows and eyes people want that to be the focus feature on their face.""

Now that that's pretty much all you see is eyebrows and eyes people want that to be the focus feature. - Jillian DesRoches

Eyelash tinting is popular for some because the heat from breathing into a mask can cause mascara to ""melt"" off your eyes DesRoches said. If your eyelashes are tinted she said you don't need to wear mascara.

She was already busy doing lashes and brows she said because those services had been trending upward anyway. But she said her regular customers are booking more frequent appointments after four weeks instead of six.

Part of the increased demand the estheticians agree is that customers are missing close human interaction and touch as pandemic restrictions require physical distancing.

""People are even happy to come in and have their lip waxed!"" DesRoches said with a chuckle.

Skin care services such as facials are in high demand during the pandemic says Pure Spa owner Karen Murphy. (LaVie In Pictures)

She had been worried people who aren't able to travel south this year would skip getting a pedicure or waxing but said that hasn't been the case.

""They're still doing it they're taking care of themselves.""

Jenefer Reynolds who owns About Face Cosmetics in Charlottetown said demand for facials soared when the initial lockdowns started to ease last summer: ""Just 'Scrape off these COVID layers please.'""

As well as eyelash lifting and tinting Reynolds has seen a higher demand for brow shaping tinting and microblading (tiny tattoo strokes that fill in light-coloured sparse or overplucked eyebrows). She estimates eye services have been 20 to 25 per cent more popular in the past year at her business.

She added: ""It's so trivial I know but when you look in the mirror and you like what you see it affects your whole being.""

That's pretty much what United Parcel Service Inc. is doing to squeeze two more decades of life from dozens of aging Airbus freighters by revamping their cockpit computers. It's all part of new Chief Executive Officer Carol Tome's strategy to ""sweat the assets"" by increasing efficiency while reducing investment.

The 52 Airbus A300-600 jets were purchased beginning in 2000 and the flight computer has such limited memory that it can't store full navigational maps forcing UPS to divide the U.S. into five regions to hold the information. Each update takes 45 minutes and has to be done each time a plan needs to fly to a different area.

""This is a huge productivity improvement for us"" said Ed Walton director of engineering for UPS's aircraft maintenance unit. ""We had a 1970s-generation flight management system that only had 200K of memory. It's kind of shocking that we were able to stretch it out this long.""

The upgrades use a Honeywell International Inc. system and are a less-expensive alternative to purchasing replacement cargo jets. One drawback is that keeping old planes in service means burning more fuel. But Tome is under pressure to bolster profit margins and reduce capital spending which will drop to $4 billion this year from $5.6 billion last year and more than $6 billion in each of the previous two years as UPS invested heavily to boost efficiency.

UPS declined to detail how much it's spending or saving on the avionic overhauls. The A300 is no longer in production but a new Boeing 767 Freighter a slightly larger plane that UPS has bought recently has a market value of $80.8 million according to aviation consulting firm Avitas.

The new Honeywell system will hold worldwide navigational maps and take about two minutes for updates. It also will have larger displays than the old screens and tools such as a central maintenance system and improved weather radar that enables pilots to avoid storms.

The Atlanta-based courier plans to purchase 11 new aircraft this year down from 16 in 2020 as air-cargo volume surges during the pandemic because of growth in online retail and covid-19 vaccine distribution. Couriers are also hauling some freight that would have been carried by passenger jets had the pandemic not forced airlines to slash their schedules.

Airbus completed the upgrade and flight testing of the first A300. UPS is looking to choose two companies to do the modifications which take about three weeks on the remaining 51 aircraft. The company expects to have them all retrofitted and flying by next year.

For Honeywell the contract is its first complete avionics replacement on a cargo plane said Mike Madsen chief executive officer of the company's aerospace unit. Doing such work for freight companies is a huge potential market.

""Most of them operate the older aircraft because it's economically attractive"" Madsen said. ""There are easily a thousand aircraft that could take advantage of this system.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQudXBzLmNvbS91cy9lbi9vdXItaW1wYWN0L2NvbW11bml0eS9lcXVpdHktYW5kLWVjb25vbWljLWVtcG93ZXJtZW50L3doZXJlLXdpbGwtd2UtZmluZC10b21vcnJvdy1zLWxlYWRlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where will we find tomorrow’s leaders,"Thirty years ago Malcolm Berkley made a decision that forever changed his life. As he considered his college options the Harlem-based teenager was drawn to the legacy of prominent Morehouse College graduates including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Howard Thurman Samuel L. Jackson and Julian Bond.

But what Malcolm found most inspiring was the campus of nearly 2000 students filled with young Black men focused on excellence just like him. For the future English major the decision was clear.

Today Malcolm is president of media investor and crisis communications for UPS one of the thousands of successful graduates shaped by Morehouse College.

“My experience at Morehouse not only helped prepare me for my professional career it helped prepare me for life” Malcolm said. “The confidence perspective and brotherhood I found at Morehouse are among the strengths I draw upon every day.”

As the next generation of leaders emerges graduates of HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities) are shaping the landscape through groundbreaking work and achievements in business government social and civic impact and the arts.

The next generation of leaders

HBCUs were established to serve the educational needs of Black Americans denied admission to traditionally white institutions. While access to colleges and universities has widened HBCUs are still providing a needed avenue to higher education for many.

“I was so excited when my daughter chose to continue the legacy of women in our family and attend Spelman College” Malcolm said. “She’s now walking the same hallways and sitting in the same classrooms once occupied by Spelman alumnae who are making history in science and politics leading companies and changing the world.”

HBCUs offer a close connection to a strong support network of students faculty professors and alumni. This culture extends into best practices to develop the next wave of successful business leaders – allowing diverse thought and experiences to flourish leading to new and innovative solutions.

A lifelong commitment

Companies also have the ability to support the schools through partnerships and mentoring. In Malcolm’s previous role as vice president of The UPS Foundation he helped drive efforts to support lifelong preparation for success. The UPS Foundation‘s support for HBCUs includes The UPS Community Scholars Program a scholarship and mentoring program with Morehouse College Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University; the INROADS internship program; scholarships through United Negro College Fund; and mentoring through the 100 Black Men of America.

With more than 100 HBCUs throughout the U.S. all navigating through the impact of the pandemic the need for support is greater than ever.

Recently UPS provided Morehouse College freshmen Microsoft Surface® Pro tablets needed for online learning — a necessity in the age of COVID-19.

“The Morehouse/UPS/Microsoft Surface Pro collaboration was particularly special to me” Malcolm said. “When I entered Morehouse I couldn’t afford to purchase my own technology. I know what this gift means to those young men.”

Black History Month serves as a reminder of the importance of developing the next generation of diverse leaders who will make our world more resilient and responsive to the needs of all. Supporting HBCUs and the students who bring their hopes and aspirations to their classrooms (virtual or otherwise) is a critical step in that journey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qdW5reWFyZC1nZW0tMTk5Ny1oeXVuZGFpLWFjY2VudC0yMDAwMDA2ODQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Junkyard Gem: 1997 Hyundai Accent GT,"

One of the rarest of all Accents is the GT version available during its early years of production and that's what I've found for today's Junkyard Gem in Colorado.

Eventually a dual-overhead-cam engine became standard on the Accent but in 1997 you had to buy the GT to get that bit of factory-hot-rod technology.

Pretty much the same thing as an Acura Integra GS-R but at about half the price ($21150 versus $10614 or $34626 and $17377 today).

Actually that '97 GS-R had 170 horsepower and the '97 Accent GT had 105 horsepower but that was still better than the 92-horse engine in the regular Accent that year.

This car has the base 5-speed manual transmission which would have made it reasonably fun to drive.

The Accent GT also got a stiffer suspension and this exquisitely 1990s seat upholstery.

225781 miles is pretty good for a car that probably didn't get handled with kid gloves.

By the end its final owner was just dumping cigarette butts and orange peels on the floor.

The duct-tape residue sheet-metal screws and crudely installed aftermarket radio indicate that numerous audio systems lived in this dash.

The Tiburon took over from the Accent GT as Hyundai's sporty car but we can remember this one as the descendant of the Scoupe.

The announcement follows another $100 million+ investment the startup secured from Google AlphaWave and Microsoft in December last year. That tranche of investment also part of Series H had turned Dailyhunt into a unicorn (giving it a valuation of $1 billion or higher). The startup has to-date raised about $430 million.

Dailyhunt co-run by Virendra Gupta and former Facebook India head Umang Bedi is a popular news and entertainment app that serves more than 285 million users each day in 14 local languages in India. Its reach in India the world’s second largest internet market would explain why Twitter last month partnered with the Indian firm to bring Moments to Dailyhunt.

VerSe Innovation expanded to short form videos last year with Josh after New Delhi banned TikTok and created a theoretical void for snacking content in the country. Scores of large giants and startups — including MX Player and ShareChat — have attempted to try their hand at short form videos in the recent quarters.

Facebook launched Instagram Reels in India last year and YouTube launched Shorts which is already garnering over 3.5 billion daily views in India it said last month. (With over 450 million users in India YouTube is closing in on WhatsApp’s market lead in India.)

Josh appears to have emerged as one of the leading players: The startup says Josh has amassed over 85 million monthly active users — 40 million of whom check the app each day — and the app sees more than 1.5 billion video plays everyday.

Now the startup says it is exploring expansion into more categories and like with Dailyhunt and Josh cater users in smaller cities and towns and eventually replicate this model in international markets.

India’s internet economy is expected to be worth $639 billion by 2030 analysts at Citi wrote in a report to clients late last month. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated digital adoption and users’ appetite to transact online a report from analysts at UBS said last week.

“Josh represents a confluence of India’s top 200+ best creators the 10 biggest music labels 15+ million UGC creators best in class content creation tools the hottest entertainment formats and formidable user demographics. Josh has been consistently rated as the leading Indian short-video app in India on the Play store” the startup said in a statement.

The death of Floyd a Black man killed by a white police officer in May 2020 prompted thousands to peacefully protest across the city. But violence soon erupted which police say began with a masked man seen in a viral video with an umbrella and smashing windows of an auto-parts store in south Minneapolis. The AutoZone store was the first among dozens of buildings across the city set on fire in the days following.

The search warrant compelled Google to provide police with the account data on anyone who was “within the geographical region” of the AutoZone store when the violence began on May 27 two days after Floyd’s death.

These so-called geofence warrants — or reverse-location warrants — are frequently directed at Google in large part because the search and advertising giant collects and stores vast databases of geolocation data on billions of account holders who have “location history” turned on. Geofence warrants allow police to cast a digital dragnet over a crime scene and ask tech companies for records on anyone who entered a geographic area at a particular time. But critics say these warrants are unconstitutional as they also gather the account information on innocent passers-by.

TechCrunch learned of the search warrant from Minneapolis resident Said Abdullahi who received an email from Google stating that his account information was subject to the warrant and would be given to the police.

But Abdullahi said he had no part in the violence and was only in the area to video the protests when the violence began at the AutoZone store.

The warrant said police sought “anonymized” account data from Google on any phone or device that was close to the AutoZone store and the parking lot between 5:20pm and 5:40pm (CST) on May 27 where dozens of the people in the area had gathered.

When reached Minneapolis police spokesperson John Elder citing an ongoing investigation would not answer specific questions about the warrant including for what reason the warrant was issued.

According to a police affidavit police said the protests had been relatively peaceful until the afternoon of May 27 when a masked umbrella-wielding man began smashing the windows of the AutoZone store located across the street from a Minneapolis police precinct where hundreds of protesters had gathered. Several videos show protesters confronting the masked man.

Police said they spent significant resources on trying to identify the so-called “Umbrella Man” who they say was the catalyst for widespread violence across the city.

“This was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the city” the affidavit read. At least two people were killed in the unrest. (Erika Christensen a Minneapolis police investigator who filed the affidavit was not made available for an interview.)

Police accuse the Umbrella Man of creating an “atmosphere of hostility and tension” whose sole aim was to “incite violence.” (TechCrunch is not linking to the affidavit as the police would not say if the suspect had been charged with a crime.) The affidavit also links the suspect to a white supremacist group called the Aryan Cowboys and to an incident weeks later where a Muslim woman was harassed.

Multiple videos of the protests around the time listed on the warrant appear to line up with the window-smashing incident. Other videos of the scene at the time of the warrant show hundreds of other people in the vicinity. Police were positioned on rooftops and used tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowds.

Law enforcement across the U.S. are increasingly relying on geofence warrants to solve crimes where a suspect is not known. Police have defended the use of these warrants because they can help identify potential suspects who entered a certain geographic region where a crime was committed. The warrants typically ask for “anonymized information” but allow police to go back and narrow their requests on potential suspects of interest.

When allowed by law Google notifies account holders of when law enforcement demands access to the user’s data. According to a court filing in 2019 Google said the number of geofence warrants it received went up by 1500% between 2017 and 2018 and more than 500% between 2018 and 2019 but has yet to provide a specific number of warrants

Google reportedly received over 180 geofence warrants in a single week in 2019. When asked about more recent figures a Google spokesperson declined to comment on the record.

Civil liberties groups have criticized the use of dragnet search warrants. The American Civil Liberties Union said that geofence warrants “circumvent constitutional checks on police surveillance.” One district court in Virginia said geofence warrants violated the constitution because the majority of individuals whose data is collected will have “nothing whatsoever” to do with the crimes under investigation.

Reports in the past year have implicated people whose only connection to a crime is simply being nearby.

NBC News reported the case of one Gainesville Fla. resident who was told by Google that his account information would be given to police investigating a burglary. But the resident was able to prove that he had no connection to the burglary thanks to an app on his phone that tracked his activity.

In 2019 Google gave federal agents investigating several arson attacks in Milwaukee Wis. close to 1500 user records in response to geofence warrant thought to be one of the largest grabs of account data to date.

But lawmakers are beginning to push back. New York state lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would if passed ban geofence warrants across the state citing the risk of police targeting protesters. Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) grilled Google chief executive Sundar Pichai at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing last year. “People would be terrified to know that law enforcement could grab general warrants and get everyone’s information everywhere” said Armstrong.

Abdullahi told TechCrunch that he had several videos documenting the protests on the day and that he has retained a lawyer to try to prevent Google from giving his account information to Minneapolis police.

“Police assumed everybody in that area that day is guilty” he said. “If one person did something criminal [the police] should not go after the whole block of people” he said.

The country spends more on health care compared to the size of its economy than other wealthy nations according to CNBC. Meanwhile its medical services remain the same as other nations that charge substantially less.

Countries with the most affordable health care systems such as Malaysia and Costa Rica control how much pharmaceuticals and hospitals can charge for life-saving procedures. But the health care system in the U.S. allows for individual patients to pay substantially higher prices for prescription drugs than the global average and leaves those who can’t afford life-saving medical procedures in debt or without necessary hospital visits altogether. In the wealthiest nation in the world why should cost be a barrier for basic health care?

In the middle of the pandemic the cost of health care and medical services is a barrier that must be confronted through universal health care the global standard for health insurance. Individual Americans face costs that residents in other nations do not and millions of Americans are left without access to basic health care.

In the U.S. proper health care is a privilege not a right. This has been exemplified throughout the pandemic. For example students already attending an in-person semester at SU have access to health services such as COVID-19 testing. Although students paid an increased tuition for the 2020-21 academic year they didn’t have to pay out of pocket for COVID-19 testing.

Those who attend school in person during the height of a pandemic face a sharply different scenario than those mere miles away. Residents of the city of Syracuse face limited access to the health services within their city. Additionally low-income residents in Syracuse are among those disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

However the exclusivity of basic health care is not limited to Syracuse. American health care is expensive compared to other nations. When surveyed in 2016 26% of Americans reported that they were unable to afford their medical bills. Lutchmie Narine chair and graduate director of public health in SU’s Falk College described costs related to private insurance as “prohibitive to people with lower incomes.”

This makes medical procedures exclusive to those who can afford them. In the case of unforeseen medical expenses insurance does not always cover emergency visits. Millions can’t afford medical coverage completely.

The federal government has addressed the expensive cost of health care in the past. Currently the Affordable Care Act insures 39 million people. However the federal control of health insurance costs under the act made health insurance more accessible but not more affordable for treatments. In addressing this the federal government is limited in its options for controlling costs: most citizens are privately insured.

This is different from universal health care. For example universal health care in Denmark allows for direct budget legislation to determine health care costs. Universal health care in the Netherlands allows for the government to directly address private insurers medical providers and the public need for affordability. This is why a heart bypass surgery costs $15742 in the Netherlands and $75345 in the U.S. Clearly the high cost is not necessary.

As of 2018 health care spending in the U.S. accounted for 17.7% of its total gross domestic product. In Malaysia a nation with some of the top health care systems in the world health care spending accounted for 3.76% of their total GDP. This means if health-related expenses were better managed less out-of-pocket costs would occur for patients and money could be spent elsewhere in the economy. To provide a more affordable health care system the U.S. should expand federal programs such as the ACA.

Universal health care works to lower medical costs. Across the globe universal health care has allowed for residents to become insured and pay less in out-of-pocket medical bills. This means universal health care can address financial inequities faced within a nation. In turn the investment in universal health care can work to address the health care gap faced in Syracuse and across the nation.

Photo by VnExpress/Duc Hung.

Vietnam has made considerable progress in providing universal healthcare by focusing on the poor and vulnerable according to U.S. think tank Brookings Institution.

In an article on its website Wednesday a group of researchers from Duke University in the U.S. Duke Kunshan University in China and the Health Strategy and Policy Institute in Vietnam said Vietnam has made sizable gains towards providing equitable universal healthcare by focusing on the most disadvantaged when growing its health insurance scheme.

Citing their own study published on BioMed Central a U.K.-based open access scientific journal last November the researchers said Vietnam incrementally increased enrollment in compulsory health insurance and provides comprehensive and universal service packages for all of them with priority given to poor and vulnerable populations.

Such an approach means the most vulnerable populations are stabilized first while the uninsured are assumed to already have some form of financial capacity making the approach much more equitable for all they added.

As a result the country has reduced catastrophic health expenditure defined as when health spending exceeds 40 percent of non-subsistence spending for a household and the gap between urban and rural populations the study said.

The study which collected data through interviews with policy makers bureaucrats and health insurance scholars and statistics from national reports between June 2017 and January 2018 also said Vietnam's health service delivery while it includes both public and private systems mainly relies on a vast network of public healthcare providers from the commune to central levels to deliver health services to everyone but especially those with insurance.

The country is among the highest scorers in essential health services coverage in WHO's Universal Health Coverage Index the study said.

But a significant increase in health expenditure driven by a rapidly aging population and an increased burden of noncommunicable diseases poses a challenge.

The country also needs to ensure the sustainability of health insurance schemes and design an effective cross-subsidization mechanism according to the study.

To tackle some of these problems Vietnam has been working to increase coverage thereby increasing the financial pooled funding and hopefully decreasing the government’s total health expenditure it said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2ZlYi82L2RvY3VtZW50cy1kZXRhaWwtdXNlLW9mLXNlZGF0aXZlLWF0LXlvdXRoLWZhY2lsaXRpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Documents detail use of sedative at youth facilities in Utah,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - When social workers in Oregon’s foster care system sent a 14-year-old to Utah they were trying to find a place that could help. But instead the girl who has an intellectual and developmental disability endured an increasingly difficult stay at Provo Canyon School.

Over roughly three months employees pinned down her arms and legs nearly 30 times some restraints lasting as long as a half-hour the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Fellow students beat her up at least four times including once when she was punched in the face while she was asleep.

Staff injected the girl with sedatives 17 times - a number so alarming that child welfare officials from Oregon flew in to investigate. Those officials got her on a plane and took her back to Oregon in March 2019.

“The whole idea of sending her to Provo Canyon School was supposed to be that her needs were so great that this was the only place that could help her” said Oregon state Sen. Sara Gelser who has investigated allegations of abuse at youth facilities. “And what they sent back to us was a broken injured frightened child with more trauma than she went there with.”

Gelser shared with The Salt Lake Tribune heavily redacted public documents outlining this girl’s stay in Utah. They don’t reveal who she is but they do offer a look at her treatment via emails exchanged between Oregon child welfare workers and Provo Canyon School contracts for her stay and documentation of every time she was restrained or put into seclusion.

The records show troubling treatment methods that would either be outlawed or severely curtailed under a legislative proposal championed by a Utah Republican who said the largely for-profit industry needs more government oversight.

Provo Canyon School said it’s open to these new regulations. It is one of Utah’s oldest youth residential treatment facilities and can house more than 250 kids at a time between its two campuses in Provo and Springville. It’s owned by the for-profit company Universal Health Services one of the largest hospital providers in the nation.

The facility has faced scrutiny in the past year over accusations of poor and abusive treatment of kids. The highest-profile account comes from celebrity Paris Hilton who said she was abused at the school in the 1990s.

Others have come forward since and there’s a pattern to the stories these former residents tell. They often involve being physically held down being left in seclusion rooms for hours and being overmedicated or sedated.

If the girl had remained in Oregon she never would have been injected with sedatives.

That type of restraint is outlawed there and in a number of other states - but it is permitted in Utah where the troubled-teen industry has thrived under light regulations. Almost 100 facilities dot the state and in the past five years nearly 12000 children have come through their doors.

Some of the youths are sent by their parents while others are ordered into treatment by a judge after committing a crime. Then there are children in foster care like the 14-year-old from Oregon who are brought here because no place in their home state will take them.

Gelser was a driving force to get Oregon officials to bring all of their foster children home in 2020 cutting ties to treatment centers in Utah and elsewhere. Her campaign began after Oregon Public Media published a report about the number of foster children who were being sent to other states. Gelser responded by holding legislative hearings demanding child welfare officials explain why their kids were receiving treatment in places like Red Rock Canyon School a Utah center where a riot had broken out and violence had been escalating.

She also began filing public records requests for information about the Oregon kids sent elsewhere. That’s how she received the documents about the 14-year-old at Provo Canyon School. She said in a recent interview that she was “shocked and heartbroken” when she read the hundreds of pages.

“We have worked so hard just as a Legislature and a community to really try to wrap supports and protections around kids” she said. “And the idea that just a plane ride can strip those rights and protections from them is incredibly frustrating.”

Change could be coming to Utah driven by a partnership between two unlikely allies: Gelser a liberal Democrat from Corvallis and Utah Sen. Mike McKell a conservative Republican from Spanish Fork.

McKell has sponsored legislation that would limit the use of restraints and isolation rooms at Utah youth treatment centers. It would also ban the sedatives referred to as chemical restraints unless a facility gets special permission from state regulators.

It’s the first time Utah lawmakers will consider new regulations on youth residential treatment facilities in the past 15 years.

When Oregon officials arrived at Provo Canyon School in February 2019 the 14-year-old girl told them she was getting into fights and was often getting in trouble.

Staff would hold her down she told them and sometimes the adults bit her or pulled her hair. Records show there were times when staff held her down three times in a single day and often gave her a shot of Haldol an antipsychotic.

“Typically in a restraint (the girl) stated she received ‘booty juice’ which she described as a liquid that makes someone fall asleep and calms you down” an Oregon worker later wrote in a report. “After receiving booty juice (she) would then spend time in the calming room staff would shut the door and hold the door while they stand there.”

The public records show the girl was frequently restrained for trying to intervene when her peers were being held down by staff. Sometimes she acted out at the encouragement of her classmates.

“Peers have always been one of her biggest struggles” a Provo Canyon School worker wrote in an email to the girl’s social worker. “She wants friends so badly but has never had one.”

The records show the girl’s social worker became worried in December 2018 about the medication Provo Canyon School was giving her and reached out to a state-contracted nurse for advice. That nurse expressed concern about Haldol saying it could have irreversible side effects in children like long-term muscle spasms or “tics.”

By February 2019 Oregon child welfare workers were sounding the alarm again.

“For the last two months or so they have been using medical restraints at least once a week on top of physical restraints” an email reads. “These medical restraints are the use of an intramuscular injection.”

Oregon workers visited the Utah campus later that month and pulled the girl from the school a few weeks after that when they located an Oregon facility that agreed to take her.

In a statement Provo Canyon School administrators said they couldn’t comment on an individual’s treatment but they did address the use of chemical restraints and solitary confinement.

The administrators said they “eliminated the use of seclusion or isolation some time ago.” The records however show that Provo Canyon was using seclusion as recently as 2019 when the 14-year-old girl’s paperwork was labeled as “Seclusion/Restraint Order.” There were nine times when staff wrote the girl had been secluded in a three-month period because they felt she was a safety risk.

Tim Marshall an administrator at the school said in a follow-up email that Provo Canyon School started to phase out seclusion in 2018 and eliminated its use at its Provo campus in June 2019 and in Springville where the Oregon girl stayed in February 2020.

“We have currently been free of the use of seclusion at either site for the past 12 months” he wrote.

Provo Canyon School further said its physicians do not prescribe medication as a means of discipline.

“The infrequent use of medications to assist a patient in gaining control is within the standard of care or the requirements in Utah code” the center said. “We do not use medication to sedate render a patient immobile or restrict them in their ability to continue to engage actively in their care.”

Chemical restraints in these care facilities are prohibited not just in Oregon but also in Colorado Illinois Michigan and Montana. Some states like California and Arizona allow it but require facilities to document each time they are used. Others like Wisconsin allow it only if the Department of Children and Families approves it.

Utah law is silent on the use of chemical restraints and there’s no reporting requirements unless a child is injured. The state can investigate if it believes chemical restraints are being abused. It does require intermediate secure care facilities like Provo Canyon School to have a plan for “the use of involuntary medicine” but doesn’t mandate anything further.

This means it’s impossible to know how frequently this sort of sedation is used on kids at youth facilities in Utah.

In a review of laws in 14 states that have a significant number of youth residential treatment centers Utah is one of three that has no clear written policy for chemical restraints on children. The others are North Carolina and Connecticut.

There’s no central database that shows how many youth treatment centers are operating throughout the country but the director of the National Association of Therapeutic School and Programs said Utah likely has the most. About 30% of the association’s members are based in Utah.

McKell said he wants to limit the use of sedatives like Haldol adding that he’s heard of some scenarios when it has “clearly been overused.”

“If we pass this legislation and if we see chemical restraints are (still) being used on a regular basis we will be back to the Legislature to rein that in” he said. “There may be an appropriate place for chemical restraint but it better be extremely rare.”

McKell said his concerns about the industry stem from cases he has seen as a personal injury attorney. He added recent reporting including ongoing coverage in The Salt Lake Tribune and public advocacy have raised his interest.

McKell’s bill would require treatment centers to document any instance in which staff used physical restraints and seclusion and submit monthly reports to the Office of Licensing which is the industry’s primary regulator in Utah. It would also prohibit programs from sedating residents or using mechanical restraints like a straitjacket without the office’s prior authorization.

The troubled-teen industry has been supportive of the legislation so far.

Provo Canyon School administrators said they back McKell’s bill and the transparency it will bring. The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs to which many of these facilities belong is also on board though its leaders say they’d like a few clarifying amendments made. There’s been little public opposition to the measure but it hasn’t been heard in a committee yet.

McKell said when drafting it he consulted with Breaking Code Silence an activist group of former students who say they were abused at troubled-teen facilities and Gelser the Oregon senator.

McKell called Gelser a “trailblazer” and said he sought her out because of her expertise in navigating the industry.

Gelser said the Utah senator was her “new hero” after she saw the extensive nature of his proposal.

“That’s a monumental piece of legislation that will reverberate far beyond the boundaries of Utah” she said. “Because almost every state in the country has kids that are coming to Utah. And they’re not safe when they get there right now.”

Gelser said that at a time when the country is so divided she feels like she has a partner in McKell a politician from the other major party.

McKell said for him it’s not about political lines.

“How we treat participants in these programs is certainly more important than political party” he said. “This is an issue that I think we can all agree there needs to be some reform.”

That 14-year-old girl was taken back to Oregon in March 2019. The contract Oregon officials signed - agreeing to pay $102425 for her care - was supposed to expire in June 2019.

Emails show Oregon officials pushed to have her leave Provo Canyon early. And when she got back to Oregon her caseworker wrote a summary of the visit she had with the girl in her new treatment center. She noted the girl had deep cuts in her arms from harming herself while at Provo Canyon.

She noticed something else too.

“I was worried about the child I might find when she arrived” the caseworker wrote. “I was relieved to see that she still has her spark.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL0hlYWx0aC1DYXJlL0phcGFuLXN0YXJ0dXBzLXVzZS1oaWdoLXRlY2gtdG8tZml4LW15b3BpYS1hbmQtY3Jvb2tlZC10ZWV0aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan startups use high tech to fix myopia and crooked teeth,"TOKYO -- Backed by unique technology and competitive pricing Japanese startups are curing ills in the field of corrective medical treatment.

They have been on the frontlines in protecting the national sovereignty of the country and ensuring law and order under difficult conditions. Despite their lifetime service soldiers in Ethiopia are not well remunerated both during their service and after retirement lacking social security benefits. Hence they constitute one of the less well-off groups in Ethiopian society. This calls for a special policy decision to provide retirement health care coverage for Ethiopian army members and their families as a gratitude for their heroic service to the nation. This can be particularly fitting following the recent events and their triumphant role in protecting the country despite the shocking attacks on the Northern Command.

Since 2018 as part of the new “homegrown economic reform” agenda the government of Ethiopia has made many economic and social policy reforms. Reforms in the health sector that include social security for the army can be crucial welfare improving interventions that can enhance the quality of life for those who have been serving their country on the frontlines.

Since time immemorial Ethiopian army has also fought several wars to maintain peace and stability both in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region. For instance the legacy of Ethiopian forces during Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1896 at the Battle of Adwa has inspired the black global and led to resistance to colonialists across Africa. Egypt’s ambitions of occupying Ethiopia to have direct control of the Nile River ended in the Battle of Gura in 1876 with the sacrifice made by Ethiopian patriots. The Ethiopian army also defeated the Sudanese Mahdist army who invaded Ethiopia in 1889 at the Battle of Gallabat. In 1978 the gallant Ethiopian army defeated and repulsed the invading Somalian army which controlled significant parts of eastern Ethiopia. During the Eritrean-Ethiopian war in 1998 thousands have lost their lives to defend the country. The Ethiopian army has also participated in regional and international peacekeeping missions and is praised for its courage. For instance in 1951 more than 3000 soldiers from Ethiopia fought in the Korea War their motto was “Never be captured in the battlefield” and contributed to the liberation of Korea. Currently Ethiopia is a major contributor to the United Nations (UN) and African Union (AU) peacekeeping missions.

To this effect Ethiopian soldiers have been in Darfur Sudan Abyei South Sudan and Somalia to strengthen cross border conflict management in the Horn of Africa together with eight other member countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). The majority of IGAD’s peacekeeping force is from Ethiopia.

Ethiopian soldiers have also successfully participated in many other development activities including maintenance and construction of public infrastructures (e.g. schools roads health centers) helping the people during national health and disaster emergencies (e.g. COVID-19 locust infestation flood). However the Ethiopian army has never been paid back for its national regional and international services in the form of social security benefits they deserve more than retirement healthcare coverage. The current health reform effort in Ethiopia should consider as a similar initiative of countries that have a better healthcare program. Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all citizens is also one of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals- SDG3. Countries that have not been investing in health services were also facing challenges during an unprecedented time like the COVID-19 that affects senior citizens more. Investing in health education and infrastructure are also key areas of social development.

Although the move in the direction of universal health coverage following the World Health Organization (WHO) framework has been slow Ethiopia can still learn from the experience of other developing and developed countries. First Rwanda and Ghana provide health coverage for their population through a national health insurance scheme. The Rwanda Defense Force in its citizens outreach program which was launched in 2009 provides several socioeconomic services besides serving the community for free medical services that include dentistry ophthalmology orthopedics internal medicine gynecology pediatric and dermatology and minor surgeries. Second in the United States of America retired military personnel and their families have several incentives the TRICARE For Life program for instance provides a range of options for army veterans to receive healthcare coverage. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program also supports over 1.3 million veterans and their families.

Ethiopia’s health insurance system has remained traditional and underdeveloped. The system is dominated by community based schemes established more than 100 years ago called Idir an informal institution which provides financial help to families for emergencies like funerals. An improvement in the health sector including intervention in the care program is needed. The Idir is organized by a group of people where members pay premiums regularly as protection against unforeseen emergencies. Currently as part of the universal health coverage the government is trying to scale up Idir through its new initiative “Idir while alive” the plan is to pool members’ premium payments into a collective fund to use for basic healthcare costs at local health centers when a member is sick. While such progress is appreciated a modern form of health insurance like any other developing country remains weak and underdeveloped in Ethiopia.

A new form of social security in terms of healthcare insurance coverage for veterans who have honorably served the country in the frontlines is needed. Soldiers in particular are vulnerable groups since 1991 the Ethiopian army which fought multiple wars to protect the country was disbanded without any compensation but then remobilized for the war with Eritrea in 1998. Several soldiers after the Eritrea war have been unjustifiably demobilized and again invited to help the army with the current internal conflict (with the Tigray region).

It is also important to understand that frequent conflicts have economic social and environmental consequences including poverty and migration problems and children women and the elderly are often the most affected groups. In many countries that face frequent internal conflicts their governments are greedy for power and trap their people into poverty transition to democracy and development can be delayed significantly the military personnel in particular who sacrificed their lives to protect civilians from conflicts who have been wounded and disabled required retirement healthcare coverage. Provision of some level of social protection and healthcare to retired military officers not only reduces the threat of endless war and conflict but it has enormous social benefits in the long run.

More particularly providing healthcare for military veterans can offer the following types of benefits. First it helps to maintain peace and security in a conflict-affected region. Second it makes servicing the country in the military attractive to the educated youth as well adds dignity and honor to those who retire after their gallant service to the nation. Third the incentive may allow the government to consider a national peacetime training and short term service in the military for the youth (this is not to fight wars) as a way of building discipline commitment and patriotic duty as has been practiced by several developed countries which use this model for cultivating their youth after high school graduation.

Retirement healthcare coverage as a social security benefit for the army could therefore be the first of its kind in Ethiopia and provide immense social benefits. As part of the effort for extending universal healthcare in the country it can incentivize and recognize distinguished public service for peace and security and facilitate democratization and sustainable development. As part of the healthcare reforms intervention on retiree healthcare for the army (and their immediate family) can improve the quality of the life of soldiers who have been providing unique national service to secure peace and facing enormous risks to their lives in the conflict affected region. This can also be a good initial experience to innovate and identify other vulnerable groups in the country and explore feasible policy options to expand social protection.

Over 9000 tonnes of earth have already been removed and 18000 tonnes of hardcore brought in to provide firm foundations for the remarkable all-electric SGC-90 ‘Little Celeste’ used by heavy lift specialists Sarens.

It will be used to lift the replacement Depropaniser and Settler units that many people have recently seen travelling down the Haven waterway.

With a ring diameter of 35 metres a maximum counterweight of 2700 tonnes and a load moment of 99000 tonnes it can be configured in a variety of ways; with main boom lengths of 100 120 and 130 metres and a small jib of 200 tonnes.

Its hook alone weighs over 50 tonnes.

The crane has taken over 200 lorry loads to transport it from Pembroke Port to the refinery and is taking six weeks to build and will take another six to take it down.

The big lift is due to take place in the first week of March weather permitting.

Such is its size that another crane has been erected to construct it. That crane in itself weighing over 600 tonnes when fully built taking 25 lorry loads to bring it to site.

Valero Public Affairs Manager Stephen Thornton said: “This is a remarkable feat of engineering which will dominate the skyline of Pembrokeshire. This event is a huge investment by Valero into the area with many local people employed. Valero is grateful to the people of Pembrokeshire for their continued support. Valero holds the safety of the community and workforce as its number one priority.”

To learn more about this remarkable feat visit www.sarens.com and search for Little Celeste.

Pembroke refinery has measures to protect the community and workforce during its planned maintenance event.

Measures to ensure maximum safety levels include elements such as:

• All staff and contractors will be Covid-19 tested before arriving at the Valero site. Anyone testing positive will be required to isolate immediately and follow Test Trace Protect instructions.

• Regular random testing will also be in place on site ensuring the whole site is tested. Anyone testing positive will be required to isolate immediately and follow Test Trace Protect instructions.

• Public Health Wales will have a presence at the refinery during the Turnaround with staff embedded to ensure ongoing compliance with agreed safety measures.

• All contract firms operating on site have been briefed by Public Health Wales on their workers responsibilities and the personal behaviours expected within the wider community

• All members of staff and contractors will continue to be temperature tested every time they enter the refinery.

• Shift times will be staggered to allow for social distancing on site. Work groups will be kept in bubbles.

• 50 percent of the workforce will work the night shift to ensure social distancing and bubbles are maintained",,,,,,,,,

Estos son tiempos de incertidumbre por la pandemia por el asalto al Capitolio y por el cambio de poder ahora en manos de los demócratas más dados a establecer algún tipo de restricciones en el acceso a las armas.

Todo esto se reflejó en los números registrados en las armerías estadounidenses durante el pasado enero. Más de dos millones de armas de fuego se vendieron en ese periodo según el estudio y la base de datos que mantiene The Washington Post.

Esto significa un incremento del 80% en la comparación de años tras años y el tercer récord más alto en un mes.

Las peticiones de antecedentes penales de pistolas y rifles y de munición han mantenido un ritmo constante a lo largo de los últimos meses una etapa de confinamiento de protestas raciales en las calles y de vísperas electorales. El incremento de enero sigue con esa dinámica del 2020 cuando se vendieron casi 23 millones de armas lo que supone una subida del 64% respecto a los registros del 2019.

Las armerías tienen serios problemas de abastecimiento en dos de los elementos más buscados en esta época las pistolas y la munición. En muchos establecimientos disponen de escasas pistolas y han vendido toda la munición sin dar tiempo a nuevos suministros de los fabricantes.

El punto más alto de fiebre por las armas se produjo el pasado junio con 28 millones de unidades. Este repunte llegó al rebufo de los incidentes propiciados por las manifestaciones tras la muerte del negro George Floyd en Minneapolis bajo custodia policial.

Esta situación se prolongó durante julio con 25 millones.

Desde entonces se ha detectado un fenómeno nuevo. Muchos de los compradores de armas son primerizos nunca había dispuesto de una de ellas pero las circunstancias les hizo cambiar de parecer en este terreno.

La enorme inestabilidad que creó el presidente Donald Trump al no aceptar el resultado electoral cuestión que condujo al asalto al Congreso el 6 de enero ha sido el factor determinante en esta nueva oleada de ventas.

Coinciden toda una serie de factores como la irrupción pública de la extrema derecha y el supremacismo blanco que hace que numerosos ciudadanos sientan preocupación por la inseguridad. Michigan con gran presencia de las milicias ultra y Nueva Jersey son los dos estados donde más se han disparado las ventas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGlhcmlvLm14L2Vjb25vbWlhL2Rpc3BhcmEtc3VwZXItYm93bC12ZW50YXMtZGUtYWd1YWNhdGUtMjAyMTAyMDUtMTc1OTYwNy5odG1s0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9kaWFyaW8ubXgvZWNvbm9taWEvYW1wL2Rpc3BhcmEtc3VwZXItYm93bC12ZW50YXMtZGUtYWd1YWNhdGUtMjAyMTAyMDUtMTc1OTYwNy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dispara Super Bowl ventas de aguacate,"Chihuahua— La celebración anual del campeonato de la Liga Nacional y Americana del Futbol Americano de los Estados Unidos de América durante el primer domingo de febrero propicia un aumento en las exportaciones de aguacate mexicano para cubrir la alta demanda y consumo de “guacamole” por millones de estadounidenses y migrantes durante el transcurso del juego.

El Servicio de Información Agropecuaria y Pesquera de la Secretaría de Desarrollo Rural informó lo anterior y detalló que históricamente antes del partido en las semanas de enero la curva de ventas del procesado presenta un ascenso. En 2021 el nivel exportado registra ventas promedio por semana de 160 toneladas.

Durante la primera semana de 2021 las exportaciones mexicanas de aguacate hacia el vecino país alcanzaron las nueve mil 418 toneladas en la segunda 21 mil 764 y en la cuarta se registraron ventas por 25 mil 629.

En semanas previas a la realización del evento deportivo la necesidad de contar con los ingredientes de preparación del platillo genera un incremento significativo de las exportaciones mexicanas de aguacate fresco y otros derivados del fruto como lo es la pulpa y la salsa elaborada con la que se hace el guacamole al gusto del consumidor.

México exportó a Estados Unidos durante el año pasado poco más de un millón 134 mil toneladas de aguacate de ellas un millón 36 mil corresponden al fruto entero en fresco otras 83 mil 468 a guacamole y 14 mil 904 a pulpa.

El valor comercial anual conjunto de los productos cifró 2 mil 579 millones de dólares reportó el SIAP.

Detalló que el comparativo interanual 2020 versus 2015 de las ventas mexicanas del fruto y sus derivados hacia la Unión Americana refiere un comportamiento favorable de 7.3% en volumen y 21.8% en valor.

El SIAP informó que del total de aguacate preparado o conservado que adquiere Estados Unidos 97.8% proviene de México. En 2019 la nación erogó 433.5 millones de dólares por la compra de esos productos.

Antes del Supertazón 2021 el mejor momento para las ventas de la salsa aconteció en las tres últimas semanas de diciembre es probable que la expectativa de un menor aforo al estadio y las restricciones por la pandemia hayan desacelerado las ventas de enero.

Aun cuando las exportaciones mexicanas de pulpa de aguacate se efectúan en cantidades que promedian 311 toneladas por semana se espera en el mediano plazo un panorama favorable para este segmento de mercado.

Finalmente dijo que México es el principal productor y exportador de aguacate del mundo y la venta del procesado está orientada a satisfacer los requerimientos de un grupo de consumidores que desean preparar su salsa pero evitando las tareas que implica extraer la pulpa del fruto fresco.

Amid a particularly isolated year Verizon has announced its plans to safely bring people together for America’s biggest annual sporting event.

The company is set to make the festivities of Super Bowl LV weekend more accessible than ever to fans — whether at the game or at home — using the power of its lightning-fast 5G Ultra Wideband.

On Sunday Feb. 7 at 11 p.m. ET Verizon is set to livestream the ultimate Super Bowl LV after-party “The Big Concert for Small Business.” The benefit hosted by Tiffany Haddish will feature performances by Alicia Keys Brandi Carlile Brittany Howard Christina Aguilera Eric Church H.E.R. Jazmine Sullivan Luke Bryan and Miley Cyrus.

The star-studded concert will be livestreamed on Yahoo and Fios and on Verizon’s Twitter Twitch YouTube and TikTok; broadcast on BET CBS Sports Network CMT MTV2 and MTV Live; and aired on iHeart and Sirius. Verizon has pledged to donate $10 million to the nonprofit Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) providing immediate financial support to businesses during the pandemic. All additional proceeds from the concert will go to the charity as well.

But that’s not all.

As part of its fan-first Super Bowl celebration Verizon has constructed a stadium in Fortnite Creative — the largest activation ever made in Fortnite’s Creative Mode by BeyondCreative and Epic Games — featuring four football-inspired games and a few hidden surprises for players.

The stadium which will give gamers the opportunity to interact with their favorite NFL players and pro gamers in a way that’s never been done before was built utilizing the low lag and high speeds made possible by the Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband network highlighting the power of 5G for gaming.

On Sunday during the big game the Verizon 5G SuperStadium in the NFL mobile app will allow iPhone 12 owners who are present at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium the opportunity to watch the game through seven different camera angles. Fans at home will be able to access five camera angles as well as project augmented reality overlays of NFL’s Next Gen Stats onto the players in real time.

Verizon Media’s “Watch Together” a free co-viewing experience in the Yahoo Sports mobile app will also give fans the ability to co-watch Super Bowl LV with friends and family on their phones.

The comedian appeared as a guest on Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show and as the host of Verizon’s Big Concert for Small Business a charitable event featuring performances by Alicia Keys Brandi Carlile Brittany Howard Christina Aguilera Eric Church H.E.R. Jazmine Sullivan Luke Bryan and Miley Cyrus.

While she charmed opposite Colbert singing a few verses of the children’s song “Skinny Marinky Dinky Dink” the hosting outing for Verizon came with some surprises. It was clear that there were production delays that forced Haddish to stall for time and that’s when one segment went off the rails.

“Our next performer has a career I have been following from the beginning. When I saw her kill it on the BET Awards …” Haddish said as she read an introduction for H.E.R. from a teleprompter before pausing to ask “What the fuck does vamp mean?”

It seemed she was getting direction from an earpiece — common for hosts during live productions — while off-camera a voice can be heard saying “Stall.” Haddish continued reading the script only to stop again. “Now they asked me to vamp. I don’t know what vamp means. To me vamp means be a vampire and/or vampirate like slowly disappear and/or elaborate. Maybe that’s the word they should’ve used? Elaborate. But let’s continue on guys.”

Viewers took to Twitter to find out what was going on. One user tagged Verizon and asked “Who keeps messing up?” The tech giant replied and simply praised its host. “Tiffany Haddish is a national treasure.”

Curated and produced by Roc Nation the show was designed to shine a spotlight on small businesses as part of Verizon’s multiyear commitment to help 1 million small-business owners rebound and thrive in the digital economy by 2030. Big Concert for Small Business which streamed on Yahoo Fios @Verizon on Twitter Twitch YouTube and TikTok as well as on BET CBS Sports Network CMT MTV2 and MTV Live featured many small-business owners some of whom even got to check out select performances in person. The response online was mixed and Verizon turned off comments on its YouTube page.

Haddish an accomplished actress host and producer who has shown she’s quick on her feet both on the stand-up stage and hosting shows like Kids Say the Darndest Things finished strong and seemed to take the whole thing in stride.

With about 30 minutes left in a two-hour show Haddish said “This has not been the smoothest-running situation” adding that they had to follow extra protocols between each act. “Every time an act leaves the stage they have to clean the whole stage get all-new microphones all-new everything. You have to keep in mind that some of these acts haven’t performed for nobody. … Me personally I’m in a studio alone it’s cold — and I’m ready to bring the heat. But it’s cold.”

When Big Concert for Small Business wrapped Haddish took to Twitter to thank Verizon for the opportunity while acknowledging it was not an easy gig. “I just want to say that was one of the funnest hardest things I have ever done” she posted after 10 p.m. “Thank you Verizon for letting me be apart of something so great. I am always supportive of the small businesses in my community.”

Verizon said in September it would buy Tracfone a unit of Mexican telecom company America Movil in a cash and stock deal.

The state attorneys general said the FCC “should examine whether the acquisition of TracFone by Verizon could significantly reduce millions of Americans’ access to affordable communications services.”

Th letter added “it is imperative that the FCC thoroughly vet the proposed transaction and impose specific conditions that protect and ensure the public interest before considering approval.”

The state AGs are led by Virginia’s Mark Herring and also include those of Colorado Connecticut Delaware the District of Columbia Iowa Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Nevada New Mexico New York North Carolina Oregon Rhode Island Vermont and Washington.

Tracfone is one of the largest providers of telecommunications services under the government subsidy program known as Lifeline with 1.7 million low-income subscribers in 43 states and the District of Columbia the state AGs’ letter said while Verizon offers Lifeline in parts of four states.

A Verizon spokesman said on Friday the company “will continue to offer Lifeline service through TracFone and further develop its core brands products and distribution channels. Strengthening and growing TracFone will benefit value-conscious consumers.”

Tracfone which serves about 21 million subscribers through more than 90000 retail locations across the United States said last year more than 13 million of its subscribers rely on Verizon’s network under an existing agreement. Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers.

“We urge the FCC to put the interest of the American consumer before that of big business and request additional information before allowing this acquisition to happen” said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel."

Matching its 2019 investment the organization will support 14 research projects throughout the state including studies at the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Auburn University Cerflux Mitchell Cancer Institute at University of South Alabama Tuskegee University and Southern Research. Funding was raised in 2020 by corporate sponsorships special events individual donations grants from local state and federal funders and sales of the Breast Cancer Research specialty license plate.

“Despite COVID-19 individuals and companies throughout the state stepped up for breast cancer research” said Beth Bradner Davis executive director of the BCRFA. “Our staff and board are truly thrilled to match last year’s investment allowing us to support critical projects which will change therapies and treatments for breast cancer patients here in Alabama and around the world. Unfortunately diagnoses don’t stop during a pandemic. This investment will ensure that research won’t either.”

The BCRFA invests in projects in developing stages providing “seed money” to attract grant funding. From there many projects go on to win national grants from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and others.

“The support of organizations like the BCRFA is crucial to our work at the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center” said Dr. Barry P. Sleckman director of the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center. “Developing projects often have an undeniable positive impact for research in the field of breast cancer. Each discovery brings us closer to a cure – and the BCRFA is helping get us there.”

As he considered his college options the Harlem-based teenager was drawn to the legacy of prominent Morehouse College graduates including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Howard Thurman Samuel L. Jackson and Julian Bond.

But what Malcolm found most inspiring was the campus of nearly 2000 students filled with young Black men focused on excellence just like him. For the future English major the decision was clear.

Today Malcolm is president of media investor and crisis communications for UPS one of the thousands of successful graduates shaped by Morehouse College.

“My experience at Morehouse not only helped prepare me for my professional career it helped prepare me for life” Malcolm said. “The confidence perspective and brotherhood I found at Morehouse are among the strengths I draw upon every day.”

As the next generation of leaders emerges graduates of HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities) are shaping the landscape through groundbreaking work and achievements in business government social and civic impact and the arts.

The next generation of leaders

HBCUs were established to serve the educational needs of Black Americans denied admission to traditionally white institutions. While access to colleges and universities has widened HBCUs are still providing a needed avenue to higher education for many.

“I was so excited when my daughter chose to continue the legacy of women in our family and attend Spelman College” Malcolm said. “She’s now walking the same hallways and sitting in the same classrooms once occupied by Spelman alumnae who are making history in science and politics leading companies and changing the world.”

HBCUs offer a close connection to a strong support network of students faculty professors and alumni. This culture extends into best practices to develop the next wave of successful business leaders – allowing diverse thought and experiences to flourish leading to new and innovative solutions.

A lifelong commitment

Companies also have the ability to support the schools through partnerships and mentoring. In Malcolm’s previous role as vice president of The UPS Foundation he helped drive efforts to support lifelong preparation for success. The UPS Foundation‘s support for HBCUs includes The UPS Community Scholars Program a scholarship and mentoring program with Morehouse College Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University; the INROADS internship program; scholarships through United Negro College Fund; and mentoring through the 100 Black Men of America.

With more than 100 HBCUs throughout the U.S. all navigating through the impact of the pandemic the need for support is greater than ever.

Recently UPS provided Morehouse College freshmen Microsoft Surface® Pro tablets needed for online learning — a necessity in the age of COVID-19.

“The Morehouse/UPS/Microsoft Surface Pro collaboration was particularly special to me” Malcolm said. “When I entered Morehouse I couldn’t afford to purchase my own technology. I know what this gift means to those young men.”

Black History Month serves as a reminder of the importance of developing the next generation of diverse leaders who will make our world more resilient and responsive to the needs of all. Supporting HBCUs and the students who bring their hopes and aspirations to their classrooms (virtual or otherwise) is a critical step in that journey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkMmZpc2guY29tL3N3aW1iYWl0LXRpcHMvaG93LXRvLXBhaXItc3dpbWJhaXRzLW9uLXN3aW0tamlncy1mb3Itc3Rpbmd5LWJhc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Pair Swimbaits on Swim Jigs for Stingy Bass,"Florida bass fishing pro John Cox loves swim jigs to cover water fast and get bit but he admits bass are quick to get conditioned to it. Like ChatterBait fishing his remedy is to remove the skirt and thread on a realistic paddle tail swimbait. A swim jig and paddle tail combination add an element of refinement that can generate fresh bites even in heavily pressured areas.

Cox shares his preferred jig head and swimbait combo for combing the shallows and unlike a Texas-rigged swimbait the jig fosters higher hooking percentages so long as you have the right rod reel and line combo. He shares a few additional points on how he fishes the setup ranging from cadence to hook sets and why it’s essential to manipulate the jig weed guard.

Tast,"CLEVELAND Ohio -- cleveland.com’s Yadi Rodriguez and Brenda Cain kicked off the new year taste-testing a whopping 95 frozen appetizers found at grocery and big box stores.

While the national brands may play to your recognition factor because they are sold at several retailers across the country and touted in commercials don’t discount the store brands. Manufactured and sold exclusively by a retailer these often suffer from the “generic” handle placed on them for being a store brand.

While on the hunt for frozen appetizers -- store brands and name brands alike -- we found several store brand apps worthy of a shout out for their taste and uniqueness in the marketplace.

Check out our rankings below to see which store brand frozen apps are excellent choices for your table regardless of the size of your soiree -- whether it is a few friends your pod or just a treat for yourself.

We’ve spotlighted the best frozen appetizers we tried that are made by the following stores: Whole Foods Aldi Target Walmart and Trader Joe’s.

365 by Whole Foods

We sampled three excellent appetizers from the 365 line at Whole Foods two of which made our Top 20 overall.

Jalapeños & Cream Cheese small bites 365

Box says: Made with spicy jalapeños and cream cheese.

Our thoughts: We kicked off the Top 20 with these tiny triangles filled with chopped pieces of jalapeno and mixed into a creamy cheese filling so you get a kick with every bite. What makes these jalapeño bites different and stand out from all the others we tried is that the Jalapeños were chopped and incorporated into the filling so we didn’t have a large soggy piece of jalapeño inside the breading. By incorporating the pepper into the filling you get great Jalapeno flavor in every bite.

Macaroni & Cheese small bites 365

Box says: Macaroni and cheese made with real cheddar cheese.

Our thoughts: These are some of the smallest mac and cheese bites we found but their big flavor stands up to any craving you have for a carb-heavy snack. Creamy thick and cheesy inside wrapped in a crunchy outer shell. A real winner.

Appetitos by Aldi

Appetitos can be found at Aldi. We tasted three appetizers from the line but the best by far was the Loaded Potato Skins which ranked 67th overall.

Loaded Potato Skins Appetitos

Loaded Potato Skins Appetitos

Box says: Loaded potato skins with cheddar cheese and real Applewood smoked bacon.

Our thoughts: While the potato still had plenty of “meat” on the peel it got hard upon cooking. There was lots of (is that American?) cheese which didn’t fully melt and the consistency was off. The adequate bacon stayed crispy and was flavorful.

Good & Gather by Target

Good & Gather is one of Target’s store brands. We tasted seven appetizers from the line during our sampling. Below we are featuring three which all made our overall Top 10.

Brie & Berry Jam Bites Good & Gather

Box says: Berry jam blend of blackberries raspberries strawberries in a flaky phyllo cup and topped with brie cheese.

Our thoughts: Is this a dessert or an appetizer? They could be either. Whether you are looking for sweet or savory you’ll find it in this unique appetizer. The savory combo of cheesy goodness covers bright tart berries delivered in a flaky easy to eat cup. These little bites took the No. 8 spot in our overall ranking.

Uncured Bacon Wrapped Scallops Good & Gather

Box says: Uncured bacon and Atlantic scallops.

Our thoughts: If your first thought is this appetizer is a little too fancy for your small gathering -- or just an evening in -- think again. First off who doesn’t love bacon? Wrap it around a succulent firm scallop and you have an explosion of taste in your mouth! And the toothpicks make this an easy grab-and-go bite. It may be a little greasy but we repeat who doesn’t love bacon? This one ranked No. 3 in our overall list of best appetizers.

Parmesan Pastry Wrapped Uncured Hot Dogs Good & Gather

Box says: Topped with a blend of parmesan cheese sesame poppy and caraway seeds.

Our thoughts: These bites were our overall winner with their outstanding balance of flavor. A delightful aroma while baking primed our taste buds. The flaky dough browns up nicely and provides crunch in every bite. Not your usual hot dogs these little meat bites will remind you of Lil Smokies. Just the right pastry-to-dog ratio and the toasted seeds add additional texture making this a delightful bite. Not your typical pigs in a blanket.

Great Value by Walmart

The Great Value brand is well known as Walmart’s store brand. We found three appetizers to try during our shopping excursions. The spinach dip came in ninth place.

Spinach Artichoke & Gouda Dip Great Value

Box says: Spinach artichoke and gouda dip.

Our thoughts: This dip is packed with plenty of veggies -- spinach artichoke and onions -- all of which retained their fresh flavor in a rich and creamy cheese sauce. You can taste each ingredient individually yet they meld together nicely. The perfect complement to your favorite cracker or chip.

Market Pantry by Target

Market Pantry is the second store brand we found at Target. We tasted nine appetizers from this line but are giving a shoutout to only three which ranked highest in our overall ranking.

Mini Cheeseburgers Market Pantry

Box says: Beef patty with cheese on a bun.

Our thoughts: Way more bun than beef. Sufficient cheese. Be careful not to overcook these because the sweet bun gets crunchy. It is a decent bite for what it is. This little patty came in No. 54 in our overall ranking.

Potato Skins Market Pantry

Boneless Chicken Bites – Honey Barbecue Flavored Market Pantry

Box says: Breaded boneless skinless chicken breast chunks with rib meat coated with a sweet barbecue glaze smoke flavor added fully cooked.

Our thoughts: This was one of the few real chicken breast pieces -- not processed -- we found. Coated in a mild slightly smoky honey barbecue flavored sauce this nugget is firm and meaty. It captured the No. 32 spot.

Trader Joe’s brand

The Trader Joe’s brand speaks for itself. We tasted 10 appetizers three of which made our Top 20.

Pastry Bites with Feta Cheese & Caramelized Onions Trader Joe’s

Box says: Pastry bites with feta cheese and caramelized onions. No preservatives no artificial colors or flavors.

Our thoughts: Sweet onion and a creamy cheese in puff pastry is a delicious bite that stands out amid so many of the same ‘ole same ‘ole appetizers. It is a delicious combo of flavors in a bite-sized treat. This one ranked No. 19 in our overall standings.

Nutrition per serving:

Calories 240 | Fat 18g | Cholesterol 65mg | Sodium 300mg | Carbs 15g | Protein 5g

We bought it at Trader Joe’s for $4.99

Mac and Cheese Bites Trader Joe’s

Box says: Imagine the cheesiest bite of macaroni and cheese encased in a crispy outer coating. We have created the ultimate appetizer inspired by our popular Diner Mac & Cheese. They’re compact they’re comforting they’re cheesy and they’re delicious.

Our thoughts: While other mac bites are covered in a traditional breading these bites have a decidedly panko coating which takes ‘crispy’ to a new level. Inside the noodles are firm and covered in a smooth sauce blended from several cheeses. Could have used a little salt though. These bites came placed 17th.

(KPLC) - It’s been two weeks since 15-year-old Melanie Lyons was stabbed at Walmart on La. 14. Today her family was finally able to lay her to rest.

There was not a dry eye in the building as family and friends gathered at New Shiloh Baptist Church Saturday morning to say their final goodbyes to 15-year-old Melanie Lyons.

“Melanie is like the best person. You meet her and she would put a smile on her face. She encouraged people different ways. She let us know she loved us” her cousin Kaitlyn Goodly said.

Lyons was stabbed just a few weeks ago at a Lake Area Walmart. Today her family is remembering her joy and the light she brought into their lives. One that’s even visible in her videos.

“She was just roaring loud for no reason and that’s bringing joy to our whole family. That’s a memory we love. So for our family on the count of three we’re going to do this for Mel” her brother Lawrence Senegal said.

Her grandmother Priscilla Willis says she’s glad to see Melanie finally at peace.

“She’s in a better place. We need to go catch up and get in a place where she’s at. Kind of keeping me calm when I see how beautiful she looks.”

Her grandmother Priscilla Willis says despite the circumstances her granddaughter left teaching them all a lesson.

”She ended up here but it’s turning for her good. For us it opens our eyes to see and get closer with our kids. Love on our kids and our children and be there for them. Listen to them.”

A lesson she hopes will carry on in Melanie’s legacy.

Her family at the funeral wore blue and white to honor Lyons because blue was her favorite color.

Lyons was laid to rest at Combre Memorial Park.

A wallet in the purse identified the suspect as 32-year-old Kayla Marie Barker of Sebastian. Walmart security positively identified the suspect from the identification she carried in her wallet.

The purse also contained:

Two crack pipes

A plastic baggy with a grey powder substance

Four identification cards with three different names

Debit cards

The grey powder substance was sent to a lab for testing.

Walmart security said they were monitoring Barker on video surveillance as she failed to ring up some of the items in her shopping cart at the self-checkout.

“The female had taken different barcodes that she taped to multiple items so that they would ring up as a cheaper item. The female would also take items and place them into a bag making no attempt to ring them up” the deputy said.

When Barker was done at the self-checkout she proceeded to the exit passing all points of sale making no attempt to purchase the unscanned items. The unpaid merchandise amounted to $107.51.

The loss prevention officer approached Barker and identified himself. Upon doing so Barker “ran out of the door and got into a Blue Kia sedan” the affidavit said.

However Barker left behind her purse and wallet in the shopping cart. Walmart security said Barker had been stopped previously at the same Walmart for theft.

Barker was arrested and transported to the Brevard County Jail where her bond was set at $2500."

Larry Davis

Youngstown State University alum Larry Davis who had decades-long successful creative career at the Walt Disney Co. presents the next Alumni Lecture Series program 7 p.m. Thursday Feb. 11 on the Alumni Engagement Facebook page.

The lecture is titled “How YSU Faculty Helped Shape My Career Trajectory” and will focus on Davis’ career in sculpture and with Disney that culminated with his position as the executive producer and creative director for the Main Entrance of Shanghai Disneyland.

A native of Salem Ohio Davis began his academic career in 1970 as a Biology major at YSU before picking up a paint brush. He earned a bachelor of Fine Arts from YSU in 1976 and seven years later a master of Fine Arts at California State University in Long Beach with a major in sculpture.

In 1980 while still a graduate student Davis began a decades-long career with the Walt Disney Co. holding numerous positions in a variety of creative roles.

From 1986 to 1991 Davis stepped away from Disney to pursue his own design firm Larry A. Designs in Los Angeles. During that time he had significant success working in the entertainment industry as well as continuing to create art. He was represented by two Los Angeles art galleries Piezo Electric and The Brendan Walter Gallery and was included in group shows at several other LA-based galleries as well as the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York.

Upon returning to Disney Davis continued creating and exhibiting his own art for a number of years including a commission from Linane/Drews Architects for a 17-foot-tall outdoor sculpture in Burbank and shows at Cache Contemporary Gallery in Los Angeles Stroke and Structure Gallery in Pasadena Gallery 114 in Portland Ore. and the MorYork Gallery in Highland Park Calif.

The last leg of his Disney career was with Walt Disney Imagineering the division responsible for developing and executing Disney theme parks around the world. Throughout his career Davis traveled the world for Disney with involvement in places like Paris Tokyo London and Rome. In 2016 he retired from Walt Disney Imagineering as executive producer and creative director for the Shanghai Disneyland Main Entrance. During this role after traveling back-and-forth to China for several years of development he relocated to Shanghai for the entire construction phase of the project.

Magic Kingdom

Magic Kingdom has quite a list of attractions that will not be available in March.

Walt Disney World Railroad – Frontierland – Temporarily Unavailable Closed for Refurbishment

Walt Disney World Railroad – Fantasyland – Temporarily Unavailable Closed for Refurbishment

Walt Disney World Railroad – Main Street U.S.A. – Temporarily Unavailable Closed for Refurbishment

As we noted for February’s refurbishment the Walt Disney World Railroad has been closed for quite some time since December 3 2018 to be exact. The train is a popular option for Guests to travel around the lands of Magic Kingdom in style but has yet to reopen. The construction for TRON: Lightcycle / Run overlaps with sections of the railway so likely the attraction will not open until the coaster’s construction is no longer interfering — this has not however been confirmed by Disney.

The Hall of Presidents is currently closed as the attraction is adding in the new President Biden animatronic as the United States is now under a new administration. The attraction closed down on the day of the Inauguration. It seems that the attraction will take months before Guests can see the new President as it will be closed throughout March (as well as February of course).

Mad Tea Party closes down on February 20 2021 but will only be gone for a short while! On March 5 the attraction will be running once again so Guests can spin with Alice and the Mad Hatter!

The Swiss Family Treehouse will be closed for a good chunk of March! The refurbishment begins Match 12 and goes until the 25.

Although the PeopleMover in Tomorrowland was set to reopen on March 1 2021 the attraction has seen multiple delays. Now we know the attraction will be closed all of March.

Animal Kingdom

Here is what will be closed in March at Disney’s Animal Kingdom theme park.

Kali River Rapids is a water attraction that closes down every year for routine maintenance and refurbishment. Currently Kali River Rapids is set to reopen on April 2 2021. That being said Disney’s refurbishment schedule is subject to change.

It’s Tough to be a Bug! Closed for Refurbishment

It’s Tough to be a Bug! is the show that happens in the Tree of Life and will close for a short refurbishment from March 8 – 11.

EPCOT and Disney’s Hollywood Studios do not have any scheduled refurbishments during March so do not worry about having to miss a ride to the Twilight Zone on the Tower of Terror or not being able to travel the world on Soarin!

But perhaps one of the most intriguing and overlooked rides is the Tomorrowland Transit Authority – otherwise known simply as the PeopleMover.

The slow-moving tour of Tomorrowland is more than just another attraction. Rather it ties in with a key Disney legacy tying back to Walt Disney’s vision for a utopian futuristic tomorrow.

So today let’s explore the rich and fascinating history of the PeopleMover.

Origins at the World’s Fair

New York’s 1964-1965 World’s Fair was an important point in Disney history. Walt Disney used the opportunity to develop and market innovative technology he could take back to Disneyland – with corporate sponsors paying him for the honor of showcasing pavilions for them. Disney provided four different attractions that proved popular with guests and three of them later found a home at the parks: it’s a small world Carousel of Progress and Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.

The fourth attraction Ford’s Magic Skyway never reappeared after its World’s Fair debut but it nevertheless made a significant impact in Disney Imagineering. The ride involved guests boarding classic Ford cars and traveling back in time to animatronic scenes of dinosaurs and cavemen. However the ride’s concept posed a problem: how to avoid fender-bender collisions between the cars. Imagineers came up with a new approach inspired by Ford’s own manufacturing system; they mounted the cars to a constantly moving conveyor belt so all the vehicles moved in perfect sync. Ford’s Magic Skyway was the second most popular ride of the fair and it inspired Walt Disney to advance the technology even further.

A New Ride for Tomorrowland

Around the same time Disneyland Anaheim was preparing to improve its Tomorrowland area since modern advances were outpacing the land’s early sci-fi aesthetic. The “New Tomorrowland” project reimagined Tomorrowland’s futuristic vision and brought in new attractions that delighted guests. These additions included the PeopleMover which took the concept of a motorless always-moving ride and applied it to a tour of Tomorrowland.

The original PeopleMover at Disneyland gave guests an elevated view of Tomorrowland. Not only did the ride go around Tomorrowland but it also went inside some of the attractions. For instance you could gain a unique view of Space Mountain’s interior letting you get a glimpse of the ride even if you weren’t a fan of rollercoasters. It offered a fun way to experience the whole of Tomorrowland demonstrating the utility of the unique track system.

Walt’s Vision for Tomorrow at Disney World

But Walt intended the PeopleMover to be more than simply a ride at his parks. Rather he believed that the PeopleMover could become an alternate means of public transportation. He was already developing plans for his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT). He imagined EPCOT as a utopian metropolis in Florida alongside Disney World. In this futuristic city there would be no cars cluttering the streets creating traffic hazards. All citizens instead would use public transportation including monorails and a WEDWay PeopleMover system.

Unfortunately Walt never got to see that dream become a reality as he died in 1966 more than a decade before the eventual opening of EPCOT. Rather than try to create the new city without him Disney leaders instead focused on making EPCOT into a second park at Walt Disney World. However Walt Disney World still got its own PeopleMover albeit not at EPCOT. Magic Kingdom’s Tomorrowland section received its own PeopleMover attraction in 1975 called the WEDWay PeopleMover (short for Walter Elias Disney). Like Disneyland the Magic Kingdom PeopleMover offers a guided tour of Tomorrowland and takes you inside many of the local attractions.

Magic Kingdom’s version of the PeopleMover showcased improvements made by Imagineers since the original design at Disneyland. Rather than using rotating tires for propulsion this version utilizes linear induction motor magnets. Incidentally the lack of tires meant that Goodyear does not sponsor the Magic Kingdom ride like it did for Disneyland. Plus whereas Disneyland’s PeopleMover cars are enclosed Magic Kingdom’s cars are open-air letting riders better experience their Tomorrowland tour. Since then the PeopleMover has remained a key part of Tomorrowland at Magic Kingdom.

Goodbye to Disneyland’s PeopleMover

Sadly the original version of the PeopleMover in Anaheim’s Disneyland no longer exists due to a misguided renovation. During the 1990s Disney tried to revamp its Tomorrowland areas with another wave of refurbishments originally intended to embody the fantastic visions of early sci-fi stories. However budget cuts during that time period sharply reduced the level of upgrades to Tomorrowland. In fact rides viewed as outdated were removed — including the PeopleMover which closed in 1995.

Feeling that the PeopleMover was too old-fashioned Disney tried to revamp the ride into the newfangled Rocket Rods attraction which opened in 1997. The new set-up added rocket boosters to the cars with the intent of making the experience into more of a thrill ride. However due to inadequate efforts to adjust the original set-up the ride flopped horribly. To account for the original track’s sharp turns meant for slow-moving vehicles the Rocket Rods had to erratically shift between sudden boosts and stops. Not only did this make the ride jerky but it led to numerous breakdowns and traffic jams.

Moreover the Rocket Rods permanently disabled Disneyland’s PeopleMover. The intense grinding from the Rocket Rods damaged the delicate track components. Constant malfunctions forced the ride to close indefinitely in 2000. Still the extreme wear to the track makes restoring the PeopleMover generations after its original design into a costly and difficult proposition. Since then the PeopleMover track has remained abandoned yet present in Tomorrowland a gravemarker reminding us of we lost.

Actual Upgrades to Magic Kingdom’s Version

Fortunately Magic Kingdom’s PeopleMover in Disney World hasn’t suffered the same fate. While Disney renamed the ride as the Tomorrowland Transit Authority in 1994 it never changed to the problematic Rocket Rods. In addition the 1994 upgrades included new narration from Pete Renaday to engage riders in Tomorrowland’s fictional sci-fi setting. For instance the announcements claimed that passengers were riding the “Blue Line”. The fictional Green Line supposedly went to hovering neighborhoods while the Red Line connected to other planets.

The Tomorrowland Transit Authority received additional improvements during a refurbishment in 2009. Along with a new paint job to the track and enhanced lights on the beamway we got a new narrator: Mike Brassell who has also composed music for the Disney parks and narrated Living with the Land. Not only that but now you can hear voices from Disney characters as you approach the different attractions during the ride.

The PeopleMover was closed for almost a year between 2020 and 2021 and fans were delighted when the attraction finally reopened. Though its return to glory had a bit of a bumpy start the PeopleMover (now with new narration!) once again offers guests a chance to tour Tomorrowland and appreciate this lasting Imagineering legacy.

The colorful two-block long mural was unveiled during a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday on a road in front of Jake Yates High School Floyd's alma mater. The artwork features the words ""Black Lives Matter"" and the red and gold No. 88 jersey Floyd wore as a standout player on the high school football team.

""This [artwork] is another public statement that the life and death of George Floyd is not in vain"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said during the dedication ceremony adding that the image of Floyd begging for life as an officer dug his knee into the back of his neck ""is still being resonated throughout the globe.""

Members of Floyd's family were on hand to help dedicate the massive mural on Alabama Street in Houston's Third Ward neighborhood.

""This means a lot to my family and I know it would mean a lot to my uncle"" Floyd's niece Bianca Williams said of the mural. ""Continue to stand with us. This is the beginning of a long fight united together stronger than ever.""

As the dedication ribbon was cut those in attendance said Floyd's name in unison and released red and gold balloons. The ceremony also featured a motorcycle procession and a performance by the Texas Southern University drumline.

The mural was created by local artist Jonah Elijah and was commissioned by Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis Houston Society for Change and 88 C.H.U.M.P. a nonprofit social activism organization launched by Floyd’s former high school football teammates.

A viral cellphone video of Floyd's fatal arrest on May 25 showed former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the back of Floyd's neck while he was handcuffed and prone on the ground next to a police patrol vehicle.

The footage showed Floyd repeatedly crying out ""I can't breathe"" until he went unconscious. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

All of the officers involved in the fatal arrest were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department and charged in Floyd's death. The officers confronted Floyd outside a grocery store after receiving a report that Floyd allegedly used a phony $20 bill to purchase cigarettes.

The release of the video on social media set off massive protests across the country and globe including several that led to looting and burning of businesses and violence directed at police.

Chavin was charged with second-degree murder. Former officers Kiernan Lane Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were all charged with second-degree aiding and abetting felony murder and second-degree aiding and abetting manslaughter in Floyd's death.

None of the officers have yet to enter a plea.

This third-person exploration area houses a huge number of the game’s customization items and gear and if they’re available in the Krypt you’re not going to find them in the other modes. The Krypt can be overwhelming when you first begin as it’s filled with secret passages multiple types of chests and puzzles but with our Mortal Kombat 11 Krypt guide you can make sense of it all and get the gear of your dreams.

How the Krypt works

The Mortal Kombat 11 Krypt is essentially an enormous dungeon filled with treasure and you’ve been invited to collect as much of it as you can afford. Running along the walls and in the middle of nearly every area you explore are chests that can be opened with the Koins currency you’ve been accruing over your time in the game’s other modes.

Recommended Videos

The cost of opening a chest in the Krypt is directly tied to the value of the items inside. A chest that costs 2000 Koins will contain minor items like development art or music while chests at or above around 8000 Koins can contain character-specific gear augmentation items or skins. You can acquire more Koins in the Krypt by smashing certain objects — more on that below — and by opening up new pathways but the primary way you will get more Koins is to go back into the Towers and fight against enemies.

There are two other currencies in the Krypt — Hearts and Soul Fragments. Hearts are used to open rare chests that can be spotted by the terrifying mask located above them. This must be smashed and then you can spend 250 Hearts to unlock the contents. These contain some of the best rewards in the entire game including several customization pieces for a character. To acquire Hearts you can perform Fatalities during matches and you can destroy the bodies found hanging in the Krypt itself using Scorpion’s Spear.

Soul Fragments are used to unlock the green Soul Chests that you’ll start encountering soon after you begin the Krypt. You’ll accrue these through normal play and occasionally for completing certain tasks in the Krypt but you won’t be able to use them to open Soul Chests until you’ve acquired Ermac’s Soul Amulet. Don’t worry about them until you’ve progressed further into the Krypt.

Key items to find

Much of your progress in the Krypt is tied to key items scattered through the sprawling map. These vary in use but are all tied to letting you continue progressing to new areas and unlocking better gear. Below we’ve detailed the most important items you’ll discover and what they allow you to do. They’re listed in order of when you should acquire them.

Shao Kahn’s Hammer

Shao Kahn’s Hammer is impossible to miss as it’s located directly in front of you as you first enter the Krypt. The hammer is what you’ll use to destroy damaged walls and doors and you’ll find one of each in the very same room. It’s crucial that you look for damaged areas as you progress as you’ll often find enormous rooms behind them loaded with treasure.

You can also use Shao Kahn’s Hammer to destroy pots and skeletons scattered throughout the Krypt. This will reward you with a small amount of Koins but it’s so trivial that it will make very little difference in how many chests you can open.

Gem of the Living and Cracked Horn of the Motaro

The Gem of the Living is a special item you need to progress further into the Krypt and enter Goro’s lair which is home to some of the best treasure in the game. When you’re in the outdoor area head to the center and then north until you see an area with statues of several characters. Progress forward and a meteorite will smash the Raiden statue. Hit the meteorite with your hammer to get the Gem of the Living.

The Cracked Horn of the Motaro is also needed to progress further into the Krypt and can only be acquired after already having the Gem of the Living. Use the Gem of the Living to open a door near Kronika’s Time Vault — and progress into the underground area. You’ll find the horn behind an unlockable gate inside. With the horn head to Goro’s Lair Door on the western part of the outdoor area and you can enter.

Ermac’s Soul Amulet

This is the item you need to unlock those pesky green glowing Soul Chests you’ve seen throughout the Krypt. Once you’ve made your way into Goro’s Lair progress until you reach an enormous hall that has a statue in the front and a feasting area. Go forward walk all the way around the outside using the stairs and in the front-right corner there will be a chain you can pull to open a gate. Do this progress until you get a cutscene showing a man getting impaled and locate him in the room. He has Ermac’s Soul Amulet and you can now open those chests.

Ermac’s Soul Amulet is also used to open up certain new pathways. You’ll use it for the first time to exit the room you found the amulet in which has caved in with rocks.

Spear of Hanzo Hasahi (Scorpion’s Spear)

Scorpion’s Spear can also be found inside Goro’s Lair but this time you’ll have to head to the Armory area on the southeast side. Once you’ve reached this area search until you find a flaming vertical line running along a pillar. Interact with it to pull the spear and equip it.

Once you have Scorpion’s Spear you can use it to interact with certain environmental objects including drawbridges. The main purpose of the spear however is to pull down the bodies you’ll find hanging above your position. These are destroyed and usually contain hearts that you need to open the Krypt’s valuable chests.

The Forge

You’ll occasionally find materials while opening chests that are not used for customization or for opening new pathways — these are called “Forge Items” and they can be found on their own page in the Krypt menu. For the beginning of your time in the Krypt they will be useless but you will eventually find a gong that you can hit with a hammer and open the path to the Forge – it’s an intimidating area with flames behind it but by feeding it the materials you’ve gathered you can produce rewards.

The rewards you get are based on the combination of materials you throw in but you can also get nothing from the Forge if you put in the wrong combination. If you throw three items in and it fails to yield a reward don’t do it again as the same result will happen every time.

Not only does the Forge need materials to produce anything but it also needs currency. This can take the form of Koins Soul Fragments and Hearts so make sure your combination of materials is going to produce something valuable before you throw them into the Forge.

We’ve reached the final round of play from the 2021 Waste Management Phoenix Open. Here’s everything you need to know to watch the final round of action from TPC Scottsdale on Sunday.

Waste Management Phoenix Open final round preview

Folks this is not a drill. Jordan Spieth is tied for the 54-hole lead at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Just weeks after reports surfaced that the three-time major champion had spoken with legendary coach Butch Harmon about his swing Spieth heads into Sunday in the final group.

The 27-year-old is in contention largely thanks to an unconscious bogey-free Saturday 61. Spieth racked up 10 birdies on the afternoon including six on the back nine to move to 18 under for the week and in a tie with Xander Schauffele for the Saturday lead.

Of course any Sunday charge from Spieth will also mean outlasting Schauffele who has been tremendous of late. Schauffele hasn’t finished worse than T17 since the beginning of the 2021 PGA Tour season in August and is riding a streak of consecutive top-5 finishes into Sunday at the WMPO. The former PGA Tour rookie of the year is looking for his first win since January 2019 in Scottsdale Sunday.

Xander Schauffele started the day off slowly under the beautiful Scottsdale sky with only one birdie on the front-nine but caught fire on the back with a four-hole stretch of three birdies and an eagle on the par-five 15th hole. Schauffele finished the day bogey-free and sits atop the leaderboard by one stroke at 12-under par.

U.S. Ryder Cup Captain Steve Stricker is one shot off the pace bagging six birdies to go along with one bogey and finds himself with a real chance to become the oldest PGA TOUR winner in history at 53. Keegan Bradley also is one off the lead at 11-under par and had a feverish front nine with five birdies before adding two more on the back – the only blemish coming on the par-5 15th where he found the water.

“The People’s Open” is far from a three-man race with Scottie Scheffler Kyoung-Hoon Lee and Sam Burns locked into a three-way tie for fourth place at 10-under par. Burns kept some of his momentum rolling from his seven-under finish yesterday with an eagle on his third hole this morning while Lee continued his consistent play by finishing five-under for the second day in a row. Scheffler had a mixed bag today taking a double on No. 5 but still finished six-under par on the evening after eagling the par-4 17th hole.

Other notable scores from Friday’s second round –

Thursday’s leader Matthew NeSmith fell to being tied for eighth at eight-under after a rough finish to the day. NeSmith finished even on the day after a back nine that included a triple bogey on the 18th hole along with back-to-back bogeys on 10 and 11.

2015 Waste Management Phoenix Open Champion Brooks Koepka had a strong showing today finishing at five-under par after consecutive birdies on 56 and 7. Koepka is part of the eight-way tie for eighth that includes NeSmith three-time Major champion Jordan Spieth and former FedEx Cup Champion Billy Horschel.

Among those who didn’t make this years cut at two-under par are three former WMPO Champions – Rickie Fowler (2019) Gary Woodland (2018) and J.B. Holmes (2006 2008). Fowler finished Friday’s round even while Woodland and Holmes finished one-over par.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDcvZ3JlZW4tZ29waGVyLXJlbW90ZS1jb250cm9sLWJvYXQtd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1waG9lbml4LW9wZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,So about that gopher in the remote control boat at the Phoenix Open,"SCOTTSDALE Ariz. — You’ve probably seen the little guy cruising around on his remote control boat during the TV coverage of the Waste Management Phoenix.

His name is the Green Gopher. Sometimes he wears a headband. This year he’s donning a mask. On Super Bowl Sunday he’ll sport some sort of NFL gear although his official spokesman would divulge nothing further so as to not spoil the surprise. A mini TB12 jersey perhaps? Again no secrets could be revealed.

For viewers on TV or fans at the course he’s probably just a fun gimmick a slick way for Waste Management to get some airtime for its logo.

But in reality the Green Gopher officially the Waste Management Recycling Ambassador has an actual job: to buzz around the lake and scare the birds away from the giant floating WM on the 18th hole although Golfweek can confirm that the Green Gopher’s boat no longer shoots water at the birds.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- A man found shot to death Saturday morning outside a north Houston apartment complex may have been struck hours before his body was discovered authorities said.

It happened in the 500 block of Wells Fargo Drive sometime overnight.

The man's body was found with a gunshot wound near the front gate of the complex according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.

A woman living in the complex spotted the man's body around 7:45 a.m. Saturday and called 911. Witnesses told deputies they heard what they believed to be a gunshot around midnight but they weren't sure if it was related to the man's death.

The victim a man between 25 and 30 years old did not have any identification investigators said. They were still working to find out who he was. He was wearing a green hoodie and gray Nike shorts.

Detectives were reviewing surveillance video in the area to find out what happened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbGVuZGlzdHJ5LWZpbGxzLWdhcC1taW5vcml0eS1vd25lZC1idXNpbmVzc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lendistry Fills the Gap for Minority-Owned Businesses,"The state of California is set to deploy $475 million in Covid relief funding for small businesses extending what could be a lifeline for many business owners.



More than half of the applicants already selected for the program are minority-owned and nearly half are woman-owned. Through this equity-focused funding California could help stave off further widening of the racial wealth gap.



And one local Black-owned lender is helping make it all possible.



B.S.D. Capital Inc. which does business as Lendistry is a hybrid between a financial technology company and a traditional small business lender. It is also a Community Development Financial Institution that provides loans and other capital to underserved small businesses such as minority-owned businesses and those in low-income areas.

The downtown-based company was built according to founder and Chief Executive Everett Sands to address the fallout from a pernicious issue in the American financial system — the decline of community banking.



Sands began his career at a small Baltimore-based Black community bank. Ironically it was only after moving to banking giant Wells Fargo & Co. that he began to appreciate how serious the issue of community bank decline could be.



Large banks like Wells Fargo provide capital for loans at smaller banks that might not have the cash on hand to otherwise execute the deals. The process is mutually beneficial because it helps large banks put their massive deposit volumes to work while enabling smaller banks to serve customers they would otherwise have to turn away.



“We were probably financing a billion dollars a week (for those smaller institutions)” Sands said. “If 10% to 20% of (those community banks go) away that is a huge vacuum created.”



Over time a 10% to 20% decline in community banks would prove overly optimistic. Spurred on by factors such as increasing technological demands and a shifting regulatory landscape community bank numbers have been dwindling for decades.



In 1990 there were more than 15000 commercial banks and savings institutions in the United States according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Today that number is just over 5000. Most of the banks lost over this period have been smaller community institutions.



“One of the things that I remembered from econ class was supply and demand” Sands said. “If you ever ask why small businesses aren’t being funded or aren’t able to get capital that’s why.”



Beyond fintech

Sands’ initial plan to address these issues centered on building a fintech company. But the Lendistry founder said he soon realized that pieces of the typical fintech model didn’t suit the task at hand.



“The cost of acquisition was really high for a fintech company” Sands said referring to the cost a business pays to recruit new customers.



“Also the cost of funding was really high” he added referring to the costs associated with getting capital from financial institutions to make new loans. These high capital costs result in high lending costs for borrowers according to Sands which can become onerous for some small businesses.



Sands also said the risk management process for many fintech companies didn’t align with the type of underserved small business lending he wanted to focus on with his new company.



“The small business customer is more like an individual than a commercial customer” he said. “With small businesses they just don’t have the assets (to back up a loan). You can’t foreclose on groceries.”



What the fintech model did have according to Sands was a strong ability to channel customers to the financial products that were best for them.



“Sometimes it’s as simple as ‘What do you want to spend the money on?’” he said. “Sometimes it is a lot more complicated. There is a lot that you can do with data.”



Fintechs also had what Sands described as a “more scalable experience” meaning a more systematized ability to grow their platforms and customer bases across a broader audience.



Sands ultimately decided to try and carve a path somewhere between a fintech and a traditional community lender. He hired a mixed team of former community bankers — recently displaced by mergers and acquisitions in their sector — and technologists.

“We had to literally take years and sit down and think about every point of this” he said.



The result was what Sands described as a “hybrid institution” taking many of the traditional focuses of a community lender paired with the data-crunching technology of a fintech.



The value of this novel approach was recently highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic.



Initiatives like the federal Paycheck Protection Program alongside other state and local measures have been rolled out over the last year to prevent small businesses from going under amid shutdowns and other restrictions.



Despite the good intentions these programs faced issues ensuring that funding reached the groups most in need. Large banks with the ability to distribute capital on behalf of governments did not have relationships with many small businesses in desperate need of funds or effective ways to identify and engage those businesses.



Filling the gap

Lendistry’s niche in technology-driven small business lending lined up with this gap. Over the last year Sands said the company has worked with 12 different state governments to issue PPP funds as well as administering eight different grant programs for county and state governments.



Lendistry has deployed hundreds of millions of dollars to small businesses through these programs to date according to Sands.



As part of these initiatives the downtown-based lender was commissioned by the California Office of the Small Business Advocate to be the official administrator of the state’s $475 million Small Business Covid-19 Relief Grant Program.



The program is designed to target many of the underserved businesses that slipped through the cracks with the PPP. It was divided into two rounds the first of which opened on Dec. 30.



“We processed 344000 applications in 15 days” Sands said. “We were like ‘Oh boy. It works but it’s scary.’”



Some 21000 businesses were selected in the first round of the grant program. Of these 77% were underserved and disadvantaged small businesses such as those owned by minority groups or in low-income areas according to CalOSBA.



The second round which opened on Feb. 2 will select a similar number of recipients with similar equity targets in mind.



While the situation remains precarious for many of California’s small businesses Sands said he is optimistic that funding like this will help many make it through the tough months ahead.



“The bad is that we are in a pandemic. There is suffering and there is deep deep need” Sands said. “The good is that the small businesses never took a break. They are the most resilient people in California by far.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tdGhlc2UtMi1zdG9ja3MtY291bGQtY2xpbWItYXQtbGVhc3QtMzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo: These 2 Stocks Could Climb at Least 30% - TipRanks.com,"After January’s sell-off February’s first week of trading saw the stock market firmly back in bull mode. All 3 major indexes closed off the week at or at touching distance from all-time highs as the market reacted favorably to the latest job data and the Democrats’ decision to move forward with a $1.9 trillion stimulus package.

So where is the market heading next?

Investment firm Wells Fargo sees long-term appreciation ahead for the stock markets. Attempting to peer into the future Wells Fargo’s senior global equity strategist Scott Wren says “Playing into our expectation for a meaningful bounce back from the pandemic-induced contraction of last year are factors we have discussed in the past and we believe will continue to be the drivers this year. Positive vaccine news easy money policies being pursued by the Federal Reserve and additional anticipated government stimulus have all helped the stock market…”

Against this backdrop Wells Fargo analysts are pounding the table on two stocks noting that each could surge at least 30% in the year ahead. After running the two through TipRanks’ database we found out that the rest of the Street is also standing squarely in the bull camp.

Guild Holdings (GHLD)

The stock market may get more headlines but real estate is where most Americans hold their wealth. The two markets intersect when real estate companies go public. Guild Holdings is a mortgage company originating selling and servicing home loans in the US residential mortgage sector. The company has a footprint across most of the States and operates through retail and word-of-mouth channels.

The San Diego-based company held its IPO last year in the latter half of October. The opening was only moderately successful with the stock holding at or near $15 below the $17 planned. Guild Holdings sold 6.5 million shares which was below the 8.5 million anticipated. The IPO raised $97.5 million and the company boasts a current market cap ofreiterate our Overweight rating on GHLD. $972.6 million.

Looking ahead Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti thinks the company is well-positioned to benefit in the current climate.

“Despite rising interest rates we believe management struck a confident posture that their business model should hold up relatively well given their purchase/retail orientation. There is also opportunity to fill in their branch footprint in areas such as the Northeast. The rising 10-year yield has shifted investor sentiment further negative for originators” the analyst opined.

In this environment Fandetti continues to “favor value and purchase mkt exposure” hence his bullish take on the stock.

In line with these comments Fandetti rates GHLD an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and his $22 price target indicates a potential for 36% upside growth in the year ahead. (To watch Fandetti’s track record click here)

Similarly the rest of the Street is getting onboard. 4 Buys and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months add up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. The stock is selling for $16.21 and its $19.30 average price target implies a 19% one-year upside. (See GHLD stock analysis on TipRanks)

PDC Energy (PDCE)

Next up PDC Energy is a hydrocarbon producer based in Denver Colorado. The company has operations in the Wattenberg Field of its home state as well as the Delaware Basin of the Texas Permian oil formation. PDC produces oil natural gas and natural gas liquids through an aggressive horizontal drilling program.

PDC saw revenues slip in 1Q20 and slip farther in the second quarter – but the top-line moved in the right direction in Q3. The company brought in $303 million that quarter and on an adjusted basis showed a profit of $1.04 per share. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter report due out at the end of February the company is expected to show 92 cents per share in earnings.

In some additional positive metrics PDC produced a total of 192000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter for a total of 17.7 million Boe. The company generated net cash from operations of $280 million and saw a free cash flow of $225 million. During Q3 PDC was able to pay down $215 million worth of debt.

Analyst Thomas Hughes in his note on the stock for Wells Fargo is impressed by the company’s free cash flow and potential for future production.

“FCF generation will drive absolute debt below $1.5bn by the end of 1Q21 per our model an important figure as shareholder returns (buybacks first) are predicated on this achievement… As debt falls below $1.5bn the company will likely take a formulaic approach to distributing FCF… While heightened CO regulatory risk exists PDCE has been successful building a backlog of permits and DUCs for forward development” Hughes wrote.

To this end Hughes rates the stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and his $33 price target shows his confidence in a 30% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Hughes’ track record click here)

It’s not often that the analysts all agree on a stock so when it does happen take note. PDCE’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 10 Buys. The stock’s $27.90 average price target suggests a 10% and a change from the current share price of $25.35. (See PDCE stock analysis on TipRanks)

One Subject Remains at Large

Anchorage Alaska – U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder announced Friday that two Anchorage men were sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Ralph R. Beistline for their roles in the December 4 2019 armed robbery of an Anchorage Wells Fargo Bank branch on Debarr Rd.

Totoe Opeti Sakaria Jr. 24 and co-defendant Brandon David McDonald 24 both of Anchorage were indicted by the grand jury in December 2019 for their roles in the armed robbery and have been detained without bail since December 10 2019. Sakaria pleaded guilty to bank robbery and use of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence in October 2020 and was sentenced Thursday to 126 months in prison. McDonald pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact to bank robbery in October 2020 and was sentenced Friday to 28 months in prison.

According to documents filed in the case on Dec. 4 2019 two masked men entered the Wells Fargo bank on Debarr Road during business hours. One of them later identified as Sakaria pointed a shotgun at patrons and employees while demanding that everyone get on the ground. The other man who has not been identified approached a teller and demanded money obtaining $2624. As Sakaria and the other man left the bank Sakaria struck a security guard in the head with the buttstock of his shotgun causing serious injury to the guard. Sakaria and the unidentified coconspirator subsequently met with McDonald who was aware the two had committed the bank robbery and agreed to hide the shotgun and clothing used in its commission. On December 6 2019 FBI special agents recovered the shotgun from the crawlspace of McDonald’s residence.





Sakaria and McDonald were identified as suspects after still photos from surveillance footage were released to the public via Nixle alerts and the media. The coconspirator remains at large.

If the public has any information regarding the coconspirator who robbed the bank with Sakaria please contact Anchorage FBI at (907) 276-4441.

In sentencing Sakaria to a term of 126 months followed by 3 years of supervised release the court noted the terrifying nature of the crime for the bank patrons and employees Sakaria’ s dangerous use of a shotgun and the rapid succession of serious crimes Sakaria committed in 2019 including a vehicle theft conviction from the State of Alaska. The Court also ordered Sakaria to pay $7652 in restitution for the loss to Wells Fargo Bank and the cost of medical care and worker’s compensation insurance for the injured security guard.

In sentencing McDonald to a term of 28 months followed by 3 years of supervised release Judge Beistline emphasized the foolishness of McDonald’s decision to help the robbers. McDonald has pending felony charges from the State of Alaska stemming from a May 2019 armed robbery and a February 2019 failure to stop at the direction of an officer.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Anchorage Police Department (APD) conducted the investigation leading to the successful prosecution of this case. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison O’Leary.

This case was brought as part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) the centerpiece of the Department of Justice’s violent crime reduction efforts. PSN is an evidence-based program proven to be effective at reducing violent crime. Through PSN a broad spectrum of stakeholders work together to identify the most pressing violent crime problems in the community and develop comprehensive solutions to address them. As part of this strategy PSN focuses enforcement efforts on the most violent offenders and partners with locally based prevention and reentry programs for lasting reductions in crime.

Lead single “Kyoto” came first traveling from playful to stratospheric thanks to a horn section and an expanded edition of Bridgers’ live band. But the more talked-about moment was easily her second song the acclaimed album-closer “I Know the End.” It’s a beautifully cathartic epic that was named one of XPN’s favorite songs of 2020 and Bridgers took it over the edge after the culminating scream by smashing her Danelectro on the center stage wedge monitor; sparks flew the instrument was chucked aside and screams were heard in the studio and no doubt in living rooms around the country.

The WD DashBoard is a free tool available here that shouldn’t be overlooked; it is the best in the business by a stretch. Were you aware that turning on game mode when the software is active has been shown to increases SSD speeds? Not many did.

Not only does the WD Dashboard watch over the health of your SSD along with its ability to measure performance upgrade firmware and a number of other things but it also has an RGB Setting that works great with the WD_Black D50.

It has 13 different effects which coordinate with millions of colors but also it can sync with the RGB settings of several mainstream 3rd party motherboard manufacturers.

REPORT SUMMARY AND FINAL THOUGHTS

We have reviewed a ton of Thunderbolt 3 docks throughout the years and well I have to say nothing compares to the WD_Black D50 1TB NVMe SSD Gaming Dock. There is just so much we can say about the D50 but the thing that stands out most is its extreme performance. Western Digital has somehow reached Thunderbolt 3 performance of 3118MB/s read and 2677MB/s write. To the best of our knowledge nothing has ever even come close to this.

The D50 was built for gamers first most and D50’s ability to pull that performance out of the internal SSD is incredible. For my needs as a media professional however this couldn’t have come at a better time. Being able to add an 8TB storage area that connects to each and every Tbt3 system I have is incredible and only possible as this is the ONLY dock that we are aware of in the world that has four Type-C ports and then an additional three Type-A ports that run at 10Gb/s. It has active cooling. It has RGB that syncs with our own system as it sits right now. It eliminates the need for the laptop or ultra power brick when it is plugged into it as it can provide up to 87W to the PC. This is how we have it set up to best suit what we do in the office.

It is connected to the PC and laptop. It is charging two phones and it also runs our ProGrade CFExpress Thunderbolt 3 Card reader at up to 1700MB/s along with its little brother CFExpress/SDXC Card reader at up to 1000MB/s. You would have to look close but the Deep Orange RGB of the D50 is sync’d to our system RGB of the same pattern and motion. Price. We will be the first to admit this is a bit more than your typical dock but this is anything but. This is typical WD_Black. Connect command and control. Editor’s Choice.

Yet while their unit sales are dropping sales are still strong at nearly 139 million units per year. In fact capacities and exabytes shipments of client HDDs are setting records.

Unit sales of all hard drives for all kinds of applications totaled 259.81 million units in 2020 a 13.9% drop year over year according to data from Trendfocus (via StorageNewsletter).

Despite the rapidly growing popularity of SSDs in the consumer PC space — particularly among enthusiasts — hard drives for desktops and notebooks represent the largest HDD category in terms of units sold. Last year the industry shipped 54.46 million hard drives for desktops as well as 84.42 million HDDs for notebooks. While unit sales of client PC HDDs are dropping their average capacity is increasing which is why the capacity of all client HDDs totaled 266 exabytes in Q4 2020.

Seagate was the undisputed market leader last year with a 42.7% market share and 110.96 million HDDs shipped. Western Digital followed its rival with 96 million drives and 37% of the market while Toshiba was a distant third with 20.3% of the market and 52.8 million units sold.

Since capacities of SSDs shipped in new PCs are sometimes insufficient many people buy external direct-attached storage (DAS) devices with 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch HDDs inside. Such DAS devices are usually classified as consumer electronics (CE) drives so they fall into the same category as game consoles and digital video recorders. In total 49.05 million CE HDDs were sold last year the data from Trendfocus shows. Unfortunately it is unclear what exactly (apart from retail DAS and various DVRs) the company includes in the 3.5-inch CE category.

All the hard drives supplied by these three manufacturers in 2020 could store 1081.32 exabytes of data which seems to be up compared to 2019 and 2018.

Speaking of exabytes. 3.5-inch hard drives for servers enterprise and nearline applications commanded over 62% of exabytes shipments last year. In total the three manufacturers shipped 59.22 million of such HDDs last year an increase of 11.8% year over year. Meanwhile the 2.5-inch enterprise-grade hard drives market is dying. It dropped to 12.66 million units in 2020 a decline of 27.9% year-over-year.

The year 2020 brought no surprises to the HDD market. The general trend of lower unit sales and higher exabyte sales was set several years ago and it continued in 2020. Meanwhile many of HDD categories that exist today including 2.5-inch HDDs for clients servers and CE are set to either decline dramatically or actually cease to exist in the coming years as SSDs replace them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBob2Jsb2dyYXBoZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMDYvbTQzLXJ1bGVzLWluLWphcGFuLW5vdy1vbS1kaWdpdGFsLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1uZWVkcy10by1jcmFjay10aGUtd2VzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M4/3 Rules In Japan Now OM Digital Solutions Needs To Crack the West,"Spread the love

OM Digital Solutions and Panasonic need to crack markets in Europe and the US with their M4/3 cameras.

We have always known that M4/3 cameras from Olympus (now OM Digital Solutions) and Panasonic have been hot sellers in their homeland. But we didn’t know the M4/3 mount was popular enough to take the top spot on the most popular mount charts for 2020. This will come as a huge boon to OM Digital Solutions. It will also give JIP the investment firm that purchased Olympus a huge boost of confidence in their acquisition. This is all fine and dandy but OM Digital Solutions and Panasonic still need to find a way to crack western photography markets. Let’s talk about this after the break.

A press statement from OM Digital solutions gives both themselves and Panasonic a large pat on the back for a job well done. In 2020 M4/3 cameras accounted for a 21.7% share of the Japanese camera market. This is actually rather impressive as Sony and Canon seemed dominant according to previous CIPA reports. Still this news should come as no surprise really. Japanese consumers have always tended to like small compact cameras (something where Micro Four Thirds cameras excel). This is all well and good but there’s still so much work to be done. OM Digital Solutions and even Panasonic need to become bigger players outside of the Japanese market when it comes to Micro Four Thirds.

M4/3 Could Be So Much More

Captured with the Olympus OM-D E-M1 III

Just how can both OM Digital Solutions and Panasonic bring success from Japan to the west? Well that’s the million-dollar question isn’t it? For whatever reason the vast majority of photographers think M4/3 cameras simply can’t cut it. This is a real shame. I use Olympus branded cameras (OM-D E-M1 III) in my professional life and have zero issues with them. I love the images I produce with the cameras and lenses. My clients never have any issues with the images I produce either. I know professional photographers who use Panasonic M4/3 cameras who have no complaints. The stigma around the system is unwarranted but YouTubers and others have claimed the system isn’t worth investing in.

However It’s Time for Some Upgrades

One thing both OM Digital Solutions and Panasonic need to do is use some new technology. At this point the sensors in the Olympus E-M1 III the E-M5 III the Panasonic G9 GH5 and GH5s are older than dirt. That’s not to say they’re bad; they’re not. Still the lack of advancement with regard to sensors is hurting the platform especially when so many photographers are tech heads these days. Six years is far too long to go without introducing a new sensor. Other upgrades to the cameras (especially pro-level models) like higher resolution EVF’s are necessary as well. Going back to using the E-M1 III after using some of the newer models from Canon and Sony is jarring. Overall it’s the perceived lack of progress that’s hampering the platform outside of Japan.

Captured with the Olympus 40-150mm f2.8 Pro

When the likes of Sony Canon heck even Nikon show that steps are being made forward every other week it’s disconcerting to see Olympus and Panasonic M4/3 cameras standing still. The messaging around marketing needs to be improved too. The Micro Four Thirds platform has been going after a very niche segment of the market. Panasonic and OM Digital Solutions need to give the platform a much broader appeal.

There Needs to Be Diversification

Yes M4/3 cameras are great for birding wildlife and sports. However they are great for so many more genres: I know from personal experience. Market the cameras in a way that appeals to all photographers. Show them what the cameras can do. I love using Micro Four Thirds cameras for portraiture yet portrait photography is never mentioned in any marketing. They are fantastic for street and event photography too. I think to win over the American market you need to show that Micro Four Thirds cameras can do it all just like Canon Sony and Co. show that their cameras are great all-rounders. We all want that one camera that’s good at everything. As I said above niche markets are on their way out.

We’re rooting for OM Digital Solutions Panasonic and Micro Four Thirds cameras in general. We applaud your success in Japan. We just hope that you can get the rest of the world to see the value in your platform; otherwise the future may not be so rosy. What do you think OM Digital Solutions and Panasonic need to do to make M4/3 cameras more successful outside of Japan?

TRIBUTES have been paid to a “community stalwart” who passed away over the weekend. 66-year-old Micky McMahon died suddenly on Sunday. Micky was a life-long community activist and founding member of the Whiterock-Westrock Residents’ Association.

Throughout the years he tirelessly campaigned for improved housing and infrastructure for local residents and was among those who fought for a new playpark and community garden in the area. Whiterock-Westrock Residents’ Association Chair Al McComb said the community was Micky McMahon.

“I met Micky over 40 years ago when he was working for the DoE” he said. “Loud funny and resourceful Micky had a laugh for every adversity most times not even realising it. He also had the most generous nature and attitude which he brought with him to the Residents’ Association which he helped form.

“Our community was very much a different place then and needed determined and committed people to help tackle the multitude of issues which impacted heavily on his community.” He continued: “Micky was committed to see positive changes not just for the area but especially for families. I have so many many memories even our phone calls became marathons as he asked about everyone and everything ≠ getting a word in as usual was a task .

“He overcame many issues with his health over all the years but never let them hinder him. Micky knew everyone he had a contact to resolve every issue and a knack to get the best deal possible without losing friends. “He was first to run and help anyone in need or distress.”

Al described Micky as a “family man” who was “totally dedicated” to his wife kids brothers and sisters. “On behalf of all in our Whiterock-Westrock Residents Association and our community I offer our genuine and deepest condolences to Micky’s wife Anne his children Michael Stephen Leanne and Lisa Micky’s brothers and sisters and the entire McMahon family.”

Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said: “Micky was a community stalwart. A man we were lucky to have in this area and a man whose heart will always be in the Whiterock area.

“We will miss him greatly.” The Whiterock Westrock Historical and Cultural Society expressed “deep regret” at Micky’s passing adding: “He will be sadly missed by his many friends in the Westrock/Whiterock areas we have lost a great friend and neighbour. “Thoughts and prayers are with Ann and the McMahon family at this sad time.”

Micky McMahon’s Requiem Mass was held on Thursday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Surging ESG-driven investing is drawing greater regulator scrutiny with Nasdaq recently proposing new board diversity disclosure requirements said Hamlin a securities attorney who has two decades of experience counseling corporate boards and executives of public companies in the Twin Cities and across the country.

Hamlin and others in different practice areas at the firm — which has 15 offices and more than 650 lawyers — have long been advising clients on sustainability workforce composition management diversity labor standards and pay equity among other issues that now fall under the ESG umbrella.

Just as online presence once an afterthought has become ubiquitous the focus on how companies behave and whether it is consistent with what consumers employees and investors expect will grow more widespread Hamlin said.

""It's going to be more of a multi-headed constituency model where pursuing the last penny for shareholders is not necessarily the goal"" Hamlin said. ""You're going to start to see everybody having an ESG program. That's what you're going to see in five years just like every company now has a website.""

Emerging growth and startup companies in cities where Ballard Spahr has offices are driving the ESG focus Hamlin said. ""Startups younger companies get this as kind of an ethos thing"" Hamlin said. ""It's helping them benchmark where they're at vs. their peers to compete for talent to compete for business and to compete for customers.""

Hamlin who has a law degree from what is now Mitchell Hamline School of Law co-leads the ESG Working Group with attorney Kahlil Williams in the firm's Philadelphia office.

Q: How has interest in ESG progressed during your practice?

A: It started 15 years ago at least when you talk about sustainable investing and socially conscious investing. Then environmentalism and sustainability programs and now leading up to diversity and inclusion as a component of ESG. The treatment of whistleblowers is another component.

Those things are all jelling together as a unified body of how to think about evaluate and for consumers [to] make buying decisions.

Q: What are your responsibilities in helping to lead Ballard's ESG Group?

A: Our primary responsibilities are to make sure that we're sharing within the firm all of the learning on this topic and the advice we've been giving to clients. Making sure clients understand that we have these capabilities. Some clients that are very up on this topic want help seeing around corners to know what is the next trend in ESG and how does their company stack up. For a big chunk of folks in the middle it's trying to do something that's appropriate for their company and for what they do.

Q: Are any of the emerging growth companies and startups among your clients that have made ESG central to their business located in the Twin Cities?

A: Plenty of them are. It's a big thing here in the Twin Cities. It's cutting across all facets of ESG. Some clients' thing is ag tech where they're coming up with new ways to grow food more efficiently with greater ability to be transported and using less water and less chemicals.

I have others who are more socially focused. One client is focused on artist development and having arts immersion and arts in the community. Folks in the fintech space med-tech those all have their won takes on ESG.

Las Vegas’ skyline has never been stable.

In the ’90s and 2000s the desert oasis-themed properties built during the city’s mob era were demolished to make room for bigger more lavish properties. Wynn Las Vegas replaced the Desert Inn the Bellagio was built on the ashes of the Dunes and The Venetian now offers gondola rides where the Sands once stood.

Demolition has been one of Las Vegas’ go-to methods for a refresh but certain aspects of Las Vegas’ skyline today will be here to stay thanks to a condominium trend that started in the 2000s. Real estate experts say the individually owned units inside the properties will make them difficult to tear down.

“Las Vegas does have a history of reinventing itself over the years. The market has seen a number of properties being torn down in an effort to replace it with something bigger better and more innovative” Applied Analysis partner Brian Gordon said. “For those locations that have these individually owned condominium units that development alternative becomes much more challenging.”

‘Difficult to tear down’

A dozen-plus high-rise condo buildings are spread across the tourist corridor. Some — like Turnberry Towers and Juhl — are purely residential. Others are attached to hotels like Palms MGM Signature Trump International Vdara and Waldorf Astoria.

Gordon said the hotel-condo trend first took off in Las Vegas in the early- and mid-2000s when land value and construction costs were soaring.

Developers needed to find a way to help finance their projects and condos offered a simple solution. Properties could sell individual units to frequent travelers who agreed to put their unit back in the rental pool a certain number of times throughout the year.

“Costs were escalating land values were elevated and demand for Las Vegas amenities and resort properties was high” Gordon said. The “for-sale condominium component (helped) fund that infrastructure.”

That financing trend died out when the market came crashing down during the Great Recession. Dreams of the “Manhattanization” of Las Vegas faltered as several planned high-rise mixed-use properties were nixed in the mid-2000s. Other projects pivoted operations: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for instance canceled condominium sales in 2008 and converted the units into hotel rooms after its original developer defaulted on a loan and Deutsche Bank took over.

While there are fewer condominium properties in Las Vegas than originally planned those that did make it to completion seem to be here to stay.

“Those properties will be more and more difficult to tear down” said Uri Vaknin a partner at private equity firm KRE Capital LLC who oversees five condominium properties in Las Vegas. “You have to get almost complete buy-in from ownership based on Nevada law.”

Layer to Las Vegas’ history

Gordon said condominiums “add an additional layer of complexity” to Las Vegas’ redevelopment activities. He expects the city’s current condominium towers to be around for at least the next decade.

Their longevity could be good for Las Vegas Vaknin said. As the chair of The Neon Museum’s board of trustees Vaknin said the buildings could help bolster the city’s architectural history.

“As we’ve matured as a city … we’re also seeing the importance of the history of our city” he said. “Part of what we know about Las Vegas is it is constantly evolving. At the same time we want to keep some of the stuff that makes Las Vegas Las Vegas. We don’t want to lose our identity.”

Brendan Bussmann of research and management consulting firm Global Market Advisors said these mixed-use properties have loyal customers who prefer the space and amenities compared with the traditional hotel offerings.

“There are individuals out there that … enjoy that product” he said. “Some people want that larger (room) that has a kitchen” when they visit Las Vegas.

Vaknin added that many of the condo-hotel hybrids lack the heavily-themed designs seen in other structures which could help them avoid going out of fashion longer.

“There will always be (demolitions)” Vaknin said but “I don’t think a place like CityCenter will be obsolete for decades and decades to come.”

Spokespeople for MGM Resorts which owns 50 percent of CityCenter declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for Red Rock Resorts which owns Palms Place also declined to comment.

Las Vegas: a ‘unique market’

Unlike the historic high-rises in New York or Chicago many structures in Las Vegas last just decades.

The Landmark was open 26 years before it was imploded. Dune’s South Tower was around for only 15. Desert Inn’s Palms Tower lasted seven.

For a city used to seeing buildings toppled over after only a few decades condominiums could throw a wrench in the city’s’ go-to method for a face-lift.

“We’re accustomed to seeing properties torn down after a few decades” Gordon said. “That seems to be something that’s fairly unique to this particular market given the evolutionary nature of the resort industry as a whole.”

Perhaps no one knows this better than Mark Loizeaux president of Controlled Demolition Inc. The Maryland-based business has been tearing down Las Vegas resorts since the Dunes implosion in 1993.

Loizeaux orchestrates implosions all over the country but Las Vegas has provided a steady stream of business over the years. The Riviera’s 2016 implosion was the company’s 28th or 29th Las Vegas project — at this point it’s hard to keep track.

“Las Vegas is a very unique market” Loizeaux said. “Nowhere else are people so aware of the value of time.”

Loizeaux said he has been approached with inquiries on three “iconic” Las Vegas structures in recent months but wasn’t able to share names because of nondisclosure agreements.

“I don’t see (implosions) immediately on the horizon” he said.

Despite redevelopment challenges tied to Las Vegas condos Gordon said the city will continue to evolve.

“These particular buildings will last much longer than we’ve seen among other sites up and down the Las Vegas Strip just by a function of their ownership” he said. “But that doesn’t mean other properties without a residential component won’t ultimately turn over or be redeveloped with time.”

Posted on: February 7 2021 12:28h.

Last updated on: June 7 2021 09:59h.

Resorts World Catskills is targeting the Newburgh Mall for a gaming space with video lottery terminals (VLTs).

The remaining Bon-Ton department stores like this one at the mall in Camillus New York went out of business in 2018. Their buildings have become attractive for casino operators the latest being Resorts World. (Image: The Post-Standard)

The casino resort owned by Malaysia-based Genting Group recently announced its plans to renovate a former Bon-Ton department store into a commercial gaming venue. The shopping center is located at the convergence of two major thoroughfares — Interstates 84 and 87.

Newburgh is roughly 60 miles north of New York City and 90 miles south of the Albany capital.

Developing a video gaming machine facility in Orange County has for many years been part of Resorts World’s long-term vision for Hudson Valley and the Catskills” a Genting statement first issued to the Times Herald-Record explained.

“It will create hundreds of good-paying unions jobs generate significant revenue for New York’s public schools and is an important step in ensuring the long-term sustainability of Resorts World Catskills” the release added.

Similar in appearance to classic slot machines or as simulated classic table games video lottery terminals are linked to a centralized system maintained by the New York Gaming Commission. Winning outcomes for VLTs are transmitted by the central system.

VLT Rights Came with Casino License

Empire Resorts a subsidiary of Genting acquired the Monticello Raceway in the Catskill Mountains in 1996. The racetrack offered VLTs until Resorts World opened in 2018.

Empire which is the immediate parent company to Resorts World Catskills was permitted by the New York Gaming Commission to relocate its VLT operations under its commercial casino licensing. Empire’s $1.2 billion bid beat out eight other submissions.

With Resorts World Catskills offering 1600 slot machines Empire closed VLT operations at the adjacent Monticello Raceway after the casino’s opening. Since then the company has been scouting locations for a new VLT venue. Company executives believe they’ve found an ideal spot at the Newburgh Mall.

The former Bon-Ton space measures 68877 square feet. It’s been occupied by a Jennifer Furniture outlet since August 1. The mall didn’t respond to inquiries regarding whether Jennifer plans to move out.

Empire will present its plans including how many VLTs it will include in the space to the Newburgh Town Board on February 22.

Casinos Rescue Malls

The mall business has been dying for many years. With online shopping at record levels brick-and-mortar stores and mall anchor tenants have closed in large numbers.

Regional casinos have recently targeted vacant malls.

In Pennsylvania three so-called satellite casinos are opening inside malls in Westmoreland York and State College.

Live! Casino Pittsburgh opened last year at the Westmoreland Mall in what was formerly a Bon-Ton. Penn National Gaming is renovating a former Sears store in York into what will become Hollywood Casino York. Bally’s is underway with plans to build a casino at the Nittany Mall near Penn State University.

The case which came during a busy year for arson investigators in the Twin Cities remains unsolved.

Developer Carl Kaeding who plans to start construction on the hotel anew said he continues to look for answers about why someone would have set the Seven Corners Gateway development project ablaze.

“I wish we knew more but I’m sure everybody wishes they did” he said recently. “… I’d like to know what the reasoning for it was if there was a reason.”

The case is among more than 160 fires in the Twin Cities investigated last year by the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives’ St. Paul field division.

“It was an unprecedented year for this division when it comes to fire investigation and arson” investigation according to Special Agent in Charge Terry Henderson who added that agents “worked around the clock for months to handle these scenes.”

Most of the arsons happened during the riots that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May. Separately the Aug. 4 arson in downtown St. Paul caused most of the under-construction five-story Courtyard by Marriott Hotel to collapse.

“Sometimes these investigations are complex and it takes time to get through all the evidence and conduct all the follow-up that needs to occur before we get to a resolution” Henderson said.

INVESTIGATORS WILL WORK CASE ‘AS LONG AS POSSIBLE’

Firefighters responded to the construction site blaze on Aug. 4 at about 4:20 a.m. The fire sent flames shooting into the air and debris was found miles away. Not only did it cause the hotel to mostly collapse it was hot enough to melt plastic on nearby stoplights. Even the Xcel Energy Center sign atop the building across the street was slightly damaged because of the blaze; it has since been repaired.

Fire crews reported seeing at least one person fleeing the fenced-in site according to a search warrant affidavit filed in Ramsey County District Court after the fire. The ATF said in August that there were “persons of interest” they were looking into.

Because the probe is ongoing the ATF says it can’t release additional information. Investigators will work on the case “as long as possible to bring it to a successful conclusion” Henderson said from his St. Paul office.

Arson investigations combine traditional law enforcement work — such as tracking down leads interviewing witnesses or suspects and looking for surveillance footage — with the science of fire investigations including analyzing how the fire started and determining whether an accelerant was used.

The U.S. attorney’s office of Minnesota has filed federal charges against more than 20 people in arsons in the Twin Cities that happened during civil unrest in May and August.

The ATF continues to ask anyone with information about the hotel fire or other arsons to contact them at 888-ATF-TIPS (888-283-8477).

WHY ATF INVOLVEMENT?

It’s not unusual for the ATF to get involved in fire investigations and it usually happens when local or state public safety agencies request their assistance Henderson said.

“A lot of times we will bring to bear our resources to assist them if there’s something in particular that they need” he said.

A special agent assigned to the ATF’s St. Paul office is a certified fire investigator and the agency can call on more ATF investigators as needed. They’re also able to bring in a regional ATF canine trained in detecting accelerants along with sending evidence for testing at one of the ATF’s forensic laboratories.

They came to St. Paul with about 20 members.

The team includes certified fire investigators electrical and fire protection engineers and chemists from the ATF’s Fire Research Laboratory among other experts said Henderson who joined them at the site.

It was the fifth National Response Team call-out to Minnesota last year — including two teams that responded after the series of arsons during the unrest in St. Paul and Minneapolis at the end of May. Before 2020 the national team had last been in Minnesota in 2004.

DESPITE FIRE PROJECT CONTINUES

St. Paul has worked for years to develop the Seven Corners Gateway area. It was a surface parking lot in a prime spot across from the Xcel Energy Center.

The St. Paul City Council meeting as the St. Paul Housing and Redevelopment Authority agreed to sell the 2.4-acre city-owned parcel — bounded by Kellogg Boulevard Smith Avenue and West Seventh and Fifth streets — to the Kaeding Development Group in April 2019 for $5 million.

The Kaeding Group is privately funding the $68 million project. The hotel comprises about 40 percent of the cost and most of the rest is for a 144-unit apartment building. A 40000-square-foot plaza is also planned for public and private events — it’s intended to draw fans on game and event days at the Xcel Energy Center when they can return after the coronavirus pandemic.

“This Gateway site is going to fundamentally change the way people experience downtown — it’s where people enter it’s where people leave” said council member Rebecca Noecker who represents the area. “This kind of development is exactly what we need on the site. To have a developer make that investment and then to have that devastating arson happen is just awful.”

Noecker said she’s grateful that Kaeding is sticking with the project and she’s been excited to see construction on the apartment building continue.

START FROM SCRATCH

The apartment building sustained very little damage and the apartments are on track to open in September said Carl Kaeding principal of Kaeding Development Group.

When the fire struck they were about nine months into construction of the hotel. The roof was on and most of the windows were installed. Now the hotel’s construction will essentially have to start from scratch. The process has been slower than Kaeding expected.

The insurance company has already made some payments and they’re finalizing other details with them he said.

“With everything going on around here and across the country (the insurance company has) been just inundated” Kaeding said. “I think they’re doing their best. It’s just taking awhile.”

Kaeding is looking at restarting hotel construction this spring and estimating it will take a year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNwci5vcmcvMjAyMS8wMi8wNy93aGF0LXdlLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtbGF1cmVuLWJvZWJlcnRzLWNhbXBhaWduLXBheW1lbnRzLXRvLWhlcnNlbGYtZm9yLWRyaXZpbmctMzgwMDAtbWlsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What We Know About Lauren Boebert's Campaign Payments To Herself For Driving 38000 Miles,"On Feb. 22 2021 the campaign of GOP Congresswoman Lauren Boebert amended its campaign finance filing for a mileage reimbursement. Our original story continues below.

Updated on Feb. 8 at 2:45 p.m.

Congresswoman Lauren Boebert’s campaign paid her $22259 in mileage reimbursements effectively claiming that Boebert had driven 38712 miles during the course of her campaign in 2020.

It’s a figure that raised eyebrows when it was first reported by The Denver Post with two groups requesting investigations of the freshman Republican representative’s apparently ambitious itinerary.

“$22000 is unheard of in my review of monetary reimbursement” said Kedric Payne general counsel and senior director of ethics for the Campaign Legal Center a nonpartisan nonprofit that fights the influence of money in politics.

To check Boebert’s claim CPR News analyzed the congresswoman’s public travel schedule and compared her spending to other candidates.

Here’s what we found.

129 destinations

CPR News documented 129 locations where Boebert’s campaign hosted a publicly advertised event or where her presence was documented on social media or by the news media.

The events ranged from Denver to Grand Junction Pueblo and numerous other smaller cities.

If she drove roundtrip from her home in the Western Slope town of Silt to each of those destinations Boebert would have accumulated about 30000 miles according to calculations performed with route-planning software.

Many of Lauren Boebert's campaign stops with most beginning and ending at her home in Silt Colo. The routes were generated by myrouteonline.com with a setting for ""fastest"" trip.

The analysis assumed that Boebert returned home each night but drove directly between events that were hosted on the same day. A similar review by The Denver Post tallied fewer miles in part because it only included Facebook events.

It's unclear whether the mileage billed includes one of the longer and highest-profile trips Boebert made during the campaign: to attend President Donald Trump’s 4th of July rally at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota shortly after she won the primary. If Boebert did bill that as a campaign expense it would account for roughly 1100 miles of the total.

Boebert’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment or proof of her mileage claim. In a statement to The Denver Post the campaign said that the candidate “traveled to every nook and cranny of the district to speak with and hear from the people about their concerns.”

The district is among the largest in the U.S. with nearly 50000 square miles covering roughly half of Colorado.

Other candidates’ travels

CPR News’ review found two candidates in other states who claimed more than $20000 in mileage expenses during the 2020 election cycle.

In California Republican candidate Tamika Hamilton claimed reimbursement equivalent to 43734 miles in the second half of 2020. In New York Democrat Tracy Mitrano claimed 39180 miles across 2019 and 2020.

“Forty thousand miles that would not surprise anybody Republican or Democrat in the New York 23rd Congressional district” Mitrano said.

A typical campaigning day might include 90 minutes of driving to a destination and even more to get around the city she said.

“I’ll regale you with names of towns you’ve never heard of before and probably never will again” Mitrano said.

She tracked the mileage with an app and by sharing her itinerary with her treasurer she said. Mitrano shared one of those internal forms with CPR showing the date itinerary and miles driven for each trip.

Boebert’s predecessor Republican Rep. Scott Tipton reported far less mileage totaling only about $10000 for all campaign travel expenses over the last decade. However he logged high mileage in his initial Congressional campaign in 2005 adding up to 17576 miles over six months.

Caitlyn Kim/CPR News Candidate Lauren Boebert speaks at a Gunnison County Republican event attended by Adam and Pat Mckee of Gunnison Aug. 23 2020.

Some of Boebert’s fellow Republicans have stepped to her defense including Rep. Ken Buck chair of the state party. Scott McInnis a former representative for the district told CPR News that he “routinely booked 70000 miles plus or minus each year.”

Nationwide at least 20 Congressional campaigns appeared to reimburse their candidates $10000 or more in mileage expenses according to a preliminary analysis of nearly 3000 campaigns conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics at the request of CPR News. That analysis tracked campaign payments for “mileage” to people with the candidate’s last name.

What happens next?

Two groups are raising questions about Boebert’s mileage. A liberal watchdog group Accountable.US has written to the Office of Congressional Ethics to request it look into what they call “exorbitant and questionable travel expenses.”

The Pueblo-based Rural Colorado United a political action committee that opposes Boebert also plans on sending letters this week asking the OCE and the Federal Election Commission to look into the mileage as well as her actions around the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.

“We’re trying to see if there was any correlation between [Boebert] and using those funds for the taxes that she owed [for her business]” said George Autobee co-founder of the Rural Colorado United. The Denver Post reported last summer that the state had filed around $20000 in liens against Boebert’s restaurant in Rifle. Boebert paid most of that off in October according to the site Colorado Newsline.

A third group the Campaign for Accountability a campaign finance watchdog group filed a complaint with the FEC late Monday.

“Rep. Boebert has not shown a mileage log to back up the claim that she needed this large amount of reimbursement for mileage. So we're basically asking her to show us her work” said Michelle Kuppersmith executive director for the Campaign for Accountability.

The group chose the FEC route because Kuppersmith said it’s “not an ethical violation right now. It’s straight up an FEC violation. That’s how we lay it out in the complaint.”

Boebert filed her mileage claims on two dates: She claimed on March 31 that she had driven about 1843 miles. About seven months later just after the election in November she claimed an additional 36869 miles.

Payne of the Campaign Legal Center said that unusual expenses can trigger the Federal Election Commission to conduct an audit or review but “it would be highly unlikely for them to do that simply because of a mileage situation. There would probably need to be more.”

Other enforcement agencies like the Justice Department also have jurisdiction over campaign finance questions. The example Payne used was former California Rep. Duncan Hunter who was convicted of misusing more than $250000 in campaign funds.

Payne said the issue is enforcement of financial disclosure rules to avoid “campaigns pushing the envelope or in any other way using the campaign as a slush fund because they are not in fear of the consequences from an enforcement action.”

For example travel expenses usually must be filed within 30 to 60 days after the expense was incurred Payne said; otherwise they can be considered a campaign contribution. Because Boebert filed a lump reimbursement request for mileage after the election miles driven earlier in the year may have been ineligible for reimbursement.

Michael Toner an election law expert with Wiley Rein LLP and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission in 2006 said it’s understandable.

“There’s often a lag time in terms of when these expenses are processed and submitted for reimbursement.”

For him the real issue when looking at mileage is magnitude versus plausibility. “It's one thing if you report you know $92 of travel expenses versus $99000 of travel expenses” he said. “How many miles are we talking about within what period of time and is it plausible for that to be done?”

If it’s plausible and bonafide campaign travel a candidate can be reimbursed Toner said. Filings are submitted under penalty of perjury he added.

Payne said there is a simple solution: a candidate could voluntarily offer an explanation and proof for the expenses. “Otherwise that amount of smoke is what pushes people to look for the fire.”

Kevin J. Beaty contributed data analysis to this story.

More than 100 firefighters responded to a fire near Fox Hollow Golf Course and Bear Creek Lake Park in Jefferson County on Sunday afternoon.

Propelled east by the wind the fire also prompted evacuations of a large swath of metro neighborhoods from C-470 east to Kipling Parkway and from U.S. 285 north to Morrison Road.

By about 4 p.m. West Metro Fire Rescue said they had most of the 446-acre fire under control and were extinguishing hot spots. It said 110 firefighters and 19 engines were on the scene after the fire broke out around 1 p.m.

Just after 6 p.m. the agency reported that the fire has been determined to be human-caused but said on Twitter that ""it's not known if it was accidental or intentional."" West Metro Fire Rescue requested anyone with information about how it started to call 303-539-9531.

The evacuation order was lifted around 7 p.m. but residents in the nearby neighborhoods were still under pre-evacuation until at least 7 a.m. Monday. But West Metro crews were still patrolling the fire late into the evening.

The fire district said ""The forecast is calling for a windy evening and those winds could pick up embers from the interior and carry them for quite some distance causing spot fires"" in a tweet.

Another grass fire was also ignited in south Denver near the Cherry Creek Reservoir. That fire also forced evacuations around South Parker Road.

South Metro Fire Rescue spokesperson Connor Christian said Monday morning that the fire was believed to be contained and no longer growing. Evacuations for residents on the west side of South Parker Road were lifted by 6 p.m. on Sunday and those homes are no longer threatened.

Snow fell lightly on the fire overnight but Monday brought the possibility of more winds and red flag conditions. Investigators were only able to start work identifying the point of ignition in the morning and have not yet determined whether the fire was human-caused.

Cherry Creek State Park is open but trails on the east side of the park and the road from the eastern entrance to the shooting range remain closed as mop-up operations continue in the area.

A cold front moved into the area from the west on Sunday evening according to the National Weather Service. It said the wind will slow and the humidity will rise from 8 percent to 70 percent by sunset which will ease the dangerous fire conditions.

""Any moisture helps"" Christian said.

The resulting company with the New York Stock ticker ETWO ended its first day of trading at $10.58 a share. The company’s market capitalization after the first day of trading was $600 million.

E2open described itself in the release as “a leading end-to-end and cloud-based supply chain management [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)] platform.”

“The company’s software solutions orchestrate complex global supply chains and drive compelling value and ROI for its diverse and sophisticated blue-chip customers” the release stated.

CEO Michael Farlekas who has led E2open since 2015 will stay in the role according to the release.

When the recently-completed deal was announced in October Farlekas said in a press release at the time: “The need for end-to-end visibility across the entire supply chain has never been more important than in the current business environment. Our software platform powered by real-time data enables our customers to orchestrate more agile and resilient supply chains and we are excited about the opportunity to accelerate growth going forward.”

The SPAC used to execute the deal was Neuberger Principal Holdings I according to the Friday release. The company stated that at the time of the merger it was led by senior executives of CC Capital and Neuberger Berman.

The companies said in the Friday release that more details would be disclosed in an upcoming Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.

In the October release E2open stated: “The total equity investment of $1.1 billion raised in this transaction will be used to pay down existing debt purchase a portion of the equity owned by existing E2open owners and conservatively capitalize the Company’s balance sheet.”

Recommended Videos

There’s so much that it’s almost hard to comprehend. But John Pollard vice president of business development for Zebra Technologies the official on-field player-tracking provider of the NFL paints a pretty good picture:

“Every player that participates in a game whether they’re on the sidelines or on the field has RFID tags in their shoulder pads.” he explained in an interview with Digital Trends. “Most players have two tags — one on each shoulder pad sometimes with a third one between the shoulder blades. All the field officials are also tagged as well as things like the pylons and the yardsticks on the field. The ball itself has an RFID tag as well. And all these tags communicate with a series of receiver boxes that are permanently installed around the perimeter of all the stadiums in the NFL.”

“The player tags send a signal to the receiver boxes 12 times per second.” he continues. “The ball itself blinks 25 times a second. And so with that information we can find out where they are on the field within a couple of inches of accuracy. From there we can tell a player’s proximity from their own teammates and the opposing players and we can also capture their speed for an independent play or a series of plays. On the ball we’re tracking velocity and rotational information as well which allows us to mathematically determine the height of throws punts and kicks.”

Stories from the Edge: NFL Bets Big on RFID IoT

In other words the NFL tracks real-time location speed and acceleration data for every player every object and every play on every inch of the field — and it’s been doing so for every regular season football game for the past seven years.

But here’s the kicker: Despite the fact that the league has been capturing this data for the better part of a decade we’re only now starting to see how it’s changing the game.

Deep stats deeper strategy

All this data collection has unlocked a completely new generation of stats. It’s far beyond the basic stuff you’re probably used to like touchdowns rushing yards and completed passes. Nowadays they track all that stuff plus speed acceleration location and time. But really those raw measurements are just the tip of the iceberg. There’s a whole host of derivative statistics that can be calculated by combining and correlating all these data points — things like Average Intended Air Yards Expected Completion Percentage and Completion Percentage Above Expectation. It’s a football nerd’s dream.

It also allows the NFL to measure things that were previously impossible to quantify — like aggressiveness. Prior to all this sensor-driven data a quarterback’s aggressiveness was a completely subjective quality with no real significance. Now it has a clear-cut definition: It’s “the amount of passing attempts a quarterback makes that are into tight coverage where there is a defender within one yard or less of the receiver at the time of pass completion or incompletion.” Such a stat would be impossible to define without exact time location and distance information but thanks to Zebra’s sensor tech this is being tracked and updated on every passing play a QB makes.

“It’s being incorporated into not only the strength and conditioning component of our training but also for coming back from injury.”

It doesn’t take a big leap of the imagination to see how this data might affect certain aspects of the game. For example it’s easy to see how deeper more granular and more abundant statistics on player performance might change what scouts look for in prospective recruits or help a coach make better decisions on what to focus on during practice.

But as New England Patriots linebacker Brandon Copeland explains training and scouting are merely the most obvious uses of data. Teams and players are using it for far far more than just performance tracking.

“It’s being incorporated into not only the strength and conditioning component of our training but also for coming back from injury” he tells Digital Trends. “That’s another thing that’s really big. Let’s say I just tweaked my hamstring. When I feel like I’ve recovered and I’m getting back up to speed I can literally go do a sprint to test that. When I walk off the field there’s somebody sitting there that can tell me exactly how fast I was going. So if they say ‘Oh well you’re a little slower than you were two weeks ago when you had no hamstring injury’ then I know there still may be something there that we need to to address. That kind of information is definitely vital from a player’s perspective.”

“So this information doesn’t just serve one purpose” he continues. “Guys pick and choose; they use all this data for different reasons. For some guys it’s more of an injury-prevention/maintenance thing. For others it’s a training thing. For other guys it’s more of a ‘hey let’s compete! I’m faster than you!’ kind of thing.”

A new dimension of play

Perhaps the most profound change of all though isn’t how data is altering the routines of players coaches and teams. It’s how data literacy — the ability to access interpret understand and apply data-driven insights — is quickly becoming a make-or-break skill for players. Much like tackling or kicking field goals using data is a skill that can be learned and improved on and the more adept a player is at leveraging data the more likely they are to succeed. Increasingly it’s what separates the rookies from the veterans.

“Rookie year is a whirlwind” says Copeland “especially as an undrafted free agent. There’s a lot of stuff going on. You’re trying to develop a routine learn the playbook and really just make the team. And there are so many resources out there that you could just swim in over your head. At first you’re just kind of going with the flow but at a certain point you figure things out and start to really understand the data. You realize that this resource exists in practice it exists in spring training and all the different things that we’re doing. A lot of veteran players take it into account.”

Copeland expects this to get easier as the technology matures. It’s taken the NFL years to build up not only the technological infrastructure to capture the data but also the distribution pipelines — which are still being figured out. The league hasn’t quite found its footing when it comes to making all this data accessible and easy to understand for players.

“Right now you have to go ask for that information.” says Copeland. “It’s always in the coach’s hands. But if we can encourage the coaches and staff to try to deliver that information to the players if we can continue to withdraw the barriers of access to the information I think that will be revolutionary in the long run.”

“I think this is the next evolution” adds Pollard. “The players in the NFL now they’re fluent in technology. They’re fluent in information. And they take care of the bodies like athletes have never before.
