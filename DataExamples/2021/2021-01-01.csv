Apart from fighting out scuffs they are equally good in terms of providing an anti-slip grip over the device. Which one of these wraps have become the companion of your iPhone? I can’t wait to know your picks.

Corvette Z06 Puts On Weird Widebody Kit Ferrari F12-Like Front End,"Nails screws or double sided 3M tape? The body kit's panel gaps don't do justice to this Corvette Z06

The Corvette C7 Z06 is a very good sports car but someone obviously thought that a number of modifications would improve its looks. Mission accomplished? We wouldn’t say so.

The car’s exterior is painted in a shade of baby blue which on its own isn’t particularly nice. Obviously the car’s owner wasn’t satisfied with simply driving around in a baby blue Corvette and thought it would be a good idea to fit it with an aftermarket bodykit.

This bodykit includes flared front and rear wheel arches which oddly look to be painted in a slightly different shade of blue than the rest of the car. Making these wheel arches look even worse are the panel gaps black exposed screws and the black rubber surrounds as these Reddit photos show.

Other modifications include a set of black Forgiato wheels and a front bumper inspired by that of the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta. Unsurprisingly this Ferrari-esque bumper doesn’t work very well with the rest of the car’s design.

Speaking of the C7 Corvette Z06 it was revealed just before Christmas that General Motors will extend warranty cover for select Z06 models due to the overheating issues they can encounter when driving on the track.

A document from the car manufacturer has revealed that extended warranty coverage applies to 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 model year Z06s. To fix the issue dealers will install an updated radiator package while also fitting new shift point calibration software for Z06 models with the available six-speed automatic transmission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5aGVyYWxkLnN4L2lzbGFuZHMvZHV0Y2gtbG9hbi11cy0zbS10by1zdHJ1Z2dsaW5nLXdpbmFpctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dutch loan US $3m to struggling Winair,"Dutch loan US $3m to struggling Winair

THE HAGUE--The Dutch government is providing a US $3 million mortgage loan with a market-based interest rate to Windward Islands Airways (Winair) to safeguard the connectivity between the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom.

Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management Cora van Nieuwenhuizen announced the loan on Thursday December 31 in a letter to the Second Chamber of the Dutch Parliament. She also did so on behalf of State Secretary of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations Raymond Knops who will be visiting St. Maarten next week.

Minister Van Nieuwenhuizen State Secretary Knops and State Secretary of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy Mona Keizer decided positively on the request of St. Maarten Prime Minister Silveria Jacobs to secure a US $3 million (2.7 million euro) mortgage loan for Winair. The Dutch government has a minority share in the airline of 7.95 per cent. The other 92.05 per cent is owned by the Country St. Maarten.

The Winair building at the airport will serve as collateral for the loan which is partly financed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations BZK (1 million euro) and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management IenW (1.7 million euro). Prior to approving the loan the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy EZK carried out an assessment.

“The issuing of this loan is based on the necessity of maintaining the air connectivity with the Caribbean Netherlands islands. The support is provided in the form of a mortgage loan with a repayment term of 18 months which can be extended to a maximum of 6 years with mutual approval” Van Nieuwenhuizen stated in her letter.

Risk mitigating measures are not necessary because it concerns a mortgage loan with collateral. The loan can be repaid at any time and contains a number of “hard conditions” where it concerns connectivity between the islands and the payment of bonuses and dividend stated the minister.

“The most important condition is that Winair during the duration of the loan must maintain the air connectivity between St. Maarten St. Eustatius and Saba with at least two flights per day as soon as the COVID-19 travel restrictions have been lifted” stated Van Nieuwenhuizen.

Winair may also not pay bonuses to its management and board and not distribute dividend to its shareholders as long as the loan has not been repaid. The mortgage loan which involves a market-based interest rate of 4.41 per cent per year places all immovables belonging to Winair under the so-called first mortgage right.

According to Minister Van Nieuwenhuizen the financial aid for Winair is essential. The COVID-19 pandemic is deeply affecting Winair’s operations as a result of sharply diminished flight frequency between the three Windward Islands and also between St. Maarten and Aruba Bonaire and Curaçao.

The air connections between the islands are in jeopardy the minister noted. “Winair the only airline that maintains connections with all six Caribbean parts of the Kingdom and the only airline that keeps a regular frequency with St. Eustatius and Saba has run into financial problems because there are barely any revenues while the expenditures continue.”

A situation has evolved whereby the insular connectivity of St. Eustatius and Saba with St. Maarten and Bonaire is in direct jeopardy stated Van Nieuwenhuizen. For this reason Prime Minister Jacobs had asked financial support from State Secretary Knops in order to maintain a regular air connection between the three Windward Islands.

“The vital importance of connectivity in St. Maarten St. Eustatius and Saba is a given. Residents of the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom must be able to travel to and from their island. And even though the current pandemic asks people to limit their travels there are many reasons why travelling is necessary” stated Van Nieuwenhuizen who mentioned medical travel transport of students or other essential travel.

Maintaining the air connections is also important in light of the transport of goods mail and the COVID-19 vaccines. After the coronavirus pandemic the inter-island air connections will be important as well for the unrestricted transport of residents and tourists. Islands that are easily reached by air contribute to a speedy revival of tourism and as such to the local economy.

The issuing of this mortgage loan to Winair shows that the connectivity between the islands remains fragile the minister pointed out. The development for the middle-long term strongly depends on the progress of combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This matter is being discussed between the Dutch government the St. Maarten government and Winair."

No one was injured but video shows the huge chunk crashing down near people.

SAN DIEGO — Fears have been growing after chilling video of a bluff collapse in Torrey Pines on New Year's Eve left many scared. Cell phone video shows the start of the cliff coming down before beachgoers started to scream and run.



“In the back of my mind it is always there you never can tell when one of those things is going to collapse and fall basically it's gravity and gravity never quits” said Dr. Pat Abbott Geologist.



Geologist Dr. Pat Abbott spoke of what to look out for when out at the cliffs. He says there's always a loud sound right before a huge chunk drops and it sometimes sounds like the pop of a gunshot.



""It usually has a noise to it a crack to let you know the rock is there it's been solid and has cracked or snapped and broken loose and if you hear that noise head for the water or look up.""

And we know it's definitely not the first time San Diegans have seen a dangerous bluff collapse. There have been numerous incidents in Encinitas Carlsbad Solana Beach Del Mar and La Jolla over the years.



The deadly Encinitas bluff collapse in August 2019 took the lives of three women of one family at Grandview Beach when a roughly 30-foot-wide chunk of the cliff dropped down. Dr. Abbott says bluff collapses are more common in very rainy years so to have a cliff falling now is happening an unlikely time.



“Here is a time where we haven't had much rain. The weather is warm it is one of the times where you would least expect something to go but again gravity never stops” Dr. Abbott said.



Just one day before this Torrey Pines collapse a picture shows a group of people standing in that very spot taking a picture by the ""Danger"" sign that warns against falling rocks. Still crowds came to Torrey Pines Saturday enjoying a hike at the beach. One family from Chula Vista was worried.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNib3N0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmxhbWVzLXJpcC10aHJvdWdoLW11bHRpLWZhbWlseS1ob21lLWluLXdvcmNlc3Rlci1vbi1uZXcteWVhcnMtZGF5LTYtcGVvcGxlLWRpc3BsYWNlZC8yMjY5OTM5L9IBiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNib3N0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmxhbWVzLXJpcC10aHJvdWdoLW11bHRpLWZhbWlseS1ob21lLWluLXdvcmNlc3Rlci1vbi1uZXcteWVhcnMtZGF5LTYtcGVvcGxlLWRpc3BsYWNlZC8yMjY5OTM5Lz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flames Rip Through Multi-Family Home in Worcester on New Year's Day; 6 People Displaced,"Flames ripped through a multi-family home in Worcester Massachusetts displacing six people on the first day of 2021.

Everyone made it out safely and there were no reported injuries but the damage at the 2.5-story home on Abbott Place has left a half dozen people without a place to live.

Worcester fire officials say flames were shooting through the roof when crews responded around 3:15 p.m. Friday.

A man who lives inside the home tells NBC10 Boston he has no idea how the fire started; He just heard the alarm and got out fast.

Firefighters were able to get the flames under control pretty quickly but the entire back porch was on fire and it extended into the attic as neighbors watched on.

""The whole entire flames came right up out of the roof...it ignited really quick. but the fire department came super fast the police showed up and they contained it very well"" neighbor Crystal Brooks said.

Firefighters say the biggest challenge was getting their equipment down the very narrow street to the home. And they say they are grateful the flames didn't spread to any nearby homes because of how close together they are.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVsY24uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZXMvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90aGUtc29uZy1yZXR1cm5zLWJhdGF2aWEtbmF0aXZlLXNoYXJlcy10aGUtc3Rvcmllcy1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLWhpdHMvYXJ0aWNsZV9iZjY4ODMxNy0xMGIyLTUxYmYtOWZkYS03OWE1MWY3Mzk0NGYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Song' returns: Batavia native shares the stories behind the hits,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Flash Player logo courtesy of Adobe.

Jan. 1 (UPI) -- Adobe Flash an early online animation plugin will no longer be supported by the company and customers are urged to uninstall it Adobe said. The browser add-on that first appeared in1996 reached the official ""end of life"" on Thursday and Adobe will stop all videos and animations run by Flash Player starting on Jan. 12 the company said.

""Adobe does not intend to issue Flash Player updates or security patches"" the company said. ""Therefore Adobe will continue to prompt users to uninstall Flash Player and strongly recommends that all users immediately uninstall Flash Player.""

The early animation program was once the most popular tool to stream videos and play games online but it was prone to hacks and other security problems and never made the transition to smart phones.

Three years ago Adobe gave advance warning that Flash would be phased out.

""Adobe believes that there has been sufficient time for developers designers businesses and other parties to migrate Flash content to new standards"" the company said.

Since 2017 companies like Google Facebook and other large internet tech giants have been issuing video and streaming content with open web standards which led to fewer prompts to run Flash on the sites.

Older sites on internet archives may still run Flash but Adobe won't support those applications the company said.

Users waxed nostalgic on Twitter about early video games such as Fancy Pants Snail Bob and Super Mario Bros that used early Flash technology.

""So many memories were made from it and I will miss the games that helped make our childhoods"" tweeted @IBoy154.

On 1 January software company Adobe stopped supporting and updating its Flash Player.

The company has asked users to uninstall the software before it blocks all Flash content from 12 January.

First released in 1996 Flash was instrumental in allowing content creators to make and share animations and games that could be downloaded quickly via a dial-up internet connection.

It also helped early versions of websites like YouTube stream high-quality videos.

But it has been plagued with security concerns and struggled to keep up as internet technology developed and users moved to mobile phones to surf the web.

In 2010 Steve Jobs wrote a scathing open letter called Thoughts on Flash in which he criticised the software and set out why it wouldn't be allowed to run on Apple products.

Other brands distanced themselves and in November 2011 Adobe announced it was ending support of Flash for mobile web browsers after multiple issues.

But the final blow came in 2014 when HTML5 a program that provided many of the same functions as Flash but did not require users to install a specific plug-in was released.

As a result the popularity of Flash started to fade.

That year 80% of Chrome users were visiting Flash sites but in 2017 Google said that figure had dropped to below 17%.

Big companies like YouTube Facebook and Netflix went on to stop using Flash and in 2017 Adobe announced it was discontinuing it altogether in 2020.

Many are mourning the demise of the software which has become synonymous with the early days of the internet.

Meanwhile other internet users have raised concerns that years of content will be lost when Flash goes down for good.

Adobe has launched its final update for Flash Player and is now solemnly offering farewells to the millions of users that have benefited from it over the years.Most of us were probably aware that Adobe Flash was going to be leaving us rather soon  but a lot of users are not ready to accept this fact. Google Chrome and other browsers have been flashing warnings since the start of the year warning users that they will stop supporting Flash as soon as the new year rolls by. Adobe itself released a notice on the 8th of this year published with the final Flash update for regions outside of China. The notice stated that Adobe will stop supporting Flash Player after December 31st and will only support content running on the platform until January 12th 2021.This news may bring out an uncharacteristic solemnity for most readers and not without good cause. Flash has been a big part of all computer-owning millennials' childhoods. Let's take a look back shall we? If one has at any point 1) played an online game 2) used YouTube in its early days 3) spent time on animation 4) lurked around websites such as Newgrounds or Friv (even writing down the word Newgrounds brings up a fresh pang of nostalgia) they have encountered and used Flash.This development isn't necessarily recent. Adobe has been announcing plans to disband Flash Player since 2017. This declaration came after quite a few factors fell in place. The system had already been handling a steady stream of criticism regarding its mobile battery usage and regular crashes. It had also been on the receiving end of a barrage of security threats and developmental flaws. All of this was capped off by a rather scathing letter published by Steve Jobs himself in 2010 listing all of the numerous reasons as to why iOS would never support Flash. Newer technology was also sliding in quickly making the player's usage irrelevant.So yes perhaps it really is time to say goodbye to the software. Perhaps all of this really is for the best. Adobe seems all-too reluctant to continue its usage which really should be a solid indicator that the service has completely run its course. The company has already prompted Adobe users to uninstall Flash Player with a short thank you note. And so we bid it adieu and goodnight with energy akin to what the internet felt as the Mars Opportunity Rover faced an oncoming storm and relayed a message of farewell as its battery ran out and the world got dark.

Ant McPartlin and his girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett have announced their engagement following the latter's proposal on Christmas Eve.

The I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! host got down on one knee during the festive season as the twosome are both very fond of the holiday.

Ant's rep told Metro on New Year's Day: ""Ant and Amzie are delighted to announce their engagement. The proposal took place on Christmas Eve at home in a very romantic setting.""

Ant's yet to share the news on the social media he shares with Declan Donnelly though the duo shared wishes for the year ahead a few hours before the news was confirmed.

Ant has been romantically linked to Anne-Marie since March 2018. Before then he was married to makeup artist Lisa Armstrong for 12 years whom he'd been with for 11 years prior to getting hitched. Corbett has two teenage daughters from a previous relationship.

While the Saturday Night Takeaway presenter is known for keeping things relatively private when it comes to his dating life he did offer up an update as to how well the pair were getting on back in March last year when he was asked by Stylist what his 'greatest love' is.

""My family my partner her girls our dogs… and Newcastle United"" he replied.

(Simon Berlyn/Berlyn Photography)

One down one to go. A few months after listing their back-to-back homes in Hancock Park Oscar-nominated composer Danny Elfman and actress Bridget Fonda have sold the larger of the two for $8.75 million.

The married couple offered the two properties up as a package deal for $14.6 million in October and the smaller home which Elfman and Fonda used as a guesthouse is still up for grabs at $4.888 million.

The one they just sold is a century old. Elfman a frequent Tim Burton collaborator whose credits include “Batman” “Alice in Wonderland” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” bought the place two decades ago.

It sits on three-quarters of an acre in Fremont Place a gated community filled with historic homes and architecturally dramatic mansions. This one spans two stories with colorful custom spaces across 8346 square feet.

Concrete columns frame the wooden front door and inside a two-story entry with arched doorways and beamed ceilings is overlooked by a series of interior balconies. The most expansive space comes in the grand ballroom which features massive murals and doubles as a movie theater.

There’s also a two-story living room with a stone fireplace a lavish dining room under gold ceilings a mint-green family room full of French windows and doors a breakfast nook with checkered tile floors and a recording studio lined with velvet drapes.

Six bedrooms and eight bathrooms complete the floor plan including a custom blue guest suite and primary suite with a spa bathroom. A sunroom and a series of second-story terraces overlook a leafy courtyard with a fountain and the grounds also hold a gym loggia dining patio swimming pool and spa.

Elfman 67 has won a Grammy and two Emmys and received four Oscar nominations. After forming the new wave band Oingo Boingo he moved on to film as a composer and his credits also include “Spider-Man” “Good Will Hunting” and “The Nightmare Before Christmas.”

Fonda 56 received a Golden Globe nomination for the 1989 film “Scandal” and hit her acting stride in the ’90s starring in “The Godfather: Part III” “Single White Female” “Point of No Return” and “Jackie Brown.”

Branden and Rayni Williams of the Beverly Hills Estates held the listing. Jill Galloway of Compass represented the buyer.

Showplace gets a lower price

New year new price for NFL legend Tony Gonzalez and his wife former “Beat Shazam” DJ October Gonzalez. The couple recently trimmed the price of their Beverly Hills mansion to $28 million — down from the $30 million they were originally asking.

They paid $7.1 million for the property in 2016 and razed the 1950s traditional-style house immediately erecting a Georgian-inspired manor in its place over the next four years. It was finished last winter and they listed it for sale over the summer.

Story continues

At 12855 square feet the showplace is nearly three times the size of the house it replaced. In addition to the two-story mansion there’s a swimming pool with a spa a pool house with a gym a subterranean garage with room for eight cars and a lighted tennis court.

Offered fully furnished the home kicks off with a dramatic 24-foot entry. Farther in common spaces include a study with built-in cabinetry and a chef’s kitchen with a large marble island. Walls of glass line the living room and dining area and the custom pub adds floor-to-ceiling wine storage and an eye-catching limestone fireplace. For those home-schooling during the pandemic there’s also a full-size classroom.

The owner’s suite sits upstairs. One of seven bedrooms and 12 bathrooms it extends to a massive balcony overlooking the patios and lawns in the backyard. The grounds cover about three-quarters of an acre.

An Orange County native Gonzalez was a standout at Huntington Beach High School before attending UC Berkeley where he played football and basketball. During his prolific 17-year career in the NFL the 44-year-old tight end played for the Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons making 14 Pro Bowl teams and being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.

Lakers star makes a pass

Hours after Derek Fisher was named the new general manager of the Los Angeles Sparks in December the Lakers legend wrapped up a home sale in Tarzana selling his Mediterranean-style estate for $2.31 million.

Fisher and his partner Gloria Govan were offering the San Fernando Valley spread for $2.35 million in November according to the Multiple Listing Service.

The former point guard oversaw some extensive renovations during his stay adding designer fixtures and an open-concept center-island kitchen. A wrought-iron staircase swirls around the two-story entry kicking off a floor plan full of arched doorways and wide-plank wood floors.

The home holds five bedrooms including a primary suite with a marble bathroom and balcony overlooking the backyard. At the far end of the half-acre property a guesthouse adds a pair of bedrooms and bathrooms. The two residences combine for more than 6500 square feet.

Between the two homes a long landscaped backyard adds multiple lawns dining areas and a patio with a swimming pool. Out front a gated motor court leads to three garages.

Fisher spent the majority of his career with the Lakers winning three consecutive titles with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal from 2000 to 2002 and rejoining the team in 2007 to win two more. The 46-year-old ranks second of all time in NBA career playoff games and remains the Sparks’ coach.

Govan owns and operates the Mexican restaurant chain Gorditos which recently opened its second location in Van Nuys.

We obtained An. gambiae s.s mosquito larvae from a mosquito colony maintained at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) Nairobi Kenya. This mosquito colony was originally initiated reared and maintained at Mbita Point Research and Training Centre of ICIPE Homa Bay County Kenya from adults collected in 1996 at Njagi village in south-east Tanzania [22]. The colony was transferred and used to establish the An. gambiae s.s colony we used for our study at ICIPE Nairobi Kenya in December 2000. This colony had never been previously exposed to any insecticide or growth-regulating xenobiotics including plant extracts and was thus considered susceptible to known insecticides and other xenobiotics. We followed standard procedures for rearing Anopheles mosquitoes [23]. We reared all life stages in an insectary (28 ± 2 °C 75–80% relative humidity) at the Animal Rearing and Quarantine Unit of ICIPE Nairobi Kenya. From the day of emergence we provided adult mosquitoes with a 10% sugar solution soaked in cotton wool. We fed 3-day-old adult female mosquitoes on bovine blood using an artificial membrane feeding method [24]. Approximately 2–3 days later we placed oviposition dishes in the cage containing gravid females. We placed the eggs on water and surrounded them with floating wax paper to prevent them from getting stranded on the sides of the hatching tray. We typically placed about 30 mg pulverized Tetramin fish food (Tetra GmbH Melle Germany) per pan of water twice daily (three times daily after reaching the third larval stage). We collected the pupae daily transferred them to bowls with water and placed the bowls in cages for adult emergence. For our study we maintained the larvae on 0.3 mg powdered Tetramin fish meal per larvae per day as recommended for An. gambiae s.s larvae [25] under the insectary conditions. This quantity of food was sufficient to sustain the larvae for 24 h while establishing minimal residual food that could potentially interfere with bioavailability of the extract to the larvae.

We exposed the larvae to curry tree leaf extract following the protocol of Mang’era et al. [11] with relevant modifications for our current applications. The extract consisted of a natural blend of alkaloid phytochemicals (neplanocin A 3-(1-naphthyl)-l-alanine lumiflavine terezine C agelaspongin and murrayazolinol) and induced morphogenetic abnormalities reduced locomotion and delayed pupation (8-day delay) in the larvae [11]. Briefly we initiated this process by establishing the temporal range of toxicity of specific phytochemical extract concentration (2 ppm) to late third-early fourth instar larvae (L 3 /L 4 ) of the mosquito. The temporal range was critical to our determination of optimal duration of exposure of the larvae to putatively elicit molecular responses to our extract at the L 4 instar larvae just before pupation. We selected this concentration (2 ppm) since we have previously identified it as sub-lethal to the L 3 /L 4 of the mosquito in an extract toxicity range (median lethal concentration) assessment [11]. For this purpose (establishing the temporal range of toxicity) we first solubilized the extract in absolute ethanol and diluted the resultant solution to 2 ppm in a total volume of 100 ml solution of distilled water (in a 250-ml glass beaker). Our overall ethanol concentration was 0.2% (v/v) absolute ethanol in the distilled water based on the quantity of absolute ethanol we initially used to solubilize the extract. We then placed 20 L 3 /L 4 instar larvae of the mosquito into the solution consequently exposing them to the extract and serving as our exposed treatment. We similarly placed 20 L 3 /L 4 instar larvae in 100 ml of distilled water with a similar concentration of absolute ethanol in a water beaker (in a 250-ml glass beaker) that served as our control treatment. The absolute ethanol concentration equivalence between the treatments potentially assisted in contrasting the effect of the extract from that of the solubilizing agent in downstream analyses. We prepared five replicates each of the treatment and control and monitored daily mortality and pupation of these larvae in both treatments under insectary conditions.

Our findings revealed peak pupation of the larvae 7 and 18 days post-exposure to our control and exposed treatments respectively (Fig. 1a b) suggesting that (i) the extract appeared to delay growth in the larvae and consequently the exposed and associated control larvae were potentially physiologically (L 3 /L 4 instar larvae) similar 7 and 18 days post-exposure (dpe) respectively. At this point 81 and 53% of the larvae had pupated or eclosed (Fig. 1a) for control and exposed larvae populations respectively indicating that the remaining respective proportions would potentially be appropriate L 4 instar larvae for further analyses in the definitive phase of our studies. The significant extension of larval phase (delayed pupation) by the extract exposure presented us with unique challenges in selection of the sampling points for the RNA extraction and subsequent RNA-Seq experiments. We reckoned that age-matching by sampling the larvae from either population 7 days post-exposure (peak pupation in control population) would constitute comparison between L 2 exposed and L 3/4 control larvae populations; hence the outcome/results would be confounded by differences in the physiological states between the populations. The alternative was to consider exposed and control larvae populations 7 and 18 dpe respectively as physiologically equivalent (both at L 3 /L 4 instar larvae developmental stage). The results from this approach would be confounded by the age differences between the larvae populations. Balancing these options and their consequences we selected the latter option since growth inhibition compounds typically have the most profound effect on insects at the L 3 /L 4 instar larval metamorphosis stage (physiologically matched) of their growth [26]. Consequently our molecular results would reflect responses to the inevitable combination of age differences between the larvae populations and the xenobiotic (extract) challenge. The exposed will hereafter refer to this larvae population (extract-exposed but not age-matched larvae population).

For assessment of molecular events associated with the exposure to the phytochemical extract we repeated similar treatments (exposed and control) but in 15 independent biological replicates of 25 larvae per treatment to enhance the odds of obtaining sufficient surviving larvae for the subsequent molecular studies given potential 55% mortality and 59% pupation as revealed by our preliminary studies (Fig. 1a) and the need to minimize crowding of the larvae in the beakers. We monitored and recorded larval survivorship at 24-h intervals indicating numbers of larvae alive dead or moribund and removed the dead larvae. Since we were interested in two biological replicates each for the control or exposed treatments for our subsequent RNA-Seq molecular comparative analyses we randomly and separately assigned five replicates from each treatment (exposed or control) into two groups of five treatments each. We performed these assignments 7 or 18 dpe for the control or exposed treatments respectively. From the 50 and 49 L 4 instar larvae survivors from control and exposed treatments respectively (Fig. 1b) we pooled surviving larvae in each group into two separate 1.5-ml reaction tubes constituting our two biological replicates of surviving larvae for subsequent RNA isolations and analyses. The replicates consisted of 25 25 25 and 24 larvae in each of control replicates 1 and 2 and exposed replicates 1 and 2 respectively. We quickly centrifuged the larvae in the tubes at 15300 rcf for 1 min (Eppendorf AG 5417R centrifuge Hamburg Germany) to pellet the larvae and facilitate removal of the residual water. We then snap froze the larval pellet in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation.

Isolation and sequencing of An. gambiae s.s RNA

We isolated total An. gambiae s.s RNA from the two biological independent replicates (from control or exposed larvae) by mechanically crushing the larvae using disposable RNAse-free plastic pestles in ISOLATE II RNA Mini Kit buffer (Bioline Merdian Life Sciences London UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We then treated resultant total RNA with TURBO DNase™ (Ambion Life Technologies TX USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions to remove potentially contaminating DNA that could confound our subsequent RNA-Seq analysis. We verified the quality and integrity of the RNA samples using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Palo Alto CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We sourced services for cDNA library preparation from the total RNA and subsequent sequencing of the libraries from Macrogen Korea (Geumcheon-gu Seoul Republic of Korea). Therein cDNA libraries were prepared from 900 ng (per replicate) of high-quality total RNA (RNA integrity number between 8 and 9.7) using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit (Illumina Hayward CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA libraries were then sequenced (101-bp paired-end read) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina Hayward CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Low-quality reads (< 100 base pairs) and adapter sequences in the libraries were then removed using Illumina build software (Illumina Hayward CA USA). Overall four transcriptome sequences were generated from our samples (two each for control or exposed larvae). We deposited the raw transcriptomes at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) USA under study accession number PRJNA560504.

Identification and validation of responsive transcripts in An. gambiae s.s RNA to M. koenigii leaf extract

We separately assessed the quality of each library using FastQC software [27] and used the results to filter and trim out low-quality sections of the reads using CLC Genomic Workbench version 9.0 software (CLC Bio Aarhus Denmark). We then obtained the protein-coding gene set AgamP4.4 of An. gambiae s.s from VectorBase [28] and mapped the filtered and trimmed reads to the gene set (AgamP4.4) using RNA-Seq analysis procedures in CLC Genomic Workbench software version 9.0 (CLC Bio Aarhus Denmark) as described previously [29]. Briefly we mapped the reads through settings that allowed two mismatches per read (with a maximum of 10 hits per read) with at least 80% of each read matching the gene at 95% identity. We then used reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) mapped reads as a proxy for quantity (abundance) of transcripts [30] for (1) assessment of baseline transcriptional processes that underpin the larval developmental stage in the mosquito (in the absence of xenobiotics) and (2) comparison of relative expression of the genes between libraries from control and exposed larvae. We established the relative number of reads for each transcript in relation to the total read counts for each RNA-seq library to calculate the p-value based on Baggerly's test method following Bonferroni analysis [31]. We then determined the relative fold change (FC) of transcripts between the control and exposed mosquito larvae as a ratio of the RPKM values and normalized based on the number of reads obtained from each library using an inbuilt algorithm in CLC Genomic Workbench. The normalized values were used in this study. We considered transcripts differentially expressed (DE) between the libraries if they had a normalized value of at least (i) 1.5-fold change (ii) corrected p < 0.05 false discovery rate (FDR) (iii) ten RPKM and (iv) a support of ten unique read mappings. We defined fold change as a ratio of RPKM values between those from exposed and control larvae libraries. We thus considered and categorized these transcripts as specific to control or exposed larval libraries.

We also conducted gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of differentially expressed transcripts in exposed relative to control larvae libraries using gProfiler [32] to establish pathways networks and interactions associated with transcripts induced or suppressed by the exposure of larvae to the extract. For these analyses we set our thresholds to a significance of p = 0.05 (to retrieve all GO terms under the biological process molecular function and cellular component) and ordered query to identify specific functional terms associated with the most significant changes for our query [33]. Since the extract predominantly induced morphogenetic abnormalities in the larvae [11] that we putatively associate a priori with cuticular metabolism [34 35] which changes with developmental stages in insects [36] we further focused our analyses on cuticular proteins (CPs). We consequently detected and classified putative structural CPs among the DE transcripts through blastp [37] searches against the AgamP4.4 gene set of An. gambiae s.s from VectorBase [28] and CutProtFam-Pred CPs family prediction tool [38 39]. The tool classified the CPs into protein families that (i) exhibited Rebers and Riddiford (R&R) Consensus sequences (CPR) [38 40] (ii) were based on a conserved region with a 44 amino acid motif (CPF) and (iii) were analogous to peritrophins with chitin-binding domains (CPAP). The tool further classified the CPR into RR-1 RR-2 and RR-3 subfamilies based on variations in their consensus amino acid sequences in the R&R domain [38] and identified cuticular proteins of low complexity (CPLC) which encompass CPLCA CPLCP and CPLCX among our differentially expressed transcripts.

Validation of transcriptome expression profiles using RT-qPCR

Reverse transcriptions of larval RNA transcripts

We further evaluated whether our RNA-Seq analysis results could be independently replicated using the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique as an independent tool. We randomly selected DE larval transcripts in our RNA-seq library and compared their relative fold changes to those we obtained for the same transcripts through RT-qPCR. Briefly we generated five independent biological replicates (exposed and control) of the larvae extracted and cleaned the respective total RNA libraries from our control and exposed larvae ab initio. We used the same methods and procedures we used to prepare the biological samples for the RNA-seq component of our study for sample preparations and total RNA extraction. We then reverse transcribed 1 μg of the total RNA using the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (BIO-RAD Hercules USA) on the Arktik thermal cycler (Thermo Scientific USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Selection of candidate transcripts for RT-qPCR

We randomly selected eight DE transcripts for validation of differential expression. These transcripts were significantly induced or suppressed in the exposed larvae library relative to the control library to encompass and validate differential expression in both directions (up- and downregulated genes) of the libraries. We also selected four transcripts that were neutral (neither induced nor suppressed in the exposed library relative to the control library) as potential internal reference neutral/loading controls [41]. These reference transcripts consisted of CLIP-domain serine protease glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and two uncharacterized genes (Additional file 1: Table S1) from VectorBase [28]. We ensured that all these transcripts were abundantly expressed in the RNA-seq libraries (based on their RPKM values) to ensure that their expression levels would be within the sensitivity of our Stratagene MX3005P RT-qPCR machine (Agilent Technologies CA USA). We obtained DNA sequences of respective genes from VectorBase [28] using the respective gene IDs (Additional file 1: Table S1) and designed primers (Additional file 1: Table S1) from these sequences in silico using primer3 software [42]. In all cases we ensured that the melting (T m ) and annealing temperatures of the respective forward and reverse primers generated were similar as determined by pDRAW32 version 1.1.142 software (http://www.acaclone.com) (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Real-time qRT-PCR of genes for DE transcripts

We first interrogated reference transcripts for their stable expression by performing RT-qPCR in three technical replicates for each of the five biological replicates on our Strategene MX3005P RT-qPCR machine (Agilent Technologies CA USA) using Fast SYBR Green I Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We performed the PCR in reaction volumes of 10 μl for each replicate consisting of 1 μg cDNA template in three independent replicates with 5 μl of Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad CA USA) in the presence of 0.4 picomoles of specific primers for the respective candidate reference transcripts. We carried out the reactions in a RT-qPCR thermal cycler (Stratagene MX3005P Agilent Technologies CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We involved thermo-cycling conditions that included an initial step of 95 °C for 10 min 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s 55.0–63.2 °C (Additional file 1: Table S1) for 45 s and 72 °C for 1 min followed by one cycle of 95 °C for 1 min 55 °C for 30 s and 95 °C for 30 s for all the genes. We then assessed stability (non-differential expression) of these reference transcripts using BestKeeper software [43]. From this assessment we identified gapdh and CLIP-domain serine protease transcripts as less variable [with a standard deviation of crossing point (CP) of 0.56 and 0.65 respectively] among the reference transcript candidates. We thus adopted these two genes as our internal housekeeping transcripts for assessment of expression of the eight randomly selected transcripts. We then separately performed the RT-qPCR for each of these transcripts under similar reaction and thermocycling conditions as had been previously employed in the assessment for stable expression of the reference transcripts above but with gapdh and CLIP-domain serine protease as internal reference/loading controls.

Data analysis

We computed and compared relative expression (means fold changes and p-value) of the eight transcripts using Relative Expression Software Tool (REST)-384 version 2 software [44]. We then used these data to evaluate validity of the transcriptomes by comparing the fold changes obtained here (RT-qPCR) to those obtained earlier (RNA-Seq) for the eight genes through Pearson correlation analysis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDM4LTAyMC0wMDQzMC130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plant buffering against the high-light stress-induced accumulation of CsGA2ox8 transcripts via alternative splicing to ...,"CsGA2ox8 expression is upregulated in response to increasing light intensity

We recorded the changes in cucumber hypocotyl lengths after the cotyledons emerged from the soil under treatments involving two light intensities: X1 (180 µmol·m−2·s−1 PPFD) and X2 (40 µmol·m−2·s−1 PPFD). The hypocotyl lengths of seedlings grown under treatment X1 were shorter than those grown under treatment X2 (Fig. 1a) and a significant difference was observed after 40 h of light treatment (Fig. 1b). To investigate the molecular differences of seedlings grown under the two light conditions a transcriptome analysis was performed. In total 279 upregulated and 321 downregulated genes were identified between the two treatments (Fig. 1c Supplementary Table S1). In this study we focused on GA-related genes because bioactive GAs have a large effect on hypocotyl elongation in cucumber1. We found that CsGA2ox8 a gene whose product catalyzes the deactivation of bioactive GAs was significantly upregulated in treatment X1 compared to treatment X2. This expression difference was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. 1d). These results suggested that the expression of CsGA2ox8 might be affected by light intensity. To test this hypothesis we treated young cucumber seedlings with seven different light intensities (40 80 120 160 200 240 and 280 µmol·m−2·s−1 PPFD) and quantified the expression of CsGA2ox8 in seedlings grown under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 1e the transcript level of CsGA2ox8 increased with increasing light intensity. Pioneering studies have shown that light modulates photomorphogenesis-related hypocotyl elongation mainly by interacting with GAs and many genes are involved in this light-GA system10. Our results suggested that the expression of the GA deactivation factor CsGA2ox8 was upregulated by increased light levels which might be involved in light-regulated hypocotyl elongation.

Differential AS (DAS) analysis for identifying novel transcripts of CsGA2ox8

AS is a prevalent approach used by plants in response to stress and involves the generation of multiple transcripts from the same gene21. In this study five types of AS events namely RIs (retained introns) A5SSs (alternative 5′ splice sites) A3SS (alternative 3′ splice sites) MXEs (mutually exclusive exons) and SEs (skipped exons) were identified by RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 2a Supplementary Table S2). Among them SEs and RIs accounted for more than 25% of all AS events (Fig. 2b) which is similar to that reported in Arabidopsis2223.

Among all RI events we found a novel transcript of CsGA2ox8 with an IR between the second and third exons. The original transcript of CsGA2ox8 was defined as CsGA2ox8.1 and the isoform with IR was defined as CsGA2ox8.2 (Fig. 2c). To validate the existence of CsGA2ox8.2 the coding regions of CsGA2ox8 of plants under treatment X2 were amplified and then sequenced. Two distinct bands were observed after RT-PCR-based amplification (Fig. 2c). After sequencing the two amplicons were found to be 1056 and 1655 bp in length (Fig. 2c). Sequence comparison showed the same result as that after RNA-seq and a schematic diagram of this event is illustrated in Fig. 2c. RIs promoted the disruption of the open reading frame of CsGA2ox8 resulting in an mRNA with a premature stop codon (TGA) and leading to a truncated protein (Fig. 2c). Compared with other GA2ox proteins in Arabidopsis the AtGA2ox7 and AtGA2ox8 proteins have a unique region15. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of AtGA2ox8 and CsGA2ox8.1 revealed that the CsGA2ox8.1 protein had a conserved motif (Fig. 2d denoted by a red box) which may define the specificity of the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes15. The absence of amino acids in CsGA2ox8.2 is indicated using a purple line in Fig. 2d.

Overexpression of CsGA2ox8.1 but not CsGA2ox8.2 decreases GA levels and the length of the hypocotyl in Arabidopsis thaliana

GA2ox genes function in reducing GAs15161718192024. Given that CsGA2ox8.2 lost the third and fourth exons from CsGA2ox8.1 (Fig. 2c d) we questioned whether CsGA2ox8.2 still maintains the same function as that of CsGA2ox8.1. To verify this CsGA2ox8.1 and CsGA2ox8.2 were overexpressed in Arabidopsis Col-0. CsGA2ox8.1 overexpression lines (OE8.1) had shorter hypocotyl lengths than Col-0 under both light and dark conditions (Fig. 3a–c). The RT-PCR results suggested that GA2ox8.1 was overexpressed in OE8.1 but not in Col-0 (Fig. 3d) suggesting that GA2ox8.1 was functional for hypocotyl elongation. However the hypocotyl length of CsGA2ox8.2 overexpression lines (OE8.2) was not significantly different from that of Col-0 (Fig. 3e–g) even though the transcript level of GA2ox8.2 was as high as that of GA2ox8.1 (Figs. 3d h). Next the GA levels were quantified in the Col-0 OE8.1 and OE8.2 lines. Based on the GA synthetic pathway GA2ox genes encoding enzymes that convert GA 12  GA 9  GA 53  GA 20  GA 1  and GA 4 to GA 110  GA 51  GA 97  GA 29  GA 8  and GA 34  respectively2526 (Fig. 3i). In this study we found that GA 12  GA 9  GA 53  GA 20  GA 1  and GA 4 significantly decreased in OE8.1 compared with Col-0 and no significant differences in GA levels were detected between OE8.2 and Col-0 (Fig. 3i) suggesting that CsGA2ox8.1 is a functional transcript but that CsGA2ox8.2 is not.

AS is a prevalent approach in which plants respond to environmental stress. One hypothesis is that plants buffer against normal protein synthesis levels via AS to decrease the translation of a significant portion of the transcriptome under stress conditions14. Therefore for future studies it is important to know how CsGA2ox8.1 and CsGA2ox8.2 work at the protein level.

The homolog of CsGA2ox8 in Arabidopsis is AtGA2ox8 whose product functions in hydroxylating the C 20 -GA precursors GA 12 and GA 53 15. In this study consistent with the results from overexpression of AtGA2ox815 GA 12 and GA 53 levels dramatically decreased in OE8.1 suggesting that CsGA2ox8 has a function similar to that of AtGA2ox8. However we found that the content of GA 9  GA 20  GA 1  and GA 4 also decreased which is inconsistent with the results of Schomburg et al. (2003) who reported that GA 9  GA 20  and GA 4 levels increased in AtGA2ox8 overexpression lines15. GA 12 is the precursor of GA 9 and GA 4  and GA 53 is the precursor of GA 20 and GA 1 25. Therefore it is possible that decreasing GA 12 and GA 53 levels would affect the synthesis of GA 9  GA 4  GA 20  and GA 1 . Taken together these results suggest that CsGA2ox8.1 rather than its CsGA2ox8.2 isoform regulated hypocotyl elongation and this regulation was achieved mostly via decreasing endogenous GA levels.

Plants tend to generate nonfunctional CsGA2ox8.2 but not functional CsGA2ox8.1 under high-light stress

As one type of AS IR mostly results in the production of nonfunctional transcripts carrying premature termination codons targeted for degradation via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway2728. However it is unclear why plants perform AS under stress conditions. Given that CsGA2ox8.2 was detected under relatively high-light conditions and that CsGA2ox8.2 seemed to be a nonfunctional transcript we hypothesized that CsGA2ox8.2 was generated for buffering against normal CsGA2ox8.1 transcripts under high-light stress to finely tune GA levels and maintain plant growth. Chaudhary et al. posited the same idea and proposed that under stress conditions plants buffer against normal protein synthesis levels via AS to decrease translation of a significant portion of the transcriptome but the mechanisms of this process have not yet been elucidated14.

To test our hypothesis the relative abundance of the two mRNA forms of CsGA2ox8 in plants under 50 100 150 200 400 800 and 1200 µmol·m−2·s−1 PPFD was analyzed by RT-PCR. The results showed that both transcripts were positively regulated by light and CsGA2ox8.1 was the dominant transcript under all light conditions (Fig. 4a). However the expression level of CsGA2ox8.1 increased slowly when the light intensity was >400 µmol·m−2·s−1 PPFD while that of CsGA2ox8.2 increased rapidly when the light intensity was >200 µmol·m−2·s−1 PPFD (Fig. 4a). Furthermore the inclusion/exclusion (In/Ex) ratio (CsGA2ox8.2/CsGA2ox8.1) significantly increased when the light intensity was >400 µmol·m−2·s−1 PPFD (Fig. 4b). In other words the CsGA2ox8.2 expression level was negligible under low-light conditions but under increasing light intensity especially that corresponding to high-light stress plants tended to generate more nonfunctional CsGA2ox8.2 transcripts and limit the increase in functional CsGA2ox8.1 levels (Fig. 4c). In this way plants could produce less functional GA2ox and could maintain a certain level of GA for hypocotyl elongation under high-light conditions.

Fig. 4: Plants tend to generate more CsGA2ox8.2 but not CsGA2ox8.1 under high-light stress. a Relative expression levels of CsGA2ox8.1 and CsGA2ox8.2 under different light conditions as measured via quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (three replications). The asterisks indicate significant differences in gene expression between CsGA2ox8.1 and CsGA2ox8.2 (P < 0.05). b High light promotes the expression of CsGA2ox8.2.

AS is known to promote plant stress tolerance13. For example stress imposed by high salinity promotes the use of noncanonical splice sites29. In addition AS events finely tune gene expression by regulating the ratio of active and nonactive isoforms30. Similarly we showed that high-light stress increased the CsGA2ox8.2/CsGA2ox8.1 ratio in this study suggesting a new mechanism for the GA-deactivating-enzyme response to high-light stress. However it is not clear how high light modulates AS events. To our knowledge AS events are mediated by core spliceosomal components (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) as well as RNA-binding proteins (serine/arginine-rich proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins)30. One hypothesis is that high-light stress affects the expression or protein structure of spliceosome genes thereby modulating AS events at the whole-genome level.

Our results suggest that IR may have been employed to finely tune gene expression by altering the ratio between functional and nonfunctional variants. Following a BLAST search of The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR https://www.arabidopsis.org/) and the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project Database (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/index.shtml) AT4G21200 and LOC_Os02g41954 were identified has sharing high sequence homology (57.42% and 49.03% respectively) with that of CsGA2ox8. As shown in TAIR AT4G21200 has one splice variant with an IR between the second and third exons which is the same as CsGA2ox8.2 with the RI promoting the disruption of the open reading frame of AT4G21200 resulting in the generation of an mRNA with a premature stop codon (TGA) leading to a truncated protein23. From the rice database LOC_Os02g41954 also has one splice variant which has a premature stop codon (TGA) between the second and third exons30. These findings suggest that AS of GA2ox8 commonly occurs in plants and this strategy might also be used by other plant species to buffer against the stress-responsive transcriptome and promote efficient adaptation to stress conditions.",,,,,,,,,

1980s

Making cookies

Melissa Weller grew up baking cookies with her mother. “My mom baked with margarine because that was sort of the trend in the ’80s” Weller says. In college her parents encouraged her to do something science related so she got a degree in chemical engineering. “But I also loved France and I loved languages.” So she double majored in international relations and spent a year studying in France. “I was so enthralled with all of the different pastries and how good they were and I think the science part of me wanted to know how to make it all from scratch” she says. “I stuck with engineering but I think my heart was always in cooking in France.”

1995

Engineering her dream job

Upon graduating Weller received a job offer from Air Products and Chemicals where she entered a career-development program and rotated among engineering assignments. “None of them were good fits” she says. She enrolled in a course in San Francisco where she became enthralled with the cuisine and decided she wanted to work in a restaurant. So in 1999 she quit her engineering job and went door to door to restaurants looking for a job. She ended up hostessing at two restaurants in San Francisco to make ends meet. “It was a pretty stark reality from having this comfortable engineering job with benefits and a 401(k) and holidays off to all of a sudden making hardly any money at all” she says. She got nervous about her finances and decided to take a job in San Diego with the fuel-cell engine company Excelsis where she worked for 2½ years. When the company announced it was closing its US location it “was a blessing in disguise because I had a big severance package” Weller says. She called up one of the most highly acclaimed restaurants in San Diego and offered to work without pay if it would teach her to cook. The restaurant accepted.

2003

Beginning with bread

Weller moved to New York City to attend the French Culinary Institute. After graduating she worked for 2 years in the pastry kitchen at the Italian restaurant Babbo. She started experimenting with baking bread at home. “I’ve always said ‘How do you make that?’ I’m sure it’s related to my chemical engineering background” she says. Then she was hired as a dough pH tester at Sullivan Street Bakery where the owner used large batches of dough with relatively little yeast. The theory was that “at a certain point the pH would indicate when the dough was perfect for shaping into bread” she says. Weller started out using a pH meter once per hour to measure and graph the pH and eventually worked her way up to become Sullivan Street’s first-ever woman baker.

JetASAP says it is “the only platform in the world that allows direct quotes booking and pricing from charter operators”.

According to the Air Charter Service figures in August 2020 showed a 51 per cent increase on leisure travel bookings globally this year versus 2019 with 44 per cent of bookings in July 2020 from first-time private jet customers.

Thanks to enhanced concerns regarding the safety of group travel in the age of Covid-19 private jet travel is riding on a tailwind at present and JetASAP is well placed to take advantage of the surge.

By booking directly with qualified charter operators travellers can save money every time they fly as there are no third-parties to contend with whether human or technology-based. JetASAP describes itself as the “Airbnb of private jet air travel”.

The patent pending app-based service will allow flyers to submit travel requests receive live quotes from quality operators chat confidentially with operators at any time as well as select and book the quote that best suits their needs.

Borne of a team of seasoned former charter operators JetASAP’s mission is to improve the private jet travel booking experience by lowering costs and improving transparency one flight at a time.

JetASAP is a new invitation-only app that connects travellers directly with more than 700 private jet operators across the US to book charter aircraft for free with zero commissions memberships or fees charged – ever.

Lisa Sayer Founder and CEO of JetASAP and a private aviation industry veteran of more than two decades offers insight into how her company is a “true disruptor” in the industry offering a “DIY” charter service that is well beyond the mainstream market.

How would you describe the JetASAP service in relation to the travel industry?

“We tend to describe ourselves as the ‘home advisor’ of private jet travel because we are a neutral platform that does not charge the user. We could also say we’re the ‘Airbnb’ of private air travel in that we allow people to directly source aircraft that are not in use and are being offered for charter.

“We are the first and only service that is empowering retail clients to directly source and book private travel at wholesale rates with complete transparency and no need to pay commissions membership charges or other fees.”

How is JetASAP different from existing on-demand private charter services?

“When using on-demand jet charter clients primarily work through brokers to source and book travel on-demand with no commitments. We are different because we allow retail clients to directly book private travel for free with full transparency. This is unique in the industry and a democratizing game-changer.

“To provide a relatable example this is similar to when Zillow launched in the real-estate industry. Prior to that the MLS (real-estate listing service) was very difficult to access directly without the assistance of a real estate broker.

“Once Zillow arrived anyone could directly search for homes without a middleman. Right now accessing charter operator information is difficult without brokers and JetASAP is acting like Zillow in this case providing immediate direct access.”

With the popularity of jet cards why should consumers choose JetASAP?

“Though jet cards sometimes have the advantage of coming with guaranteed availability within a certain number of hours and while some do allow funds to be used with on-demand travel at lower rates there are risks.

“Operators can use the money for operations rather than keeping it in escrow and then become unable to fulfill the agreement due to bankruptcy or other reasons. There is a very real danger with trusting any company with so much money in advance when the on-demand charter market can often fulfill a flyer’s needs.

“Additionally a large number of companies offer jet cards that allow retail clients to put money on an account (typically US$100k but as little as US$25k) and then pay a fixed hourly rate for different classes of aircraft. These rates tend to be higher than on-demand rates because providers charge one-way hourly rates to offer point-to-point pricing.

“For example if a typical light jet costs US$2500 per hour a jet card provider might charge US$5000 but then only charge flyers for the time they use. However the math works out to be the same and it can be detrimental to a flyer when an on-demand charter operator can operate point-to-point.”

What is the difference between JetASAP and existing membership services?

“Similar to jet cards membership companies charge an annual fee to belong and then charge additional fixed hourly point-to-point pricing on a variety of aircraft typically with guaranteed availability within a certain number of hours.

“However as with jet cards hourly rates can be very high compared to on-demand charter in some cases. Also these companies can end up going out of business leaving many members out thousands of dollars in membership fees. A recent high profile bankruptcy left members out millions in non-refundable deposits which had not yet been used.

“Having said that jet cards and memberships are popular because most flyers are unfamiliar with booking charter and like the predictability convenience and consistency of human support and a typically closed group of aircraft operated by a single company as well as guaranteed availability when offered.

“However as flyers become more savvy they are looking for another solution that empowers them to control their travel without paying exorbitant rates and that is the mission of JetASAP.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vb2x5bXBpY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvYWlyYm5iLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtbWVjaGVsbGUtbGV3aXMtZnJlZW1hbi1vcHRpbWlzaW5nLW1pbmQtYW5kLWJvZHktcGVyZm9ybWFuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Start your year off right with Mechelle Lewis Freeman and Airbnb,"Are you looking to get 2021 off to a fast start?

But when the houses are rehabbed cargo containers that need to be tucked into the rural and rocky terrain of a Rising Fawn Georgia bluff logistics loom large.

Fortunately the payoff for the extraordinary efforts undertaken by owners Michael and Teah Hicks is shaping up to be significant as well. The diminutive dwellings the latest in the couple's suite of real estate properties have debuted to glowing reviews on Airbnb and similar sites.

Nicknamed ""On the Rocks"" the mountain retreat has been an idea bubbling in Michael's head for several years now. Michael 39 says he has been buying selling and building homes since he was 19. Teah 40 is a Realtor.

Over the years they've added short- and long-term rentals self-storage and investment properties to their real estate portfolio. ""On the Rocks"" is their first venture into tiny houses.

""We have other vacation rentals but he wanted to do something different"" Teah says of her husband. ""He builds houses and flips houses and he wanted something different and unique. It's kind of been his dream for a few years.""

What sets the Hickses' mountaintop tiny homes apart are their origins. Rather than ground-up builds theirs started life as shipping containers - the big metal boxes that stack like Legos on seafaring cargo ships. Imagine about two-thirds the length of a railroad boxcar with the same cavernous ambiance.

To see the structures now only the boxy shape and grid of locking mechanisms left intact on the ends give hints at the containers' previous lives. Fresh paint and cedar trim give the exterior a homey look. Inside they're comfy cozy and oh so cool.

""We wanted to keep the outside facade to where you could look at it and tell what it is"" Teah says. ""On the inside it really just looks like a home.""

The tiny houses sit several feet apart on a wide ledge overlooking Dade County Georgia. At more than 1300 feet above ground level the site often looms above the clouds a phenomenon noted by some of their Airbnb reviewers raving about the property's views. The pitched roofs are meant to resemble the wingspan of the hang gliders that launch from Lookout Mountain Flight Park nearby.

The smaller of the two structures made from a single shipping container began life in the parking lot of Michael's business MTAC Properties in Rossville where the Hickses live with daughters Annabelle 10 and Caroline 7. In many communities zoning ordinances prohibit tiny homes a mindset Michael is hoping to change by showing that ""tiny house"" is not synonymous with ""shack.""

Part of that effort was putting the container home on public display while he and Teah searched for a permanent site for it.

""I wanted to show the concept"" he says.

Eventually they located the brow property in Dade County where zoning regulations were receptive. They began construction in February 2020.

The wooded lot required grading - ""that was one of the big projects"" says Teah - as well as terracing a walkway from the roadside driveway to the brow-front doorways.

The steep and rocky terrain posed other challenges as well.

""It was a job getting the septic tanks in"" Teah says.

Michael expected to park a crane on Scenic Highway and use it to lower the shipping containers from the back of a truck to their foundations but the crane was no match for the steep grade and the weight of the containers. Ultimately he brought in an excavator ""and walked them down the hill with it"" he says.

The pandemic slowed their progress but they were ready to open the smaller structure by early October. The second made of two containers followed a couple of weeks later.

In the smaller house ""everything is brand-new"" says Teah. ""In the double container we wanted to repurpose more material. We pulled old sinks from the '50s (from previous home flips) and used those. We refinished the floors the original floors of the container. That was really cool. You can see where the two containers were put together. There's a line in the floor with the metal (strip) where they join together.""

Otherwise the building materials and design choices - white tile Sheetrock shiplap - resemble any modern home's. As rental properties the kitchens are outfitted with the basics for overnight guests but perhaps higher-end: an induction cooktop convection microwave coffee press.

Beds sofas and a loft in the larger container are placed to take advantage of the sweeping views outside the picture windows. To keep the focus on those views there's no internet service or television but guests will find everything they need to make s'mores around the fire pit outside.

""It's meant to be a place to retreat meditate and relax"" Teah says.

The smaller home holds a queen-size bed and full shower but other elements give it an efficiency feel. The mini fridge tucks under the counter. There's a small foldaway table and adjacent nook to store two folding chairs. The standout feature is a daybed swing on the large front porch.

Freelance videographer Levi Kelly who documents his Airbnb stays on a YouTube channel plus a season of ""Tiny BNB"" on The Design Network recently came for a two-night stay at ""On the Rocks"" and planned to post videos in December.

""I loved staying there"" he says. ""Such a unique place to experience tiny living and with a great view!""

With the success of the first two structures as overnight rentals Michael is now at work adding a third container home at the site. He likes the idea of finding new uses for the containers.

""I go by the saying 'Find your repurpose'"" he says.

Eventually they'd like to install more container homes at other sites perhaps build a community of tiny homes. A member of the Rossville City Council Michael dreams of converting containers into retail shops or small restaurants similar to The Cargo District in Wilmington North Carolina.

""It would have to be in Rossville"" he says. ""I'd like to try to drive some growth that way.""

Teah says her husband ""thinks on a larger scale"" than she does.

""I was thinking 'Let's do one and see how it goes' and he was instantly thinking 'Tiny house community.'

""But I love unique spaces so it wasn't hard to convince me to do this"" she says. ""We've looked at silo homes. Maybe we'll do a project like that next.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtei5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMS9wYXduLXN0YXJzLWNvcmV5LWhhcnJpc29uLWFjY3VzZWQtdHJhc2hpbmctcnYtcmVudGFsL9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRtei5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMS9wYXduLXN0YXJzLWNvcmV5LWhhcnJpc29uLWFjY3VzZWQtdHJhc2hpbmctcnYtcmVudGFsLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Pawn Stars' Corey Harrison Accused of Trashing RV Rental,"Corey Harrison from ""Pawn Stars"" trashed an RV he rented essentially wrecking it ... that's what the guy who rented him the RV told police.

Villafana says he was contacted by Corey's assistant on the 24th ... saying they were involved in an accident and were going to have the RV towed back. The RV didn't show up until the 26th and Villafana says it was wrecked.

You can see from the pics ... the body of the RV is damaged ... the awning ripped off. The inside was a mess. Villafana says it was littered with empty bottles and eggs among other things. He estimates the damages between $20k and $30k.

Villafana claims Harrison refused to pay for the damages ... this on top of the extra 3 days the RV was in their possession. The RV owner says as a result of the damage he had to cancel 10 reservations.

Villafana filed a report with the North Las Vegas Police Department which he says was necessary in order to go after Harrison's insurance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAxL3NvaG8ta2FyZW4taXNudC1vbmx5LW9uZS1pbi1mYW1pbHktZmFjaW5nLWNoYXJnZXMtY291cnQtZG9jcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Soho Karen' isn't only one in family facing charges: court docs,"The woman wanted by the NYPD for falsely accusing a black teen of stealing her cellphone was apparently busted early last year with a relative — who’s accused of attacking a public-safety worker California court records show.

Miya Ponsetto — who was caught on camera allegedly attacking 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. at the Arlo Hotel on the day after Christmas — was charged with public intoxication on Feb. 28 according to the online docket for the Los Angeles Airport Courthouse.

Nicole Claudine Ponsetto — who appears to be Miya’s mom — was busted as a co-defendant and slapped with an identical charge according to the docket.

In addition Nicole was charged with battery under a section of the California Penal Code that covers incidents involving a “peace officer” or another public-safety worker.

Details of exactly what happened weren’t available from either the LAPD or the LA District Attorney’s Office where spokespersons couldn’t be reached due to the New Year’s Day holiday.

But the Daily Mail which first reported Miya’s arrest said the incident took place in Beverly Hills.

Miya was also busted on May 28 and charged with four counts including driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with a suspended or revoked license.

She pleaded no contest to DUI on Sept. 28 and was sentenced to three year’s probation and $390 in fines or three days in jail or 30 hours of community service in lieu of payment.

Miya was also ordered to enroll in a nine-month alcohol and drug “education and counseling program” and is due in court on Jan. 14 for a “proof of completion” hearing.

She and Nicole who appears to be 43 are both due in court for a pretrial hearing in their public-intoxication cases on Jan. 28.

Miya’s repeated brushes with the law appear to be the reason she spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity earlier this week.

During the interview she claimed to have been assaulted during the incident in which she was allegedly caught on camera melting down and tackling Harrold son of jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold.

CNN said it agreed not to name her because she claimed to have “concerns for her safety unrelated to this incident.”

Miya doesn’t appear to have a phone listed her in name and Nicole didn’t respond to a message left at a phone number listed in her name."

Or follow us on Google News

Tesla has published its official 4th quarter 2020 and full-year 2020 vehicle production and delivery numbers. Details are below. They show that Troy Teslike whose estimates I wrote about yesterday was off by only 3142 for the full year. In other words not much changes from yesterday’s discussion but scroll down for the details and new CleanTechnica charts.

For the official figures only which do not include model-specific deliveries or production here are the tables provided by Tesla one more quarterly delivery graph (interactive version on bottom of page) and two vehicle production charts:

Perhaps the most interesting of all remains that fact that a small percentage of Tesla drivers are leasing their cars and SUVs — a stark departure from the overall premium-class vehicle market or overall auto market as a whole. As Paul Fosse wrote earlier this in 2019 “over 32% of cars are leased while in the luxury subcompact market it is 64%.”

Most noteworthy for the market though is that Tesla basically hit its guidance of 500000 vehicles a year (despite the pandemic) — and even got production up to nearly 510000.

More thoughts on regional and model-specific details based on highly informed estimates are here: 499550 Tesla Sales In 2020 (CleanTechnica Charts).

This article has been updated to add charts for Tesla vehicle production and more delivery graphs.

Here are interactive versions of the long-term quarterly Tesla delivery graphs above (tend to display better on a laptop/desktop computer than a phone):

Researchers biologists chemists process engineers formulators quality control experts and other professionals involved in drug development and manufacturing worked under pressure and sometimes socially distanced from other collaborators or team members.

The long hours and adverse conditions endured by drug development and manufacturing professionals have started to show results with the Emergency Use Authorization of two vaccines and two monoclonal antibody treatments and FDA approval of remdesivir. Nearly 50 drugs for other conditions were approved by FDA as 2020 drew to a close (1).

Drug development and manufacturing professionals participating in the 2021 Bio/Pharmaceutical Development and Manufacturing Employment Trends Survey sponsored by Pharmaceutical Technology (2) worked longer hours in 2020 than previous years with fewer salary increases. Respondents however said compensation was not a top priority and nearly two-thirds expect to stay in their same position in the coming year. (See the infographics for an overview of survey results.)

Bio/pharma companies were very busy during 2020 as evidenced by the increased workloads reported in the survey. Nearly 60% of respondents said they worked more hours in 2020 than in the previous two years compared with 38% in the previous survey.

Nearly 80% of the respondents reported some impact from the pandemic on their daily work. More than half of the respondents (53.2%) changed work schedules to enable social distancing at work. A similar number (53.9%) worked remotely from home. Nearly one-third of the respondents said they assumed additional responsibilities; 20% worked additional hours on pandemic-related projects and 10.3% switched to pandemic-related projects. Development programs were changed or reduced for 13.5% of the respondents. Work hours or responsibility were reduced for 18.6% and 5.8% said their position was eliminated.

After a difficult 2020 biopharma professionals have an optimistic outlook for the industry for 2021; more than three-quarters of survey respondents expect business to improve; 64.3% expect business at their employer to improve.

The compensation question

Satisfaction with compensation increased slightly in 2020 following a few years of downward movement. Almost 43% of the respondents said they were paid fairly or excessively in 2020 compared with 41.5% in 2019. A majority of respondents were not happy with their salary; 37.7% said their pay was at the low end of the salary range for their expertise and responsibility; 19.4% said they were paid below market value.

The percentage of respondents reporting salary increases continued a downward trend. Only 41.7% of the respondents reported a salary increase in 2020 compared with 55.4% in 2019 and nearly 63% in 2017 (2–4). A slightly greater percentage reported a decrease in salary (13.7% in 2020 vs. 11.4% in 2019). More people reported no change in salary (44.6% for 2020 compared with 33.2% in 2019).

Salary ranked second to last on a list of 13 factors contributing to job satisfaction in the 2021 survey down from fifth place in the 2020 survey. Compensation trailed factors such as challenging projects intellectual stimulation company’s potential for success supportive management and a good work/life balance as the “main reason I come to work.”

What she didn’t expect was the scrutiny from State Farm her home insurance provider.

A claims adjuster from State Farm sought to strike as many items as possible off a list of repairs from her home in Inglewood a predominantly Black city in Los Angeles County Ms. Burgess said. The adjuster argued that State Farm should not have to pay to replace a door that was so damaged by the flooding that it no longer closed.

Though only 3000 fans were able to attend whether you watched the game at home or listened to the radio you can experience the sights and sounds from Ohio State’s amazing 49-28 college football playoff win against Clemson below. It was very much unlike a traditional college football playoff semifinal game.

Pre-Game

I arrived at the stadium at 4 p.m. CT on a media shuttle and went through security and multiple screenings. Blue dots marked the floor requiring everybody to remain six feet apart. The concessions were just being set up and stadium security were just finishing finding their spots in their respective sections the stadium was quiet and the field was empty.

It wasn’t until 5 p.m. that music came on and team managers for both Clemson and Ohio State took the field.

At 5:08 p.m. Clemson players came out of the tunnel in their dress clothes and walked across the field to their locker room. Ohio State came out and walked across the field at 5:21 PM. Fans had began entering and there were consistent cheers as Ohio State walked across the field.

A handful of Clemson players were out on the field stretching and running around. As the clock neared 5:30 a lot of Clemson players were warming up on its side of the field and a few Ohio State players began coming out. As a number of Ohio State players ran out to warm up there was a lot of noise coming from the Ohio State side of the stadium.

Every time an Ohio State position group ran out onto the field to warm up the Ohio State fans cheered. Clemson fans were quiet.

The corridors of the Mercedes-Benz Superdome were empty and dark. There were very few people walking around. In a stadium with a capacity of over 74000 the 3000 fans and parents in attendance hardly took up any space.

There were numerous announcements to mask up and stay two yards apart or maintain six feet of distance.

With 99 minutes to kickoff a countdown clock began in the stadium.

At 6:00 p.m. the stadium announcer officially welcomed the fans.

Ohio State was running through position warmups and you could hear the coaches and the players yelling. You could even hear the clapping and yelling of individual players in between the music that was playing. No Clemson fans were audible in warmups.

With just under an hour remaining the Clemson band played via a video on the scoreboard as if they would at a home game.

Ohio State’s marching band also played via the video board and the Ohio State fans clapped along. The marching band was in an empty Ohio Stadium performing Script Ohio. As Carmen Ohio played all Ohio State fans were standing swinging and signing along. The dance team performed its dance virtually as well.

Game

Families and fans sat in the lower bowl and the middle bowl. There were no fans in the upper bowl. Fans were scattered throughout a the sections from top to bottom. Few fans were scattered in the end zone sections.

There were fireworks when both teams came out onto the field. Both teams ran to the end zone to kneel and pray.

When big plays were made you could hear the crowd reactions. When there was a loud hit not only did you hear the fans but you could hear the contact between players and even the thud of when a player hit the ground. You could hear the foot of Blake Haubiel hit the ball kicking the extra points.

Buckeye players on the sidelines were waving their towels and turning to the fans to pump up the crowd. The entire sideline was involved. The Ohio State fans even got an O-H-I-O around the stadium chant going late in the second quarter.

The video board was very loud and there was fake crowd noise playing throughout the game. Videos and advertisements played on the big screen and fans were shown.

But some plays were awkwardly quiet. When you would expect to hear a roaring stadium you only heard the same amount of cheers from the fans as any other play.

Running back Miyan Williams got a lot of cheers from the fans after his 15-yard run.

Post-Game

Buckeye fans remained in their seats to watch the post-game trophy ceremony as Clemson fans quietly exited the building.

Clemson players remained on the field post-game as Ohio State sung Carmen Ohio. Their alma matter played after.

After the Ohio State team received its trophies and confetti sprayed across the field the players went over and saw their friends and families in the stands. After the quick visit and photo-session Ohio State players headed to the locker room and the fans exited the stands.

After changing in the locker room Clemson players slowly walked across the confetti-filled field in their sweatsuits.

As I exited the Mercedes-Benz Superdome at the early hours of the next morning the building was lit up Scarlet and Grey and both teams’ equipment busses were finishing loading up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJpZ2xlYWQuY29tL3Bvc3RzL3RyZXZvci1sYXdyZW5jZS1tdXN0YWNoZS1pbnN1bHQtcmVwb3J0ZXItem9vbS1tdXRlLXN1Z2FyLWJvd2wtMDFldjB3cmpndG1q0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trevor Lawrence Had His Mustache Insulted By Reporter on an Open Mic,"During Trevor Lawrence's Presser somebody was unmuted and shared their opinion on Trevor's mustache.

Click to skip ahead to see Billionaire David Abrams' Top 5 Stock Picks.

The value investing guru David Abrams is one of the most successful hedge fund managers over the last two decades thanks to his strategy of buying undervalued stocks and holding them over the years to maximize gains. After working ten years for Seth Klarman's investment firm Baupost Group he founded Abrams Capital Management in 1999 and he managed to outperform the broader market index with a 15% average return in the first fifteen years since inception.

The self-made billionaire who also made billions for his investors manages $10 billion of assets at present while the value of the 13F portfolio stands above $3 billion.

The hedge-fund manager David Abrams is one of the most admired value investors and he runs a concentrated stock portfolio. The billionaire likes to diversify investments towards foreign equity securities private and illiquid investments and debt.

He is a follower of Benjamin Graham's value investing approach. “I’ve observed a great many investors over the years and I’ve never seen a consistently successful one whose strategy was not based on a value approach—paying less for something than it is worth either today or in the future” David Abrams said.

The billionaire hedge fund manager's investment strategy also includes buying depressed companies with strong long-term fundamentals. This is clearly reflection in its strategy of buying half a million shares of TransDigm Group Incorporated early this year when aircraft components supplier was under pressure. The billionaire also added to his Facebook stake early this year in the wake of staying at home policies and increased his position in internet advertisement company Alphabet.

He also took a big stake in Energy Transfer Partners early this year and added to his existing position in the September quarter as shares of the energy storage and transportation partnership remained under pressure throughout this year due to pandemic related challenges.

At the same time the Boston-based hedge fund has also slashed its stake in drilling companies amid bleak future fundamentals.

While David Abrams' reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As Seth Klarman's protege continually re-evaluates investments based on the market conditions let’s start examining billionaire David Abrams' top 10 stock picks to see how he is seeking to outperform the markets.

10. Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE:BEN)

The asset management holding company Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) is one of the long-running investments of billionaire David Abrams' 13F securities portfolio. Although the Boston-based hedge fund has reduced its position by 15% in the September quarter Franklin Resources is still the tenth largest stock holding of its portfolio.

Shares of Franklin Resources has been underperforming over the past five years amid sluggish financial numbers. Despite share price underperformance the company has extended its dividend growth strategy. It has raised its dividend every year since 1981.

9. AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL)

David Abrams has also been showing confidence in AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL) over the years. Abrams Capital Management has significantly raised its position in truck renting service several times since first initiating a position in 2016. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Abrams hedge fund accounting for 6.35% of the overall portfolio.

Shares of AMERCO rallied sharply during the second half of 2020 after making a range-bound movement in the past four years. The latest share price gains are backed by robust year over year revenue growth of 14.8% in the latest quarter. Moreover AMERCO’s earnings per share came in at $13.58 in the September quarter up almost 90% from the year-ago period. Instead of investing all the profits back into the business the company returns cash to investors in the form of big special cash dividends.

8. Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG)

Automotive retailer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG) is one of the favorite stocks of David Abrams’ hedge fund. The firm has been holding a stake in Asbury Automotive since 2017 and it currently accounts for 6.56% of the overall 13F portfolio. Boston based hedge fund is holding 2.1 million shares of Asbury Automotive valued at $206 million.

It appears that David Abrams has benefited from its Asbury position because shares of the Automotive retailer rallied 22% in the last twelve months extending the five years gains to 100%.

Other hedge funds are also showing interest in Asbury Automotive Group. It was in 24 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of June down slightly from an all-time high of 33.

Meanwhile Diamond Hill Capital is bearish about the future fundamentals of Asbury Automotive. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital stated about Asbury Automotive Group in an investors letter:

“Car dealer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. recently agreed to purchase a dealership in Dallas Texas to improve its poor new vehicle mix and geographic exposure; however the deal fell through because the business needs cash to survive the impact of the coronavirus. We believe the core Asbury business is weak (although well run) and that the slowdown in sales from the coronavirus will have a long-term impact on the business.”

7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Abrams Capital Management looks bullish over the largest advertising services platform Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). The firm has been holding a position in Alphabet since 2018 and it currently represents the seventh-largest stock holding in its 13F portfolio.

Shares of Google rallied almost 29% in 2020 accelerating five years gains to 120%. Besides David Abrams the largest advertising platform is one of the favorite stock picks of other hedge funds. The Alphabet was in 150 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of September compared to the previous all-time high of 148.

Baron Opportunity Fund which returned 17.9% in Q3 2020 is among the bulls who expect Alphabet to outperform the broader market index in the quarter ahead. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund stated in an investors letter:

“Considering solid Fund inflows we added to long-term holding Alphabet Inc. to maintain its weighting in the portfolio. Alphabet is the parent company of Google the world’s largest search and online advertising company. We increased our position in Alphabet this quarter as a protracted COVID-19-related recovery in travel and brand advertising presented an attractive buying opportunity. We are encouraged by improving trends in both search and YouTube driven by durable tailwinds to e-commerce and local advertising as well as the continued shift of video advertising dollars away from linear television as consumers increasingly cut the cable TV cord. We believe Google is becoming slightly more disciplined in capital allocation than it has been historically. Lastly Google Cloud which this quarter achieved a $12 billion revenue run rate under the leadership of Thomas Kurian is having increasing success competing with larger vendors due to its strengths in security open-source and data analytics.”

6. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA)

The pharmaceutical company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA) is the fifth-largest stock holding of Abrams Capital accounting for 6.89% of the 13F portfolio. The firm first initiated a position in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries during the third quarter of 2017.

Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical underperformed over the past couple of years amid declining revenue and widening losses.

Hedge funds are showing low interest in Teva. It was in 33 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020 down sharply from the all-time high of 81.

Miller Value Partners recently commented about the reasons behind Teva’s underperformance in an investor’s letter. Here is what Miller Value Partner said:

“Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) declined 26.9% during the quarter as the market continues to be concerned on opioid liabilities as well as price fixing lawsuits. The company report 2Q results with total revenue of $3.87B below consensus of $4.024B but reiterated 2020 company guidance of $16.6-17B (consensus of $17.041B). The company reported 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.108B versus $1.099B expected and reiterated 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5-4.9B ($4.637B consensus) and adjusted EPS of $2.30-2.55 ($2.53 consensus) and Free Cash Flow of $1.8-2.2B. The company was hit after the US Department of Justice alleged in a lawsuit that TEVA provided illegal copays from 2006-2015 on a drug to treat MS. The allegation is $300mm of false claims which TEVA would be liable for 3x that in potential damages if they were to lose in court.”

Can you use ethernet with your Chromecast with Google TV?

While wireless internet is super convenient it isn't always the most stable and that may lead you to wonder does the Chromecast with Google TV support ethernet. I mean there's almost nothing worse than being right in the middle of an epic scene in your favorite movie only to have it buffer because of a poor connection.

One solution to bad wireless connectivity is to be sure you are using one of the best Wi-Fi routers the other is to go with the tried and true ethernet cable. However while the Chromecast with Google TV supports ethernet it doesn't have a port to plug a cable into. So to get your streaming device wired up you'll need to purchase an accessory. Not to worry Google has made an adapter specifically for the Chromecast with Google TV that is simple to use so you can get back to streaming in no time.

Google's adapter has the USB-C cable that goes to the Chromecast with Google TV attached with the ethernet port right on top of the wall plug for easy access. This adapter is rated for fast speeds of 10/100 Mbps so if your internet provider offers internet capable of 4K streaming you'll be able to plug into it directly. Just be sure that your TV is 4K ready as well.

Another option to get ethernet connectivity to your Chromecast with Google TV is to use a USB-C hub from a third-party that supports ethernet. Going this route can be beneficial if you are looking to expand the ports on your streaming device. Aside from only plugging in an ethernet cable you'll also be able to plug in things like a USB flash drive or an SD card with media on them to watch on your Chromecast with Google TV.

It's great to have options in how your dongle can get online. Regardless of whether you go wireless or plug in an ethernet cable you'll be able to watch all of your favorite content with ease through the Chromecast with Google TV.

Click to skip ahead to see Billionaire David Abrams' Top 5 Stock Picks.

The value investing guru David Abrams is one of the most successful hedge fund managers over the last two decades thanks to his strategy of buying undervalued stocks and holding them over the years to maximize gains. After working ten years for Seth Klarman's investment firm Baupost Group he founded Abrams Capital Management in 1999 and he managed to outperform the broader market index with a 15% average return in the first fifteen years since inception.

The self-made billionaire who also made billions for his investors manages $10 billion of assets at present while the value of the 13F portfolio stands above $3 billion.

The hedge-fund manager David Abrams is one of the most admired value investors and he runs a concentrated stock portfolio. The billionaire likes to diversify investments towards foreign equity securities private and illiquid investments and debt.

He is a follower of Benjamin Graham's value investing approach. “I’ve observed a great many investors over the years and I’ve never seen a consistently successful one whose strategy was not based on a value approach—paying less for something than it is worth either today or in the future” David Abrams said.

David Abrams of Abrams Capital Management

The billionaire hedge fund manager's investment strategy also includes buying depressed companies with strong long-term fundamentals. This is clearly reflection in its strategy of buying half a million shares of TransDigm Group Incorporated early this year when aircraft components supplier was under pressure. The billionaire also added to his Facebook stake early this year in the wake of staying at home policies and increased his position in internet advertisement company Alphabet.

He also took a big stake in Energy Transfer Partners early this year and added to his existing position in the September quarter as shares of the energy storage and transportation partnership remained under pressure throughout this year due to pandemic related challenges.

At the same time the Boston-based hedge fund has also slashed its stake in drilling companies amid bleak future fundamentals.

While David Abrams' reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As Seth Klarman's protege continually re-evaluates investments based on the market conditions let’s start examining billionaire David Abrams' top 10 stock picks to see how he is seeking to outperform the markets.

10. Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE:BEN)

The asset management holding company Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) is one of the long-running investments of billionaire David Abrams' 13F securities portfolio. Although the Boston-based hedge fund has reduced its position by 15% in the September quarter Franklin Resources is still the tenth largest stock holding of its portfolio.

Shares of Franklin Resources has been underperforming over the past five years amid sluggish financial numbers. Despite share price underperformance the company has extended its dividend growth strategy. It has raised its dividend every year since 1981.

9. AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL)

David Abrams has also been showing confidence in AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL) over the years. Abrams Capital Management has significantly raised its position in truck renting service several times since first initiating a position in 2016. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Abrams hedge fund accounting for 6.35% of the overall portfolio.

Shares of AMERCO rallied sharply during the second half of 2020 after making a range-bound movement in the past four years. The latest share price gains are backed by robust year over year revenue growth of 14.8% in the latest quarter. Moreover AMERCO’s earnings per share came in at $13.58 in the September quarter up almost 90% from the year-ago period. Instead of investing all the profits back into the business the company returns cash to investors in the form of big special cash dividends.

8. Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG)

Automotive retailer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG) is one of the favorite stocks of David Abrams’ hedge fund. The firm has been holding a stake in Asbury Automotive since 2017 and it currently accounts for 6.56% of the overall 13F portfolio. Boston based hedge fund is holding 2.1 million shares of Asbury Automotive valued at $206 million.

It appears that David Abrams has benefited from its Asbury position because shares of the Automotive retailer rallied 22% in the last twelve months extending the five years gains to 100%.

Other hedge funds are also showing interest in Asbury Automotive Group. It was in 24 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of June down slightly from an all-time high of 33.

Meanwhile Diamond Hill Capital is bearish about the future fundamentals of Asbury Automotive. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital stated about Asbury Automotive Group in an investors letter:

“Car dealer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. recently agreed to purchase a dealership in Dallas Texas to improve its poor new vehicle mix and geographic exposure; however the deal fell through because the business needs cash to survive the impact of the coronavirus. We believe the core Asbury business is weak (although well run) and that the slowdown in sales from the coronavirus will have a long-term impact on the business.”

7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Abrams Capital Management looks bullish over the largest advertising services platform Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). The firm has been holding a position in Alphabet since 2018 and it currently represents the seventh-largest stock holding in its 13F portfolio.

Shares of Google rallied almost 29% in 2020 accelerating five years gains to 120%. Besides David Abrams the largest advertising platform is one of the favorite stock picks of other hedge funds. The Alphabet was in 150 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of September compared to the previous all-time high of 148.

Baron Opportunity Fund which returned 17.9% in Q3 2020 is among the bulls who expect Alphabet to outperform the broader market index in the quarter ahead. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund stated in an investors letter:

“Considering solid Fund inflows we added to long-term holding Alphabet Inc. to maintain its weighting in the portfolio. Alphabet is the parent company of Google the world’s largest search and online advertising company. We increased our position in Alphabet this quarter as a protracted COVID-19-related recovery in travel and brand advertising presented an attractive buying opportunity. We are encouraged by improving trends in both search and YouTube driven by durable tailwinds to e-commerce and local advertising as well as the continued shift of video advertising dollars away from linear television as consumers increasingly cut the cable TV cord. We believe Google is becoming slightly more disciplined in capital allocation than it has been historically. Lastly Google Cloud which this quarter achieved a $12 billion revenue run rate under the leadership of Thomas Kurian is having increasing success competing with larger vendors due to its strengths in security open-source and data analytics.”

6. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA)

The pharmaceutical company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA) is the fifth-largest stock holding of Abrams Capital accounting for 6.89% of the 13F portfolio. The firm first initiated a position in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries during the third quarter of 2017.

The company reported 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.108B versus $1.099B expected and reiterated 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5-4.9B ($4.637B consensus) and adjusted EPS of $2.30-2.55 ($2.53 consensus) and Free Cash Flow of $1.8-2.2B. The company was hit after the US Department of Justice alleged in a lawsuit that TEVA provided illegal copays from 2006-2015 on a drug to treat MS. The allegation is $300mm of false claims which TEVA would be liable for 3x that in potential damages if they were to lose in court.”

In his opinion issued on Thursday Judge L. Mark Bailey upheld an April ruling from the Marion County Superior Court against a financial publication called Tax Analysts which sued to access the records.

Bailey wrote that the Indiana Economic Development Corporation does not have to disclose the documents because they ""consisted of records of negotiations and not a final offer of public financial resources. The documents he wrote are protected by Indiana's public records laws.

Cornish Hitchcock a lawyer representing Tax Analysts told IndyStar that his clients are reviewing the appeals court ruling and deciding next steps.

""We're talking about public resources that could be spent on other things” said Hitchcock. “IEDC is a public agency and there's a public interest in knowing how it proposes to use scarce public resources.""

IEDC spokesperson Erin Sweitzer declined to comment on appeal court's ruling referring IndyStar to a previous response it provided regarding the Amazon HQ2 bidding process.

In that response — from February Sweitzer said discussions on economic development projects must remain confidential until an incentive package agreed upon.

Confidentiality she said at the time ensures Indiana's competitive advantage and helps to attract new jobs protect tax dollars and upholds the state's ability to negotiate fiscally-responsible incentive packages.

The appeal court's Thursday ruling is another blow to the publication's efforts to upheave guarded information about the size and scope of public resources Indiana offered to Amazon in exchange for HQ2.

Tax Analysts previously reported on a proposal for the city of Gary which it received through a public records request. That plan offered two options one entailing $2.3 billion in economic incentives from the city and the state and another containing $3.2 billion.

Reporters for the publication tried to get access to Indiana’s proposal for Indianapolis all records related to the cost of the proposal and emails between Amazon and representatives of IEDC through public records requests sent to IEDC in January 2019.

The IEDC declined those requests setting off the legal dispute.

Freezing rain glazed trees grass and pavement Friday morning around the Peoria area. The icing caused slick roads and was part of a system that was moving southwest to northeast across much of Illinois.

Precipitation began to fall about 6 a.m. in Peoria according to Erin Roberson a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Lincoln. That office issued an ice-storm warning for the Tri-County area and the Illinois River valley.

West of the river including Fulton and Peoria counties the warning was to expire at midnight.

As of about 4:30 p.m. one-quarter inch of freezing rain was reported at multiple Peoria locations per the Weather Service. Farmington reported what appeared to be the highest area total one-half inch.

In Roanoke the total was three-10th of an inch with multiple reports of felled small tree limbs. Tree limbs also were reported down in Groveland Morton and Rushville.

The Peoria municipal public-works department cautioned against non-essential travel Friday. Crews were treating city streets but the ice heightened chances of falling tree branches and power lines.

About 1600 Ameren Illinois customers in the Metamora area and another 1500 or so in the Tremont area were without power late Friday afternoon the utility reported.

In Peoria about 500 Ameren customers also were powerless as were about 400 in Pekin 300 in the Deer Creek-Goodfield area and 120 in Roanoke.

In Macomb 0.20 inches of freezing rain was reported. So was one-quarter inch at Prairie City northeast of Macomb. That area was under a winter storm warning until midnight with 2 to 5 inches of snow and sleet possible.

The snow-sleet portion of the forecast reached Peoria late Friday afternoon. As of about 4:30 p.m. flurries were falling in North Peoria.

Roberson said freezing rain was moving out of the Tri-County area faster than anticipated. That might result in less accumulation than first forecast.

Light rain in the early afternoon switched to snow with accumulation of one-half to 1 inch possible.

Temperatures were expected to rise to the mid-30s with lows at night in the mid-20s. The same temps were forecast for the rest of the weekend with mostly cloudy skies Saturday and Sunday.

A chance of rain and/or snow Saturday night was forecast.",,,,,,,,,

The Covid-19 pandemic has been brutal for U.S. airlines and significant relief isn't expected until the second half of 2021.

U.S. carriers' 2020 net losses likely topped $35 billion according to analyst estimates provided by FactSet. That includes what's expected to be Southwest Airlines ' first annual loss in more than four decades.

The pandemic ended a decade of profits that the historically boom-and-bust industry enjoyed until 2020 a stretch during which they hired tens of thousands of workers bought new planes and expanded their networks.

Airline stocks in 2020 dropped the most in years. American Airlines ' share price lost 45% its biggest percentage decline since before the carrier's 2013 merger with US Airways. Delta Air Lines ' stock lost 31% while United Airlines fell 51% over the last 12 months its biggest drop since 2008. Southwest shed 14%. The S&P 500 meanwhile rose by more than 16% in 2020.

The pandemic forced carriers to quickly shrink cut routes and park hundreds of jets. U.S. carriers' increased their total debt by $67 billion in 2020 to more than $172 billion to weather the crisis according to trade group Airlines for America. Paying that down will be a headwind over the next several years.

The good news is air travel demand has recovered a lot of ground compared with the volumes hit early in the pandemic. On April 16 the Transportation Security Administration screened 95085 people at U.S. airports less than 4% of the 2.6 million people that had passed through those checkpoints a year earlier. TSA airport screenings fueled in part by the yearend holidays surpassed 1 million people a day in the last five days through Wednesday though that's still down about 45% from a year earlier.

With lucrative business and international travel largely sidelined leisure travel became the most important market.

Airlines are expected to trim their losses and in some cases — including Southwest Delta Alaska — turn profitable next year according to analysts' estimates. Authorization of coronavirus vaccines has helped boost optimism about future travel demand though it isn't yet clear when more of the public will resume flying.

""Our mission of connecting the world has been reaffirmed by the events of the past year but we don't yet know what travel demand is going to look like when it rebounds"" said Delta's CEO Ed Bastian in an employee note on New Year's Day. ""Simply re-creating the Delta from 2019 won't be an option; our customers will give us the blueprint for the Delta of 2021 and beyond.""

Bastian reiterated that Delta expects the airline to turn cash-flow positive in the spring.

Airline executives have recently warned that they expect difficult months ahead as they pushed out targets for when they will break even and say they will continue to operate limited capacity to match weak demand. American Airlines President Robert Isom earlier this week said the carrier's January and February capacity will likely be 45% of 2019 levels.

Many potential customers are still not flying as coronavirus infections rise to ever higher records new travel restrictions are implemented and government officials recommend avoiding travel to slow the spread of the disease.

U.S. officials last week said all passengers must test negative for Covid-19 before flying to the United States after a highly contagious strain of the disease was detected in the U.K. though it has also been identified in California and Colorado.

Carriers recently won $15 billion in additional payroll support in the latest coronavirus relief package that President Donald Trump signed Sunday. That requires airlines to keep employees on staff through March 31 and to call back more than 30000 workers they furloughed when the terms of last package which was $25 billion expired on Oct. 1.

United Airlines executives said they expect it will be temporary.

""The truth is we just don't see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months"" CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart said in a Dec. 21 employee note. ""That is why we expect the recall will be temporary.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvUm91dGVzLUNPVklELXRlc3RpbmctcGlja3MtdXAtc3RlYW0tSmV0Qmx1ZS1hdC0xNTgzOTU3NS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Routes: COVID testing picks up steam + JetBlue at SFO animals on Alaska 737 Max more,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/Routes-COVID-testing-picks-up-steam-JetBlue-at-15839575.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvUm91dGVzLUNPVklELXRlc3RpbmctcGlja3MtdXAtc3RlYW0tSmV0Qmx1ZS1hdC0xNTgzOTU3NS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9qZXRibHVlLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JetBlue's First Airbus A220-300 Delivered,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9qZXRibHVlLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vbXltb2Rlcm5tZXQuY29tL21hc3NpbW8tdmlnbmVsbGktZGVzaWduLWlzLW5vdC1hcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Design Is Not Art: The Work and Legacy of Massimo Vignelli,"The design ideology of Massimo Vignelli often sounds a bit intense. During his almost half-century-long career he would design the legendary New York City subway map modernist furniture iconic kitchenware logos books and so much more. But despite these inherently creative projects Vignelli would never call himself an artist. He was famously quoted saying “Design is not art. Design is utilitarian art is not.”

This quote ultimately reveals Vignelli’s belief that all problems have a clear solution that could be found using logic. These problems—such as what logo best defines a company—were not artistic in nature. It required one to strip down complicated ideas into simpler concepts until the solution became clear.

After hearing such a strict description those unfamiliar with Vignelli’s work may imagine results that lack color or joy. But a logical design process does not mean a boring one. Vignelli simply believed that beautiful design meant understanding human nature and maximizing the efficiency of function in such a way that the work excited anyone who encountered it.

Vignelli founded Vignelli Designs with his wife Lella—another modernist designer who specialized in jewelry making. Under the firm’s name the couple designed iconography that is still familiar today including the identity of famous brands such as Bloomingdales and American Airlines. Vignelli completed all of this work under the belief that people deserved good design—and he was convinced that good design was pure with no meaningless decoration.

He believed that his life like the life of all designers was “a fight against the ugliness.” Read on to learn more about some of Vignelli's most famous projects and the legacy he leaves behind after his death in 2014.

Vignelli and American Airlines

Vignelli intensely disliked “marketing people.” He often complained that young businesspeople did not understand the beauty of crafting an identity and that they often added meaningless “vulgarity.” He thought that some business people did not give clients proper respect. They instead added decoration through an additive process—where meaningless pictures and colors were added with little critical thought. Instead Vignelli believed in a subtractive process. Remove lines until you have found the core elements or form of the concept—and hence the solution.

“You can reach timelessness if you look for the essence of things and not the appearance. The appearance is transitory—the appearance is fashion the appearance is trendiness—but the essence is timeless.”

When the Vignellis designed the American Airlines logo under the name Unimark International they simplified the design into its basic forms. They used a simple sans serif font and two basic colors. The American eagle was simplified to a based X-shape that divided the letters. To Vignelli this logo symbolized that American Airlines was an honest company no-frills and no-nonsense—just good service.

American Airlines would later rebrand after 45 years of using this logo. Vignelli responded with a break-down of the new design demonstrating its meaninglessness that came from ignoring important design rules. For example the new design included 11 stripes though the flag has 13. He reminded people that this was a constant problem that designers had to face—that folks were fickle and constantly rebranded for attention instead of using an honest design that did not add useless visual noise.

It is also important to note that the Vignelli American Airlines logo is so iconic because it utilized the font that the designer helped turn into the design staple that it is today: Helvetica.

Helvetica on the Rise Thanks to Vignelli

Among his many other claims to fame Vignelli is known as one of the people who popularized the font Helvetica. He used it in his designs extensively and towards the end of his career it was one of only four fonts that the firm Vignelli Associates ever used. The others were Garamond Bodoni and Century Expanded.

Vignelli explained the font’s flexibility by describing its ability to express love. “You can say ‘I love you’ in Helvetica. And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy. Or you can say it with the Extra Bold if it’s really intensive and passionate you know and it might work.”

One of the most obvious embodiments of Vignelli’s legacy can be found all over New York City in the signs and branding of the NYC Subway system—and all written in Helvetica.

Untangling the NYC Subway

Vignelli believed that the subway map was essentially two components— lines which symbolized the direction trains were going in and dots which symbolized the stops along those routes. He believed everything else was unnecessary visual complexity. Why did travelers need to see every single twist and turn that the train would take?

Vignelli’s map “untangled” the jumble of the NYC subway and has become the permanent branding of the system. The simple colored dots are deeply engrained in everyone who lives in and visits the city today. Unfortunately New York replaced the map but some of his logic still remains in the current version and the consolidated signage and dot system are still in use.

“Good design is a matter of discipline. It starts by looking at the problem and collecting all the available information about it. If you understand the problem you have the solution. It’s really more about logic than imagination” he says. The NYC Subway map is the perfect example of how Vignelli believed in logical solutions that pushed the boundary of simplicity.

Product Design by the Vignellis

Massimo and Lella worked together on many industrial and product design projects. One of their most famous works is the Heller Vignelli kitchenware set especially the famous mugs. These products adhered to traditional modernist ideals with a focus on simplicity and logic.

The mugs were designed so that the handle bent to create a place for your thumb. Though popular in Europe the cups ran into some cultural issues in the U.S. as consumers complained that they tended to spillover through the handle. Vignelli explained that Europeans filled their cup halfway which is how he intended for them to be used. Americans filled their cup closer to the top leading to a leaking problem when the mugs were moved too quickly. These were later capped to prevent issues.

Despite the initial controversy the Heller Vignelli dish sets are a highly sought-after example of modernist kitchenware.

Books on Design

Vignelli's best-known design logic for books was a highly developed grid. He was quoted saying “a grid is like underwear you wear it but it’s not to be exposed.” Every page that he designed started with this grid even if many of the guidelines were not used on every page.

Many great design rule books have been written both by and about Vignelli. These include: The Vignelli Canon Vignelli From A to Z and Design: Vignelli

The Work Is the Reward

Artists and designers are often living proof of the idea that if you do what you love you’ll never work a day. Massimo and Lella undeniably loved the design practice that they dedicated their lives to. In an interview following their recognition of the 1982 Medal from the AIGA—Professional Association for Design—the couple was asked what motivates them to continue the work. Massimo fittingly responded: “The reward? Why the reward is to do all this!”

That’s the question facing the U.S. Navy right now and the answer is very likely to include a large number of unmanned ships both submersible and on the ocean surface.

By September of next year engineering on navigational capabilities autonomy and payload deployment for the Orca Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) program a major step toward achieving this superiority is expected to be completed.

Measuring fifty-one feet in length and weighing fifty tons and with maximum diving depths of 11000 feet Orcas will have a range of 6500 nautical miles and can run completely alone for months at a time. The submarine features an inertial navigation system depth sensors and the ability to surface to get a fix on its position via GPS. It uses satellite communications to phone home and report information or receive new orders. Echo Voyager has a top speed of eight knots.

One crucial feature of Echo Voyager is the modular payload system that allows it to take on different payloads to support different missions. The unmanned submarine has an internal cargo volume of 2000 cubic feet with a maximum length of thirty-four feet and a capacity of eight tons. It can also support external payloads hanging off the hull.

How much Orca will improve upon the technology already inside Echo Voyager is unknown. U.S. Naval Institute News reports that Orca will be capable of mine countermeasures anti-submarine warfare anti-surface warfare and strike missions. Orca could carry sonar payloads detect enemy submarines and send location data to friendly helicopters and surface ships.

Orca could even pack MK-46 lightweight torpedoes or MK-48 heavyweight torpedoes to attack submarines and surface ships. It would even carry anti-ship missiles. It can also be used to drop off cargoes on the seabed such as sensors to detect or lay mines to impede shipping. The modular payload system and open architecture software ensure Orca could be rapidly configured based on need.

This sort of versatility in a single low-cost package is at this point unheard of in military spending. The nearest rough equivalent is the $584 million Littoral Combat Ship which requires a crew of forty. While the LCS is faster and carries a larger payload the autonomous Orca is cheaper by orders of magnitude.

For missions such as anti-submarine warfare dozens of cheaper Orcas could saturate an area potentially a far more effective strategy than that provided by a single surface ship or a manned submarine. Several Orcas could be controlled by a single shore-based crew allowing the autonomous submarines to operate independently for days or even weeks at a time.

Another benefit of unmanned submersibles is that they are more or less disposable and able to operate in dangerous waters without risking human lives. Orca could pretend to be a full-size submarine; waiting for an enemy submarine to take a shot while a real Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sits back waiting to ambush it. Orca could take on the most dangerous missions such as laying mines in heavily defended waters. They would be leaving behind a deadly surprise for enemies convinced that mine laying in their waters is simply too dangerous for manned submarines.

It is still not known whether an Orca system can become a full-fledged part of the fleet although the Navy’s purchase of four indicates that there are plans for using them for real-world missions. The Navy may be purchasing enough to continue testing while having a few on hand for actual use. Inexpensive systems like Orca could go a long way towards one of the most understated promises of unmanned air land and sea drones: reversing the out-of-control costs of today’s weapons systems.

While China’s development of unmanned surface vessels may just be getting started researchers in AI projects report that the country is developing large smart and relatively low-cost unmanned submarines that appear to be capable of performing a wide range of missions from reconnaissance to mine placement to even suicide attacks against enemy vessels. These submarines—expected to be deployed in the early 2020s and not intended to entirely replace human-operated submarines—are intended to contest U.S. Naval forces in strategic waters like the South China Sea and Western Pacific Ocean.

At the testing facility at Zhuhai Guangdong province military researchers are also reportedly developing an AI-assisted support system for submarine commanders. The new class of unmanned submarines is expected to join the other autonomous or manned military systems on water land and orbit to carry out missions in coordinated efforts according to the researchers.

China’s plans for unmanned warships are clearly extensive. It is part of the government’s ambitious plan to boost the country’s naval power with AI technology.

With no human operators on board these subs will handle their assignments and return to base on their own. While they may establish contact with the ground command periodically for updates they will be designed to completing missions without human intervention.

According to researchers the AI-powered subs are “giants” compared to the normal UUVs. Their cargo bays are reconfigurable and large enough to accommodate a wide range of freight from powerful surveillance equipment to missiles or torpedoes. Their energy supply comes from diesel-electric engines or other power sources that ensure continuous operation for months. The Chinese unmanned submarine would not be nuclear-armed and their main advantage is that they can be produced and operated on a large scale at a relatively low cost.

While not presently developing unmanned submarines Russia has something of an equivalent with the Poseidon deemed a “doomsday weapon” by the Pentagon back when the drone-bearing torpedo was still known as the Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System. President Vladimir Putin confirmed the operational status of Poseidon during his March 2018 State of the Nation address in which he touted work on “unmanned submersible vehicles that can move at great depths—I would say extreme depths—intercontinentally at a speed multiple times higher than the speed of submarines cutting-edge torpedoes and all kinds of surface vessels including some of the fastest. They are quiet highly maneuverable and have hardly any vulnerability for the enemy to exploit. There is simply nothing in the world capable of withstanding them.”

There is also major competition underway between the United States and China to develop unmanned surface combat ships. On November 5 a strange-looking ship just under 200 feet in length docked at Port Hueneme Calif. 4700 miles from her departure point at Mobile Ala. What was unique and historic about the ship and the event was that she had made the voyage including transit of the Panama Canal with no one aboard.

The unnamed ship is a Ghost Fleet Overlord test vessel playing a vital role in the U.S. Navy ‘s development is what is expected to be a large number of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) capable of packing massive fire power and vast recognizance capabilities into combat zones without the risking a single crew member’s life and at vastly reduced cost than the manned navy.

In early 2019 USS Sea Hunter became the first ship to autonomously navigate a straight-line voyage from San Diego to Pearl Harbor and back without a crewmember demonstrating that the Navy has autonomous technology and is ready to move from the developmental and experimental stages to advanced mission testing.

Today two-thirds of the U.S. fleet is made up of Large Surface Combatants (LSCs) monolithic and multi-mission platforms (e.g. destroyers and carriers) designed to perform many missions at once in self-contained kill chains existing within single hulls which are expensive to man and maintain. The likely future alternative is a transition to unmanned systems capable of taking the place of manned platforms in some situations. Two unmanned systems could take the place of one destroyer and one frigate at a substantially lower cost.

Strategically the Navy is transitioning from a war-of-attrition approach to a strategy of capabilities that will confuse enemies enough to forestall conflict or to win should conflict be unavoidable.

The service is so sure that it needs USVs for its future operations that it is pouring $2.7 billion into researching and buying ten large USVs over the next five years. With much still unknown about the capabilities of USVs why is the Navy risking such major investment? According to Vice Admiral Bill Merz formerly Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Systems (OPNAVN9) and currently commander of the 7th Fleet this lack of knowledge is precisely the reason.

“We have a lot to learn on the unmanned surface vehicles” he explains. “We’ve all said that in testimony but we’re at the point where we really have to get them out there to start understanding how tough are these things how robust and how are they going to integrate them with the fleet what kind of policies are going to surround these systems when you start talking about potentially separating weapons from humans. We’re cautious on that side but we’re very aggressive in getting it out there and run these parallel paths and illuminate these challenges and start resolving them.”

Admiral Merz added that this commitment sends a tremendous message to the ship-building industry crucial to companies making the investments needed to meet the Navy’s coming requirements. “Every recent study we have done several of them directed by Congress has indicated that this capability if indispensable. In fact absolutely essential if a more distributed more lethal more cost-imposing all to complement the 355-ship Navy” he said.

Potential adversaries are of course well into the development of unmanned surface ships as well. At just over a third the length of the Sea Hunter China’s JARI USV unmanned “warship” is boasted to have the firepower of an Arleigh Burke destroyer.

In its 2021 budget request to Congress the U.S. Navy asked for $580 million for research and development of unmanned vessels. The appropriation is essential so the future Navy would include large and medium unmanned surface vessels and large unmanned submarines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9leHBlcnRzLWJlbGlldmUtdXMtZW1iYXNzaWVzLXdlcmUtaGl0LXdpdGgtaGlnaC1wb3dlci1taWNyb3dhdmVzLWhlcmVzLWhvdy10aGUtd2VhcG9ucy13b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts Believe US Embassies Were Hit With High-Power Microwaves – Here's How the Weapons Work,"Some of the cases of the mystery ailment that has afflicted U.S. embassy staff and CIA officers off and on since 2016 in Cuba China Russia and other countries most likely were caused by pulsed electromagnetic energy according to a report by a panel of experts convened by national intelligence agencies.

The report’s findings are similar to those of another report released by the National Academies in 2020. In that report a committee of 19 experts in medicine and other fields concluded that directed pulsed radiofrequency energy is the “most plausible mechanism” to explain the illness dubbed “Havana syndrome.”

Neither report is definitive and their authors don’t address who targeted the embassies or why they were targeted. But the technology behind the suspected weapons is well understood and dates back to the Cold War arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. High-power microwave weapons are generally designed to disable electronic equipment. But as the Havana syndrome reports show these pulses of energy can harm people as well.

As an electrical and computer engineer who designs and builds sources of high-power microwaves I have spent decades studying the physics of these sources including work with the U.S. Department of Defense. Directed energy microwave weapons convert energy from a power source – a wall plug in a lab or the engine on a military vehicle – into radiated electromagnetic energy and focus it on a target. The directed high-power microwaves damage equipment particularly electronics without killing nearby people.

Two good examples are Boeing’s Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) which is a high-power microwave source mounted in a missile and Tactical High-power Operational Responder (THOR) which was recently developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to knock out swarms of drones.



A news report about the U.S. Air Force’s high-power microwave anti-drone weapon THOR.

Cold War origins

These types of directed energy microwave devices came on the scene in the late 1960s in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. They were enabled by the development of pulsed power in the 1960s. Pulsed power generates short electrical pulses that have very high electrical power meaning both high voltage – up to a few megavolts – and large electrical currents – tens of kiloamps. That’s more voltage than the highest-voltage long-distance power transmission lines and about the amount of current in a lightning bolt.

Plasma physicists at the time realized that if you could generate for example a 1-megavolt electron beam with 10-kiloamp current the result would be a beam power of 10 billion watts or gigawatts. Converting 10% of that beam power into microwaves using standard microwave tube technology that dates back to the 1940s generates 1 gigawatt of microwaves. For comparison the output power of today’s typical microwave ovens is around a thousand watts – a million times smaller.

The development of this technology led to a subset of the U.S.-Soviet arms race – a microwave power derby. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 I and other American scientists gained access to Russian pulsed power accelerators like the SINUS-6 that is still working in my lab. I had a fruitful decade of collaboration with my Russian colleagues which swiftly ended following Vladimir Putin’s rise to power.

Today research in high-power microwaves continues in the U.S. and Russia but has exploded in China. I have visited labs in Russia since 1991 and labs in China since 2006 and the investment being made by China dwarfs activity in the U.S. and Russia. Dozens of countries now have active high-power microwave research programs.

Lots of power little heat

Although these high-power microwave sources generate very high power levels they tend to generate repeated short pulses. For example the SINUS-6 in my lab produces an output pulse on the order of 10 nanoseconds or billionths of a second. So even when generating 1 gigawatt of output power a 10-nanosecond pulse has an energy content of only 10 joules. To put this in perspective the average microwave oven in one second generates 1 kilojoule or thousand joules of energy. It typically takes about 4 minutes to boil a cup of water which corresponds to 240 kilojoules of energy.

This is why microwaves generated by these high-power microwave weapons don’t generate noticeable amounts of heat let alone cause people to explode like baked potatoes in microwave ovens.

High power is important in these weapons because generating very high instantaneous power yields very high instantaneous electric fields which scale as the square root of the power. It is these high electric fields that can disrupt electronics which is why the Department of Defense is interested in these devices.

How it affects people

The National Academies report links high-power microwaves to impacts on people through the Frey effect. The human head acts as a receiving antenna for microwaves in the low gigahertz frequency range. Pulses of microwaves in these frequencies can cause people to hear sounds which is one of the symptoms reported by the affected U.S. personnel. Other symptoms Havana syndrome sufferers have reported include headaches nausea hearing loss lightheadedness and cognitive issues.

The report notes that electronic devices were not disrupted during the attacks suggesting that the power levels needed for the Frey effect are lower than would be required for an attack on electronics. This would be consistent with a high-power microwave weapon located at some distance from the targets. Power decreases dramatically with distance through the inverse square law which means one of these devices could produce a power level at the target that would be too low to affect electronics but that could induce the Frey effect.

The Russians and the Chinese certainly possess the capabilities of fielding high-power microwave sources like the ones that appear to have been used in Cuba and China. The truth of what actually happened to U.S. personnel in Cuba and China – and why – might remain a mystery but the technology most likely involved comes from textbook physics and the military powers of the world continue to develop and deploy it

The claim was backed up soon after when the UN called for an ""immediate investigation"" into the crown prince.

According to the forensic report Bezos and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman exchanged numbers at a dinner in April 2018 — on May 1 of that year Bezos' iPhone is said to have been infiltrated after he received a video attachment from the crown prince's personal WhatsApp account.

Within hours of Bezos receiving the video the report found that a ""massive and ... unprecedented exfiltration of data"" began an increase of more than 29000%.

While it's usual for A-listers to make all the headlines one designer really made a splash at the Oscars in 1995. There were some serious heavy hitters nominated that year Forrest Gump amongst them but one small indie Australian movie also received a nomination.

Today's top videos

The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert which tells the story of three fabulous drag queens on a cross-country road trip through the Outback stole hearts in 1995.

In one of the most head-scratching instances in Oscars fashion history the film's costume designer Lizzy Gardiner accepted the gold statue for Best Costume wearing a dress made entirely out of credit cards...

Lizzy Gardiner had been working as a costume designer in Hollywood since the beginning of the 90s and she had become known for her originality.

Lizzy and her partner Tim Chappel had just $20000 for the film but they turned out some truly provocative pieces from a dress made out of thongs to Guy Pearce's iconic silver wings costume that he wears on top of the Priscilla bus.

The Australian designer stole the show on the night of the awards wearing one of her own designs: a glittering full-length gold gown which was made out of 254 American Express cards. The cards were genuine but they had expired and each one had Lizzie's name on it.

The cards were joined together with wire and the dress had a split almost up to the waist. She finished off the daring look with a pair of chunky platform heels (and gold underwear!)

Giving her two cents on the showstopping ensemble on the night she reportedly said: 'I’m broke and I didn’t have anything to wear. So I went through my list of past good ideas.'

The dress unsurprisingly caused quite the scandal. Universally lauded as tacky the designer later admitted: 'On the night it really upset a lot of people. A lot of women I think they felt upstaged or pissed off that I wasn't taking things as seriously as I should.'

While walking the red carpet is as good a time as any to make a political statement many speculated that the dress was a nod to overconsumption and consumerism.

It wasn't. The wonderful irony of the situation was that American Express had actually declined to appear in the film in the first place.

According to reports Gardiner had wanted to dress up one of the film's stars in a gown made from credit cards and it was a big fat no from AMEX.

So she made the dress and rocked it on the red carpet instead.

But the funny thing was that American Express did supply her with the cards to make her now-iconic Oscars dress.

A spokesperson for the brand explained the change of heart in an interview published by the Los Angeles Times at the time: 'It’s different... She’s not dressing a character. She’s dressing herself.'

When American Express announced their slogan 'Never leave home without it' during the 90s they probably weren't expecting that!

While it's been dubbed one of the worst Oscar dresses of all time Lizzy Gardiner still went home with the gold statue on the night.

Travel perks still aren’t what they used to be and it’s going to be at least 3-6 more months before they are once again. For travel heavy premium credit cards that means it’s time to get creative. Once again American Express has. After offering $20 monthly credits last year for streaming or mobile devices Amex is offering a broader credit for 2021 with $30 in monthly PayPal credits for 6 months. Here’s everything you need to know.

Amex Platinum PayPal Credit For 2021

If you have the personal Amex Platinum Card in the USA congrats you just got $30 of your PayPal purchases covered each month for the first six months of the year. That’s $180 towards purchases you make with PayPal including shopping at most major retailers.

The only catch – person to person transactions don’t count. With the $30 credit the amount will automatically come off of any tallies you rack up over the month. So if you were to buy some Yeezy’s for $200 you’d receive a credit back of $30 making it $170.

Good to know: the credit resets monthly so if you don’t spend at least $30 in PayPal each month you won’t get the full $180 in perks over the six months. You’ll basically want to spend at least $30 each month via PayPal. If you don’t already it’s quite handy for shopping since it saves all your details and makes checkout both faster and more secure.

PayPal and Amex have a partnership explainer page which hammers out the rest of the details you might be curious about. For example – all transactions must be made in USD.

With an annual fee of $550 on the Platinum Card $180 back in the first six months plus all the 18+ other useful money saving benefits like $180 in Uber credits $100 Saks credit and a $200 airline fee credit plus Fine Hotels & Resorts offers still makes this a compelling card.

If you don’t already have the Amex Platinum Card Amex is currently offering a sign up bonus of 75000 Membership Rewards Points plus 10X points on the first 6 months of gas and groceries which can add up quickly.

PayPal has been a popular partner with credit cards in recent months as Capital One added its name to the list of rewards points currencies which you can redeem directly on PayPal to cover some or all of a purchase instead of paying cash.

Amex has long offered integrations with Amazon and PayPal to present ways to use points for daily online purchases directly but they typically don’t represent the best value. That honor still goes to travel and holding onto American Express Membership Rewards points for when travel recovers is most likely the way to go.

Here’s some inspiration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxLzAxLzAxL2JsYWtlLW1vb3JlLXRha2VzLXBheS1jdXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blake Moore takes a pay cut to join Congress while Burgess Owens nearly triples his wages,"(Tribune file photos) Utah Reps.-elect Burgess Owens left and Blake Moore. Moore will take a sizeable pay cut to work in Congress while Owens will actually see an increase in pay.

Rank-and-file members of Congress are paid an annual salary of $174000. When Rep.-elect Blake Moore R-Utah is sworn into office office Sunday the 40-year-old management consultant will take a pay cut.

But Utah’s other incoming freshman Burgess Owens a 69-year-old former NFL player who made money by running a charity and giving speeches will nearly triple his salary.

That’s according to personal financial forms that the pair filed with Congress plus additional information that Moore provided.

Moore who in 2019 was promoted to a principal at the Cicero group says he was paid a salary in 2020 of $181020 plus a year-end bonus based on performance.

So “it will be a decrease for me to go back to Congress” Moore said.

Not to worry. His forms show that he and his wife are millionaires with assets worth between $3.7 million and $6.9 million — or more. That doesn’t count his personal home or cars which are not disclosed on congressional forms.

It could be more than that top amount because of how assets are reported in broad ranges sometimes with no upper limit.

Two assets held by Moore’s wife Jane a daughter of prominent developer Roger Boyer are each valued “over $1 million” — with no upper limit. Those assets are shares in different real estate and commercial investment arms of the Roger Boyer Family Partnership.

Moore’s disclosure forms show that his “unearned income” from interest and dividends on investments plus some rental income in 2020 was between $322456 and $2.39 million.

He disclosed a long list of stock holdings in some of the nation’s best-known companies including Amazon American Express Apple Boeing Bank of America Berkshire Hathaway Facebook Johnson and Johnson Microsoft Raytheon and The Walt Disney Co.

Moore said he has been consulting with the House Ethics Committee to discuss how to handle those investments in compliance with House rules which might require fairly frequent updates on his disclosure forms for any transactions and trades. Such rules were developed to help prevent insider trading by members of Congress.

Moore said he is looking to avoid the need of such frequent updates by using index funds (with less-frequent trades) or blind trusts managed by others.

“That’s all something that I’m considering and actually working with a financial adviser on figuring out” Moore said. “There’s a lot of things to consider and a lot of nuance.”

Owens meanwhile reported on amended disclosure forms that he earned $63607 in 2019 the last full year for which his income needed to be reported. That’s about a third of the $174000 House salary he will receive.

“So I get a raise” Owens said. “Here’s the thing that I think is very important.... I’m so proud that this new group [of GOP freshmen] are not looking to be career politicians. We’re not looking at being lobbyists someday. There are many other things I could have done to get more money.... I’m there on a mission. I’m not there to be a long-term politician.”

(Rick Egan |Tribune file photo) Rep.-elect Burgess Owens talks to the media at the GOP election headquarters on Tuesday Nov. 3 2020.

His “earned income” in 2019 included $11109 from speaking engagements $14037 in royalties from books a combined $3461 for work at wellness companies Melaleuca and Quintessential Biosciences and $35000 for work at his somewhat controversial Second Chance 4 Youth charity. (An initial filing said he earned $70000 at the nonprofit but he later amended it).

On top of that he reported “unearned income” between $20001 and $65000 from Social Security payments and an NFL pension.

An earlier story reported that Second Chance 4 Youth — formed to help troubled and incarcerated youths — raised $108793 in donations in 2019 but none of it actually went directly to help youths according to a report it filed with the state Division of Consumer Protection.

But Owens said working with young people is his passion. “When my time is done or when people feel that I’m not representing them I’m more than happy to come back and work with the kids.”

Other parts of Owens’ personal finances were controversial during the campaign including being attacked in ads for multiple bankruptcies through the years.

Meanwhile Moore and Owens report that they has been working hard to launch their offices as the new Congress begins.

“That’s been a priority to make sure that we are up and running on day one not only in the D.C. office but the district office in downtown Ogden” Moore said. “I’m going to be available for constituent services and input.”

He drew a lowly 51 out of 57 in a lottery among freshmen for the order to choose new offices. But he’s happy with the one he scored on the third floor of the Longworth House Office Building. “At least it’s not in the basement” he said. “It has plenty of daylight and windows.”

Owens’ office will be on the same floor in the same building after he drew No. 19 of 57 in the lottery.

Moore and Owens say they will move into apartments on Capitol live. Moore will not move his young family there. He said his wife and three children plan to squeeze into his new one-bedroom apartment for some visits when possible. “The boys have slept in worse situations in family trips before” he said. “It’ll make it memorable.”

He said because of limited tickets due to COVID-19 only his wife and 8-year-old son will attend his swearing-in. “The twins” he said “will go next time.”

Owens will bring three daughters and seven grandchildren to Washington for the swearing-in Sunday. But with COVID-19 restrictions “most of them will be watching from the hotel.”

He still loves that they will at least be in Washington. “My kids were way too young to remember me playing in the NFL” he said. “To have them experience this [swearing-in] with me and to see the dreams I have ... is a real honor and I look forward to it.”

Delta runs a fantastic airline and people love earning Delta frequent flyer miles as a reward for flying Delta. While the program may not be as lucrative as American AAdvantage or United MileagePlus there are many things that the program does get right.

I’ll show you the best uses of SkyMiles how to maximize your earnings and how to leverage elite status if you’re someone who regularly flies Delta.

Once you meet the Delta Medallion status requirements you’ll earn even more SkyMiles and be treated to a better experience when flying Delta and their partners.

About SkyMiles: Delta Airlines Frequent Flyer Program

Delta SkyMiles is the most popular frequent flier program of the three legacy carriers in the US. Delta does a fantastic job with marketing. They have an onboard experience that American and United struggle to match. People just love to fly Delta and feel rewarded for doing so.

The Delta SkyMiles program was the first to switch to revenue-based programs of the three US legacy carriers. Delta runs such a solid and profitable operation that whatever Delta does United and American typically match.

From the consumer side this isn’t always a good thing. Delta doesn’t have access to first class awards on partners like American and United do. Delta’s partners aren’t as aspirational as American and United’s either. Award flights with Delta SkyMiles are often very expensive.

It’s easy to earn lots of SkyMiles by flying Delta and their partners shopping online or dining at restaurants spending money on Amex credit cards or participating in other promos that SkyMiles frequently runs.

SkyMiles’s partners and alliances

Delta is a founding member of the SkyTeam alliance. They’re perhaps the least well-integrated alliance in many aspects. Being able to earn and redeem SkyMiles across carriers like Air France and KLM China Airlines Garuda Indonesia and Korean Air is useful.

These are the members of SkyTeam:

Aerolineas Argentinas Delta Air Lines Saudia Aeromexico Garuda Indonesia TAROM Air Europa ITA Airways Vietnam Airlines Air France Kenya Airways Xiamen Air China Airlines KLM China Eastern Airlines Korean Air Czech Airlines Middle East Airlines SkyTeam member airlines

Delta also partners with a number of carriers outside of the alliance. Delta has major stakes in Virgin Atlantic Virgin Australia GOL LATAM and WestJet. You can earn and redeem miles on these carriers as well as Air Tahiti Nui and Hawaiian Airlines. Air Tahiti Nui is a special case though as redeeming SkyMiles on the flights is nearly impossible.

Earn and redeem SkyMiles with Virgin Atlantic

If you’re a SkyMiles elite member you’ll get access to partner lounges and priority services when flying with a partner internationally.

Delta SkyMiles benefits

There are a lot of things that Delta gets right. They run the most solid operations of any US carrier and are best at getting you where you need to go. Delta SkyMiles members enjoy lots of perks as well.

Delta SkyMiles never expire which is great for the casual traveler. They frequently have award sales on SkyMiles award tickets for Delta flights to Mexico and the Caribbean Europe and even Asia.

You can even earn Delta elite status solely through credit card spending. That does require putting a lot of spend on co-branded Amex cards. That can be invaluable for someone who values elite status but doesn’t want to chase it. Here’s the guide to earning Delta elite status with credit cards.

At the end of the calendar year any extra MQMs roll over to the next year. That gives you a kickstart to earning status every year and ensures your MQMs never go to waste if you’re a Delta elite.

If you’re a bit short on earning the requisite MQMs or MQDs for a particular year Delta will let you “buy up” to the next tier at the end of the year. That’s not always a good deal but another opportunity that Delta affords is members.

Delta also has partnerships with Airbnb and Lyft. Frequent travelers will be able to earn more SkyMiles that way.

If you’ve got an American Express Platinum Card you can access Delta SkyClubs whenever you’re flying Delta. That’s a fantastic perk as Delta SkyClubs are some of the nicest domestic lounges in the US.

Access Delta SkyClubs with the Amex Platinum Card whenever you fly Delta

Delta is the only US airline that flies to every inhabited continent on earth. While a flight to Sydney or Cape Town might require a large number of SkyMiles being able to earn and redeem miles across such a wide route network is valuable.

Delta SkyMiles charges low surcharges on award travel too with a few exceptions. They levy fuel surcharges on partners like China Eastern. If you originate in the EU and travel with an EU carrier you’ll also be looking at high surcharges for award travel. The surcharges aren’t as high as they are for carriers like British Airways but it is something to be aware of.

Delta has access to premium economy awards across a number of their partners which is also unique. Premium economy is a good middle ground between economy class and business class. Being able to book these seats with miles is certainly useful.

How to Earn Delta SkyMiles

Earning SkyMiles is easy. You can earn them by flying with Delta and their partners spending money on Amex credit cards taking Lyft rides staying in Airbnbs shopping online dining out and many other ways. Here are some of the best ways to earn SkyMiles.

Flying with Delta

Delta SkyMiles is a revenue based program which means you earn SkyMiles based on the price of your ticket. Elites earn even more SkyMiles.

Here are the earnings rates:

Delta Medallion Status Earnings Rate on Delta Tickets General member 5 miles for every $1 Silver Medallion 7 miles for every $1 Gold Medallion 8 miles for every $1 Platinum Medallion 9 miles for every $1 Diamond Medallion 11 miles for every $1 Delta SkyMiles earning rates when flying on Delta issued tickets

It’s important to remember that you earn miles for the fare and surcharges but not government taxes and fees.

Flying Delta isn’t the most rewarding way to earn SkyMiles. Partner flights earn miles based on distance flown and you can earn even more SkyMiles through credit card spending and welcome bonuses.

Flying with Delta’s partners

When you fly with Delta Airline’s partners you’ll typically earn more miles than flying with Delta. That’s because Delta credits SkyMiles based on distance flown for partner flights. Flying further distances earns more SkyMiles. Spending more on a ticket doesn’t increase your earnings.

You can earn a lot more SkyMiles Medallion Qualifying Miles (MQMs) and Medallion Qualifying Dollars (MDQs) with partners than you can with Delta. International business class tickets can be lucrative. There are many people who qualify for status this way.

Spending money on Amex credit cards

Delta has an exclusive agreement with American Express so all Delta SkyMiles credit cards are issued by Amex. US-issued Amex cards that earn Membership Rewards points can also be transferred to Delta SkyMiles.

Amex frequently has huge sign-up bonuses for SkyMiles credit cards so it’s worth taking advantage of those whenever they come along. You can typically expect to earn tens of thousands of bonus SkyMiles when you’re approved for a Delta credit card and meet the minimum spending requirements.

Being approved for SkyMiles cards is generally easier than it is for other high-end cards. Amex business cards are also easy to sign up for.

Being able to transfer American Express points to Delta SkyMiles instantly makes other Amex products valuable for even casual Delta flyers. Spending money on the Amex Platinum Card the Amex Gold Card or the Amex Everyday Preferred card can also earn SkyMiles.

It’s worth noting that Marriott points transfer to SkyMiles though there are much better airline programs to transfer to. Marriott has many more airline partners.

Shopping online dining and cruising

You can earn a lot of Delta SkyMiles by shopping online. If you click through to the retailer on the Delta SkyMiles Shopping page you’ll earn either a few SkyMiles for each dollar spent or a fixed rate for a purchase.

It’s always worth checking other shopping portals like TopCashBack and the Chase Ultimate Rewards shopping portal to see if there are better offers.

If you’re anyone who dines out regularly you can also participate in Delta’s SkyMiles Dining program. All you have to do is register a credit card with the program and whenever you dine with a participating restaurant you’ll earn Delta SkyMiles.

If you value Delta SkyMiles it’s worth signing up for. Keep in mind there are similar programs with American and United so you may prefer earning those miles instead. You can’t “double-dip” with the same credit card so it’s helpful to understand each airline’s shopping dining and cruise programs.

Traveling with Airbnb and Lyft

Delta has unique partnerships with both Airbnb and Lyft.

The Airbnb partnership works the same way as an online shopping portal meaning you have to enter your SkyMiles number on this website and then will be redirected to Airbnb’s website which will track your activity and credit your miles.

You can book your Airbnb stay with Delta to earn SkyMiles with every stay.

The Delta and Lyft partnership gives SkyMiles members opportunities to earn miles for all Lyft rides with no caps on how many miles that you can earn. This is an exclusive partnership so don’t expect another airline to have a similar partnership with Lyft.

You’ll have to link your Lyft account to your Delta SkyMiles profile and you’ll start earning SkyMiles automatically with every ride.

Best Ways to Redeem Delta SkyMiles

Delta SkyMiles can be used for award flights across Delta’s network of partners. While you can’t book international first class you can fly business class with some of the world’s top airlines.

Air France and KLM don’t release much award space between the US and Europe for SkyMiles members. If you’re traveling to Europe it’s best to look for award space with Virgin Atlantic via London.

For awards to Asia routing via Taipei with China Airlines is one of the best options and uses of SkyMiles. China Airlines offers a fantastic business class product but awards can be expensive.

Here are some of the best uses of SkyMiles.

Delta SkyMiles award sales

Delta frequently publishes flash sales on SkyMiles award tickets. More often than not these are for domestic and/or economy tickets but they do have sales on international business class.

Book Delta business class during a SkyMiles award sale

Whenever these sales come along it can be a great use of Delta SkyMiles. Being able to transfer Amex points instantly to Delta to book these flights makes them even more useful. Delta often announces these sales by email so it’s worth keeping your eye on promotional emails from Delta.

Booking short Delta flights (starting at 5000 SkyMiles)

Delta award flights can be as low as 5000 SkyMiles. It can be a good use of SkyMiles for a short haul flight that might otherwise be rather expensive.

You can also redeem Delta SkyMiles at a fixed rate using the “Pay with Miles” feature. This lets you use SkyMiles to offset the price of a revenue ticket. You only get one penny per SkyMile though which isn’t a great value.

International business class awards

The best awards with Delta SkyMiles are with partners. Delta has a hidden award chart for partner flights. They’re usually a great use of SkyMiles when there’s partner availability.

Awards from the US used to be reasonably priced (by Delta standards) however this year they gutted award redemptions for travel from the US. A one-way in business class from the US to Europe starts at 120000 SkyMiles and a one-way from the US to Southeast Asia is now 165000 SkyMiles.

There are some great values to be had from other international destinations. Business class awards from Mexico the Caribbean and Central America start at just 65000 SkyMiles. You can fly China Airlines from Europe to Asia for 90000 SkyMiles in business class. You can hop around Asia in business class for just 40000 SkyMiles.

Redeem SkyMiles for China Airlines business class

If you’re planning a trip with multiple destinations consider using SkyMiles for segments outside of the US.

Buying champagne in a SkyClub

A unique offering with Delta SkyMiles is being able to redeem them for premium drinks at SkyClubs across the US. This can be a great value as Delta lets you redeem SkyMiles for between 1.5 and 1.8 cents per SkyMile.

Enjoy a bottle of Krug before a Delta flight

Buying a bottle of champagne with miles is a fun way to start any trip and it’s a decent value. If you’re someone who appreciates nice champagne this can be one of the best uses of SkyMiles.

Upgrades on Delta flights

You can redeem Delta SkyMiles for upgrades on Delta flights. You can usually either select to pay cash or use Delta SkyMiles for an upgrade. Delta pegs SkyMiles at about 1 cent each for upgrades and I always try and get more value than this.

So while it’s an option it’s not always the best use of SkyMiles.

How to Maximize Redemptions with SkyMiles

If you book award flights within three weeks of travel they will usually require more SkyMiles than when booked far in advance. It’s best to book SkyMiles awards as far out as possible to get the most favorable pricing.

Award pricing for Delta flights using SkyMiles varies a lot. Sometimes there are sales and flights can be as cheap as 15000 to the Caribbean or Mexico while other times a round trip to Australia in business class can be over 1000000 SkyMiles.

If you book travel on partners using SkyMiles those awards are typically the cheapest. It’s always worth looking for saver space on partner airlines when booking with SkyMiles.

One of the best uses of Delta SkyMiles is using them for China Airlines to fly to Asia. China Airlines offers a fantastic business class product and award space to/from Taipei is plentiful. Delta.com doesn’t automatically show these connections. You’ll have to piece them together manually. You’ll want to start by finding the flights from the US or Europe to Taipei then search for the intra-Asia connection separately.

You’ll need to call to add the segment within Asia. That usually doesn’t require any more miles and sometimes you’ll even see a refund for fewer miles.

The best number to use when booking China Airlines awards is the Singapore call center. The agents are patient and well-trained and are much more “cooperative” than many US agents.

You can also try asking for the international manual reissue desk if you call the US numbers. They used to be the go-to desk for complicated international SkyMiles awards but they’re not as helpful as they once were.

Surcharges are very high on most awards that originate in Europe. Anything from Europe to the US will generally start at about $250+ in taxes fees and surcharges.

If you’re flying from Europe to Asia you’ll want to avoid awards on Air France/KLM Delta or Virgin Atlantic. Those carriers also have high surcharges on awards that originate in Europe. It’s better to look for flights with Korean Air China Airlines or Garuda Indonesia. The surcharges are much cheaper.

If you are transferring points from American Express to Delta SkyMiles you’ll always want to check availability and pricing with either Air France/KLM Flying Blue or Virgin Atlantic Flying Club first. They typically have more favorable rates so it’s often better to transfer points to those programs.

Lastly if you have an Amex Platinum card you can designate Delta as your preferred airline for the annual $200 fee reimbursement. Those fees could be award cancellation fees checked bag fees onboard services etc. Oftentimes award taxes are reimbursed as part of the fee reimbursement benefit though they’re not supposed to.

Delta SkyMiles Medallion Elite Status

As I’ve mentioned Delta runs a really solid operation. There’s no US airline I’d rather fly consistently than Delta and in the past I’ve often considered trying to spend my way towards status with Delta. Elite status with Delta brings upgrades free checked bags priority boarding and better seats and SkyTeam elite status.

SkyMiles elite tiers

Delta has four elite tiers with the following annual requirements:

Delta Elite Tier MQM/MQS Requirement MQD Requirement Silver Medallion 25000 MQMs or 30 MQSs 3000 MQDs Gold Medallion 50000 MQMs or 60 MQSs 6000 MQDs Platinum Medallion 75000 MQMs or 100 MQSs 9000 MQDs Diamond Medallion 125000 MQMs or 140 MQSs 15000 MQDs Delta Elite Status Requirements

MQMs are Medallion Qualifying Miles which refer to the number of elite miles you earn (this can vary based on the type of ticket you’re booking so you don’t always earn one MQM per mile flown). MQSs are Medallion Qualifying Segments which refer to the number of elite segments you earn (again you don’t always earn one MQS per segment flown as it varies based on the type of fare). MQDs are Medallion Qualifying Dollars which refer to how much you have to spend on your ticket to earn status; taxes and many fees are excluded from this total. Calculating Delta MQDs and knowing how to use them can be complicated.

While Delta-marketed flights earn MQDs via the above method Delta partner flights earn MQDs based on a percentage of the distance flown. This is calculated based on a combination of the fare class and distance of the flight.

It’s also possible to earn Delta Medallion status with credit cards alone. You can find a full guide to earning Delta elite status with credit card spending here.

Elite benefits

As soon as you earn SkyMiles Medallion status your airport experience will be easier and more comfortable. You might even find yourself with extra legroom seats once onboard.

All levels get complimentary preferred seats.

Airport benefits

Silver Medallions have baggage fees waived while Gold Platinum and Diamond Medallions have baggage fees waived as well as same-day standby fees waived.

Delta SkyMiles FAQs

Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about Delta SkyMiles.

What is Delta doing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic?

Delta is extending status by one year for all SkyMiles elites. That means elite status won’t expire until January 2022 at the earliest. They were the first program to extend status in the US and the other airlines soon followed.

Delta was blocking middle seats but that policy ended in the beginning of May 2021. They do still have additional hygienic measures onboard to ensure customers’ safety.

What are SkyMiles worth?

I value SkyMiles at 1.3 cents each. There are certainly ways to get outsized value but that’s a fair estimate. You can find a full post about how to value your miles and points here.

When do SkyMiles expire?

Never. Delta SkyMiles do not expire.

How many SkyMiles do I need to go to …?

Delta does not publish their award charts. Partner flights do price according to hidden award charts. With Delta flights “the price is the price”. Partner awards following a hidden award chart.

Asia: 120000 SkyMiles in business class

What are MQMs and MQDs? What are MQDs?

MQMs are Medallion Qualifying Miles MQSs are Medallion Qualifying Segments and MQDs are Medallion Qualifying Dollars. These the metrics Delta uses for awarding elite status.

If you’re looking to earn Delta elite status there are two ways to do it – by flying a certain number of miles or a minimum number of segments. Those distances are known as Medallion Qualifying Miles (MQMs) or Medallion Qualifying Segments (MQSs).

You’ll also have to earn a certain amount of MQDs to get status. Dollars spent on Delta flights count towards MQDs while distance and cabin calculate the number of MQDs you earn when flying partners.

What is the best Delta SkyMiles credit card?

That depends! Amex issues a number of different cards each with different perks. You can easily earn tens of thousands of miles in welcome bonuses and even elite status through spending on Delta cards.

How can I access Delta SkyClubs?

The best way to access Delta SkyClubs is by using a credit card that provides access.

Yes you can use Delta SkyMiles to upgrade flights with Delta. You’ll get one penny per SkyMiles towards the cost of a paid upgrade.

Why is my SkyMiles award so expensive?

Delta SkyMiles was the first of the US programs to remove award charts and introduce variable pricing for award travel. While Delta has a huge route network some awards on Delta flights can be astronomical when booked using SkyMiles.

The best values are partner awards in business class like Virgin Atlantic business class and China Airlines business class.

For generations profound and painful challenges such as colonialism forced resettlement strong external development pressures and exclusion from natural resource decisions have undermined Indigenous Peoples’ agency and ability to manage their lands and waters.



These externally-imposed power dynamics have disrupted countless communities’ relationships with territory with cultural and spiritual practices and with their ability to self-determine sustainable economies. Not only has this history of disempowerment harmed people—it's harmed the lands and waters they've lived on and all the life these places support.

When the legacy of these challenges is addressed Indigenous Peoples and local communities can lead us to a world where people and nature thrive together—as they have done for millennia.

As the year ended the United States surpassed 20 million infections from SARS-CoV-2 and more than 346000 deaths. Globally cases rose to 83832334 and 1824590 deaths.

Cases in some parts of the country began surging again in the weeks after Thanksgiving; the same effect may be seen in January as health officials are gravely concerned about the extent of travel for the Christmas and winter holidays. The Transportation Security Administration said it screened the most passengers (1.3 million) on the Sunday before Christmas the most since March 15.

While vaccines began to roll out in the last month of the year distribution challenges became evident and the United States fell short of its goal of providing an initial dose to 20 million people by December 31.

""The same people who own the companies that produce the coronavirus vaccine believe that the world is overpopulated and the world population must be reduced by 20 percent. This reduction is only possible by increasing deaths. There is evidence that these companies have manipulated the vaccine itself and contaminated it. How can one trust them in such circumstances"" Brigadier-General Mohammdreza Naghdi was quoted by the Iranian Students News Agency on Friday as saying.

Naghdi said he could not interfere in the work of health authorities but the health of the Revolutionary Guards is his responsibility so he can advise them on the matter of vaccination with foreign-made vaccines.

Hardliners have been campaigning against the Rouhani government plans to purchase US-made Covid vaccines through the World Health Organization’s Covax facility. They believe the west would even use vaccines as a biological weapon against Iranians and have instead been promoting a vaccine now in the first phase of human testing that a state-owned company claims to have produced.

The company Shifa Pharmed is a subsidiary of Barakat Foundation a charitable foundation – and business group − controlled by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

On Thursday tens of hardliners and clerics staged a protest rally against foreign-made vaccines in front of Iran's Health Ministry. One of the posters that participants carried demanded the ""exclusion of the Zionist-American World Health Organization (WHO) from decisions [on vaccination] in the country.""

Another poster in the rally urged the Judiciary to investigate the WHO representative in Iran for promoting UNESCO's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has repeatedly spoken against the implementation of the UNESCO goals as a means to destroy the country's ""Islamic-Iranian identity.""

Spurred by a social media campaign with the Hashtag ""By the vaccine"" that has gained huge popularity the government of President Hassan Rouhani and health officials who blamed the United States sanctions for preventing Iran from accessing vaccines now say they are trying to procure Covid vaccines through several channels.

So far health officials have said that their plans include buying the vaccine through the WHO's Covax program joint production with Cuba and direct purchase from several countries including China Russia and India as well as using homegrown vaccines if they become available.

On Wednesday President Hassan Rouhani said his government has no doubts about starting mass vaccination in three weeks with imported vaccines and not waiting for the homegrown ones. ""Arguing on whether it's better to import the vaccine or produce it is like arguing on whether our weapons should be made domestically or imported at the time of war"" he said without ruling out the prospects of using the homegrown vaccine in the future ""when we reach total self-sufficiency.""

Iran International on Thursday acquired a document that shows the Health Ministry a month ago sought budget for importing foreign-made vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through India. The vaccine which has been approved for use in the UK is now being mass produced by India's Serum Institute.

The Serum Institute which is among the top three vaccine makers of the country and the world's largest vaccine maker by volume has already manufactured 50 million doses of Covishield the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in its facilities in India. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine Covishield can be stored in a standard refrigerator.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZ3BwcmV2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL2Nhbi10ZWFtLXVuaXRlZC1tYWtlLTIwMjYtc3VjY2Vzcy1tZXhpY28tdXMtY2FuYWRhLWNhbi1sZWFybi1wYXN0LXdvcmxkLWN1cHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How can Team United make 2026 a success: What Mexico US and Canada can learn from the past World Cups?,"The 2026 World Cup sanctioned by the Fédération International de Football Association (FIFA) will be hosted by the trio of Canada Mexico and the United States. This will be the highest-profile single-sport event with this kind of host structure which presents potential political and logistical concerns. This article puts forth a case study for tournament organizers and highlights key components organizers should center on to maximize the local and international opportunities the world’s largest sporting event provides.

With more than half of the world population tuning in every four years the FIFA World Cup is the pinnacle of football passion. In January 2017 to make the event even more exciting and broaden the tournament’s appeal FIFA decided to expand the World Cup to 48 teams. Given the implications of this decision the expansion will take effect from the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

However there is another reason the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be unique. As announced on June 13 2018 FIFA Congress members voted in favor of the United Bid submitted by the football federations of Mexico U.S. and Canada—making 2026 the first FIFA World Cup to be co-hosted by three nations. Of the competition’s 80 football matches across 16 stadiums Mexico and Canada will host 10 matches each and the USA will host 60 matches.

Of the three host nations both Mexico (in 1970 and 1986) and the U.S. (in 1994) have previous World Cup hosting experience. Although Canada is yet to host the men’s event in 2015 Canada hosted the Women’s World Cup and has hosted multiple Olympic Games and most recently the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

About the Bid Book

The Bid Book is generally considered to be a preface to the actual event planning. According to the Bid Book the 2026 FIFA World Cup will generate record revenues and opportunities to benefit not only the hosts but also the global football community

The North Americans pledged their tournament would generate an $11 billion profit for FIFA – greater than any previous World Cup finals… The “United Bid” projected that its tournament would generate more than $5 billion in short-term economic activity including the creation of 40000 jobs and more than $1 billion in incremental worker earnings. More than 5.8 million tickets are expected to be sold generating over $2 billion in ticketing revenue. Evans and Philips (Reuters)

FIFA rules require certain capacity standards to host matches:

The opening match and final match venues must hold 80000 spectators

Semi-final match venues must hold 60000 spectators

Group stage matches the round of 16 quarter-finals and the third-place match venues must hold 40000 spectators

In addition the hosts promise over 150 venue-specific training sites and practice facilities with modern training amenities. The bid also has sustainability promises all the stadiums will still be of use after the tournament.

Learning from the past

Hugely popular mega sporting events (MSEs) including the FIFA World Cup are associated with ever-increasing costs to meet competition standards with the estimated hosting costs for the next World Cup approaching $200 billion.

Therefore future organizers should review the experiences of the past MSE hosts for important lessons and opportunities. The strategies implemented outcomes achieved and challenges faced by the past hosts can help shape the strategic planning for future events.

Although Mexico U.S. and Canada have a wealth of experience expertise and capacity to host a successful tournament the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be among the first experiments of three co-hosting nations. Despite many benefits of co-hosting an MSE it comes with certain unique challenges with the most critical one being the need to align the capacities and logistics of host nations and managing the international and subnational interdependencies.

The three-host concept has been tried in other sports: in 2011 India Pakistan and Sri Lanka co-hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup; and in 2023 Japan Indonesia and the Philippines will co-host the FIBA Basketball World Cup. In regional FIFA football competitions multiple hosts are more frequent: in 2012 Equatorial Guinea and Gabon hosted the Africa Cup of Nations; in 2000 2008 and 2012 two countries co-hosted the Euro competitions; in 2019 the U.S. Mexico and Costa Rica co-hosted the Gold Cup; and in 2007 the Asian Cup had four host countries (Indonesia Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam).

But for the largest competition in the world only one contest has had multiple hosts: Japan and South Korea co-hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2002. Their experience could serve as a benchmark to evaluate unique challenges that might arise during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

During the 2002 FIFA World Cup co-hosts argued over a number of issues including the official name order ticket price policies and visa issuing as well as currency exchange and stadia construction which contributed to the complexity of co-hosting a mega event.

Similarly any political spat between the U.S. Mexico and Canada could cause border tensions restricting the free movement of spectators. Political conflicts could complicate visa approvals for international travelers across the three nations.

Travel logistics between host countries can be another challenge for spectators which was clearly evident during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Although the 2026 FIFA World Cup would not require spectators to cross a sea traveling distant miles can be challenging. Travelers will also need to manage three different currencies. Given the proliferation of distributed ledger technology financial technology and banking innovation this could be an opportunity to promote a cashless FIFA World Cup.

At the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa ticket counters were placed in shopping malls and city centers to encourage local business opportunities and to make tickets accessible to people from diverse economic backgrounds. Similarly implementing ticket sales through online and offline channels may help ensure greater participation during the 2026 FIFA World Cup matches.

The United Bid Book refers to various entertainment programs and festivals to be conducted to engage fans during the event. Host nations should consider expanding these entertainment programs and festivals to take place before during and after the tournament as well as in non-host cities to ensure longer visitor stay even after the final match (as seen during the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia). Qatar the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup has similar plans to increase tourism and local business opportunities. A similar strategy if adopted during the 2026 FIFA World Cup would help increase the scope for local businesses in host and non-host cities.

Extending local business hours during event days would maximize economic activity – a serious challenge faced during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Since the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be co-hosted by three nations the Local Organizing Committee and tourism agencies should cooperate to offer three-nation packages for international travelers and maximize the impact of the tournament on the local tourism industry.

The FIFA World Cup provides a global platform that can enhance or rebrand a nation’s image as well as help spread awareness about a particular cause across the world. Past tournaments have been used as a platform to promote environmental causes. Restricting the use of non-recyclable materials enhancing waste management and recycling as well as the use of electric vehicles are good examples adopted during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia that helped reduce their carbon footprint. While adopting similar measures the 2026 FIFA World Cup organizers could go even further by innovating carbon-neutral transportation between the three nations.

With a variety of opportunities and challenges ahead the 2026 FIFA World Cup could serve as a major catalyst for innovation and business opportunities. However taking advantage of those opportunities will depend on the collaboration between the policymakers organizers and local businesses and determine the impact and legacy of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

(WBTV) - The Charlotte skyline is lighting up purple on New Year’s Eve.

The purple is symbolizing “the end of a turbulent year and encourage hope for 2021.”

Mecklenburg County and Center City stakeholders say they are humbled by the strength of the community.

“We want to honor those who have been deeply affected by the COVID-19 crisis – from the frontline workers who have kept Charlotte running to the 557 people in our County who lost their battle with COVID-19 since March – by changing the building lights to purple” a press release read.

“Our lives have been forever altered by COVID-19. But no one’s lives have been more effected than those who have lost loved ones this year to this virus” said Mecklenburg County Public Health Director Gibbie Harris. “We are fighting hard every day to get the lifesaving vaccine to as many people as possible. It is fitting that we remember those we have lost with the symbolism of purple in Uptown Charlotte this New Year’s Eve.”

“Throughout the crisis the strength compassion and resilience of the community has been both overwhelming and inspiring to all Center City stakeholders” said Michael Smith president and CEO of Charlotte Center City Partners. “The lights on the building are one way to commemorate and honor those who were lost to this disease while also trying to provide a symbol of hope as the calendar turns from 2020 to 2021. We also want to thank all who are sacrificing so much by working tirelessly to keep our community safe.”

Despite heavy fog in Charlotte Thursday night the lights came on around dusk and lit the night into the new year. The Uptown buildings that participated include:

Bank of America Corporate Center

Bank of America Tower at 620 South Tryon

300 South Tryon

Truist Tower

Uptown 550

The Vue

NASCAR Hall of Fame

Blumenthal – Belk and Knight lobbies

In one corner is a Texan millionaire DJ and property developer who has put forward plans for a 20-storey office block in Brixton next to a conservation area and the district’s famous Electric Avenue.

Taylor McWilliams’s property company Hondo which owns most of Brixton market claims the proposal will “deliver” 2000 jobs in the area and generate £2.8m every year for the local economy.

In the other corner is a group of residents whose fierce opposition has been joined by Historic England and the Victorian Society which this month wrote to the mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the proposal no longer had merit in a post-Covid future where more people would be working from home.

McWilliams a member of the DJ collective Housekeeping first attracted local anger when Hondo served notice on a popular small shop Nour Cash & Carry.

But following a social media campaign called Save Nour – backed by celebrities including rock singer Skin from Skunk Anansie – the shop will stay albeit moved to a new site nearby.

Now McWilliams find himself facing further local censure after his plans for the tower were approved last month by Lambeth council despite almost 8000 people signing an online petition opposing it.

The Save Nour group wants the mayor to intervene a move backed by the Victorian Society.

“This area of Brixton has avoided the intensive development which has blighted many of London’s historic urban centres” said Olivia Stockdale conservation adviser for the society. “It therefore retains its character as a predominantly Victorian town centre.

“The plans to construct a building of 20 storeys next to this conservation area demonstrates a total failure to understand and respond to the context of the area.

“While buildings of this height may be appropriate elsewhere in London this is clearly not a location where this applies. The proposed development would overshadow the surrounding buildings including the historic Electric Avenue which when built in the 1880s was the first market street lit by electric lights.”

There were reports that the development had already been approved by the mayor. An email was circulated that appeared to confirm Khan had given the go-ahead. But this was later attributed to an administrative error.

In response to locals’ concerns Hondo told the Observer that it was setting up a community liaison group “to identify and map how the local community can engage with this project including engagement through the community space”. It claimed that the proposal had received support from more than 1000 residents predominantly from the local area and a large percentage of current Brixton market traders.

Joe O’Donnell Victorian Society director called on Khan to consider whether London needed more office space. “This is an opportunity to respond to what is wanted by the local community. If a huge office tower block was ever really needed or viable in Brixton it’s commercial future seems now seems doubtful as it is unclear whether London will ever return to previous levels of office demand in a post Covid-19 world of home working. We have sent our objection to the mayor to inform his decision.”

Hondo said there was a “serious need for office and commercial space especially in Brixton”.

The company said in a statement: “Commercial space is at a premium and Hondo feel we are best placed to address that. Despite employment rising at twice the rate as in Lambeth in Brixton vacancy rates are virtually at zero. Studies have been undertaken by Savills which reflect that the post-Covid situation for office space will look very similar to the pre-Covid situation.”

O’Donnell said that if the plan were to go ahead it would set a precedent opening up the area and potentially other sites across the capital for further high-rise developments.

“Many of the largely Victorian town centres of urban London are already blighted by massive development which has radically altered their character for example Lewisham or Stratford. This character is becoming increasingly rare and this is why we argue the conservation area be spared it.”

However Hondo stressed that the new development would do justice to the area.

“The Pope’s Road development will be a landmark building and the design is of the highest quality led by world leading designer Sir David Adjaye who has drawn inspiration from architecture in Brixton” the company said.

“Our proposal takes direct inspiration from the existing markets and aims to extend and implement this unique urban typology.

“A thorough research into the character and history of Brixton from both an architectural and a cultural point of view allowed us to propose a scheme which is at the same time innovative and contextual.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXB1c3NhZmV0eW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS91bml2ZXJzaXR5L2JsdWUtbGlnaHQtZW1lcmdlbmN5LXBob25lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despite Decline in Usage Blue Light Emergency Phones Are Here to Stay,"Research shows blue light emergency phones help deter crimes and students and parents still want the technology on campus.

Postsecondary institutions are often criticized for spending money on new blue light emergency phones especially if the amount of emergency calls made on them has recently declined.

However despite a decrease in usage U.S. colleges and universities continue to expand their blue light phone systems. Why? The answer is because the ability to make emergency calls is just one of many reasons colleges have blue light phones.

Here are other ways blue light emergency phones can be used to improve your campus.

Blue Light Phones Can Help Increase Enrollment

Public safety is important for maximizing attendance. A study by the University of Southern California found that public venues with increased security measurements result in higher attendance rates. This is because visible security equipment increases the venue’s perceived safety making people feel more comfortable attending the venue. Related: Quiz: Clery-Reportable Crimes and Clery Geography Scenarios

According to a 2015 Noodle Survey of 985 parents the most important factor considered when evaluating potential colleges for their respective children is how safe the campus environment is. For this reason the University of Purdue is increasing the number of emergency phones on campus.

“Some institutions are phasing out emergency telephone systems but we are adding more. The number of boxes used to be around 250 and we have increased them to around 300” said Song Kang Captain of Special Services for the Purdue Police Department. “We find that students like them and parents love them—knowing that there is an added layer of safety.”

Blue Light Phones Deter Crime

A study of 422 incarcerated burglars found that window and lawn signs indicative of security measurements put in place are an effective way to deter burglary attempts. One of the most valuable aspects of a blue light phone is its ability to increase the awareness of on-campus security measurements.

Rice University in Houston Texas once had a stained history of criminal incidents similar to the city of Houston’s high crime rate. However after Rice completed the installation of 80 blue light emergency phones in 2010 the following year the school reported that the overall crime rate on campus decreased despite the city of Houston’s crime rate remaining high. Specifically on-campus burglaries plummeted by 67.74%.

As the number of blue light phones increased the perception and awareness of the campus’ security also increased deterring the number of on-campus burglaries from being attempted.

Students Want Them

In 2019 hundreds of students at the University of Florida protested after the UF student government failed to pass a resolution for emergency blue light phones to be implemented on Fraternity Drive.

Christina Pugliese a sophomore at UF spoke on the Senate floor in the spring during public comment demanding support for placing blue lights on Fraternity Drive. Related: Don’t Make These 10 Campus Security Mistakes

“If I had it my way every single fraternity would have a blue light on it but we don’t have that” she said. “We gotta take it one step at a time.”

UF Police Major Blake Barber said UFPD and UF administration support having more blue lights on campus and are looking at proposals to install them on fraternity row.

“We want to emphasize that we listen to our community members when they are bringing forward issues of concern and looking at how we can address them” Barber said.

Nearly Every Campus Has Emergency Blue Light Phones

It has become an unwritten requirement for college campuses to have a blue light phone system. Per the U.S. Department of Justice’s Special Report on Campus Law Enforcement 100% of private schools (15000+ students) have a blue light phone system as well as 92% of all university campuses. See the breakdown of college campuses in the chart below.

If 19 out of 20 colleges have emergency blue light phones the one school that lacks emergency phones is immediately at a disadvantage in terms of perceived security.

While fewer on-campus emergency calls are being made via blue light phones a decline in usage suggests emergency phones are actually doing their job of making campus safer by increasing the perception of security deterring crime and reducing the number of emergencies where a blue light phone would be needed.

Speaking to Bloomberg a US-based media agency the MTN Group chief executive officer Mr Rob Shuter said: “It is regrettable that the value has gone down so much.”

The decline in Jumia’s share price according to the African Report has accelerated since the e-commerce platform said in August that sales consultants in Nigeria had been involved in placing improper orders which were then cancelled.

Jumia has traded as high as $49.77 per share but the stock has fallen to about $11 compared with the IPO price of $14.50 which gives the company a market value of about $867m from $1.5b in 2016.

MTN’s interest in Jumia according to Bloomberg is now worth less than $100m.

The move comes at a time when MTN is behind schedule in its bid to generate about $1b in asset sales over the next three years.

The fall Bloomberg reported makes the e-commerce group less viable for MTN to sell a stake in the near term.

This follows a six-month lock in period where the telecom would not sell its shareholding in the e-commerce platform.

“The post IPO lock up period of Jumia in which we have an 18.9 per cent stake has expired and as at 29 October this stake is valued at approximately $94.3m” Mr Ralph Mupita the MTN Group chief financial officer said in a statement earlier.

Assets disposal

According to Mupita MTN has through its Asset Realisation Programme which was announced in March achieved $141m out of the $1b target.

However the telecom said it hopes to attain more money through disposal of its tower assets in Uganda and Ghana.

“We continue to make steady progress in this regard and following American Towers Corporation’s announcement of its acquisition of Eaton Towers we are in advanced discussions to dispose of our 49 per cent holdings in ATC Ghana and ATC Uganda which we value at between $471m and $539m respectively” he said.

The sale is expected to help MTN meet its target of generating a $1b in asset sales over three years.

A statement by ATC highlighting the definitive agreement to acquire Eaton Towers including the assumption of existing debt of approximately $1.85b said the company continues to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Acquisition of the stakes in each of the joint ventures with MTN in Ghana and Uganda ATC said are also subject to the closing of the Eaton Towers transaction.

MTN group performance

According to Mr Shuter: “Service revenue grew by 9.6 per cent while earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) marginally improving by 0.6 per cent to 35.1 per cent.



“We remain committed to driving access to Internet and financial services and in quarter three we added 4.7 million active data users and 2.2 million mobile money subscribers across the portfolio. Our Ayoba messaging platform is now available across five markets and is already recording 515000 active users per month” Mr Shuter revealed.

Various disposal efforts

Botswana’s Mascom for $300m has been scrapped and events at Jumia Technologies AG have made a sell less viable.

Further proceeds could be generated by the redemption of the Nigeria unit’s preference shares which MTN values at $315m according to Mr Mupita.

The MTN group is awaiting a ruling from the central bank of Nigeria on the matter.

A proposed sale of HIS Towers - which is separate to the $1b plan - may be revived as shareholders including MTN prepare for a fresh tilt at an IPO next year people familiar with the matter said this week.

MTN has been exploring asset sales while focusing on key markets such as Nigeria.

For generations profound and painful challenges such as colonialism forced resettlement strong external development pressures and exclusion from natural resource decisions have undermined Indigenous Peoples’ agency and ability to manage their lands and waters.



These externally-imposed power dynamics have disrupted countless communities’ relationships with territory with cultural and spiritual practices and with their ability to self-determine sustainable economies. Not only has this history of disempowerment harmed people—it's harmed the lands and waters they've lived on and all the life these places support.

When the legacy of these challenges is addressed Indigenous Peoples and local communities can lead us to a world where people and nature thrive together—as they have done for millennia.

At 8:00 P.M. after a meal of Nepali dal bhat (lentils and rice) the 10 members of our expedition take refuge against the cold in sleeping bags inside the small tents that make up our temporary camp. Falling asleep is tough because the low oxygen concentration fools our bodies into increasing their heart rates. As a consequence I spend many overnight hours listening to distant sounds of thundering avalanches and cracking ice contemplating whether to leave the sleeping bag to pee outside and what not to forget the next day. As soon as the sun rises the camp is bustling and we are on our way up the steep glacier to install special instruments at 5600 meters.

Our team which includes colleagues from the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development in Nepal has been conducting field expeditions biannually in this place called the Langtang catchment since 2012. We have erected automated weather stations at the base camp and at higher elevations that measure precipitation snow depth radiation temperature relative humidity and wind making Langtang one of the best-monitored high-altitude catchments in Asia. We need to visit the stations every six months to maintain the instruments and to download their data; there is no cellular network to transmit readings automatically and the mountains tend to block satellite signals. On the current ascent we will mount new sensors on a metal frame three meters high that we will drill into the ice. The sensors will measure sublimation—the phase transition of ice directly to water vapor—by sampling temperature and vapor 10 times a second.

These expeditions help us gather the information necessary to understand the high-altitude water cycle: snow falls on mountaintops and gradually turns into glacier ice which slowly flows downhill and melts. The water cascades down into growing rivers that supply numerous high-elevation settlements as well as agricultural terraces hydropower stations forests valley agriculture fields and large cities and industries below. The high-altitude water cycle was largely a mystery when we started. We did not know how much rain and snow actually falls how much water flows into and out of the snowpack or why glaciers blanketed in detritus eroded from surrounding slopes seem to melt as fast as their debris-free counterparts. We need to know these details to determine how much water ultimately flows out of the snowpack and glaciers and how the volume and timing of flow may change in the future.

The Langtang catchment is a small river basin that drains several mountain peaks and glaciers. It feeds the Trishuli River an important water source for recently constructed hydropower dams halfway down the mountains and the irrigated fields farther downstream. The amassing flow leads to the Ganges Delta hundreds of kilometers away which provides water to 400 million people as it empties into the Bay of Bengal east of India. There are hundreds of catchments like Langtang across the Himalayas.

The same dynamics play out across many other mountain ranges such as the Alps the Andes and the Rockies. A study we published in Nature in December 2019 revealed that 78 of these “water towers” from the Tarim in China to La Puna in Peru supply the bulk of fresh water for almost two billion people globally. Computer models show that climate change could threaten these vital water supplies. Changes in temperature precipitation patterns the accumulation and melting of snow and the distribution of airborne particulates all help to determine how much water descends. Yet most plans and policies related to climate change and sustainability ignore the role of mountain water. Now that we have systematically studied the world's top water towers that may begin to change.

Monsoon Dominance

Mountains function like water towers because it rains and snows more at higher elevation than it does in lower surrounding terrain and because much of the precipitation is stored temporarily as snow and glacier ice. This snow and ice melts slowly and steadily providing a reliable predictable supply of water and acting as a natural buffer against dry spells.

The water stored high in Nepal's mountains is crucial for the people who live below because monsoon winds between June and September provide 70 to 80 percent of the Himalayas' annual precipitation. Data from our weather stations in conjunction with weather models reveal how the monsoons interact with the mountains. Even across a small catchment such as Langtang the rains vary strikingly. The valley runs east to west and its elevation rises in that direction. Much of the warm moist air precipitates between the entrance of the valley at around 1350 meters and the village of Lama Hotel at 2480 meters. We have measured around 250 centimeters of annual rainfall at this site the wettest in the valley. The village of Kyanjin at 3900 meters is only another 15 kilometers to the east but there we measure around 80 centimeters of annual rainfall—more than three times as dry yet so nearby.

The position and shape of the mountains create other local effects. If we ascend from Kyanjin to the Yala Glacier at 5300 meters precipitation increases again by 40 percent on average. Together the large medium and valley-scale processes shape the distribution of rain and snow throughout the region. If most precipitation falls as rain at lower altitudes for example the rivers below will flow differently than they would if most precipitation fell as high-altitude snow.

To understand the dynamics of water towers we have extensively investigated the amount of water stored in the snowpack close to Yala Glacier. This amount known as the snow-water equivalent is influenced by how much snow falls how much melts and refreezes how much sublimates and how much is distributed by wind. Our instruments at the 5300-meter base camp measure many of these kinds of variables. The conditions can be severe: extreme cold has caused batteries to explode high winds have twisted sensors and avalanches have knocked over the scaffolding holding our instruments.

It is particularly tricky to measure sublimation a turbulent process that occurs under cold sunny windy and dry conditions which are common during the Himalayan winter. Instruments such as the ones we erected at 5600 meters have quantified sublimation by measuring variations in air humidity and temperature. We find that at windy exposed locations about 21 percent of the snowfall never ends up in a river because it sublimates into the atmosphere. This phenomenon suggests that even at temperatures well below zero degrees Celsius the snowpack can shrink.

We have also found that when the air temperature two meters above the snow is below zero there is enough energy on the snow's surface to melt it. The energy is the net result of the shortwave radiation from the sun the longwave radiation emitted by the surface and the atmosphere and turbulent heat fluxes. There are interesting dynamics inside the snowpack as well. At least 30 percent of the snow that melts into water during the day refreezes at night. Much more energy is required to melt snowpack than what would be expected purely on the basis of its mass.

Another instrument which we install above the snow measures changes in gamma radiation as a proxy for snow-water equivalent. Rock under the snow naturally emits gamma rays and the degree to which their signal is attenuated is related to how much water is actually stored in the snowpack.

Sometimes we hit on unexpected ways to collect information. About eight years ago a colleague working in Tasmania sent drones up over a landslide there and came back with intriguing data about the landslide's volume and velocity. We realized we could use the same approach to obtain data on glaciers covered in debris which are hard to access. Our first outing was in 2013 on the glacier tongue just above Kyanjin.

The drone takes overlapping pictures of the glacier's surface. Software determines the surface elevation to a remarkable resolution of about 10 centimeters. We repeated the surveys every six months or so until 2019. We found that the glacier's edge is receding by about 40 meters a year that the surface is thinning by about 80 centimeters a year and that the dwindling ice hardly flows anymore. It will not be long until the cold mass no longer qualifies as a glacier. Instead it will be a piece of dead ice slowly withering away like a heap of dirty snow plowed to the end of a parking lot. Theoretically a debris-covered glacier should melt much more slowly than a debris-free glacier at the same altitude because the debris acts as insulation. But we identified hotspots of melt that amplified the overall process. We would never have found them with traditional satellite imagery because its resolution is too coarse.

We put all these puzzle pieces into our models to learn how much water will flow in the rivers in the future. One last big piece though is the amount of water flowing in the rivers today. The water height alone cannot indicate the volume of flow. We need a so-called rating curve—a relation between the water level and the river's discharge. And this curve has to represent both high monsoon flows crashing downhill and meager winter runoff. Generating reliable data is a challenge here too. In the rivers we either lodge a pressure transducer housed in a steel pipe at the bottom of the river or mount radar sensors on frames jutting up a few meters above the river's surface. We also throw salt into the river upstream of the gauges and measure changes in electrical conductivity at the gauge site; the extent of salt dilution can help us determine the discharge. Even though the conditions are more hospitable here than at 5300 meters sensors get washed away by monsoon floods. But after years of effort we now have a fairly good idea of water flow.

Avalanches and Floods

For several years we have been integrating findings from various catchments into a model that describes all the processes influencing Himalayan water flow; other scientists are doing the same in other mountain regions worldwide. Climate change presents some conspiring factors. One is elevation-dependent warming in which mountains warm faster than lower-lying plains because of atmospheric feedbacks such as cloud formation increased humidity and higher albedo as snowpacks retreat. Global warming of 1.5 degrees C means 2.1 degrees C of warming in the Himalayas.

Another factor is seasonality. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture which leads to more mountain precipitation. And more of it falls as rain than as snow landing on rocky surfaces that were previously covered by ice quickly running into rivers. According to research published last July most models predict a wetter climate although conditions can vary widely in the region. Compared with glaciers in a steady state melting glaciers will provide more river water in the short term but less in the long term as glaciers retreat uphill and ice thins. We estimate that Langtang will hit peak water supply around 2060; after that the supply will drop steadily.

We will achieve even greater understanding as we erect more sensors making the observational network denser particularly at high altitude and as we integrate the data with extremely detailed models. Satellite remote sensing can also help us better estimate precipitation patterns between sensors across the basin allowing us to fine-tune our models. Other research teams are making similar progress in mountainous terrains. Abundant data sets are available for the Alps for example and for the Andes. Coverage is getting better in the Himalayas as researchers at Kathmandu University and Tribhuvan University shift their attention to higher ground taking measurements across the Annapurna and Everest mountain ranges.

My team has analyzed supply worldwide by using hydrological simulations too. Our Nature study ranks mountain water towers worldwide. We consider a water tower “important” if it is rich in glaciers snow or lakes and if water demand is great from people downstream. Significant water towers include the Colorado the Fraser in western Canada and the Negro in Argentina as well as the European Alps feeding the Rhine and Po Rivers.

Our modeling shows that Asia's ranges which feed major rivers such as the Amu Darya and Indus are the most important in the world. They are also among the most vulnerable: the models project strong rates of warming there as well as rapidly growing populations and economies that will increase water demand tremendously. Average water availability is not likely to decrease until midcentury in part because of greater monsoon rainfall but the longer-term forecast is grim. We predict that 50 to 60 percent of the ice volume will be lost by the end of the century unless the world radically reduces it greenhouse gas emissions.

The big challenge for high-mountain Asia in the short term will be coping with changes in the timing of river flow and with natural hazards. In some basins snow melt may start several weeks earlier than before requiring farmers to change crops or sowing schedules. With snowpack providing less of a buffer swollen rivers will increase across a region that is already facing heavy flooding every year.

Extreme rainfall in the mountains is also causing more landslides particularly during monsoons. Greater melting is filling glacial lakes to the brim causing disastrous floods when rocky ridges that dam the lakes burst because of the immense water pressure behind them. In the past two decades natural disasters such as avalanches landslides and sudden floods have caused thousands of casualties and billions of dollars' worth of economic damage. Future increases in extreme rainfall and warming will exacerbate these hazards. Damages will rise too as growing populations build towns and hydropower dams at increasingly high altitudes.

Although these overall trends are clear each region must be studied in detail to provide people there with useful information. One anomaly is a Central Asian region connecting the eastern Pamir and Karakoram ranges with the western Kunlun Shan. Glaciers there are stable or even gaining mass which we see almost nowhere else on the planet. Data collected within the past year or so reveal that greater farming and irrigation in the nearby Tarim Basin may play a role. Irrigation water withdrawn from groundwater and surface sources evaporates into the atmosphere and transpiration by crops adds even more moisture. This vapor condenses over the mountains and falls as snow—a critical reminder that human actions can alter natural systems.

Mountain Policies

Research on the high-altitude water cycle is already creating awareness of the importance of mountain water to billions of people worldwide. Officials should start acting now to safeguard it.

The first step is to include mountains in broader discussions about preserving Earth's natural resources. Locally leaders can create national parks to protect peaks from development. They can set policies to reduce emissions of pollution and black carbon to lessen airborne debris. And they can build reservoirs to store rainwater and snowpack that melts rapidly in the spring—as long as they analyze how a structure's size and effects on water flow could interfere with ecosystems. An excellent example comes from Langtang Valley. The upper village had no electricity until two years ago when a nongovernmental organization and the community built a hydropower plant that now provides electricity and therefore Internet to villagers.

Neighboring countries can work together to reduce water demand; treaties can cover competing withdrawals from rivers flowing down from high peaks which frequently cross national boundaries. Ministers from eight countries that touch the Hindu Kush Himalayan region set a strong example in October 2020 when they met for a mountain summit and signed a declaration pledging to use science to improve mountain policies listen to advice from the region's highly diverse population and speak as a unified voice in global negotiations. Millions of people in Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan China India Myanmar Nepal and Pakistan depend on the Hindu Kush Himalayas for water and rain patterns and crop yields there are already changing.

The world's high peaks are transforming rapidly. Within the next few decades many people living downstream will have to adapt to more weather extremes greater natural risks and shifts in water supply. Scientists engineers and policymakers should join forces and act now to ensure that sustainable mountain water resources will be available for future generations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbG9yaWRhYmFyLm9yZy90aGUtZmxvcmlkYS1iYXItam91cm5hbC9zdGF0ZS1hc3N1bXB0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1jbGVhbi13YXRlci1hY3Qtc2VjdGlvbi00MDQtcGVybWl0dGluZy1wcm9ncmFtLXBhcnQtaS1hbi1vdmVydmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State Assumption of the Clean Water Act Section 404 Permitting Program: Part I an Overview,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-journal/state-assumption-of-the-clean-water-act-section-404-permitting-program-part-i-an-overview/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbG9yaWRhYmFyLm9yZy90aGUtZmxvcmlkYS1iYXItam91cm5hbC9zdGF0ZS1hc3N1bXB0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1jbGVhbi13YXRlci1hY3Qtc2VjdGlvbi00MDQtcGVybWl0dGluZy1wcm9ncmFtLXBhcnQtaS1hbi1vdmVydmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5kaWVnb3VuaW9udHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL3N5bHZpYS1oYWxsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTcxNjU1MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sylvia Hall Obituary (1954 - 2021) - Escondido CA - San Diego Union-Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sandiegouniontribune/name/sylvia-hall-obituary?id=7165532 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5kaWVnb3VuaW9udHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL3N5bHZpYS1oYWxsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTcxNjU1MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Berkowitz's mugshots / Picture Credit: A& on YouTube

Who is David Berkowitz?

David Berkowitz in an American serial-killer born in Brooklyn in 1953.

He murder six people between 1976 and 1977.

Berkowitz’s crimes led to one of the biggest New York City (NYC) manhunts in the city’s history and caused a mass panic within the area as many citizens feared for their lives.

The oddest part about this case is no doubt the reasoning Berkowitz gave for killing – he claimed he was being ordered to murder by a demon-possessed dog…

Later on in the investigation into his crimes Berkowitz became known as ‘Son of Sam’. This is because Berkowitz stated (after his arrest) that his neighbour Sam Carr was commanding him to kill and communicating these orders through his demon-possessed Labrador Harvey.

Early life and military service

Berkowitz was adopted by a Jewish-American couple Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz when he was just days old.

Berkowitz was very close with his mother and when she passed away when he was a teenager he found it very difficult to deal with.

At 18 years old Berkowitz enlisted in the U.S Army and served in South Korea – he turned out to be quite the skilled marksman.

He finished his military service in 1974 and returned to NYC where he obtained a job with the U.S Postal Service as a letter sorter.

Berkowitz found an apartment in Yokers. However neighbours and co-workers would say that he was a loner and kept himself to himself – hardly surprising since we are talking about a serial killer.

The ‘Son of Sam’ appears

Berkowitz’s rampage began in 1976 when he attacked two teenage girls Jody Valenti and Donna Lauria in the Bronx. He shot at the girls who were sat in Valenti’s parked car – killing Lauria and injuring Valenti.

Not long after his first kill Berkowitz was at it again.

He shot a couple again in a parked car resulting in massive injury to the man’s skull.

Berkowitz also shot at another pair of teenage girls this time while they were on their way home. One girl was unfortunately left paraplegic.

Police had yet to connect these shootings together not realising that they were related.

Another attack occurred in 1977 in which Christine Freund and her fiancé were shot at – Christine was shot in the head twice evidently this proved fatal.

Berkowitz left a clue for the Police seemingly unbeknown to him; he used the same .44 caliber gun in all the shootings. At this time police now seemed to be connecting all the murders and were now facing the idea that they were tackling a serial killer.

Berkowitz struck again when he murdered another young woman this time on her way home from class.

A month or so later Berkowitz attacked another couple Valentina Suriani and her partner Alexander Esau while in their car.

This murder was different however as Berkowitz left a note addressed to NYPD captain Joseph Borrelli – calling himself the Son of Sam for the first time.

He left many letters at the scenes of his murders which led to widespread media coverage. This then instigated a panic among NYC citizens as everyone lived in fear of being Berkowitz’s next victim.

Berkowitz’s last hit occurred in July of 1977 when he shot Stacy Moscowitz and Bobby Violante. Moskowitz was killed and Violante was blinded in one eye and lost most of his vision in the other due to his injuries.

The arrest of Berkowitz

Thankfully during Berkowitz’s last hit there was a witness who saw something pertinent to the investigation.

Berkowitz seemingly unbothered by his arrest / Picture Credit: Real Crime on YouTube

The witness saw a man fleeing from the scene in a car a car with a parking ticket on it. Only a handful of tickets were handed out that day – one of them belonging to Berkowitz.

On the 10th August 1977 Berkowitz was arrested. According to The New York Times Berkowitz said “Well you’ve got me” while being taken into custody.

Sentencing and demon-dog claim

After many psychological evaluations due to his outlandish claim regarding a demon dog telling him to murder Berkowitz was declared ‘competent’ to stand trial.

The year following his arrest in 1978 Berkowitz pled guilty to all six killings and around 1500 fires he had set in and around NYC.

He received 25-years-to-life for each murder.

Berkowitz’s trial got a bit heated as he attempted to jump out of the window of the seventh-floor courtroom after hearing the judge’s ruling.

Since his arrest Berkowitz has retracted his story about a possessed dog telling him to kill as per the order of his neighbour Sam Carr. Berkowitz claimed that this was “all a hoax a silly hoax” in a letter to his psychiatrist Doctor David Abrahamsen.

Harvey the 'demon-dog' / Picture Credit: Real Crime on YouTube

Berkowitz also made declarations that he had been part of a cult that aided him in carrying out the murders and fellow members John and Michael Carr (Sam Carr’s sons) abetted him in this.

During his time in prison Berkowitz has been offered large amounts of money to share his story. Since then however nearly every state (including NYC) passed a law (sometimes known as ‘Son of Sam’ laws) that prevent convicted criminals from profiting financially from books films or other enterprises relating to their crimes.

Berkowitz himself has since turned Christian and prefers to be called Son of Hope rather than Son of Sam as seen in his book Son of Hope: The Prison Journals of David Berkowitz (2006).

This is even featured on a website run by his supporters.

In both the book and on the website Berkowitz provides an apology to the victims and their families. In prison he continues to write journal essays on faith and repentance…

Berkowitz is currently still serving his sentences at the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Wallkill NY.

The 60 year-old Mica Creek Power Station near Mount Isa in north-west Queensland will generate its last electricity this morning.

Mica Creek was first commissioned in 1960. Originally a coal-fired power station it made the switch to gas in 2000. According to the Clean Energy Regulator Mica Creek Power Station had an emissions intensity of 750 grams of CO2 equivalent per megawatt hour of electricity generation in 2017-18 among the highest for gas burners. Even so the switch from coal to gas reduced emissions from the facility 43 per cent.

The 218MW power station isn’t connected to the National Electricity Market (NEM) network and has been supplying electricity to just two industrial customers in recent years – and both of those contracts expired last night.

Mica Creek was in need of a costly overhaul in order to supply energy beyond 2020 and was unable to compete with APA Group’s Diamantina Power Station (410 grams of CO2 equivalent per megawatt hour in in 2017-18) which pinched pretty much all of Mica Creek’s customers.

A decision was made by plant owner Stanwell Corporation in May 2020 to put Mica Creek into “cold storage” effective from today. It was only a couple of months prior to the announcement management seemed confident of its ongoing viability.

This isn’t the first time the power plant has been mothballed. The facility was in cold storage from February 2016 until mid-2017 due to reduced demand but this time around it looks like it will be permanent.

Diamantina CopperString 2.0 And Renewables

It would seem Diamantina Power Station’s future is looking very secure and very profitable having rid itself of a competitor and picking up a couple more major customers in the process – but what about CopperString 2.01?

CopperString 2.0 is a proposed high-voltage transmission line that would connect Mount Isa and the North West Minerals Province (NWMP) to the National Electricity Market supplying lower cost wind and solar power to the region’s mining sector and providing reliable and competitively priced electricity to communities in North West Queensland.

The $1.7 billion project involves a 1100km high-voltage transmission line running from a substation on the Ross to Strathmore transmission line (south of Townsville) to a substation near Cloncurry then on to Mount Isa. The region has no shortage of solar and wind resources and with CopperString in place wind and solar farms incorporating energy storage will likely pop up along its length.

In August proponent CuString Pty Ltd said ACIL Allen modelling found that every $1 invested in CopperString 2.0 will deliver $4.54 in benefits for Australia.

“Global demand can sustain minerals mining and processing in the NWMP and Townsville driven by new economy minerals and essential commodities used in clean energy batteries technology smart phones and defence technology” stated CuString Director Joseph O’Brien. “To be globally competitive the NWMP must have the cheaper and more flexible electricity supply that CopperString can deliver.”

Macquarie Securities analyst Ian Myles suggested (paywall) early last year that CopperString 2.0 would see Diamantina’s role switch from being a baseload power station to providing firming capacity mitigating any loss in energy-only profitability. Some aren’t so sure.

CuString had envisioned a construction commencement date of mid-2021 but that seems a little optimistic given it was only on December 21 the project’s draft environmental impact statement was released for public consultation. If and when construction does commence it’s expected to take approximately three years to complete.

Footnotes The “2.0” refers to the project being the second crack at establishing a transmission line. The first time attempt to get a similar project happening failed in 2011 ↩

They cost nearly 200 times more than the pricy new Apple AirPods Max.

Those who had a tough time justifying the Apple AirPods Max’s $550 price tag should stop reading now because this bedazzled aftermarket treatment of the silicon valley giant’s first over-ear headphones steps into six-figure territory.

Luxury gadget company Caviar has plated the outer earcups and other metal fixtures in pure 18-karat gold then wrapped the overhead headband in “rare black crocodile leather.”

The report suggests that some of the titles affected include Assassin’s Creed Identity and NBA 2K20 with only 74 of the top 1500 games on the Chinese App Store still available.

Alongside the 39000 games Apple removed another 7000 apps from the store bringing the total to 46000 in order to comply with new Chinese laws surrounding licensing.

The company previously asked developers to prove that they had a license for their games by June 30 but this deadline was extended to New Year’s Eve amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apple then froze updates on thousands of games without a license in July and removed 30000 games in August making this December 31 cull the latest in its efforts.

It’s reported that Apple’s decision comes off the back of increasing government pressure to comply with local regulations. Apps available in China must be licensed and be published by a known source – those who have failed to comply have now seen their products removed.

We employed a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser system with a wavelength of 1064 nm and focused on the surface of the titanium target. We observed that the intensities of the negative biasing voltages were higher than those of the positive biasing voltages. We recorded an enhancement in the intensity 2.5 times higher with the -15 kV voltage compared to one without. With an applied electric field of 15 kV the spectral intensity of the titanium plasma recorded a 0.9 times decrease in the intensity with reference to the zero voltage. The electrical characterization of the titanium plasma was also investigated. The results showed a sharp decrease in the electrical signal as the distance between the plates increased from 15 to 60 mm. From the Saha-Boltzmann equation the plasma temperature was calculated at 9152 K with a laser energy of 100 mJ and an applied electric field of -15 kV. The plasma temperatures were enhanced under the negative biasing voltage case compared to the positive biasing voltage case. The electron density of the titanium plasma was also examined and the results predicted increasing electron density with increasing laser energy. At an applied electric field of -15 kV and laser energy of 300 mJ the highest electron density of the titanium plasma was recorded as 1.51 × 1018 cm-3.

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a quantitative analytical technique that employs a high-power laser beam focused on the surface of a target which then ablates the surface of the target. This process is carried out to investigate the elemental composition of the target material. The spectra analysis gives detailed information about the composition of the target sample. This technique and its applications have been used in many scientific fields and industries (1–11) such as material sciences analytical chemistry and plasma physics (12–14). Researchers all over the world working in the field of LIBS have studied the potential of the LIBS technique for the analysis (1516) of different target samples such as liquids (17) solids (18) and gasses (19–23). The LIBS technique has numerous advantages compared to other spectroscopic techniques such as inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) (24–26). These advantages include in situ analysis and little or no sample preparation (2728). The analytical performance of the plasma mostly depends on several plasma parameters such as the laser fluence the pulse repetition rate and the wavelength (29). In LIBS the plasma expansion and the plasma parameters such as electron temperature and density can also be influenced by other experimental conditions such as the nature of the ambient environment laser wavelength the applied laser energy (30–34) the presence of cavity confinement and the applied electric field.

In our previous paper (9) we studied the influence of laser energy on the laser-induced magnesium plasma. The results showed that the laser energy had a huge effect on the electron temperature. We also reported a study (35) on the influence of cavity and magnetic confinements on the signal enhancement of a laser-induced magnesium and titanium plasmas. The study employed both circular and square cavities to investigate the confinement effect on the spectral intensities of the plasmas. The spectra intensities of both the circular and square cavities were more enhanced when compared with the cavity-free case.

Few papers have been reported on the laser-induced plasma under applied electric fields. Robeldo-Martinez and his team (36) investigated on the dipolar field and plasma expansion of a laser-induced breakdown in a uniform direct current (DC) field. They focused an Nd:YAG laser between two parallel plates connected to a DC power supply and investigated the plasma expansion and formation of the LIBS in air by utilizing an electric field measurement and fast photography. Their results predicted that the plasma produces a dipolar electric field that is proportional to the strength of the bias. They reported that the dipole was caused by the redistribution of the charges over the surface of the plasma.

Elhassan and his group (37) also studied the effect of applying static electric field with different polarities on the laser-induced plasma parameters. Their work revealed an enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of both the neutral and ionic lines of the aluminum plasma under forward biasing voltage. They also recorded a decrease in the emission intensities of the plasma in the case of reverse biasing of the voltage.

Alvarez and his coauthors (38) published a report on the spectral and electrical characterization of laser produced plasma. They studied the influence of transverse electric field produced by two parallel capacitor plates on the aluminum target. Their results showed that the electron temperature and density are directly proportional to the applied laser energy. They also recorded that the electric signal as a function of the distance of separation of the plates had a relationship which is approximately the inverse of the square of the distance.

We present an in-depth study on the titanium plasma under static electric field by analyzing the plasma parameters of the titanium plasma. The aims of this study are to investigate the effect of the electric field on the electron temperature and density of the titanium plasma and also to study the electrical characterization of the titanium plasma.

Materials and Methods

The experimental set-up in this work is similar to the report of (3738). Figure 1a shows the experimental setup for the laser-induced plasma. The plasma was produced by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating with a laser pulse of 100 mJ/pulse with a pulse duration of 8 ns at its fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. An energy meter (Nova II Ophir from Laser Measurement Group Ophir Optronics Ltd.) was used to monitor the shot-to-shot laser pulse energy. The pulse laser beam was focused on the titanium target by a plano-convex lens with a focal length of 15 cm. The target was a highly polished titanium plate with 99.9% purity. The target was sandwiched between two polished copper plates at 2 cm apart. These copper plates were used as the electrodes for the application of the voltage. The diameter of the two electrodes was 50 mm with a thickness of 5 mm. The electrode between the focusing lens and the target sample had a hole with a diameter of 5 mm at the center to allow the focus- ing of the laser beam on the target surface. To increase the S/N ratio and the reproducibility of the measurements the collection of the spectra data was done by averaging 15 single accumulations of spectra from 15 different fresh positions on the target surface. The voltage across the electrodes was varied from 0 to 15 kV to study the electric field effect on the plasma. The polarities of the electrodes were also reversed to further study their effect on the plasma. The spectra were collected by a fiber bundle coupled with an echelle spectrometer (Andor Technology Mechelle 5000. Wavelength range of 200–975 nm wavelength accuracy pf ±0.05 nm focal length of 195 mm and high resolution power up to 6000 and with spectral resolution of λ/Δλ=5000) with an inbuilt ICCD camera. The delay generator was also employed to vary the delay time (Stanford Research System model DG645).

The setup in Figure 1b was used to study the electrical characterization of the titanium target. The capacitor plates were connected parallel to the laser beam. One of the plates was connected to the ground through a 5.0 kΩ resister and the other plate was connected to a high voltage source. The voltage source varied from 0 to 15 kV and the distance between the two plates varied between 15 mm to 60 mm with an interval of 5 mm. The titanium sample was sandwiched between the two capacitor plates and was affixed to a translation stage to enable fresh positions for the focusing of the laser beam onto the titanium target. The spectra from the emission were collected by a fiber bundle that was coupled with an echelle spectrometer with an in-built intensified charged coupled device (ICCD) camera (1024 × 1024 pixels iStar from Andor Technology). The ICCD was triggered by a photodiode in order to synchronize the delay time between the laser pulse and the ICCD. The analysis of the data was performed by a computer with Andor software (Andor Solis Andor Technology).

Results and Discussion

Spectral Emission Intensity

To investigate the influence of static electric fields on the titanium plasma we studied the spectral analysis of the laser-induced plasma. The spectral emission of the plasma was recorded under several experimental conditions. Figure 2 shows the emission spectra of the LIBS plasma obtained with a laser energy of 100 mJ at atmospheric pressure in the presence of an applied electric field. The emission spectra revealed the spectral lines of titanium I at 336.2 nm 390.1 nm and 430.1 nm and titanium II at 337.3 368.5 376.0 376.2 439.5 and 450.2 nm. From the emission spectra we observed a strong continuum with an increase in the laser energy. Varying the electric field resulted in an increase of the spectral intensities of the plasma. Furthermore in the early stage of the plasma generation the signal was mostly dominated by the continuum emission because of the collision of the ions and atoms with the electrons.

FIGURE 2: The emission spectra of titanium with an applied electric field of -15 kV in the spectral region of 200−800 nm with a laser energy of 100 mJ.

The Electric Field Effect on the Plasma

Figure 3 depicts a three-dimensional plot of the emission spectra generated by an Nd:YAG laser operating with a laser energy of 100 mJ and a delay time of 15 ns under different applied electric fields by forward and reverse biasing of the electrodes. The figure reflects a wide titanium spectral range from 300 to 500 nm. It also depicts the spectra intensity differences between the negative biasing voltages and the positive biasing voltages. After observing the peak intensities of both the negative and positive biasing cases we found the intensities of the negative biasing voltages were much higher than that of the positive biasing voltages. We also found that the intensities of both the ionic and atomic spectral lines were all influenced by the applied electric fields. We conducted thorough investigations on the obtained spectra and plotted the intensities of the Ti II-376.0 nm against the biasing voltages from -15 to 15 kV as shown in Figure 4. The plot reveals an enhancement in the Ti II-376.0 nm lines in the forward basing case. Comparing the zero voltage intensity with the -15 kV voltage case we observed a 2.5 fold increase in the intensity of the -15 kV voltage. For the 15 kV voltage case we recorded a 0.9 times decrease in the laser intensity with respect to the zero voltage intensity. These decreases in the intensities can be attributed to the decrease in the recombination rate the strong attractive field between the negative front electrode and the positive ions within the plasma. The intensity enhancement of the titanium II-376.0 nm lines via the forward biasing case was a result of the repulsive fields between the positive front electrodes and the positive ions within the plasma.

Electrical Characterization of the Titanium Plasma

The setup in Figure 1b was used to investigate the electrical characterization of the titanium plasma produced in air at atmospheric pressure. The oscilloscope was used to monitor and study the electrical signals generated from the plasma. During the process of plasma formation within the two capacitors an electric pulse was generated that can be measured as a potential difference across the resistor connected to the ground. We further characterize these electrical signals as a function of the laser energy and the distance of separation between the two capacitor plates.

From Figure 5 we observed that as the distance of separation between the two capacitors increased the electrical signals decreased. The highest electrical signal was recorded with a distance of separation between the plates as 15 mm. From these results we found that there was a sharp decrease in the electrical signal as the distance between the plates increased from 15 to 60 mm. Figure 6 depicts the electrical signals as a function of the laser energy. As can be seen from the figure the electrical signals increase with increasing laser energy. At a laser energy of 300 mJ the maximum electrical signal was recorded as 18.2 V. We also observed a linear relationship between the electrical signals and the laser energies. The plotting of the electrical signal against the applied voltage across the capacitor plates is presented in Figure 7. We also observed a linear relationship between the electrical signals and the applied voltages. It can be seen that the electrical signals increase with increasing voltage across the capacitor plates.

Determination of Electron Temperature

Saha-Boltzmann Plot Method

The plasma temperature of the laser-induced titanium plasma with and without applied electric field can be deduced from the Saha-Boltzmann equation used in our previous work (35). From the neutral and the ionic lines for the titanium spectra lines we employ the Saha-Boltzmann plot method to calculate the plasma temperature of the laser-induced plasma. Equations 1 and 2a can be used to express the neutral and the ionic lines respectively (39–42).

Equation 1

Equation 2a

Equation 2b

where E IP is the ionization energy (eV) N 0  N e  and Z 0 (T) represents the particle density electron density and the partition function respectively. c m and A denotes the speed of light mass of the electron and the ionic broadening parameter respectively. T is the plasma temperature and h is the Planck’s constant.

From the Saha-Boltzmann equation plotting the expression at the right-hand side of the equation (E m ) against the expression in the left-hand side of the equation gives a linear fit with a slope which is equal to -1⁄(k B T). Where k B and T are the Boltzmann’s constant and the plasma temperature respectively. Using the spectroscopic parameters of the titanium spectra lines acquired from the NIST database as shown in Table I. The plasma temperature can be deduced from the slope of the Saha-Boltzmann plot as depicted in Figure 8.

FIGURE 8: The Saha-Boltzmann plot using the titanium lines at a laser energy of 100 mJ with an applied electric field of -15 kV.

From the Saha-Boltzmann plot the plasma temperature was calculated to be 9152 K with a laser energy of 100 mJ and an applied electric field of -15 kV. With the same laser parameters the plasma temperature of the titanium plasma with an applied electric field of -5 and -10 kV was found to be 7567 and 8425 K respectively. Also for the positive biasing voltage case with an applied electric field of 5 10 and 15 kV with a laser energy of 100 mJ the plasma temperatures of the titanium plasma were found to be 6725 6192 and 5427 K respectively.

Figure 9 represents a plot of plasma temperature against applied electric field with different laser energies. The plasma temperature of the titanium plasma without electric field was recorded to be 7012 K at a laser energy of 100 mJ. From Figure 9 we can see that the plasma temperature increases with increasing laser energy under both positive and negative biasing voltages. However comparing the positive and negative biasing voltages the plasma temperatures of the negative biasing cases were more enhanced as compared to the positive biasing cases. Comparing the plasma temperatures of the positive biasing cases with the case without electric field it was observed that the plasma temperature decreases in the presence of positive electric fields. At an applied electric field of -15 kV and a laser energy of 200 mJ the plasma temperature was found to be 11274 K. Also for the positive biasing voltage of 15 kV at the same laser energy of 200 mJ the plasma temperature was also calculated to be 7035 K. Figure 9 shows that the plasma temperature drops tremendously from the negative biasing voltage of -15 kV to positive biasing voltage of 15 kV.

FIGURE 9: A plot of plasma temperature against applied electric field with three different laser energies of 100 150 and 200 mJ.

Electron Density

In this section we discuss the effect of the applied electric field on the electron density of the titanium plasma. The electron density can be calculated by using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the spectral lines which can be expressed as:

Equation 3

where N D is the number of particles in the Debye sphere N e is the electron density ω and A are the electron impact width parameter and ionic broadening parameter respectively. Ignoring the contribution of the ionic broadening the expression in equation 3 can be written as (3539):

Equation 4

A plot of the electron density against the laser energy at different applied electric fields under negative biasing of the voltage is depicted in Figure 10a. The graph reveals the general trend of increasing electron density with increasing laser energy. The electron density of the titanium plasma at a laser energy of 100 mJ at an applied electric field of -5 kV was deduced to be 9.61 × 1017 cm-3. At an applied electric field of-15 kV and laser energy of 300 mJ the highest electron density of the titanium plasma was recorded as 1.51 × 1018 cm-3 Figure 10b also represents a plot of electron density against laser energy with an applied electric field under positive biasing voltage. Comparing the electron density of the negative biasing case with the positive biasing case we observed that the electron density increases tremendously under the negative biasing case. The minimum electron density was obtained as 4.66 × 1017 cm-3 under the positive biasing of the voltage at a laser energy of 50 mJ.

Conclusion

In this study we presented the investigation of the effect of applied static electric fields on the plasma parameters of a laser-induced titanium plasma. The study employed an Nd:YAG laser operating at its fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm focused on the surface of the titanium target. Applying static electric fields through forward and reverse biasing of the electrodes. We found that the intensities of the negative biasing voltages were much higher than those of the positive biasing voltages. It was also found that the intensities of both the ionic and atomic spectral lines were all influenced by the applied static electric fields. Comparing the intensity of the case of zero voltage with the -15 kV voltage case we observed a 2.5 fold enhancement in the intensity of the -15 kV voltage. By reversing the polarities of the applied electric field we recorded in the 15 kV voltage case a decrease in the intensity by 0.9 times with reference to the zero voltage. The decrease in the spectral intensities of the titanium plasma was attributed to the decrease in the recombination rate which was as a result of the strong attractive field between the negative front electrode and the positive ions within the plasma. We also studied the electrical characteristics of the plasma and observed that increasing the distance of separation between the two capacitor plates decreases the electrical signals. The highest electrical signal was recorded with a distance of separation between the plates as 15 mm. The plasma temperature was deduced to be 9152 K with a laser energy of 100 mJ with an applied electric field of -15 V. We found that the plasma temperature of the negative biasing cases was more enhanced as compared to the positive biasing cases. The electron density was also found to be 9.61 × 1017 cm-3 with a laser energy of 100 mJ at an applied electric field of -5 kV. Increasing the applied electric field to -15 kV the maximum electron density was obtained as 1.51 × 1018 cm-3 at a laser energy of 300 mJ.

Marshawn Lynch

One of the most accomplished running backs in modern history Seahawks great Marshawn Lynch went public this month with news that he’s considering coming out of retirement for the third time—but only if it’s to play for a Super Bowl contender. He certainly doesn’t need to do it for the money.

According to Business Insider which reported on a radio interview involving the NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport Lynch got in the habit of tucking away every dollar of his on-field salary starting when he was drafted in 2007. He lived off the millions he made from several lucrative endorsement deals and his Beast Mode clothing line and saved the rest.

“Marshawn Lynch has a lot of money” Rapoport said. “He hasn’t spent a dime of his actual playing money… ever.”

That was a few years back but if Lynch stuck to his plan he has nearly $56.77 million in career earnings in the bank today.

Kirk Cousins

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins has some good advice for his colleagues in the NFL. “You don’t know how long you’re going to play” Cousins said in a 2016 interview with the Wall Street Journal. “You’ve got to save every dollar even though you are making a good salary.”

At the time of the interview Cousins drove a 16-year-old GMC Savana van that used to belong to his grandparents.

“It’s better to buy appreciating assets than depreciating” he told the Wall Street Journal. “No yachts no sports cars.”

Not only did he opt against a typical NFL supercar but he also steered clear of the classic celebrity mansion choosing to live in an apartment with a roommate who happened to be an NFL lineman.

Story continues

The duo apparently furnished the place with hand-me-down furniture and miscellaneous repurposed items they were given by teammates including a bunch of fake trees.

Rob Gronkowski

When Rob Gronkowski retired in 2019 he walked away from his long and illustrious career with every penny of the $54 million he earned since being drafted in 2010. The famed Patriots tight end of course came out of retirement to follow his partner in Super Bowl rings Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Bucs—but his frugal financial strategy never changed uniforms.

Aside from being an explosive sure-handed touchdown machine Gronk was famous for living off of his endorsement money and not touching a dollar of his outsized salary.

“I’d just say keep it simple” Gronkowski told Business Insider in 2018. “Keep it easy and I’d say keep it simple. Get what you need to be comfortable save the extra.”

Glover Quin

Former Detroit Lions safety Glover Quin retired in 2019 but his notoriously cheap habits are a legend for the ages.

According to ESPN however “cheap” is a synonym for “smart” in Quin’s eyes.

For years Quin still drove the same Yukon Denali he owned when he was drafted in 2009. It’s all part of his 30/70 plan. In his playing years Quin and his family lived off just 30 percent of his salary. For his first three years in the league that was $6000 a month. The rest he invested in stable publicly-traded blue-chip stocks.

The trick is discipline and refusal to deviate.

“I like to call it tunnel vision” Quin told ESPN. “It’s not good to have tunnel vision on the field because you need to know what’s going on around you but when you’re in life especially in this field you need to have tunnel vision because you see so many guys around you buying cars buying jewelry doing this spending money talking about the money that they spend.”

Jordy Nelson

Like Glover Quin former Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson left the game in 2019. Also like Quin Nelson’s legendary thriftiness still lives on.

While calling into the Dan Le Batard radio show Nelson recounted his childhood growing up on a farm in Kansas. Raised to perform difficult and tedious agricultural labor for his family Nelson credited his upbringing for his NFL work ethic. He also admitted to a history of frugality.

“I am extremely cheap” he told the hosts when they asked about his reputation as a penny pincher.

Nelson told the hosts about a habit he had of staying in his hotel room and eating NFL-provided snacks so he could keep the per diem money he and his teammates receive to dine on the road.

The flabbergasted host said “Wait a minute Nelson you’ve got a $39 million contract that came with like a $12 million bonus. You’re hoarding the per diem so that you can just have the team snack?”

“Yeah” the famously frugal celebrity responded.

Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co's robust brokerage segment continues to drive revenue growth.

Strategic acquisitions bolster the company's service offerings and geographic reach.

Global economic volatility and competitive pressures present ongoing challenges.

Technological advancements and ESG initiatives offer pathways for future growth.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) a leading global insurance brokerage and consulting firm filed its 10-Q on May 1 2024 revealing key financial and operational data. The company's primary revenue streams stem from its brokerage segment with significant contributions from its corporate segment including clean energy investment and other investment income. The United States remains AJG's largest market complemented by substantial operations in Australia Bermuda Canada the Caribbean New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats as presented in the recent SEC filings providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of AJG's market position and potential investment value.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Le calendrier en est actuellement discuté a-t-il dit selon le texte de son discours publié sur les réseaux sociaux.

""Je suis l'ultime garant du processus électoral"" a-t-il dit. ""Je le dis clairement: personne ne prendra le processus en otage mais en retour personne ne doit en être exclu"" a-t-il ajouté.

M. Ndaw a aussi évoqué la progression ""inquiétante"" du Covid-19. ""La cote d'alerte est atteinte"" a-t-il dit en appelant à une ""mobilisation générale"" des autorités religieuses et de la société civile pour le respect des gestes barrières. ""Les diligences appropriées ont été entreprises en vue de l'acquisition des vaccins"" a-t-il dit sans plus de précision.

Bah Ndaw ancien officier sorti de sa retraite par les colonels qui ont renversé le président Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta en août a prêté serment fin septembre à la présidence l'un des organes de la transition mis en place par les militaires.

Ces derniers ont promis de rendre les rênes aux civils après des élections. Après avoir envisagé une période de transition allant jusqu'à trois ans les colonels se sont engagés à le faire au bout de 18 mois. L'emprise qu'ils exercent sur la transition ainsi que l'ampleur de la tâche consistant à organiser de front des élections réformer la Constitution tout en faisant face à la propagation jihadiste ainsi qu'aux multiples maux du pays suscitent cependant des interrogations sur la réalisation de cette promesse dans les temps.

Le Mali est pris dans la tourmente depuis les insurrections indépendantistes et jihadistes parties du nord en 2012. Un accord de paix a été signé avec les indépendantistes. Mais les agissements des groupes jihadistes affiliés à Al-Qaïda ou à l'organisation Etat islamique se sont propagés malgré le déploiement de forces françaises et internationales. Les attaques jihadistes se doublent de violences intercommunautaires. Des milliers de civils et militaires ont été tués depuis 2012.

En dépit des doutes sur les capacités de l'armée malienne Bah Ndaw a assuré que ""l'ennemi perd du terrain"". Il a exprimé la reconnaissance de son pays aux soldats étrangers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0ZXVyYXV0b21vYmlsZS5iZS9hY3R1LWF1dG8vbm91dmVhdXgtbW9kZWxlcy9rb2VuaWdzZWdnLWplc2tvLWFic29sdXQtcHJpbWUtdml0ZXNzZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nouveau modèle / Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut prime à la vitesse,"C’est le constructeur qui l’affirme la Jesko Absolut sera sa création la plus rapide en vitesse de pointe de manière définitive. Elle a été conçue spécialement dans ce but et se différencie de la Jesko « normale » par une recherche de finesse aérodynamique extrême tout en assurant la stabilité nécessaire.

""La Jesko Absolut avec son coefficient de traînée étonnamment bas de 0278 Cd combiné à ses caractéristiques aérodynamiques optimisées pour la stabilité à haute vitesse ses caractéristiques de conduite quotidienne et son espace pour les bagages font de la Jesko Absolut un vaisseau-fusée terrestre déterminé à atteindre une vitesse inouïe en battant des records"" (Christian von Koenigsegg)

Traînée mini vitesse maxi

On l’aura compris la Jesko Absolut bénéficie d’un traitement aérodynamique destiné à optimiser au maximum sa vitesse de pointe en assurant cependant la stabilité de la voiture en toutes circonstances. Les différences avec la Jesko « normale » se situent donc principalement au niveau de la carrosserie puisque la puissance reste à 1600 ch fournis par le V8 biturbo (alimenté en E85) et est transmise aux roues arrières via une boîte robotisée à 9 rapports du système Light Speed Transmission (LST) développé et produit par Koenigsegg qui permet de changer de vitesse en un temps pratiquement nul de n'importe quelle vitesse à n'importe quelle autre quel que soit le nombre de rapports sautés. Toutefois derrière ce joli discours aucune donnée concrète n’est annoncée quant à la vitesse maxi ou les capacités d’accélération.

Comme à son habitude le patron de la marque préfère se fendre de déclarations imagées qui suffisent à faire vibrer les fans de ses créations. Pour détailler les deux dérives « en aileron de requin » qui ornent le capot il évoque les empennages d’un chasseur F-15 tout en précisant qu’ils permettent de nettoyer le flux d’air vers la poupe allongée pour stabiliser la voiture. Toujours dans cette volonté d’optimiser la vitesse maxi les roues arrières voient leurs jantes carénées tandis que la suspension avant est plus compacte et le capot modifié pour favorisé l’écoulement de l’air. Du coup il est possible de ranger le toit targa sous le capot avant.

Générant moins d’appui et nantie d’une suspension assouplie l’Absolut se veut plus confortable et utilisable au quotidien. Ce qui ne l’empêche pas de se montrer la digne héritière de la One : 1 en affichant un rapport poids-puissance de 1kg/ch même avec les pleins deux passagers et leurs bagages. Ce qui reste un exploit unique à ce jour pour un véhicule homologué pour un usage sur la voie publique !",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5vdXZlbGxlcmVwdWJsaXF1ZS5mci9hLWxhLXVuZS9taWNoZWwtc2FyZG91LWlzYWJlbGxlLWF1dGlzc2llci1sYS1wcm9tb3Rpb24tZGUtbGEtbGVnaW9uLWQtaG9ubmV1ci1kZS1jZS0xZXItamFudmllctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michel Sardou Isabelle Autissier Yann-Arthus Bertrand : la promotion de la Légion d'honneur de ce 1er janvier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/a-la-une/michel-sardou-isabelle-autissier-la-promotion-de-la-legion-d-honneur-de-ce-1er-janvier on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5vdXZlbGxlcmVwdWJsaXF1ZS5mci9hLWxhLXVuZS9taWNoZWwtc2FyZG91LWlzYWJlbGxlLWF1dGlzc2llci1sYS1wcm9tb3Rpb24tZGUtbGEtbGVnaW9uLWQtaG9ubmV1ci1kZS1jZS0xZXItamFudmllctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHA6Ly9mcmVuY2gueGluaHVhbmV0LmNvbS8yMDIxLTAxLzAyL2NfMTM5NjM2NTU3Lmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Le ministre chinois des Affaires étrangères présente les priorités de la diplomatie chinoise pour 2021_French.news.cn,"

(Xinhua/Liu Bin)

BEIJING 2 janvier (Xinhua) -- Le conseiller d'Etat chinois et ministre des Affaires étrangères de la Chine Wang Yi a présenté le thème central de la diplomatie chinoise en 2021 lors d'un récent entretien avec l'Agence de presse Xinhua (Chine nouvelle) et le China Media Group à Beijing.

Wang ajoutant que la partie chinoise s'efforcerait de créer un environnement extérieur favorable pour promouvoir un nouveau paradigme de développement et mettre en œuvre le 14e Plan quinquennal dans le pays.

La Chine continuera à construire un nouveau type de relations internationales. ""Guidés par l'engagement personnel du président Xi dans la diplomatie nous œuvrerons pour des progrès constants dans les relations de la Chine avec les principales puissances cimenterons la solidarité et l'amitié avec les voisins et les autres pays en développement et approfondirons davantage la coopération internationale et régionale"" a-t-il déclaré.

La Chine renforcera encore son ouverture et sa coopération. M. Wang a déclaré que la Chine ferait progresser la coopération de haute qualité de ""la Ceinture et la Route"" tirerait parti de l'énorme marché de la Chine et de son potentiel de demande intérieure stimulerait la reprise mondiale avec sa propre croissance et partagerait avec le monde entier les ""dividendes du développement"" de la Chine.

""Nous nous engagerons de manière proactive dans la réforme de la gouvernance mondiale"" a déclaré M. Wang. Notant que l'année 2021 marque le 50e anniversaire de la restauration du siège légitime de la Chine à l'Organisation des Nations unies (ONU) et le 20e anniversaire de son adhésion à l'Organisation mondiale du commerce le ministre des Affaires étrangères a déclaré que la Chine continuerait à pratiquer le multilatéralisme organiserait avec succès une conférence des Nations unies sur la biodiversité relèverait les défis mondiaux en partenariat avec les autres et promouvrait un système de gouvernance mondiale plus équitable et plus sain.

Il a déclaré que la partie chinoise faciliterait activement la compréhension mutuelle entre les pays communiquerait mieux avec le monde le solide passé du PCC en matière de gouvernance le voyage extraordinaire du peuple chinois vers le rêve chinois et l'engagement de la Chine dans le développement pacifique et appellerait tous les pays à surmonter les différences à rechercher un développement commun et à accepter les échanges l'apprentissage mutuel et l'harmonie entre les civilisations.

""Nous continuerons à travailler en faveur d'une communauté de destin pour l'humanité. Dans ce contexte nous chercherons à créer une communauté mondiale de la santé pour tous et une communauté d'avenir partagé dans la région d'Asie-Pacifique"" a-t-il déclaré ajoutant que la Chine défendrait les valeurs partagées de l'humanité à savoir la paix le développement l'équité la justice la démocratie et la liberté et travaillerait avec tous les pays pour construire un monde ouvert inclusif propre et beau de paix durable de sécurité universelle et de prospérité commune."

An Israeli official also confirmed the negotiations had stalled and described them as being in “crisis.”

For months the negotiations aimed at achieving a cease-fire and a release of hostages have made little progress but signs the two sides were coming closer to an agreement appeared over the last week. Israel backed off some of its long-held demands and a top Hamas official said the group was studying the latest Israeli offer with a “positive spirit.”

But the setback over the weekend meant Palestinians living in miserable conditions in Gaza would not experience an imminent reprieve and the families of hostages held by militants would have to wait longer for the freedom of their loved ones.

The main obstacle in the talks was the duration of a cease-fire with Hamas demanding it be permanent and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel expressing openness to only a temporary halt in the fighting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWJhYnktY2FyZGlhYy1hcnJlc3QtMTkwNjAzNTU0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman arrested after baby has cardiac arrest at Legoland,"The boy was taken to hospital in a serious condition [BBC]

A woman from Essex has been arrested after a five-month-old baby suffered a cardiac arrest at a theme park.

The infant needed medical attention at Legoland Windsor Resort at about 13:00 BST on Thursday.

He was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition Thames Valley Police said.

A 27-year-old woman from Witham was arrested on suspicion of neglecting a child to cause unnecessary injury on Saturday. She has been released on police bail until 26 July.

Det Con Zoe Eele of the child abuse investigation unit said: “We are investigating a distressing incident involving a very young child at Legoland Windsor earlier this week.

“Firstly our thoughts are with the family of the boy who is in a critical condition in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest. We are supporting them as best we can at this extremely difficult time.

“We are working closely with the team at Legoland Windsor Resort but would like to speak to anyone who may have information about this incident specifically anyone who was queueing for the Coastguard HQ boat ride between around 11.30am and 12:45pm.”

She added that an arrest had been made and the force were “not looking for anyone else as a suspect”.

“I would ask for the public to please avoid speculation about the incident and to respect the boy’s family at this deeply upsetting time” she added.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: New data released today shows that California continues to have the largest market share of tourism in the nation with travel spending in the state reaching an all-time record high of $150.4 billion last year.

SAN FRANCISCO – Governor Gavin Newsom and Visit California CEO Caroline Beteta today announced that travel spending in the state reached an all-time high of $150.4 billion last year surpassing the record $144.9 billion spent in 2019. This comes after the state retained its title as the world’s 5th largest economy and had a population increase both of which are directly tied to California’s nation-leading tourism and entertainment industries.

VIDEO: Gov. Newsom makes announcement at the top of the Golden Gate Bridge

WHAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID: “From our world-renowned coastline to the world’s tallest trees to our iconic cities and theme parks California is the nation’s coming attraction. Visitors from all over the world are coming here to experience the wonder of the Golden State boosting our economy and creating good-paying jobs for years to come.”

BY THE NUMBERS: The Economic Impact of Travel in California prepared by Dean Runyan Associates and released by Visit California detailed spending that is 3.8% higher than 2019 and 5.6% higher than 2022. Spending exceeded 2019 levels in a majority of counties.

WHAT VISIT CALIFORNIA CEO BETETA SAID: “California tourism is back where it belongs – setting records and providing for the workers business owners and all Californians who depend on the travel industry as a cornerstone of our state’s economy. The industry has once again proved its ability to recover from any challenge whether it be economic or environmental. California continues to be the largest most diverse and most resilient tourism economy in the United States.”

WHAT THIS MEANS: California has the largest market share of tourism in the nation. The new travel-spending record generated $12.7 billion in state and local tax revenue by visitors in 2023 marking a 3% increase over 2019. Tourism created 64900 new jobs in 2023 bringing total industry employment to 1155000.

California remains the 5th largest economy in the world for the seventh consecutive year with a nominal GDP of nearly $3.9 trillion in 2023 and a growth rate of 6.1% since the year prior according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. California’s per capita GDP is the second largest among large economies.

In addition to visiting the state more people are moving to California. Earlier this week Governor Newsom announced the state’s population is increasing for the first time since the pandemic.

The Golden State which has the most equitable tax system in the entire country is #1 in the nation for new business starts #1 for access to venture capital funding and the #1 state for tourism spending manufacturing high-tech and agriculture.

Massive floods in Brazil’s southern Rio Grande do Sul state have killed at least 75 people over the last seven days and another 103 were reported missing local authorities have said.

Damage from the rains also forced more than 88000 people from their homes state civil defence authorities said on Sunday. Approximately 16000 took refuge in schools gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.

The floods left a wake of devastation including landslides washed-out roads and collapsed bridges across the state. Operators reported electricity and communications cuts. More than 800000 people are without a water supply according to the civil defence which cited figures from water company Corsan.

“I repeat and insist: the devastation to which we are being subjected is unprecedented” state Governor Eduardo Leite said on Sunday morning. He had previously said that the state will need a “kind of ‘Marshall Plan’ to be rebuilt”.

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday accompanied by Defence Minister Jose Mucio Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva among others. The leader and his team surveyed the flooded streets of the state capital Porto Alegre from a helicopter.

“We need to stop running behind disasters. We need to see in advance what calamities might happen and we need to work” President Lula told journalists afterwards.

The Guaiba River reached a record level of 5.33m (17.5 feet) on Sunday morning surpassing levels seen during a historic 1941 deluge when the river reached 4.76m (15.6 feet).

During Sunday mass at the Vatican Pope Francis said he was praying for the state’s population. “May the Lord welcome the dead and comfort their families and those who had to abandon their homes” he said.

The downpour started on Monday and was expected to last through Sunday. In some areas such as valleys mountain slopes and cities more than 300mm (11.8 inches) of rain fell in less than a week according to Brazil’s National Institute of Meteorology known by the Portuguese acronym INMET on Thursday.

The heavy rains were the fourth such environmental disaster in the state in a year following floods in July September and November 2023 that killed 75 people.

Weather across South America is affected by the climate phenomenon El Nino a periodic naturally occurring event that warms surface waters in the Equatorial Pacific region. In Brazil El Nino has historically caused droughts in the north and intense rainfall in the south.

This year the impacts of El Nino have been particularly dramatic with a historic drought in the Amazon. Scientists say extreme weather is happening more frequently due to human-caused climate change.

“These tragedies will continue to happen increasingly worse and more frequent” said Suely Araujo a public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory a network of dozens of environmental and social groups.

Brazil needs to adjust to the effects of climate change she said in a Friday statement referring to a process known as adaptation."

All the fake-woke corporations and companies are launching their campaigns to uplift Black people one month out of the year. At The Frontline we center Black leadership and voices all year long; we don’t need Black History Month to do that. That being said we’ll never turn down an opportunity to celebrate everything Black.

Welcome to The Frontline where we’re kicking off Black History Month with some facts. I’m Yessenia Funes climate editor of Atmos. Let’s start off this month by laying out what’s what. The reality is that Black people in the U.S. and around the world care tremendously about our ecological crises despite white environmentalist stereotypes.

In the U.S. Black people have been at the forefront of environmental advocacy. Their work around civil rights and pollution wasn’t always viewed as environmental stewardship but it was.

These days we have Black voters in Georgia to thank for a Democratic-controlled Senate that finally offers the U.S. a fighting chance at passing comprehensive climate legislation. If we step out for a bird’s eye view Black people’s diets and energy habits on average contribute less greenhouse gases and air pollution than white people in the U.S. Meanwhile they’re disproportionately at risk from both of these dangers.

Ain’t that some shit?

A poll released in March 2020 by the Environmental Defense Fund found that a majority of Black Americans are already feeling the impacts of climate change. I’m talking about severe heat and extreme weather. And 57 percent believe the situation is worsening. On the bright side 77 percent of the Black people surveyed support a clean energy transition. This is a contingent of people who don’t have the luxury to deny climate science. They see the realities in person.

We’re finally witnessing a union between racial justice and traditional environmental groups—and an understanding that there’s some serious value in learning from Black communities. Yes they are on course to face some of the gravest harms from climate change. (Remember Hurricane Katrina?) Beyond that expected devastation however is essential knowledge and an awareness of what Black communities will need to weather the next storm. There are countless leaders who are paving the way for Black leadership in the climate space and creating space for even more leaders to come up.

I’m thinking of Mustafa Santiago Ali. Or Tamara Toles O’Laughlin. How about the Green New Deal champion Rhiana Gunn-Wright? And newly elected Rep. Cori Bush. There are more: Sean Watkins a climate solutions storyteller; climate writer Mary Annaïse Heglar; Brentin Mock whose writing inspired me to jump on this beat; or Grist’s Andrew Simon whose mentorship helped make my career possible.

So many Black creatives writers scientists thought leaders and advocates are making a carbon-free future possible through their everyday work. And let me tell you: It’s not easy working in the climate space. It’s even harder to face a reality that’s willing to sacrifice you and your peoples along the way.

This month I’ll be making some space for people I admire in this realm inviting Black writers and readers to take over The Frontline for a day. Be sure to keep your eye out. I’ll still be covering daily news and events but every week—starting next week—will include original writing from someone.

Happy Black History Month.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the field’s official 1958 emergence engineers have helped humans travel — commercially militarily and exploratively. Aerospace industry advancements have improved how quickly safely and efficiently this has been made possible. They have also paved the way for numerous endeavors not previously imaginable.

Only three years would elapse before we turned our attention to the stars. Accordingly manned spaceflight kicked off in 1961 with Yuri Gagarin’s interstellar ascent. Space was the final frontier — a medium through which countries could display their technical prowess — and global powers poured billions into the space race. That reinvigorated space exploration has taken a different form today.

Looking at Modern Aerospace Pursuits

The world’s current concept of space travel wouldn’t exist without advancements in aerospace engineering. Spaceflights while largely safe are still relatively risky for a variety of reasons. Crew members rely on radiation shielding heat shielding continuous oxygen flow and other exterior-interior structural elements. There are human lives aboard — as with any aerial flight — meaning shuttle designs must be robust. These developments require a few things:

Ample amounts of strong expensive materials

Multiple prototypes and viability tests

An immense amount of intellectual and financial resources

Space missions have extended beyond simple proofs of concept. Oftentimes it is expected that astronauts remain in orbit longer making their duties even more complex. Aerospace engineers have shifted their gaze increasingly inward towards the cabin. Crew members now require more livable spaces with noise isolation comfort lighting and mental health coming to the forefront. These needs are compounded as crews push deeper into the galactic unknown.

In the early days of space travel governments were expected to provide these essentials. Private companies are leading today’s rejuvenated efforts. SpaceX and its engineering team have redefined traditional spaceflight from accessibility to execution.

United States-based company SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002 as a privately-funded venture with the goal to further commercialize space flight. A central goal in that mission is making spaceflight more affordable something which has never been done before.

The engineering team at SpaceX has since implemented cost-saving measures to make this possible. Its Merlin engine was cheaper to design and assemble than those of competitors. Furthermore reusability became a central tenet of SpaceX’s strategy. This eliminated the need to construct expensive new launch vehicles. SpaceX became the first private company to achieve spaceflight in 2008. It also launched a nine-engine craft (Falcon 9) into orbit in 2010 after earning over $1 billion in the NASA funding and federal contracts.

SpaceX’s Dragon space capsule blasted into orbit before making its terrestrial return. Dragon became the first commercial craft to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) just two years later. Naturally this meant that Dragon was built stoutly enough to handle the physical rigors of repeated space travel without disintegrating. Recent Dragon missions and those involving other rockets have completed successfully proving that modern aerospace engineering has reached a new pinnacle.

SpaceX is now focusing efforts on commercial space travel with a plan to make rapid travel between Earth and settlements on Mars possible by the mid-2020s. Engineers must devise a new class of crafts capable of transporting humans skyward time after time. Note that these vessels will be subject to similar stressors upon launch and reentry. Teams will once again innovate in the areas of strength efficiency and speed to realize these goals.

Novel Approaches to CAD CAE and CAM

The need for creative thinking in the aerospace field is of utmost importance. However no job is done without the proper tools — tools that make sound design possible while respecting the variables unique to spaceflight. With programs such as Autodesk’s Integrated CAD CAM and CAE software Fusion 360 engineers now have the ability to create dynamic projects on a single platform and streamline their development process making projects — like the ones being done at SpaceX — possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vcGFyYW1ldHJpYy1hcmNoaXRlY3R1cmUuY29tL2FndWFob2phLXByb2dyYW1tYWJsZS1iaW9jb21wb3NpdGVzLWRpZ2l0YWxseS1mYWJyaWNhdGVkLWJ5LW5lcmktb3htYW4tYW5kLW1pdC1tZWRpYS1sYWIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aguahoja: Biocomposites Digitally Fabricated by Neri Oxman and MIT,"A secondary skin developed and programmed by Neri Oxman and MIT using water-based biocomposites for digital design and fabrication. The Aguahoja project has exhibited a pavilion and a series of artefacts erected from molecular components found in tree branches insect exoskeletons and our own bones. They use natural ecosystems inspired for a material production process that produces no waste.

The Design Approach

The design approach facilitates close integration between material creation and robotic fabrication. The project consents creation of objects across varying scales. Besides it examines the importance of water in Nature’s systems the birth cycle adaptation and decay. This allows the re-use of materials in the whole composition. Incorporating inspiration of growth forests and coral reefs waste virtuals non-exists The design team compared to the waste production rates of current building industries where objects expire and materials extracted from the earth. Indeed their creation can faster be replenished.

Aguahoja uses biocomposites composed of the widely used materials on our planet: cellulose chitosan pectin and many more. They digitally fabricate particularly to weave materials with specific properties adapting in response to heat and humidity. In death the materials dissociate in water thus eliminating production waste and fuelling life.

The Aguahoja Pavilion

The Aguahoja Pavilion continues its research on the application of environment-responsive biocomposites leading to the first architectural-scale iteration. Vertically upright in five meters the structure’s skin indeed composes flexible biocomposite with functionally graded mechanical chemical and optical properties. Cellulose and chitosan allow for creating a generative surface pattern to additionally alter panels’ stiffness and colour by robotic deposition. Moreover when exposed to rain the skin degrades programmatically. This restores its constituent building blocks to their natural ecosystem. This cycle continues naturally in synthesis.

Minute alterations to the molecular composition of biocomposites induce dramatic impact on their appearance and behaviour. The Aguahoja Artifacts subsequently represent years of exploration into parameterizing material chemistry. Especially developing a library of functional biocomposites. The pieces in the collection appear diverse in presence yet all compose the same components; chitosan cellulose pectin and water.

The Aguahoja Artifacts

The Aguahoja Artifacts forms an array and behaviours exhibited by these pieces. They reflect their manner of expression in Nature. Furthermore a material such as chitin can compose both the exoskeletons of crustaceans and fungi’ cell walls. In contrast to steel and concrete the composites indulge in constant dialogue with their environment. Some artefacts exude dramatic changes conforming in response to humidity and heat. Others darken or lighten as the season’s transform. Some seem brittle and transparent with glassy texture while others remain flexible and tough like leather. Despite the emergent diversity these artefacts share a standard quality mediated by humidity. As in death they dissociate in water and return to the ecosystem.

“Derived from organic matter printed by a robot and shaped by water this work points toward a future where the grown and the made unite.”

It can be tough to narrow down which one works best for you — especially since they all offer different features.

Gmail has been the go-to for many thanks to an easy-to-navigate interface and simple chat feature. But while Gmail may be one of the top email choices Google is notorious for collecting tons of user data. This massive tech company tracks almost everything users do search for or use.

The automatic data gathering that occurs in Gmail is going to change shortly though. Google is rolling out new smart features that will change the way you look at this email service. If you’re concerned about the data collection that comes with using Gmail you’re going to want to know about these changes.

Smart features coming to Gmail

Google announced on its blog recently some new changes to Gmail. These changes will give Gmail users more control over the data gathering done by apps like Gmail Chat and Meet.

Gmail users will be able to opt out of having their data used by the smart features in Gmail and Gmail-associated apps. This includes automatic email filtering and categorization Smart Compose summary cards and automatic calendar entries.

These smart features which can give you directions in Google Maps to your restaurant reservations or summaries of your emails are admittedly handy for users. Who doesn’t want to get automatic directions to where you’re having lunch with a colleague?

But while these features are useful they also gather a ton of data and hand it over to Google which is less than ideal. There have been concerns for years about the volume of data Google is gathering on users and most people want to limit that whenever possible.

Gmail users have always had the option to toggle these features on or off but the new update will also disable the background data processing that makes them possible. This gives Gmail users the option to fully and completely opt out of smart feature data processing while using Gmail and Gmail-associated apps.

There’s a downside though. While this will stop your data from being used by Google users who opt out of the data processing for smart features won’t be able to use any of the smart features offered in Gmail or the other apps.

You will have the option to limit data gathering by Gmail Chat and Meet that powers other Google products too. This includes data that powers the Assistant which displays bill due date reminders and other important information along with Google Maps and GPay’s loyalty cards and tickets.

According to Google the settings changes were “designed to reduce the work of understanding and managing that process in view of what we’ve learned from user experience research and regulators’ emphasis on comprehensible actionable user choices over data.” In other words they’re meant to give you more control over whether your data is gathered and used by Google.

When will these new changes roll out?

According to Google these changes aren’t active for all Gmail users just yet but will be in the “coming weeks.”

If you opt out of any of these features you can always enable them again in Gmail’s settings. However you won’t be able to enable or disable any of the features individually.

You won’t be able to toggle it on for Smart Compose but turn off the data processing for summary cards or calendar entries for example. It’s all or nothing because these features are all powered by the same data.

Hopefully these privacy changes will actually work. Google has been known to collect data on users even when it’s not supposed to.

We’ll be using a few key Python libraries here namely os  sqlite3 and pywin32 .

To start off we’ll first need to decide what we want to extract from our emails. For example let’s say we have a bunch of emails that each contain a list of news articles like this:

Let’s then say that we want to extract the header of each bullet point which includes the title the publication media platforms and URL links. In short we want to take the entire header of each bullet point then break it down into four different parts.

Sample header that we want to extract text from

Our pseudocode so far should look something like this:

1. Create list of emails that we want to parse

2. Open first email

3. Iterate over each bullet point

4. Extract data from bullet point

5. Upload data from bullet point to a database

6. Repeat until all data is parsed then move to next email

Creating a SQL Database

Before parsing our emails we’ll first want to set up a SQL database with Python. We’ll do this by establishing a connection to the SQLite database with a connection object that we’ll call db .

# Create & connect to database

db = sqlite3.connect(""emails.db"")

If it doesn’t already exist a new database will be created as emails.db . We can then create tables in our database that our email parser can write to later on.

# Create empty tables

db.execute(""""""

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ""articles"" (

""id"" INTEGER

""title"" TEXT UNIQUE

""publication"" TEXT

PRIMARY KEY(""id"" AUTOINCREMENT)

);

"""""")



db.execute(""""""

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ""links"" (

""article_id"" INTEGER

""link0"" TEXT

""link1"" TEXT

""link2"" TEXT

PRIMARY KEY(""article_id"")

);

"""""")



db.execute(""""""

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ""platforms"" (

""article_id"" INTEGER

""platform0"" TEXT

""platform1"" TEXT

""platform2"" TEXT

PRIMARY KEY(""article_id"")

);

"""""")

In essence we’re creating three tables where our main table is ‘articles’ which has a one-to-many relationship with ‘platforms’ and ‘links’. In other words this reflects how one article can have many different platforms and links.

Our database schema

Accessing your Emails in Python

You’ll want to move the emails that you want to parse from Outlook to a folder. The simplest method to do this is by dragging and dropping.

Demonstration of the drag-and-drop method

Next create a variable storing the folder path of your emails. You can do this manually e.g. folder_path = r‘C:\Users\Username\EmailFolder’ or with tkinter and os  which will generate a file explorer prompt to select a folder.

# Create an folder input dialog with tkinter

folder_path = os.path.normpath(askdirectory(title='Select Folder'))

Obtaining our folder path with tkinter

Here we’re using a file input prompt created with tkinter to save our folder path then normalizing the path with os to remove any redundant separators.

We’ll then want to obtain the path headings of each email. We can do this with os.listdir()  which gives a list of all files in the specified directory.

# Initialise & populate list of emails

email_list =

[file for file in os.listdir(folder_path) if file.endswith("".msg"")]

This will save the file name of each email in list that we can access later.

Connecting Outlook to Python

Next you’ll want to create an object that will allow us to control Outlook from Python. This is enabled through the pywin32 library that helps to connect Python to Outlook via the Microsoft Outlook Messaging API (MAPI).

outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch(""Outlook.Application"")

.GetNamespace(""MAPI"")

With this we can begin to open each item as a HTML object and use regular expressions i.e. Regex to extract the body text of each email.

While conventional wisdom dictates that you shouldn’t use Regex to parse HTML we’re not worried about this here as we’re only looking to extract very specific text snippets out of a standard email format (Some commercial email parsers like Parseur are heavily built around Regex).

From this point Regex can be used to narrow down the specific data that you want to extract.

# Iterate through every email

for i _ in enumerate(email_list):



# Create variable storing info from current email being parsed

msg = outlook.OpenSharedItem(os.path.join(folder_path

email_list[i]))



# Search email HTML for body text

regex = re.search(r""<body([\s\S]*)</body>"" msg.HTMLBody)

body = regex.group()

Parsing Email HTML with Python

This is how the first bullet point of our email might look as HTML:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9idWlsZGluZy1kYXRhLXBpcGVsaW5lcy11c2luZy1yLWQ5ODgzY2JjMTVjNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building Data Pipelines using R.

The Academy Award-winning actress-turned-media mogul and her husband Jim Toth quietly bent and snapped their way into the bucolic estate which happens to be one of the most private properties on L.A.’s Westside.

That’s not an exaggeration. The house is tucked securely away in nature lying deep within one of Brentwood’s best-known canyons on a private road and behind a massive driveway gate that effectively shields the entire three-acre property from prying eyes. Behind the gate a winding driveway leads down to a formal circular motorcourt beside the English Country-style mansion with its three-car attached garage.

More from Variety

Built in 1993 the house is of “massive scale” per the listing and packs seven ensuite bedrooms into more than 9500 square feet of rambling living space. Behind the stone-clad façade lies an enormous foyer with dark brown hardwood floors dark brown ceiling beams and an elegant staircase that soars up to a spacious landing. Public rooms include a fireplace-equipped living room a wood-paneled library formal dining room and a more intimate breakfast room off the kitchen where the marble countertops and abundant stainless appliances — four huge ovens no less — are guaranteed to impress any chef.

The upstairs master bedroom is best described as cavernous with its vaulted ceiling nearly touching the heavens and a private sitting area that’s bigger than some living rooms. There are dual master baths at least one of them with a built-in soaking tub and an oversized closet with built-in shelving. Elsewhere on the upper level are four additional family bedrooms plus two staff suites downstairs for the live-in help. Running an estate of this size with a massive main house and acres of manicured grounds requires the help of a well-oiled staff machine of course.

Speaking of the grounds most of the main floor rooms have banks of French doors that open to various parts of the gardens. The verdant and abundantly private yard is best described as park-like or heavenly. Squint your eyes and the sprawling lawns and dozens of mature trees all appear to be touched by an angel plus there’s a full-size saltwater swimming pool with spa and an outdoor kitchen services the al fresco dining patios some of them warmed by a large outdoor fireplace.

It isn’t a surprise that Witherspoon would be in the market for a new home though she has yet to move into this particular property. Over the last year the “Legally Blonde” star has been on a selling spree of sorts dumping her $17 million Pacific Palisades mansion to AutoZone heiress Robin Formanek and offloading her charming Malibu ranch for $6.7 million to real estate heiress Meg Haney. For now though she’s still holding onto an elegant part-time home in Nashville back in her native Tennessee.

Drew Fenton of Hilton & Hyland and Dena Luciano of Douglas Elliman jointly held the listing; Tami Pardee and Matt Freeman of Halton Pardee and Partners repped Witherspoon.

Autozone co-owner Jon Gardiner said officers ‘stormed’ the premises on Doncaster Road at around 6.45pm on Saturday December 19.

They proceeded to take down details of the people there warning they would issue each a £200 fine he told the Chronicle.

The garage had closed at 6pm as normal for a Saturday - but staff had stayed for an hour to swap presents and have a bite to eat with two musicians asked to play festive tunes on acoustic guitars.

Jon 41 said: “There were police officers storming through the front door with no reason.

“They could’ve walked in calmly.

“They could’ve done it with a phone call.

“But they’ve harassed me and my staff and a couple of customers who were still in the shop - it’s not uncommon for us to stay anyway if we have customers to help.

“We’ve had a lot of mental health and wellbeing issues within the staff due to furloughing and letting people go.

“So we decided to have a bit of food get a couple of guys playing Christmas songs on acoustic guitars - trying not to overstep the mark but put a bit of something together for that wellbeing and moral support. Were we in the wrong?

“I was busy dealing with the police but my staff were shocked.

“I felt victimised.”

Jon said when he stood up to the officer he was issued with ‘ridiculous’ requests that he knew he couldn’t fulfil - such as showing police his payroll to ensure all the people in the building were staff.

He added the firm employed 45 staff around half of which were present on the evening.

“I think the police made their mind up before they came through the door what they were going to do” he said.

“They saw what they wanted to see which was a Christmas party.

“They’ve wasted a lot of resources for nothing.

“The officer leading them read the riot act to me and yet issued no paperwork. He should’ve listened to my explanation apologised and left but was too emotionally-driven to walk away.”

Customer Lewis Tawton from Wakefield said he had been in the shop and then gone outside before returning to find police who said they would be fining him for ‘attending an illegal gathering’.

“I was shocked” said the 28-year-old. “Police were here there and everywhere and I didn’t really have a clue what was going on.

“They took my name and address and said I would be fined but I’ve not had anything come through.

“I felt a bit like a prisoner - I couldn’t leave until they said I could.”

Jon said the business has struggled to survive this year with sales down by 70 per cent.

“For anyone in retail with big overheads like us Covid has been catastrophic” he added.

“We’ve had a hard year like everyone. This has been the first time we’ve properly opened we’ve put every precaution in place with stickers directional signs and signs on the front of the building - and then this happens.”

Jon said he would ‘wholeheartedly’ defend his staff if they faced any further allegations that they were breaking guidelines.

A police spokesperson said fixed penalty notices were issued to 30 people with body-cam footage reviewed after the event.

“There was food alcohol and a band playing” they added. “This was clearly a pre-organised event and was a deliberate and blatant breach of Covid regulations.

“The company directors have also been reported for encouraging an offence.”",,,,,,

City Council OK’d the $93926 purchase of two 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles at its last meeting in December.

“The Mach-E is an all-electric small crossover vehicle that is new on the market” Matt Kulhanek the city’s fleet manager told council in a memo noting the city is purchasing all-wheel-drive models for winter weather conditions.

The vehicles which are expected to arrive later in 2021 could go about 210 miles per charge Kulhanek said.

“As a fully electric vehicle this purchase is consistent with many of the city’s established sustainability efforts including the Green Fleets Policy and the A2Zero Plan” Kulhanek wrote.

The city has been gradually shifting toward all-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as part of its goal of achieving communitywide carbon-neutrality by 2030.

The city’s sustainability office is putting $30549 toward the initial EV purchases though the police department will be responsible for the increased fleet replacement costs each year Kulhanek said noting fuel savings will offset some of the expense.

“These vehicles will also require Level 2 chargers at an estimated cost of $5000” he told council adding that would be funded separately.

The city’s sustainability office has a goal of adding 100 new EV chargers throughout the community in 2021 including four rapid-chargers planned outside city hall and the police station on Ann Street.

Ann Arbor gets $170K from state DTE to install rapid EV chargers downtown

The new electric Mustangs are replacing two police vehicles reaching their contractual limit Kulhanek said.

The city’s labor contracts with the Ann Arbor Police Officers Association and the Ann Arbor Police Supervisors require the city to replace vehicles used by the police union members every six years or 80000 miles whichever comes first.

In addition to the new electric Mustangs which are coming from Gorno Ford in Woodhaven council OK’d a six-year $348308 contract for new dashboard cameras in AAPD vehicles.

The agreement with Axon Enterprise Inc. includes the cost of new cameras and Wi-Fi offload server hardware in patrol vehicles and cloud data storage via Evidence.com.

Ann Arbor resident Adam Oxner addressed council urging city leaders to make sure the city’s police oversight commission has a say on future technology purchases to avoid using facial recognition technology.

AAPD does not use or possess facial recognition technology including the Axon dash cameras and body cameras Police Chief Michael Cox said.

“Facial recognition technology has been proven over and over again to be biased and used mostly to surveil lower-income communities and communities of color” Oxner said calling it a powerful technology that in the wrong hands can harm the less privileged.

While the contract does not grant Axon the right to analyze the city’s data in ways that identify anyone’s personally identifiable information it does upload all recordings to Axon’s servers and that’s a citizen privacy concern Oxner said.

“It is exactly this type of technology used by police that we need strong citizen oversight of” he said.

It’s good to know current AAPD practice is on the proper side of policing on the issue of facial recognition technology said Ali Ramlawi a City Council liaison to the police oversight commission.

It is highly likely that the engineers who play the biggest role in solving that problem and the technologies they adapt and advance will come from oil and gas. There is enough energy in the earth’s crust just a few miles down to power all of humanity for ages according to the US Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. The problem is how to tap into it safely efficiently and cost effectively.

After many years of failure to launch because of technology or cost limitations new companies and technologies—and smarter ways of leveraging those that already exist—are bringing geothermal out of its doldrums to the point that it may finally be ready to scale and become a major player in the transition to cleaner energy according to Jamie Beard executive director of the Geothermal Entrepreneurship Organization (GEO) at The University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin).

“The cutting-edge technological developments in geothermal are devoted to drilling into ever-deeper hotter and harder rock” she said “and oil and gas holds the key to cost reduction for all of these concepts.”

Eric Van Oort drilling and well engineering expert educator and scientist agrees. The UT-Austin engineering professor and director of the rig automation and performance improvement in drilling (RAPID) industry consortium said “Fifty to seventy-five percent of the cost of geothermal development is tied up in drilling and well construction. To scale it we have to reduce that cost.”

Designing for Extremes

Well design for geothermal wells is similar to that for oil and gas wells. The challenges arise from drilling deeper and deeper into hotter and hotter rock. Heat ranging from 150°C (302°F) to 373°C (703°F) and above can be used to profitably generate electricity. Oil and gas well designs traditionally have not had to contend with these extremes.

Thermal considerations are unavoidable in deep geothermal well construction.

Temperature and thermal effects chemical composition of produced fluids and rate of production or pressure depletion pose significant challenges to well casing and design.

Nick Cameron reservoir characterization manager at BP and leader of the supermajor’s studies into geothermal energy said his company is using corporate data geological understanding and oil and gas expertise and experience to look at where their technology can reduce risk and drive down the cost of development.

“Metallurgical understanding of materials and how they handle heat is crucial to these efforts” he said. “Fortunately there have been significant advancements in this area in recent years.” Cameron said that much work is also being done into changing the chemical composition of the fluids that flow through the geothermal reservoirs.

Numerous oil and gas service companies are contributing to game-changing capability and cost improvements in deep (especially horizontal) well construction logging and materials that enable completions in ultrahigh-temperature regions; high-temperature cement and well casing that increase long-term well integrity; research and modeling of thermodynamic properties of closed-loop systems that show long-term resource life and viability; and efficiency testing of different closed-loop well architectures across a broad spectrum of geophysical conditions using different working fluids such as water and supercritical CO 2 (sCO 2 )—that is above the temperature at which it is neither gas nor liquid but has properties of both.

Baker Hughes for one has developed tested and field-deployed a 300°C directional drilling system comprising drill bits positive-displacement motors and drilling fluids all capable of operating at up to that temperature. The system was used in the Iceland Deep Drilling Project geothermal research well RN-15/IDDP-2 at Reykjanes Iceland.

The well reached its target of supercritical conditions at a depth of 4.6 km in January 2017. After only 5 days of heating the measured bottomhole temperature (BHT) was 426°C and the fluid pressure was 4931 psi. The drilling system is the subject of an SPE paper (IADC/SPE 189677) as is a 300°C-capable measurement-while-drilling platform that has been tested in the lab.

Bringing Up the Heat

Just as with oil and gas tapping geothermal means not just digging into it but also getting it to surface. Currently there are three broad approaches to globally scalable hot-dry-rock geothermal energy—enhanced geothermal systems (EGS); advanced geothermal systems also termed closed-loop geothermal (CLG); and hybrid systems with elements of both. Because most companies pursuing these projects are highly competitive startups that don’t share their information technical details are sparse and public numbers on cost are not available.

CLG is considered more expensive than EGS currently with the possible exception of a pipe-in-pipe CLG model paired with CO 2 as the circulation fluid. Within CLG concepts that require two wells and long laterals are by far the most expensive.

However proponents argue that while upfront capital expense for these systems is more expensive than for EGS lower long-term operating expense more than offsets higher startup costs and environmental permits are significantly less expensive and time-consuming to obtain.

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). In an EGS well the objective is to increase permeability at depth in hot dry rock by creating an engineered artificial version of a conventional hydrothermal reservoir. An injection well is drilled through which water is injected at sufficient pressure to cause pre-existing fractures to re-open and create a fracture network. Once there is sufficient fractured volume to create a reservoir a second production well is drilled into the fracture network intersecting the created flow paths.

The resulting circulation loop allows water to flow through the enhanced reservoir picking up in-situ heat. The heated water is then pumped to surface through the production well. Energy is produced from the resulting steam on the surface.

Despite significant government-sponsored research beginning in the 1970s EGS has thus far been largely unsuccessful in establishing and maintaining hot-rock fracture pathways and avoiding cool-water breakthrough.

Critics of the approach point to these issues. But its proponents cite more recent advancements in hydraulic fracturing and the larger area of contact between the wellbore and the hard rock and fluid—which they say improves the rate at which heat can be extracted and thus well economics.

According to the US Department of Energy (DOE) while advanced EGS technologies are young and still under development the approach has been realized successfully on a pilot scale in Europe and the DOE is now funding demonstration projects in the US.

The DOE-funded Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) is an international field laboratory located in Utah for technology development and public education on geothermal energy in general and EGS development in particular. The facility is managed by a multidisciplinary team of engineers and scientists led by the University of Utah.

Among the most vocal cheerleaders for EGS is Mukul Sharma professor and W.A. Moncrief Jr. Centennial Endowed Chair in Petroleum Engineering at UT-Austin a member of the US National Academy of Engineering and founder of Geothermix Energy. Sharma who has been a key player in the development of hydraulic fracturing compares the current position of geothermal and particularly EGS to that of unconventional oil and gas in its nascent phase.

“By translating the engineering advancements that increased well productivity by a factor of four to 10 in many shale basins I have no doubt that we will be able to successfully deploy these methods in EGS” he said. “Today we’re drilling wells with one to three fractures; we are going for 200–300. But even if only one in 10 connect—and we know how to do that—we can increase the contact heat exchange rate and economics by the same order of magnitude.”

Tim Latimer and Jack Norbeck co-founders of Fervo Energy believe they can improve EGS performance by using horizontal drilling techniques and distributed fiber-optic sensing to isolate multiple zones inside a well and optimize flow rates within each. The California-based startup was one of the first seven companies—and the first geothermal entity—to receive funding from Bill Gates’ $1-billion Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund.

Advanced geothermal/closed-loop geothermal systems (CLG). CLG systems follow an approach very different from that of EGS. No fluids are introduced to or extracted from the earth and there is no fracturing. Instead CLG wells overcome permeability and flow issues by circulating fluid through a downhole heat exchanger or sealed wells and pipes picking up heat by conduction and carrying it to the surface where it can be used for a mix of direct heat and electricity.

Like EGS CLG systems have been around for quite some time without achieving commercialization. Also like EGS new startups are adapting technologies from oil and gas to jump-start scaling of the approach.

Closed-loop systems can operate in a broad range of temperatures and rock compositions. This wide range not only increases the number of potential viable geothermal projects but also allows the use of high-temperature resources (≥300°C) that dramatically increase power output.

Different concentric pipe-in-pipe and multilateral sealed U-loop configurations can be used to optimize site-specific costs and performance.

Closed loops make it possible to use not only water but also alternative heat-transport fluids such as sCO 2  that create a strong thermosiphon effect that can eliminate the need for an external pump.

Compact turbomachinery is scalable with sCO 2  reducing capital costs. Finally CLG energy systems can produce power from previously unproductive geothermal wells and from played-out oil and gas wells in hot strata.

Eavor Technologies and GreenFire Energy are current leaders in the development and application of CLG technology. Both have had successful initial demonstration projects. GreenFire successfully completed a field-scale demonstration of its GreenLoop technology in 2019 using an inactive well at the Coso geothermal field in Coso California. It has ongoing commercial projects in the Philippines and California.

Eavor has been operating a $10-million pilot/demonstration project called Eavor-Lite in Alberta Canada since 2019. It is partnering with Enex Power Germany and others to develop new Eavor-Loop heat and power projects within Enex’s existing geothermal license area at Geretsried in Bavaria. Construction on the initial phase of the project is expected to begin in Q3 2021.

GreenFire’s modeling and analytics capabilities make GreenLoop adaptable to a wide variety of underutilized geothermal resources at competitive prices according to the company.

It says its high-well-density architecture optimizes power output and makes it possible to drill multiple wells from the same location substantially reducing the cost per well and permitting economies of scale in site development power purchase agreements and transmission lines.

Following Eavor-Lite Eavor has modified the geometry of its original “daisy-chain” design in its new “James Joyce” design (named for the pub where the concept was hatched not the Irish author) which it will use in the Geretsried project (Fig. 1). By locating the two vertical wells next to one another the design is expected to reduce physical surface footprint and enable more precise drilling.

The wells will use magnetic ranging to remain at a fixed distance from one another. Lateral wells will branch out from each vertical staying parallel until they meet at the toe end which Eavor says is easier than meeting in the middle. The company has also been field testing a new drilling technology designed to extend Eavor-Loop into harder hotter rock. Eavor-Long has been tested throughout 2020 at the XRig facility in Stavanger Norway and is scheduled for deep field trial in the US and Canada in 2021.

EGS/CLG Hybrid. Sage Geosystems’ approach to geothermal development combines open-to-reservoir EGS and closed-loop CLG. The Sage approach begins with drilling a well to approximately 4 to 6 km total depth.

It then uses its HeatRoot technology to propagate fractures downward reaching at least several hundred more feet in depth and with it much higher temperatures than the BHT of their well. The fractures are filled with a highly conductive slurry that is also convective. Then a pipe-in-pipe closed-loop heat exchange system with a supercritical circulation fluid is placed in contact with the HeatRoot network.

“Think of this system like tree roots reaching downward from the well that suck up heat from the depths and deliver it to the wellbore” said Lev Ring founder and CEO of Sage.

“You’ve got heat resources that would have required a well twice as deep to access by growing some roots to feed your heat exchanger” added Lance Cook Sage’s president.

Blind Geothermal Picks Up Steam

At the end of December Canada-based Deep Earth Energy Production (DEEP) announced what is being called a historic milestone with a positive well test from its Border-5HZ well the deepest horizontal well ever drilled in Saskatchewan and the world’s first 90° horizontal fluid-production well to be drilled and hydraulically fractured for a geothermal power-generation application.

The DEEP project is essentially a directionally drilled “blind hydrothermal” resource which puts it in the same category as conventional hydrothermal resources such as those in Iceland and other isolated areas. The resource is a hot sedimentary aquifer meaning that there is existing water in the formation.

This type of resource is more limited than the hot and dry sedimentary rock that is fairly ubiquitous globally and therefore the focus of EGS CLG and other potentially scalable geothermal development at this point. “Blind” in this case means that there are no visible surface manifestations—such as geysers hot springs or fumaroles—of the heat and water underground.

How much more limited blind hydrothermal resources are than their deep hot-rock counterparts is a pending question and one that may attract more attention following the successful DEEP well test.

According to industry sources there are at least three major operators looking right now at where blind hydrothermal resources may be located throughout the world.

DEEP is producing the high-temperature water in the Border-5HZ well using an electrical submersible pump and said the well was completed using a sliding-sleeve system. The company also noted that the hydraulic fracturing operation was carried out using “standard horizontal-well completion procedures.”

Drilling Ahead

“What is needed to scale geothermal to the point where it can fulfill its potential as a global energy source is specific innovation and expertise in drilling technologies—the very expertise and skills many in oil and gas already have” Beard said.

“ I view the oil and gas industry as the most capable and resourced asset we have on the planet to solve climate change and with geothermal they can accomplish that end by leveraging what they already know and do” she continued. “It is oil and gas that will enable ‘geothermal anywhere.’ Across the entities within the industry I’ve engaged with regardless of their particular current focus there is clear agreement that the oil and gas industry can make huge and globally relevant things happen in geothermal fast.”

Van Oort agrees. “Geothermal drillers are very knowledgeable but they have not yet capitalized on oil and gas developments over the past 10 to 20 years” he said. “But neither does oil and gas need to come up with absolutely new technologies for geothermal” he continued. “We can push current technologies and apply them to geothermal to make a step change in drilling efficiency and cost reduction.

“Yes we have some problems to overcome” he added. “In the meantime we have the opportunity to do significantly more with what we have by applying what we learn from data to optimize its efficiency. That’s where oil and gas expertise can really help improve things for geothermal.”

BOWLING GREEN Ky. (WBKO) -” She is just one of those people that if you have a bad day no matter what it is --if you come in that door it was always “Hi Rodge.” It didn’t make any difference in what type of day she was having or you were having it just helped and that to me is a hero.” Roger Ruble a customer.

Connie Blair owns a small restaurant off of Russellville Road and has made a lasting impact on Bowling Green through the years. One long time friend of Connie’s who once served up breakfast with her at Teresa’s said she can count on her for anything.

“I come in here as often as I can--not as often as I would like but as often as I can and she has just been a sweetheart. I mean if I call her in the middle of the night and say Connie I need-- in the middle of the night she would be there no questions asked. She is dedicated to her customers she is dedicated to her family. It has been really rough on her to try and stay open and she has walked up walls to keep the doors open” said Cathy Lora a long-time friend.

Con-Cons is open for 50% capacity for indoor eating now but throughout the pandemic Connie had to adapt by adding a walk-up and a pick-up window. Most recently she added a tent for customers to eat outside.

“She gives 110% every day and just the care that she has for her customers and her employees. By far she is the best boss I have ever had and I mean it is a great place to work and she cares so much about all of us and it is just like family here and we love our customers and we love to come to work” said Jennifer Buckingham employee.

Although she has faced challenges her customers have continued to support her throughout the pandemic which has meant the world to Connie.

“I am completely overwhelmed with all the faithful customers that I have.. a lot of them are older and are staying in and I understand that and I have gained so much new business with the pickup window and the walk-up window and just adapted in a way I would have never dreamed would happen for me” said Connie Blair Hometown Hero.

Con-Cons has been open for 11 years before opening her own place Connie worked at her sister’s restaurant “Teresa’s” and her other Sister Melissa owns Melissa’s Country Cafe in Rockfield.

For her continuous efforts to work through a pandemic and keep her local business doors open we honor Connie Blair as this week’s Hughes & Coleman Hometown Hero.

“It brought tears to my eyes that someone recognized so much what I have done to stay afloat” added Blair.

Rhode Island’s tallest building -- the Industrial Bank Building or better known as the Superman building -- enters its eighth year of vacancy in 2021.

In 2019 it was named one of ""America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places"" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in its annual list.

“From the National Mall Tidal Basin in Washington D.C. to one of Chicago’s best examples of Post-Modern architecture to the vast largely unprotected cultural artifacts in the Ancestral Places of Southeast Utah this year’s list reflects both the diversity of America’s historic places and the variety of threats they face. As it has over the past three decades we know that this year’s list will inspire people to speak out for the cherished places in their own communities that define our nation’s past"" said Katherine Malone-France the then chief preservation officer of the organization.

But 2020 was a year of silence.

State economic development officials were absorbed with the coronavirus and trying to keep existing Rhode Island businesses open.

Trying to market a nearly 100-year-old building that needs an estimated $100 million or more in rehabilitation seems to be an epic challenge.

In the post-pandemic world is there a market for high-rise living or working in Providence? Is this the type of live or work environment that anyone will seek?

Since Bank of America vacated the building in 2013 the core of the Financial District has been on a painful downward decline. Nearby CVS and Dunkin’ stores have closed. Restaurants have come and gone.

“Opened in 1928 it has dominated the city's skyline for almost a century as one of the grandest pre-Depression era skyscrapers in the country. No new building in downtown Providence since has approached the wannabe-dirigible-docking station in terms of architectural excellence and design quality” wrote GoLocal’s architecture critic Will Morgan.

He added “Renovating the Superman Building will pay handsome dividends as this landmark could become our most desirable and fashionable address. It can be a permanent advertisement that Providence cares about its past while taking innovative steps to keep its downtown livable and lively.”

Is there a future in a work at home economy for this building?

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

The film is based on her son Antony Penrose’s biography The Lives of Lee Miller and recounts her career in which the former fashion model became a war correspondent for British Vogue and captured some of the most memorable images of the conflict on camera.

Two of the murderer’s 16-year-old friends who were also carrying zombie knives were detained for nine years and nine years and six months after being found guilty of the manslaughter of Mikey Roynon 16.

During his sentencing remarks Mr Justice Saini said the killing was an example of the “plague of knife crime” that was blighting Bristol and surrounding areas. He said: “The lives of young boys who carry knives continue to be taken at the hands of other boys who carry knives.”

He said Mikey from Kingswood South Gloucestershire was still a child but had a “bright musical career ahead of him”.

Mikey’s mother Hayley Ryall said: “Every morning I wake up and it hurts as much as the last morning. I keep having awful dreams that Mikey is lost and I’m looking for him but even the awful dreams are better than waking up to reality. At least in my dreams he is somewhere whereas in reality he is gone.”

She described how difficult she found what would have been Mikey’s 17th birthday in November without him and spoke of her sadness that she would never be called “mum” again. She said: “I feel like I’m living in a film or a nightmare and soon I’ll wake up and I’ll be able to hug and kiss him and Mikey will say ‘It’s OK Mum.’”

The judge lifted an order banning identification of the killers. The boy convicted of murdering Mikey is Shane Cunningham who will serve 16 years before being considered for parole. The two boys convicted of manslaughter are Cartel Bushnell and Leo Knight.

A jury at Bristol crown court rejected the claims of the boys who are from the Wiltshire market town of Devizes that they were acting in self-defence.

They travelled to Bath by bus in June last year for an open-invitation birthday party. They were each armed with zombie knives hidden beneath their clothes. One other member of the party took a knife. The judge said: “You took a total of four big knives to what was supposed to be a fun occasion. How you each got hold of these horrendous and unlawful weapons and why you took them to the party will never be known.”

The three did not know Mikey. He arrived at the party with friends from Bristol. He had a reputation as a rapper and his appearance at the party went down well and some of his songs were played.

There were about 70 young people at the party. The judge said he was sure Mikey also had a knife. The judge said: “Something happened in the garden which led to the violence. A number of the Bristol boys began drawing knives.”

Cartel and Leo took their knives out ready to fight. The judge said: “Mikey drew a knife and struck towards Cartel. Shane stabbed Mikey in the neck. The knife passed through his neck and severed a major artery.”

DI Mark Newbury the senior investigating officer said: “Knife crime is a disease which leaves a horrifying and long-lasting mark on everyone it affects. It’s a national problem which isn’t limited to specific towns or cities and we must come together as a society to tackle it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLnVzbmV3cy5jb20vd2VsbG5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZG8taWNlLWJhdGhzLXdvcmstZm9yLXJlY292ZXJ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do Ice Baths Work for Recovery? | U.S.,"Getty Images

You’ve probably seen athletes or other fitness trendsetters on social media taking an ice bath or tried one yourself to reap the benefits of the potential health benefits including faster recovery increased metabolism and reduced stress.

“People want to try (an ice bath) usually for three reasons: the physical benefits the mental benefits or because it’s trendy and they want to know what the hype is about” says Alex Corbett a physical therapist with BreakThrough Physical Therapy with locations throughout North Carolina.

But is that bone-chilling dip worth the purported benefits?



Key Takeaways:

Ice baths also called cold water immersion involve plunging part or most of your body into cold icy water.

Studies have shown that ice baths have the potential to increase fat loss reduce inflammation improve mood and speed recovery.

Cold water immersion isn’t for everybody and it is possible to experience frostbite or hypothermia if your water is too cold or you stay in for too long.

What Is an Ice Bath?

An ice bath is a planned exposure to cold water. It can be water made cold by ice or it can be water in lakes or oceans that’s seasonally cold. In the latter example it may be called a cold plunge. Some people even partake in charity cold plunges or ring in the new year with an icy cold shock.

An ice bath temperature is typically below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and often ranges from 50 to 59 degrees. Sometimes people may want their ice bath temperature to be even lower.

Ice baths are different from cryotherapy which involve exposure to very cold air (typically -220 to -240 degrees). However cryotherapy doesn't involve any submersion in water.



Ice Bath Benefits

Fans of ice baths claim that they have several potential benefits including:



Quicker recovery after intense exercise and reduced muscle soreness.

Fat burning by stimulating the body’s production of brown fat

Improved circulation

Improved mood focus and stress relief

Reduced inflammation and pain

A 2023 analysis of 20 studies published in Frontiers of Physiology concluded that cold water immersion performed immediately after exercise could help lower muscle soreness and speed up fatigue recovery. However despite their initial benefits for muscle recovery some research has found that ice baths can actually reduce muscle strength and growth over time Corbett says.

While an ice bath can increase your metabolism and help with fat burning you’re not likely to see overnight benefits with just one ice bath session. Studies have noted that while researchers have seen decreases in body fat in people who take cold plunges much more research is needed to recommend ice baths for weight loss.

Beyond physical health benefits ice baths can also give your mental wellness a boost.

“Ice baths make people feel refreshed and invigorated leading to a sense of overall well-being” says Dr. Yoshua Quinones a board-certified internist with the Medical Offices of Manhattan in New York and a contributor to the website Lab Finder.



Dangers of Ice Baths

Before you take the plunge it's important to first consider some of the potential dangers of ice baths.

These include:



Frostbite. This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long.

This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long. Hypothermia. This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure.

This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure. Cold shock. Sudden immersion in cold water can cause increased blood pressure heart rate and breathing which increases the risk of drowning. This is due to blood vessels contracting when your body is exposed to cold. People who have cardiovascular issues are at higher risk for experiencing this type of response to cold.

Because of the potential dangers of hypothermia or cold shock make sure there's someone else keeping an eye on you while you plunge into the cold no matter how experienced you are with cold temperatures.



Who Shouldn’t Take an Ice Bath

For most healthy people it’s OK to try an ice bath. However you’ll want to avoid an ice bath or check first with a health care provider if you have:



An open wound or infection. An ice bath could slow healing.

An ice bath could slow healing. Cardiovascular disease . Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate.

Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate. Peripheral neuropathy. A type of nerve damage that may cause tingling and numbness this condition is often associated with diabetes.

A type of nerve damage that may cause tingling and numbness this condition is often associated with diabetes. Raynaud’s disease. An ice bath could make your condition worse.

An ice bath could make your condition worse. Respiratory issues. Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems.

Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems. Uncontrolled high blood pressure. Increased blood pressure can occur during an ice bath.

You should also check with a healthcare provider or avoid ice baths if you are pregnant or hypersensitive to cold.

Ice Bath Tips

If you’re ready to take the plunge with an ice bath keep these tips in mind:



Plan to have someone with you or someone nearby who can help in case you need help during the ice bath.

Start gradually as you would with an exercise routine. Don’t go too cold or for too long during your first time.

Aim for water that’s uncomfortably cold but still feels safe.

Less is more. A few minutes is good but more than 30 minutes is too long.

Listen to your body. Exit if you feel dizzy or uncomfortable.

Plan to warm yourself up gradually after exiting an ice bath.

Don’t take any medication that might impair you before an ice bath.

Stay hydrated after an ice bath.

Additionally consider when is the best time to do an ice bath and how often you'll incorporate it into your routine.

“If you’re using it for muscle soreness then doing an ice bath after exercise is the optimal timing. Ten minutes post-exercise may help with delayed onset muscle soreness” says Dr. Justin Mullner a primary care sports medicine physician for adults and children with Orlando Health Jewett Orthopedic Institute in Orlando Florida.

For general mental health benefits like mood and focus you can do an ice bath three to four minutes at a time a couple of times a week for its benefits he adds.

Ice Bath Alternatives

If you want the benefits of an ice bath but can’t fathom immersing yourself in that frigid water you still may be able to obtain some of the same benefits in other ways:

Among the lessons learned from the pandemic response are changed perceptions within the industry regarding flex capacity risk management supply chain and inventory control according to Eric Langer managing partner at BioPlan Associates.

“These are not ‘new’ factors by any means. But the pandemic has demonstrated how critical they are not just in normal times but during crisis as well” says Langer.

Is the industry up for the challenge of handling the pandemic? “…the industry has in many ways known [that a pandemic response] would be possible and all the ‘moving parts’ have generally worked at the remarkable speed needed to develop vaccines and therapeutics around the world” Langer says.

Contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) proved integral to the biopharmaceutical industry’s ability to handle the pandemic providing expertise facilities and manufacturing capacity sponsor companies did not have. COVID-19 has emphasized the benefits of CMOs and CDMOs. So how did these organizations fare in 2020 and what is their outlook for 2021?

Can capacity meet demand?

Capacity has been a challenge in the past year says Langer. “CMOs and manufacturers have been managing their capacity since the beginning of this crisis from vials to stoppers from single-use devices to fill/finish lines and all the accompanying logistics. Many non-COVID projects have reportedly been shifted to other facilities and even other partners which has created bottlenecks in other adjacent segments as well. But by managing existing capacity we’re already seeing a smooth transition from R&D and clinical production to large-scale manufacturing” he says.

Fiona Barry associate editor at PharmSource–GlobalData agrees that there is insufficient capacity for the level of demand caused by the pandemic but doesn’t see the industry being able to catch up to the demand in 2021. “Eventually there will be a few different vaccine types on the market and these will require different technologies/processes to manufacture and so capacity will be specific to which vaccine types gain approval” she says. “A number of promising vaccine candidates in late stage use newer vaccines technologies such as mRNA-based products. As these become approved—the UK [United Kingdom] issued an emergency approval of Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 on [Dec. 2 2020]—then repurposing more traditional vaccine facilities will not help capacity issues.”

A balancing act

The pandemic has created another challenge: maintaining the manufacturing of non-pandemic drugs in addition to needed COVID-19 treatments. In 2021 Langer says CMOs and CDMOs will continue to balance pandemic and non-pandemic-related programs by shifting projects from facility to facility. “The cascade of scheduled pre-pandemic non-COVID projects are necessarily continuing since these too are lifesaving and must be moved forward despite the challenges to R&D and clinical trials during these times” he says.

COVID-19 vaccine developers are contracting with CMOs and CDMOs at a rate not seen before in the industry says Barry. “Consequently infectious disease drugs have already overtaken perpetual leader oncology as the year’s top therapy area for contract manufacturing service agreements since many of these vaccine-developer companies are small and lack manufacturing capabilities. Even the largest companies require extra resources to supply billions of doses with AstraZeneca and Inovio having the largest number of contract service agreements to date. Pharma companies such as Pfizer are also pushing internally manufactured drugs out to CMOs to free up space for COVID-19 vaccine manufacture” she says.

Barry agrees however that manufacturers will continue to juggle the needs of non-pandemic therapies and COVID-19 medicines and vaccines. “More than 1000 clinical trials worldwide were disrupted in 2020 by COVID-19 due to suspended or slow enrollment or delayed initiation (1). Resumed trials and delays in manufacturing of advanced biologics many of which require the same capabilities as vaccines will cause even greater demand of these already scarce resources in 2021” she says. Cell and gene therapies have also been affected by the pandemic according to Barry. She notes that a bottleneck in viral vector manufacturing was already a problem prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (2).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pbmRpYW4tc3VwZXItbGVhZ3VlL2lzbC10aGVyZS1hcmUtbm8tZWFzeS1nYW1lcy1pbi10aGlzLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLXNheXMtb2Rpc2hhLWZjLWNvYWNoLXN0dWFydC1iYXh0ZXItMjM0Njg3OdIBjAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pbmRpYW4tc3VwZXItbGVhZ3VlL2lzbC10aGVyZS1hcmUtbm8tZWFzeS1nYW1lcy1pbi10aGlzLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLXNheXMtb2Rpc2hhLWZjLWNvYWNoLXN0dWFydC1iYXh0ZXItMjM0Njg3OS9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ISL: There Are No Easy Games In This Competition Says Odisha FC Coach Stuart Baxter,"Ahead of the match against SC East Bengal in the ongoing Indian Super League (ISL) Odisha FC coach Stuart Baxter on Saturday said most of the games so far in this season have been close and each and every game is difficult in its own way. ""What the games have shown us is most games are close affairs. All games in their way are difficult. I think it's a mistake if we think suddenly we are gonna blossom into a wonderful team because we are not playing against one of the so-called top teams"" said Baxter in an official release.

Speaking about the break that Odisha FC players got after the previous game against NorthEast United FC the head coach said ""We needed a little bit of time together on the field and I think this has been useful. It was a comparatively long break and it's been good.""

Goalkeeper Arshdeep Singh has been one of the fine performers for the team so far in the competition. Highlighting the custodian's performance in the seventh season he explained ""He (Arshdeep) has done very well. The main thing is that he has shown consistency. For a goalkeeper you want that consistency. Every game is a new game a new challenge. We give him as much information about the opponents as we can. On the day he's got to do the ABCs correctly make sure that he gives that level of consistency and I think he has done that very well.""

When asked about the mindset of the team after the first few games in the season the former South Africa manager mentioned ""We have got new foreigners who are settling into Indian football and we have got young players who are helping the younger players. Even our more experienced younger players are still really settling into it. They have got a different message coming from the coach. I have been very pleased with the fact that they approach every game with the belief of getting the result. I think if we can continue to do that then we can expect a better result in the future.""

Pretty much like the Kalinga Warriors SC East Bengal is also winless so far in the tournament. Explaining further about his take on the Red and Gold Brigade the experienced coach said ""I see a lot of similarities in ourselves. We have a very young team who need time on the field and they have a very new team who need time on the field. So in a way maybe we and they have suffered from the limitations of the bio-bubble quarantining etc the most. Their games have been close games they have played well in periods of games same as we have. They will be looking for that consistency the same as we are.""

""I don't know Robbie (Fowler) that well as a coach. I obviously know him as a player. The job that he is doing under the shorter constraints is the same as ours. Even he is seen working very very hard and you see improvements there. We both would like to see those improvements going a little bit quicker"" he added.

Odisha FC is currently at the 11th spot in the ISL points table and the side will take on East Bengal on Sunday.",,,,,,,,,

Look no further than 2020 for evidence that the long-term trend of the market is up. Despite an unprecedented global pandemic it appears as though the S&P 500 will miraculously end this year up in the mid-teens.

Nevertheless we shouldn't forget we've had two massive downturns in just the past two years which can be awfully scary if you're not prepared. One thing's for sure -- we'll get another. It may be in 2021; it may be further out. But another big downturn will most certainly happen at some point over the next five years.

After this year's big gains some investors may be looking to lock in some profits and preserve capital especially those in or near retirement. Nevertheless stocks still seem like the best place for long-term savings given that bonds yield next to nothing and most asset classes remain somewhat highly priced.

The solution? Position your portfolio defensively in companies that can weather a big storm or even capitalize on the next recession.

With high-flying IPO stocks trading at nosebleed valuations and many ""reopening"" stocks already pricing in a recovery here are three rock-solid defensive stocks you can confidently hold through the next downturn.

Berkshire Hathaway

One of the best ways to protect your net worth is to throw your money in with the most practical risk-off investor of all time: Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.56%) (BRK.B 0.07%) has actually lagged the overall stock market for the past one- five- and 10-year periods.

Still this may be a function of the growth-obsessed market we're currently in with investors paying very high prices for young companies with exciting potential. In comparison Buffett's Berkshire may seem downright old-fashioned.

Yet that's overlooking the topic of risk. As Buffett once said in his 2001 letter to shareholders ""You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.""

Buffett and his partners have built the current Berkshire into a collection of businesses with highly defensive characteristics. After all insurance doesn't fluctuate with economic cycles but with the random frequency of disasters and claims.

Another huge business at Berkshire is its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit which is a huge utility and energy business that covers the U.S. Canada and Great Britain and which is also highly defensive. Another major ""utility-like"" Berkshire business is Burlington Northern railroad. All of these business units remained profitable during the downturn of 2020 with Berkshire Hathaway Energy even increasing profits.

Then of course comes Berkshire's large investment portfolio which consists of wholly owned businesses and $245 billion in public stocks as of Sept. 30. One of the greatest investors of all time Buffett and his team mostly invest in wide-moat stocks with solid staying power at reasonable valuations. And being highly cautious Berkshire held about $142 billion in cash at the end of last quarter giving Buffett and his team the optionality to pick up discounted companies should disaster strike again.

Many investors have ignored Berkshire this year as the market bounced back much too fast for Buffett to swoop in with many large consequential buys. Additionally Buffett sold out of several Covid-affected stocks like airlines at or near the 2020 bottom.

However trading at just 1.28 times book value Berkshire still looks awfully cheap compared to just about any other large-cap company. Its industrial and manufacturing businesses should also bounce back after a vaccine making shares look like a bargain for today's defensive investor.

Costco

When times get tough families look for necessities at a big discount. That likely means heading to Costco Wholesale (COST 1.57%) for its unbeatable prices on bulk items.

Operating as a membership club Costco actually earns most of its profits from annual membership fees which start at just $60 per year. Those membership fees allow Costco to continue cutting prices essentially selling products and services near breakeven to its customers.

Once you become a Costco member you aren't likely to find a better deal anywhere else. Even in this pandemic year Costco was able to increase its same-store sales in the mid-teens as it rolled out enhanced safety measures and grew its e-commerce business. Last quarter Costco grew its e-commerce business by 86.4% and increased overall same-store sales by 15.4%.

Not only that but Costco still has a long runway for growth especially internationally. The company has only one store open in China today but it appears to be a success. If the company can increase its presence in the world's second-largest economy over the next decade it'll be another huge win.

As a defensive consumer staple Costco's stock decreased less than most other stocks in the market during the March swoon. And by December it rewarded shareholders with a special $10 dividend a bonus the company has rewarded shareholders with every few years for the past decade. For defensive-minded investors Costco will definitely help you sleep well at night.

Microsoft

Finally the most defensive way to play the red-hot cloud computing sector is Microsoft (MSFT 2.22%). At the core of Microsoft today is its high-growth Azure cloud computing platform which grew by 48% last quarter and is already a strong No. 2 player behind Amazon's AWS.

We're still in the relatively early innings of enterprises migrating their infrastructure to the cloud and Microsoft seems well-positioned as one of the three big U.S. companies primed to benefit. Last year Microsoft earned its bona fides as not just a second-place player but as a potential leader after it won the $10 billion JEDI cloud contract from the Department of Defense.

Cloud computing is a utility-like service that's also high growth adding a terrific business to Microsoft's already-impressive roster of enterprise-software products like Office and Dynamics. Microsoft is also the owner of business social media network LinkedIn code repository GitHub and the Xbox gaming platform which just released its first new console in seven years.

These highly profitable growth businesses along with a healthy $137 billion in cash on the balance sheet make Microsoft a highly defensive and growth stock all at once. When you look at it that way the company's 35 price-to-earnings ratio doesn't seem so expensive after all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9ub3hpb3VzLXBvaXNvbi1iaXRjb2lucy1tYXJrZXQtY2FwLXN1cnBhc3Nlcy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0cy1iZXJrc2hpcmUtaGF0aGF3YXktdmFsdWF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Noxious Poison' - Bitcoin's Market Cap Surpasses Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Valuation – Finance Bitcoin News,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtub3huZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAxLzAxL3BvcnRpb24tbmV3bHktcmVjb25zdHJ1Y3RlZC1qYWNrc29uLWF2ZS1yYW1wLW9wZW5zLzQxMDkyMTQwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Portion of newly reconstructed Jackson Ave. ramp opens,"Portion of newly reconstructed Jackson Ave. ramp opens

Lending credence to the “digital gold” narrative bitcoin hit a high of 15.62 ounces in the early morning surpassing its peak at the top of the 2017 bull run according to MarketWatch data. Its price in fiat terms was $19300 at the time of publication.

Bitcoin priced in gold bullion via MarketWatch

Many analysts are bullish on both gold the spot price of which rose 25% in the past year and bitcoin which jumped 300% in 2020. Citibank’s analysts believe bitcoin’s price could hit $318000 by the end of 2021 and similarly optimistic projections have become widespread. Even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon once a vociferous critic of bitcoin has jumped on the bandwagon.

Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal sold his considerable gold position to go all in on bitcoin and Ethereum. While he remains bullish on gold he shares Wall Street legend Paul Tudor Jones’ belief that bitcoin is “the fastest horse in the race” and thinks it will reach a gobsmacking $1 million in five years.

Proponents of the digital gold narrative include Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone and Michael Saylor CEO of MicroStrategy an American business intelligence firm that has shifted its treasury into bitcoin a highly lucrative move that has caused its share price to soar.

Saylor believes bitcoin is “1000X better than gold” because of its greater divisibility; ease of storage transport and verification; and perhaps most importantly its genuine scarcity.

‘Rat poison squared…’

Meanwhile bitcoin has roared past American tycoon Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway. At $545 billion at the time of publication the largest crypto has passed the the finance giant’s market cap. Bitcoiners rejoiced in the slap in the face to the legendary investor who once dismissed the crypto as “rat poison squared.”

Bitcoin bull Vijay Boyapati tweeted victoriously “#Bitcoin just surpassed Berkshire Hathaway in market capitalization. How do you like the rat poison now @WarrenBuffett?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9icmllZi1oaXN0b3J5LWJpdGNvaW4tYnViYmxlcy0xODQ3MjAzODkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A brief history of Bitcoin bubbles,"It’s been a breakout year for Bitcoin. In 2020 a wave of interest from mainstream investors and institutions helped push the price of the virtual currency from $7200 in January to above $29000 on December 31 (and then on past $32700 by early January 2021). But the innovative digital asset maintained by a decentralized swarm of so-called miners has a long history of volatility. Most observers expect some retrenchment of that rally sooner or later.

For insight into why (or maybe when) a slump is likely it’s worth looking back at Bitcoin’s many “bubble” periods: stretches when the price increased dramatically in a short amount of time then fell in most cases even more sharply. “Bubble” of course has negative connotations implying popular delusions and the madness of crowds. But there’s a growing understanding that financial bubbles can also be generated by temporary overoptimism about real innovation that can still pay off in the long run. Examples of this include the British Railway Mania of the 1840s and the 1999 Dot-com bubble.

Supporters see Bitcoin’s history of volatility as just a matter of watching the world catch up in fits and starts with an inevitable future. Ten years of steady growth seems to have vindicated that view—at least for now. But the growing pains can be truly savage.

Below a trip down Bitcoin’s memory lane.

Caveat: Many of the Bitcoin marketplaces (such as Mt.Gox) that established the historical prices cited in the following text no longer exist. Even at the time it would have been hard to identify a single price in the very small relatively illiquid market. For simplicity and consistency this article primarily relies on 99bitcoins.com for prices from 2009 to 2012 and CoinGecko for prices from 2013 to the present.

Feb. 2011: The Great Slashdotting/Dollar Parity Day

The Peak: $1.06 (Feb. 14 2011)

The Bottom: $0.67 (April 5 2011)

The Bitcoin bull run that peaked in February 2011 was arguably the cryptocurrency’s first bubble and tremendously significant for its evolution. It began as early as July 2010 when Bitcoin—then worth just pennies per coin—was first mentioned on Slashdot a news aggregator popular with die-hard techies. That post first brought important developers including Jeff Garzik and Jed McCaleb to the project. Heightened interest then drove the price of a Bitcoin to one dollar on Feb. 10 2011. That day became known as Dollar Parity Day and triggered a second Slashdot post that brought further attention.

That basic cycle is still a major dynamic of the Bitcoin market: real technology or infrastructure advances drive the price higher then the price itself generates further less sustainable price growth.

Story continues

June 2011: The Bump on Silk Road

The Peak: $29.58 (June 9 2011)

The Bottom: $2.14 (Nov. 18 2011)

The first truly wild Bitcoin bubble began with a June 1 2011 article about the darkweb market Silk Road on now-defunct news site Gawker. The article described how illegal drugs could be purchased on a hidden website using Bitcoin. (Beliefs at the time that Bitcoin is untraceable turned out to be wildly incorrect.) Just as important the article followed on the heels of several early Bitcoin exchanges opening which made the token easier to buy. The combination of attention and access sent Bitcoin from $10 to nearly $30 in just a week. Then setting a pattern it slumped for months.

November 2013: A Thousandaire

The Peak: $1127.45 (Nov. 29 2013)

The Bottom: $172.15 (Jan. 13 2015)

Just short of three years after breaking the barrier to dollar parity Bitcoin zoomed on to another crucial threshold cracking $1000 in late November 2013. It didn’t last and the price cratered nearly 50% by mid December. This bull run is notable for its relative stickiness: The Bitcoin price declined relatively gently over a little more than a year to a new bottom then rode along that bottom for another year. Prices didn’t break $1000 again for more than three years after the first time.

December 2017: The Widowmaker

The Peak: $19665 (Dec. 15 2017)

The Bottom: $3164 (Dec. 15 2018)

The most brutal and crazy of all Bitcoin bubbles so far except it wasn’t really a Bitcoin bubble. Instead 2017’s bull run was largely fueled by a wave of newly-minted “alternative” cryptocurrencies that made big promises.

More importantly a novel process known as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) allowed founders to sell their new offerings directly to the public. That created not just one speculative mania but literally thousands that fed off of each other: One ICO’s purely speculative run-up would create FOMO—that is fear of missing out—for the next. Bitcoin benefited from the frenzy but its “dominance” or share of the overall crypto market fell off a cliff as interest in “altcoins” surged.

It all ended in tears of course. A mere week after peaking Bitcoin dropped more than 25%. Other cryptocurrencies plummeted even further. Longer term many of the projects rolling out ICOs turned out to be brazen frauds and ICOs have since been broadly and aggressively pursued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as illegal securities offerings.

To cite one example of how bloody things got Japanese tech mogul Masayoshi Son of SoftBank fame is reported to have lost $130 million in the 2017 crypto bubble—and that was allegedly his personal money not SoftBank’s.

This time it’s…different?

Veterans of Bitcoin’s wild roller-coaster ride have argued that the current white-knuckle run-up is in crucial ways different. (Of course we’ve heard this before.) They argue that the absence of ICOs has forestalled the worst excesses of scammers and their greedy marks the U.S. COVID stimulus can be read as validation of the inflation-hedge thesis that is crucial to Bitcoin’s appeal as an investment and the presence of regulated institutions and publicly-traded corporations throughout the crypto market has created an entirely new sense of normality.

But Bitcoin it can’t be repeated enough is still a speculative and risky asset. If history is any teacher (and it often is) there will be more than a few more steps backwards on Bitcoin’s journey to the moon.

Contrast stitching on synthetic leather upholstery looks and feels good but Toyota limits real leather to the steering wheel and shift knob only. It's smaller than the RAV4 with up to 55.1 cubic feet of cargo room with the rear seats folded flat compared to 69.8 cubic feet in the RAV4.

Venza uses the RAV4 Hybrid's 2.5-liter inline-4 a version of Toyota's hybrid system employing three motors in all and a lithium-ion 0.9-kwh battery pack which is smaller than that in the RAV4. Like other Toyota hybrids the electric system can power the Venza at low speeds but for more urgent demands the engine takes over with a groan that only intensifies under a heavier foot. The suspension and ride quality lean towards the Lexus reputation for a calm and quiet cabin with dull steering and soft compliant handling built for comfort not speed.

Few industries offer long-term growth potential like the cannabis industry. U.S. and Canadian pot stocks are on very different paths in terms of performance and potential however.

A recent report from cannabis-focused analytics company New Frontier Data projects that legalized pot sales in the U.S. can more than triple from $13.2 billion in 2019 to $41.5 billion by 2025. That's a 21% compound annual growth rate for those of you keeping score at home. Even if marijuana were to remain illicit at the federal level state-level legalizations and organic growth opportunities provide more than enough potential to generate some serious green for investors.

The best marijuana stocks to buy in 2021 to take advantage of this growth all focus on the U.S. cannabis market.

Green Thumb Industries

First up is vertically integrated multistate operator (MSO) Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF -1.20%). Green Thumb has 50 operational dispensaries at the moment but holds 96 licenses in a dozen states. This places the company in the top three among publicly traded MSOs based on licenses.

Green Thumb is notable for its location selectivity and product mix. As for the former Green Thumb has focused its attention on states that offer billion-dollar annual sales potential by mid-decade. In particular it's bought its way into both Illinois and Nevada. Illinois is a limited license state affording Green Thumb plenty of opportunity to pick up market share. Meanwhile Nevada's tourist-reliant industry is expected to lead the nation in per-capita cannabis spending by 2024.

In terms of product mix Green Thumb has focused heavily on selling derivatives a category that includes edibles vapes concentrates topicals and infused beverages. It's easy to oversupply and commoditize dried cannabis flower so generating two-thirds of its revenue from derivatives has helped pump up the company's margins and push it toward recurring profitability faster than its peers.

Green Thumb should be second to only Curaleaf in surpassing $1 billion in annual sales. It shouldn't have any trouble turning the corner to recurring profitability in 2021.

Jushi Holdings

The marijuana stock with the highest potential upside in 2021 might be small-cap MSO Jushi Holdings (JUSHF 0.88%). Jushi has 13 operational dispensaries at the moment. It holds licenses to open over two dozen locations in about a half-dozen states.

Jushi plans to focus on building up its presence in limited license states. These are states that either limit the total number of retail licenses they'll issue or assign licenses based on a territory or county. The lion's share of Jushi's anticipated 2021 revenue will come from Pennsylvania Virginia and Illinois -- all limited license states. This selective placement should help Jushi avoid competition while building up its brand.

Jushi is also unique in that its insiders and executives put their own money on the line to grow the business. According to a recent investor presentation $45 million of the roughly $250 million in capital raised since inception has come from insiders and executives. Insiders having skin in the game is usually a big positive for investors.

In 2021 Jushi should generate positive earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as it looks to nearly triple its year-over-year sales.

GrowGeneration

Don't forget the ancillary players. Despite its huge run-up in 2020 hydroponic and organic gardening solutions retail chain GrowGeneration (GRWG 5.91%) looks poised to have another excellent year.

As state-level legalizations continue and legal pot revenue soars more producers will enter the industry to get their piece of what might be a $75 billion annual U.S. sales pie by 2030. GrowGeneration provides everything large and small cultivators need to improve yield and protect their crop from a host of threats. GrowGen as the company is known had 36 stores in 11 states as of mid-November. It has plans to increase its retail footprint to 50 stores in 15 states by the end of 2021.

In each of the past seven quarters year-over-year sales growth has tallied between 123% and 199%. Further online sales are growing by a low triple-digit percentage with same-store sales growth from locations open in Q3 2019 jumping by 73% in the latest quarter. This growth isn't just acquisition-based. GrowGen is seeing a significant uptick in sales from newly acquired and existing locations.

Still acquisitions have played a key role in GrowGeneration's expansion. The company has made about a dozen purchases since 2014 -- the latest of which (The GrowBiz) added five new locations on the West Coast.

Look for GrowGen to once again trounce Wall Street's sales expectations in the upcoming year.

Cresco Labs

Last but not least U.S. MSO Cresco Labs (CRLBF 1.00%) has all the makings of a top marijuana stock in 2021.

The Cresco growth story boils down to two catalysts. The first stems from the company's small but rapidly growing retail operations. Cresco has a presence in nine states and holds 29 total dispensaries. At the moment it has 19 operational locations roughly half of which are in Illinois. As noted the Land of Lincoln is a limited license state. Cresco should have no trouble gobbling up share in a market that looks on track to top $1 billion in annual sales by or before 2024.

The other big catalyst is Cresco's mammoth wholesale segment. In January 2020 Cresco closed on its all-stock acquisition of Origin House. Origin was one of a select few companies that held a cannabis distribution license in the lucrative California market. Once this deal closed it allowed Cresco Labs to place pot products into more than 575 dispensaries throughout the Golden State. As California continues to plow through red tape and open more dispensaries the wholesale opportunity for Cresco should grow considerably.

Cresco Labs like Green Thumb seems like it will turn the corner to recurring profitability in 2021. It may have a shot at topping $1 billion in annual sales by 2022. It's one of the strongest MSOs investors can buy right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2RlYWxzL2dldC1vbmUteWVhci1vZi1zb255LXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXBsdXMtMzMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get a year of Sony PlayStation Plus for $33,"It's certainly possible to enjoy your PS4 or if you're especially lucky PS5 without a PlayStation Plus subscription but most gamers consider it essential.

To explore the expression pattern of SlGRAS4 (Soly01g100200) during fruit development and ripening fruit at different stages were investigated including 8 DPA (days post anthesis) fruit 16 DPA fruit mature green fruit (MG) breaker fruit (Br) 3 days post breaker (Br + 3) fruit and 7 days post breaker (Br + 7) fruit. The expression level of SlGRAS4 gradually increased from breaker to red ripe fruit which accompanied the fruit ripening process (Fig. 1a) suggesting that SlGRAS4 may play a role during fruit ripening in tomato. To investigate whether SlGRAS4 was under ethylene regulation wild-type (WT) MG fruit were treated with ethylene and SlGRAS4 was significantly induced by ethylene treatment. Simultaneously E4 an ethylene response gene was used as a control to validate the efficacy of the treatment (Fig. 1b). On the other hand WT Br was treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and SlGRAS4 was significantly repressed after 1-MCP treatment (Fig. 1c) suggesting that SlGRAS4 was under ethylene regulation.

Overexpression of SlGRAS4 accelerates fruit ripening

To investigate the function of SlGRAS4 in fruit ripening the days at anthesis and DPA were recorded for WT and SlGRAS4 overexpression plants (the efficiency of overexpression is shown in Fig. S1). The SlGRAS4-OE fruit exhibited earlier ripening than the WT fruit and the OE fruit showed an orange color at 37 DPA whereas the WT was still at the mature green stage; when the WT fruit reached the orange stage at 42 DPA the OE fruit was red ripe (Fig. 2a). The calculated days from anthesis to the breaker stage showed that the ripening period of OE fruit was ~5 days earlier than that of WT fruit (Fig. 2b). The most obvious characteristic of fruit ripening is the color changes that occur with the accumulation of carotenoids. We further measured the total carotenoid content in WT and SlGRAS4-OE fruit and low levels of carotenoids were observed in both WT and OE fruit at 35 DPA but the carotenoid content in OE fruit was much higher than that in WT at 40 DPA (Fig. 2c). PSY1 encodes phytoene synthase 1 which plays a critical role in the synthesis of carotenoids. The expression level of SlPSY1 in OE fruit was much higher than that in WT fruit at both 35 DPA and 40 DPA (Fig. 2d) which is consistent with the high carotenoid level in OE fruit.

Ethylene biosynthesis and ripening-related genes are induced in SlGRAS4-OE fruit

More ethylene production was found in SlGRAS4-OE fruit at the breaker stage than in WT fruit (Fig. 3a). The expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes ethylene signaling genes and crucial transcription factors in fruit ripening was analyzed in WT and OE fruit (Fig. 3b–h S2–4). The expression levels of SlACS4 and SlACO3 in OE fruit were significantly higher than those in WT at the breaker stage and the expression levels of SlACO1 and SlACO3 in OE fruit were higher than those in WT at the Br + 3 stage (Fig. 3b–e). The expression levels of other ethylene biosynthesis genes including SlACS1a SlACS6 SlACO2 SlACO4 and SlSAM1 showed no obvious changes in OE fruit compared to WT fruit at the breaker stage except that SlACS3 was downregulated in OE fruit (Fig. S2). There were no significant differences in most ethylene signaling genes between WT and SlGRAS4-OE fruit at the breaker stage except that SlEBF3 expression was much higher in OE fruit (Fig. S3). As important regulators of ethylene biosynthesis and fruit ripening the transcriptional levels of RIN and NOR were also significantly induced in OE fruit at the breaker stage (Fig. 3f g). In contrast the expression of SlMADS1 a negative regulator of tomato fruit ripening was significantly downregulated in OE fruit compared to WT fruit at both the breaker and Br+3 stages (Fig. 3h). In addition SlPG2a and SlFUL1 were expressed at higher levels in OE fruit at the breaker stage (Fig. S4). These results suggested that SlGRAS4 may accelerate fruit ripening by influencing the expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and important transcription factors.

SlGRAS4-OE fruit exhibit more obvious phenotypes after exogenous ethylene and 1-MCP treatment

Ethylene is crucial for tomato fruit ripening and 1-MCP is a potent inhibitor of ethylene perception that can inhibit fruit ripening. WT and SlGRAS4-OE fruit at the mature green stage were picked and used for exogenous ethylene treatment. Color turning in OE fruit occurred noticeably earlier than that in WT fruit after treatment for 48 h and WT and OE fruit both turned orange after treatment for 72 h but OE fruit looked darker (Fig. 4a). On the other hand WT and SlGRAS4-OE fruit at the breaker stage were picked and used for exogenous 1-MCP treatment. There were obvious differences between WT and OE fruit after 1-MCP treatment. The OE fruit were light orange after treatment for 72 h whereas the WT fruit were still at the breaker stage and exhibited no obvious color turning (Fig. 4b); in addition more ethylene was produced in OE fruit (Fig. S5) suggesting that the accelerated color turning in OE fruit after 1-MCP treatment was caused by the higher levels of endogenous ethylene. The expression of four crucial ethylene biosynthesis genes namely SlACS2 SlACS4 SlACO1 and SlACO3 was higher in OE fruit than in WT fruit after ethylene treatment for 72 h (Fig. 4c). Consistent with the phenotype the expression levels of SlACS2 SlACS4 SlACO1 and SlACO3 in OE fruit were all significantly higher than those in WT fruit after 1-MCP treatment (Fig. 4d).

SlGRAS4-OE seedlings exhibit more intense phenotypes after exogenous ACC treatment

To ascertain whether the increased level of ethylene production persisted in nonfruit tissues in SlGRAS4-overexpressing plants an ethylene triple-response assay was performed. The ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) was used to treat WT and OE seedlings. In the absence of ACC there were no significant differences in hypocotyl length and root length between WT and OE seedlings (Fig. 5a–c). Hypocotyl elongation and root elongation were inhibited in both WT and OE seedlings after ACC treatment but the inhibition in OE seedlings was more severe than that in WT seedlings and the bending of hypocotyls was more obvious in OE seedlings (Fig. 5a–c) suggesting that more ethylene may be produced in SlGRAS4-OE seedlings. Furthermore the expression of SlACS2 SlACS4 SlACO1 and SlACO3 was detected in WT and SlGRAS4-OE seedlings with or without ACC treatment. There were no changes in SlACO1 and SlACO3 in OE seedlings in the absence of ACC whereas SlACS2 and SlACS4 were downregulated (Fig. 5d). However after ACC treatment all four genes were significantly upregulated in OE seedlings compared to WT seedlings (Fig. 5e). These results provide molecular evidence for the likely increase in ethylene production in SlGRAS4-OE seedlings.

SlGRAS4 directly binds to and activates the SlACO1 and SlACO3 promoters

The results described above suggest that SlGRAS4 accelerates fruit ripening by influencing ethylene biosynthesis. The expression of SlACS2 SlACS4 SlACO1 and SlACO3 was enhanced in OE fruit regardless of whether they were on the vine or treated with ethylene and 1-MCP. On the other hand several SlGRAS4-binding motifs were identified on the promoters of SlACS2 SlACS4 SlACO1 and SlACO3 by an in silico search (Table S1) suggesting that SlGRAS4 may regulate the expression of these genes in a direct manner. A yeast one-hybrid assay was performed to verify the interaction of SlGRAS4 with these promoter fragments and the results showed that SlGRAS4 can directly bind to the SlACO1 and SlACO3 promoter fragments (Fig. 6a) whereas there was no interaction between SlGRAS4 and the SlACS2 and SlACS4 promoters. The dual-luciferase assay further confirmed that SlGRAS4 directly activates the SlACO1 and SlACO3 promoters (Fig. 6b c). These results confirmed that SlGRAS4 influences ethylene biosynthesis by regulating SlACO1 and SlACO3 expression in a direct manner.

SlGRAS4 directly binds to the SlMADS1 promoter and represses its expression

SlMADS1 negatively regulates fruit ripening in tomato and silencing of SlMADS1 accelerates fruit ripening. SlACS2 SlACO1 and SlACO3 were upregulated in SlMADS1-silenced fruit21. SlMADS1 was significantly downregulated in SlGRAS4-OE fruit during fruit ripening (Fig. 3h). In our previous study SlMADS1 was identified as one of the SlGRAS4 target genes through a ChIP-seq approach31. Several SlGRAS4-binding motifs on the SlMADS1 promoter were identified by an in silico search (Table S1). A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that SlGRAS4 can directly bind to the SlMADS1 promoter fragment (Fig. 7a S6) and a dual-luciferase assay revealed that SlGRAS4 can directly repress the promoter activity of the SlMADS1 gene (Fig. 7b c). These results indicated that the accelerated fruit ripening of SlGRAS4-OE fruit is also caused by the repression of SlMADS1 in a direct manner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAxNDc2NTEzMjAzMTE1N1jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zinc-pretreatment triggers glutathione and Nrf2-mediated protection against inorganic mercury-induced cytotoxicity and ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014765132031157X on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAxNDc2NTEzMjAzMTE1N1jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMjcyODg0MjIwMzI2NTcy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Development of bioglass coating reinforced with hydroxyapatite whiskers on TiO2 nanotubes via electrophoretic ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272884220326572 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMjcyODg0MjIwMzI2NTcy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Now the asset-management giant is setting its sights lower.

BlackRock’s staffers conceded the target was unrealistic after struggling to meet fundraising goals. The firm’s staffers hope to grow the fund to between $4 billion and $6 billion in assets over time people familiar with the matter said.

Best known for funds that track broad markets and trade on exchanges BlackRock launched fundraising for a strategy in 2018 to make direct long-term investments in private companies. The fund was an aggressive gambit to take on private equity’s big league deal makers.

Private markets are one of the few corners of finance untouched by fee pressures that have pulled the cost of investing closer to zero. But it is hard to build a presence from scratch. Many asset managers face challenges replicating their reach over stock-and-bond markets in the complex labor-intensive business of investing in privately held companies.

So far BlackRock has raised less than one-third of its original goal—$3.4 billion as of the end of 2020 according to people familiar with the matter. BlackRock which had an initial year-and-a-half window to raise money for the fund missed internal fundraising deadlines and asked investors for a few more months to seek money according to some of the people familiar with the matter. Now BlackRock can’t raise further money until 80% of that money is invested fund documents dictate.

Firm executives have told investors BlackRock is committed to the fund.

“As one of the largest first-time private equity funds ever we look forward to investing in and working with more companies seeking a long-term strategic partner to help them grow their business"" said André Bourbonnais who heads the strategy known as Long Term Private Capital.

In 2019 the fund bought a stake in Authentic Brands Group which owns brands including Sports Illustrated and Nine West. It invested in a luxury perfume maker in 2020.

BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has pushed the firm with $7.8 trillion in assets to grow its illiquid alternatives business. BlackRock’s illiquid alternatives franchise has roughly $80 billion invested across infrastructure credit and other strategies in hard-to-trade wagers. This business punched above its weight delivering 4% of the firm’s fee revenues in the third quarter even while accounting for 1% of assets. The business has grown as pensions and endowments hunt for returns in a low-interest era.

However BlackRock’s experiment in private equity has been a tough sell.

The fund was structured differently from traditional private-equity funds that exit bets and give investors their money back within a set period of time. Some institutions balked at tying up money in BlackRock’s fund with no deadlines for returning investor money or a proven track record. Some investors asked BlackRock to settle for more modest fundraising goals.

The fund’s architect Mark Wiseman hoped that a selling point of the fund was that fees would fall as it got bigger. BlackRock found it harder to attract new investors after Mr. Wiseman was pushed out of the firm in late 2019 for failing to disclose a relationship with a subordinate. Investors questioned if the team would stay together.

Mr. Bourbonnais the executive leading the fund was a top candidate in 2020 for the top job at Canadian pension fund giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec said people familiar with the matter. He remained at BlackRock.

When the pandemic struck it was tough getting pensions excited about untested strategies.

Despite missing the $12 billion fund target BlackRock was still successful in raising over $22 billion for illiquid alternative projects in the year ended September 2020 a person familiar with the matter said.

A group led by former Goldman Sachs investors is on track to raise in excess of its $1.5 billion target by early 2021 to buy secondhand fund stakes. BlackRock sealed $5.1 billion in 2020 for a fund to invest in power plants and energy infrastructure.

“As clients are increasing their exposure to private markets we have raised record amounts for our illiquid strategies over the last year across private credit real assets and private equity"" said Edwin Conway the head of BlackRock’s alternatives business.

To knit staffers more closely to the success of the alternatives business BlackRock is in early discussions over new ways for professionals to share in profits typically reserved for select executives investment staff and firm shareholders for future funds people familiar with the matter said.

For him and his ilk Bitcoin is an asset in which funds may be parked (and hopefully grow in value) while mostly outside the reach of the government-managed economic system. Like goldbugs they have a distrust of federal authority and think that the economic lesson of the Covid-19 crisis is that scarcity reigns—in fact should reign—and that central banks by simply printing money through quantitative easing and relief efforts like the Cares Act are risking inflation and cheapening the value of the dollar. The virtue of Bitcoin is that it’s limited—according to the code underpinning the cryptocurrency only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be “minted” with about 18.5 million already in circulation—so better to get in as soon as possible. Even Saylor who has also called Bitcoin “digital gold” has his regrets about not buying more earlier: “I wish I knew then what I know now” he told a journalist in September.

Saylor described his company’s decision as a way of dodging inflation taxes and fees and putting extra capital to more productive use. He says that the company will hold onto its Bitcoin for 100 years . But a company struggling to increase revenue that chooses to put its cash reserves into a speculative digital cryptocurrency is reason enough to take pause . Saylor and MicroStrategy’s history of alleged fraud is another one."

Piedmont Senior Resources Inc. (PSR) headquartered in Farmville serves seniors in Prince Edward Buckingham Cumberland Charlotte Lunenburg Amelia and Nottoway counties.

PSR provides numerous services most income based to hundreds of clients throughout southside Virginia. Those services include home delivered meals care packages non-emergency medical transportation to doctor appointments care coordinators for clients who have difficulties with self-care and a homemaker program that provides meal preparation and basic companionship.

Before COVID changed social activities many PSR seniors would participate in weekly county-based Friendship Cafes. When the virus shut down the cafes PSR created a volunteer phone-based wellness check system that has proven to be successful in making connections with seniors who otherwise would be shut-in and socially isolated.

Over the past six months PSR volunteers have made more than 2700 phone calls to seniors for monthly check-ins to see how they are doing. They also inquire about what needs they may have and sometimes simply chat and socialize.

One situation demonstrates the importance of PSR in the lives of seniors.

“PSR has a very skilled team of individuals who often intervene and advocate in situations on behalf of seniors” Nutrition and Transportation Director Thomas Jordan Miles III said. “One of these people is Nikki Dean our nutrition program coordinator who was instrumental in helping the client in this story.”

The calls are fairly simple to make. The volunteers identify themselves and ask how the senior is doing. The volunteer in this case was Buckingham resident Margaret “Maggie” Snoddy. The PSR senior was Donald Ostrander. The results of that simple call were life changing.

It turns out that when Snoddy called 83-year-old Ostrander (who had just signed up as a PSR client) for the first time he was in Hampton where he’d gone to get medical treatment at a VA hospital. Along with prostate cancer Ostrander was struggling with pain from a hernia. While getting treatment he was placed in a Hampton shelter.

Ostrander now sees Snoddy as a gift from an angel.

“I told her I was in Hampton and could not receive PSR meals at that time” Ostrander said.

Snoddy noted his situation and said she or another volunteer would call back the next month.

“I told myself she ain’t going to call me back. What am I going to do?” Ostander said. “The situation in the shelter was not good. I couldn’t take it anymore. I didn’t know where I was going but I knew I had to leave.”

Ostrander managed to get a ride back to Farmville ending up in a motel in Blackstone basically homeless.

With cancer a painful hernia and now homeless Ostrander was at a very low place.

“I went to a church in Blackstone and spoke to God. I asked him to cure me. That was on a Sunday” he said. “The hospital was supposed to operate that following Wednesday. The doctor tested me first and the cancer was gone.”

Meanwhile continuing to stay in the Blackstone Motel was not financially possible for Ostrander.

“I got on my knees by my bed and asked God ‘what am I going to do?’ I didn’t have any money and I need a place to stay by the first of the month” he said.

That is when the next month’s wellness check-in call came from Snoddy and PSR went into action. After Snoddy learned that Ostrander had returned to the area she alerted PSR about his situation. Along with finding him an affordable place to stay PSR helped set up rides to doctor appointments made sure he had nutritous meals as well as helping with other essential needs.

“When Maggie called and informed me of Mr. Ostrander’s situation I immediately contacted Mr. Ostrander to see what PSR could do to help” Dean said. “His story brought tears to my eyes and I immediately got to work on finding him a place to stay. Once he was settled we made sure he had the necessary food clothes and other bedding items so he was comfortable. Then I got to work on his medical issues. Thankfully we were able to contact the VA on his behalf straighten up his medical issues and get him the transportation he needed to make those much-needed doctors’ appointments. Mr. Ostrander is a sweet man and has been 100% appreciative for everything given to help him throughout this process. This is why I do what I do and why I love what I do.”

Ostrander looks at PSR and Snoddy as his lifesavers. He also acknowledges God’s power.

“Look at what he did” he said. “I can’t turn God away. There’s only one God. You’re going to need him one day. I was all alone and no family.”

Ostrander gives much credit to Snoddy for being his guardian angel.

“Thank you all for what you’re doing” he said to Snoddy when she recently visited him in Blackstone. “I wouldn’t know what to do or where to go. You came to my rescue.”

Ostrander is now settled in his new home. His medical issues are being addressed and PSR continues to provide vital services to him so he can continue to live independently. Each month he still gets his monthly wellness call from Snoddy who has also worked with PSR to identify a volunteer in Amelia County who delivers groceries to him.

Snoddy as well as the other PSR volunteers know they are making a difference.

Norsk Titanium delivered new Boeing 787 Dreamliner components to Leonardo’s Grottaglie Plant based in South Italy and part of Leonardo’s Aerostructures Division. Norsk is a Norwegian-American firm providing additive manufacturing of aerospace-grade titanium components (using proprietary RPD technology).

This delivery adds a third production customer to Norsk’s growing commercial aerostructures customer base and represents Norsk’s first recurring production order from a European Union based Aerospace company.

“We are pleased to be Leonardo’s supplier” said Karl Fossum director of customer programs for Norsk. “This delivery marks a significant increase in the number of additively manufactured parts previously manufactured from titanium plate. It also is an important step towards our mission to provide an alternative to titanium forgings in aerospace applications.”

Using Norsk’s Rapid Plasma Deposition (RPD) process Norsk engineers designed Ti-6Al-4V preforms that reduced raw material needs by over 40 percent. Leveraging the RPD industrial process enabled Norsk to create a near-net-shape design while maintaining the stringent process control and material properties needed for structural applications in Boeing aircraft.

In 2018 Norsk Titanium has initiated qualification for additively manufactured titanium structural components for the Boeing 787 aircraft through an ongoing partnership with Spirit AeroSystems. The qualification process validated Norsk Titanium’s production and industrialization processes while integrating Spirit’s workscope of machining additively manufactured near-net shape components. The qualification sought to verify the aircraft parts’ material properties and overall conformity to requirements.

Leonardo does not share many details of its AM operations with the public however 3dpbm is aware of the company’s intensive testing on the industrialization of metal 3D printed parts within its helicopter production lines. At the Grottaglie site Leonardo’s Aerostructures Division has also been testing filament extrusion additive technology in the production process for composite aerospace materials.

In this case polymer 3D printing technology was implemented internally to replace traditional metallic molds with polymer-based elements (nylon carbon fiber and PEEK carbon fiber reinforced composites) reducing the cost and time factors involved in the test process and offering an increase in design flexibility. Leonardo was able to remove any porosity and surface wrinkles typically associated with items printed using fused filament fabrication technology – an essential factor also for maintaining a vacuum during the ‘curing’ stage of the process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAxL2FsYXNrYS1haXJsaW5lcy10by1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtaW4tbWFyY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alaska Airlines to Introduce Boeing 737 MAX in March,"[ Airlines ] By Winston Shek

Amid the recent ungrounding of the Boeing 737 MAX many airlines have begun filing plans to integrate the Boeing 737 MAX into service. Recently Alaska Airlines has filed new plans to integrate its MAX fleet into service starting in March 2021.

Alaska’s Boeing 737 MAX Routes

Note that these filings are tentative and could be subject to change:

On March 1 2020 Alaska Airlines will fly the Boeing 737 MAX on three main routes: Seattle Washington to Los Angeles California; Seattle Washington to San Diego California; and Portland Oregon to Los Angeles California.

The inaugural flight on the Boeing 737 MAX is tentatively scheduled as Alaska Airlines Flight 1041 from Seattle to Los Angeles with a 7:15 A.M. departure and a 10 A.M. arrival. The second flight of the day for the Boeing 737 MAX will be from Seattle to San Diego with an 8 A.M. departure and a 10:45 A.M. arrival. Below is a schedule of the routes the MAX will be operating on the first day:

Flight Number Origin Destination Departure Time Arrival Time AS1041 Seattle WA Los Angeles CA 7:15 A.M. 10 A.M. AS1413 Los Angeles CA Portland OR 10:45 A.M. 1:14 P.M. AS1391 Portland OR Los Angeles CA 2:10 P.M. 4:34 P.M. AS1055 Los Angeles CA Seattle WA 5:40 P.M. 8:26 P.M. AS398 Seattle WA Los Angeles CA 3:55 P.M. 6:36 P.M. AS705 Los Angeles CA Seattle WA 7:45 P.M. 10:29 P.M. AS482 Seattle WA San Diego CA 8 A.M. 10:45 A.M. AS539 San Diego CA Seattle WA 11:45 A.M. 2:40 P.M.

In several months Alaska Airlines expects itself to integrate the Boeing 737MAX on flights to the East Coast. Additionally Alaska Airlines plans to fly the Boeing 737 MAX on flights to Hawaii via the usage of ETOPS.

Currently Alaska Airlines plans to offer 178 seats on its Boeing 737 MAX 9 with 16 First Class seats 24 Premium Economy Class seats and 138 Economy Class seats.

Integrating the 737 MAX Into its Fleet

Alaska Airlines will receive its first 737 MAX in January 2021. When doing so the Seattle-based carrier plans to fly the aircraft more than 50 hours and 19000 miles on “proving flights.” These flights will take place all over the United States including the cold airports of Alaska and the warm airports of Hawaii with FAA representatives on board to evaluate the safety of the aircraft. Also these flights will allow pilots to validate the operational performance of the 737 MAX and its’ “required navigation performance.”

Alaska Airlines pilots will engage in eight hours of MAX-specific training before piloting the aircraft. Also they will face two hours of training in Alaska’s 737MAX simulator. Meanwhile Alaska Airlines maintenance technicians will undergo a minimum of 40 hours of training.

Alaska Airlines operates A320s and Boeing 737s with 68 Boeing 737 MAX 9’s on the way. Recently the airline ordered 23 Boeing 737 MAX 9’s and traded 10 A320’s for 10 Boeing 737 MAX 9’s. The carrier has options for 52 more MAX jets.

In exchange for the influx of Boeing 737 MAX jets Alaska Airlines will phase out its Airbus fleet. By the summer of 2023 the airline will have eliminated its A319 and A320 fleets citing high short-term lease costs as the main reason for the fleet simplification. However the carrier’s A321neo fleet will remain.

Alaska Airlines is following other North American carriers like American Airlines and United Airlines in reinstating Boeing 737 MAX service. Recently American Airlines restarted Boeing 737 MAX flights with an inaugural flight from Miami to New York. United Airlines will relaunch service in February from its hubs in Houston and Denver.

China’s C919 commercial jet aspirations are overblown and no threat to Boeing or Airbus Washington think tank finds

China’s C919 commercial jet aspirations are overblown and no threat to Boeing or Airbus Washington think tank finds

According to a report published in December 2020 by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington-based think tank American companies make up almost three-fifths of the C919’s primary suppliers.

However most of the parts are imported from foreign manufacturers including the engine avionics control systems communications and landing gear.

The Chinese government formed Comac in 2008 to design and build the single-aisle C919.

The C919 is a narrow-body jet being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) a state-owned company based in Shanghai to compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320.

Among the foreign suppliers the US’ General Electric and France’s Safran provide the engine; American firm Honeywell makes the flight-control system; and US-based Rockwell Collins produces the communication and navigation systems.

General Electric also formed a joint venture with the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) in 2012 to focus on avionics development for the C919.

Why is the C919 important to China?

China is among the world’s fastest-growing civil-aviation markets and the C919 is the nation’s ambitious attempt to manufacture its first commercial jetliner to meet its own rising demand.

The success of the project would be economically beneficial for China as it could break the country’s dependence on the duopoly currently enjoyed by Boeing and Airbus and has the potential to catapult Comac into the multibillion-dollar aviation industry.

The C919’s development also coincides with China’s objective of cutting its reliance on foreign technology and increasing investment to achieve indigenous innovation.

The plane’s development was an integral element of the “Made in China 2025” plan a road map from 2018 that Beijing hoped would help lift its hi-tech industries to international levels.

Made in China 2025 has since been officially downplayed by Beijing due to pressure from its key trading partners including the US and the European Union but China is still aiming to increase its reliance on domestic production for key components including computer chips and controlling systems.

The C919 was also mentioned by President Xi Jinping in his report at the 19th National Congress in 2017 along with the nation’s other scientific achievements as drivers of China’s “new model of development”.

How does the US-China relationship impact the development of the C919?

While China has been among the biggest buyers of US aviation products its state-driven investment in aviation which has included buying US aerospace companies has set off alarm bells in Washington.

Beijing’s national strategy of “military-civil fusion” a policy that aims to use civil technology to strengthen its military capacity and development is also a concern for the US.

commissioned a report to look into how the Chinese government was growing its aviation manufacturing business and the resulting military implications. In 2017 the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission – which advises the US Congress –

According to a report published in December 2020 by a Washington-based think tank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) American companies make up almost three-fifths of the C919’s primary suppliers. Photo: Twitter

The report compiled by the Rand Corporation found that China’s total investment in US aerospace companies over the past decade was relatively small and involved low-end technology.

There were some concerns over technology transfers through joint ventures connected with the C919 project but the report also cited experts saying that the risk was low because of US export-control restrictions.

Aerospace products are valuable exports for the US economy and integral to its national security. Many aviation products fall under US export-controls restrictions including the CFM International LEAP or Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion engine produced in a joint venture between General Electric and Safran that is used on the C919.

00:52 China Russia unveil model of joint venture passenger plane at Zhuhai Airshow China Russia unveil model of joint venture passenger plane at Zhuhai Airshow

China’s investment in US aviation companies is also subject to review and approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is an inter-agency group of the US government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in US companies or operations.

But as relations between Beijing and Washington have soured the US government has tightened its regulations over the sales of aviation products to China potentially adding hurdles to the development of the C919.

In December 2020 the US Department of Commerce released a list of “military end users”  covering aerospace companies from China and Russia that had military ties meaning they will be restricted from buying a wide range of US components and technology.

While Comac is not on the list seven entities related to AVIC which holds a minority share of Comac were included.

On January 14 2021 the US Department of Defence added nine Chinese companies including Comac to its list of ""Communist Chinese military companies"".

Under an earlier executive order signed last year by then president Donald Trump American investors were prohibited from certain transactions in securities related to certain listed companies. Comac is not a publicly traded company but it has sold bonds in the Chinese securities market.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it is “determined to highlight and counter the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Military-Civil Fusion development strategy which supports the modernisation goals of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies universities and research programs that appear to be civilian entities”.

Earlier in 2020 the US government was weighing whether to deny General Electric’s request to provide the LEAP engines for the C919. It eventually approved the licence for the jet-engine sales after President Donald Trump said the US should not prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China.

What is the outlook for the C919?

The C919 made its maiden test flight in 2017 but has yet to be certified.

Its chief designer Wu Guanghui told Chinese media in November 2020 that the narrow-body jetliner was aiming to receive a type certification by the end of 2021 after the airline regulator the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) authorised the C919 to begin the testing process.

The C919 began undergoing cold-weather test flights in December 2020 in the far northern city of Hulunbuir Inner Mongolia. The plane was also reportedly being tested in other parts of China and mainland media outlets have reported that deliveries of the jet will begin in late 2021 as scheduled.

Comac said airlines and aircraft-leasing firms have placed orders for 1065 C919s with the vast majority of demand coming from Chinese carriers.

Comac has consistently over-promised on its ability to get through each of these stages and hence it is not worth speculating how many more years remain before the first paying customers find their seat for a regular commercial flight Scott Kennedy

However some analysts believe it will take some time before the C919 receives certification from the CAAC and even longer to receive certification by US and European aviation regulators before China is able to sell the C919 in these large foreign markets.

“Comac has consistently over-promised on its ability to get through each of these stages and hence it is not worth speculating how many more years remain before the first paying customers find their seat for a regular commercial flight” said Scott Kennedy a senior CSIS adviser who is responsible for research into Comac.

Kennedy estimated in December 2020 that Comac had already received between US$49 billion and US$72.1 billion from the Chinese government for the C919.

And it appears unlikely that China will stop channelling state money into the C919.

In 2016 Beijing set up the Aero Engine Corporation of China to build an indigenous engine for the C919 the CJ-1000AX in the hope that it could eventually replace the LEAP engine produced by General Electric and Safran.

Under Xi’s so-called dual-circulation strategy which focuses on home-grown innovation to counter external hostility China is accelerating its technology development and investment.

Liu Daxiang deputy director of the science and technology committee at AVIC said in December 2020 that producing a jet engine was an urgent political task but conceded that its production would take a long time because China lacks research experience and data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXR0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWNhcmdvLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLXRocmVlLW5ldy1ib2VpbmctNzc3LWZyZWlnaHRlcnMtYWlyLWNhcmdv0gFzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdHRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWNhcmdvLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLXRocmVlLW5ldy1ib2VpbmctNzc3LWZyZWlnaHRlcnMtYWlyLWNhcmdvLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatar Airways Cargo takes delivery of three new Boeing 777 freighters,"Qatar Airways Cargo took delivery of three brand new Boeing 777 freighters on January 1 bringing its total freighter fleet count to 30 freighters consisting of two Boeing 747 freighters 24 Boeing 777 Freighters and four Airbus A330 freighters. It will introduce these freighters on its long haul scheduled routes and will also operate them as cargo charters supporting global trade and the movement of time and temperature sensitive goods.

Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar Al Baker said “With the arrival of these new freighters we are injecting much needed capacity in the market helping support global supply chains at a critical time during the pandemic. The added capacity will enable us to support the logistics around the Covid-19 vaccination which is projected to be one of the greatest logistical challenges for the industry. The 777F’s fuel-efficiency long range and high capacity will support our airline to be more sustainable and operate additional non-stop flights to further destinations around the world facilitating the movement of time and temperature sensitive goods. With our investments in innovation and fleet we are able to fulfil our customers’ logistical requirements and support the continuity of global trade.”

The Boeing Company senior vice president Commercial Sales and Marketing Ihssane Mounir said “During these challenging times Qatar Airways Cargo has been transporting humanitarian relief and medical goods to those in need and we are proud that their growing fleet of 777 freighters is supporting such a commendable effort. We deeply appreciate our long-standing partnership with Qatar Airways and their confidence in the 777 freighters as the backbone of their expansive global air cargo operations.”

The Boeing 777 freighter is an efficient long-range and high-capacity freighter powered by the world’s most powerful commercial jet engine the General Electric GE90-110B1. The 777F has a revenue payload capability of more than 102 tonnes. It can fly 4970 nautical miles (9200 kilometers) and carry a full payload of 224900 lbs (102010 kilos) at general cargo market densities (more than 10 pounds per cubic foot) making it the world’s longest-range twin-engine freighter.

Throughout the Covid-19 crisis Qatar Airways Cargo has been helping transport essential supplies pharmaceuticals perishables and other vital cargo around the world through belly-hold cargo on passenger flights and freighters. It continued to operate its scheduled freighters while also operating more than 500 freight charters of relief goods personal protective equipment and medical aid to impacted countries demonstrating its agility and resilience.

The cargo carrier has also worked closely with governments and NGOs to transport over 250000 tonnes of medical and aid supplies to impacted regions around the world on both scheduled and charter services. This equates to roughly 2500 fully loaded Boeing 777 freighters. In addition it has also converted six of its Boeing 777-300ER (Extended Range) aircraft to operate cargo-only flights introducing an additional 137 cubic metres of cargo volume per flight over the lower deck cargo capacity of 156 cubic metres per flight."

Charters were issued for the first time in 2016. However in order to receive a charter a team had to run full time in 2013 2014 and 2015. The Wood Brothers didn’t qualify for that.

In 2016 the team signed Ryan Blaney and re-entered as a full-time NASCAR Cup Series organization despite the lack of a charter.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The property is on the westbound side of Route 9 after Price Chopper and South Street. It primarily consists of woods.

“We’re looking forward to working with the new owner and to understanding what they will put on the property” Shrewsbury Assistant Town Manager Kristen Las said. Prior to the purchase Las said the pieces of land had been on the market for a while and she said she was looking forward to welcoming Boch to Shrewsbury

Boch Shrewsbury — Worcester is managed by Ernest A. Boch Jr. and Robert C. Weiss of 111 Morse St. Norwood according to the Massachusetts secretary of state's office. The Morse Street address is the location of Subaru of New England.

The entity runs multiple car dealerships around New England including Toyota Honda Hyundai Chevrolet and Nissan.

Beth Casavant chairman of the Shrewsbury Board of Selectmen said the town welcomes the opportunity to see its economic base develop.

“We’re always looking to increase our economic development base” Casavant said “We have a small area of land available for economic development so every parcel of land is extremely important for developing our community.”

Since the purchase was a private deal between Boch and the property owners Casavant said that the town was not aware of the deal before it was made. Any development plans for a potential dealership would need to go to the town for evaluation before Boch could build one on the property.

Casavant said that she expects Boch to be a good neighbor in the town. Route 9 is a key commercial area for the town and one where the town is hoping to attract new business Casavant said.

Karen J. Chapman president & CEO of Corridor Nine Area Chamber of Commerce said news of continued development in her region is welcome after a particularly difficult year for businesses. New development brings along hopes of businesses coming to the region and creating jobs Chapman said.

""Continued development is really helping in a tough year"" she said ""The light at the end of 2020 is seeing these new developments.""

Chapman pointed to plans to develop the former Edgemere Drive-In on Route 20 in Shrewsbury into supermarket and apartment properties and the Boch purchase as examples of promising development in her region.

News of the purchase was also welcomed by Timothy Murray president and CEO of the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce. He said the good economic news for Shrewsbury will also be felt in Worcester.

“Anytime there’s new investment in the region that’s a positive” Murray said “This acquisition underscores continued interest in Central Mass.”

Lilly Attell Realty Trust sold the 25.3 acres at 701 Boston Turnpike. The property includes a 1600-square-foot single-family home. The latest town records assessed the property at $710700.

Tim and Eileen Samara sold a half-acre adjoining site at 713 Boston Turnpike. The property includes a 1100-square-foot single family home and it was assessed at $280600 according to town records.

Colonies try to prevent these invasions by stationing guard bees outside the hive to monitor the thousands of bees entering and exiting the hive. Guard bees use the smell of other bees’ cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) compounds that form a waxy water-resistant...

As summer fades to fall flowers wilt and forager honeybees scouring for nectar may find their sweet snack to be scarce. Typically foragers continue to search around for some last drops of nectar before winter but if a ravenous colony is desperate enough it may resolve to a more dire tactic—to storm a foreign beehive and rob it of its honey.

Cassie Vernier a former doctoral student at Washington University in St. Louis has been searching in honeybees’ microbiota for answers to the puzzle of the insects’ recognition abilities. “The genome of an individual isn’t only made up genes found within that organism’s genomes but also the genomes of all the microorganisms that live in that organism” she says.

To test if bees’ microbiota can influence CHC composition Vernier and her Washington University colleagues conducted cross-hive fostering experiments where young bees were raised either in their own colonies or in foreign colonies. The team sequenced gut samples and analyzed CHC extracts in both groups finding that both a bee’s birth hive and the hive in which it grew up influences the insect’s gut microbiome which in turn influenced CHC composition. Of the 14 bacteria that significantly differed in abundance and strain-level variation depending on where a bee had been raised six were similar among bees that grew up in the same hive regardless of genetic relatedness.

The researchers also fed various concoctions of microbes to a separate set of newly hatched bees and found that those bees also developed different microbial communities which in turn led to different CHC profiles. Bees inoculated with a bacterium commonly found in the bee gut accepted other bees inoculated with the same bacterium but rejected—by biting stinging or dragging—bees inoculated with a bacterium typically found on trees regardless of how genetically related those bees were. “This is the first case where the microbiome is showed to play a role in the basic social biology of the insect rather than health-related aspects” Vernier says. “In this case it seems to be driving a basic social behavior that helps the colony survive.”

University of Texas at Austin biologist Nancy Moran who was not involved in Vernier’s study and has helped pioneer research on bees’ microbiota says she thinks the new study is “very convincing” adding that it points to yet another important role the microbiome plays in honeybees. Moran says that changes to the microbiome are also likely to be a relevant factor in colony declines noting that the pesticides that beekeepers use to kill mites in their colonies and weed killers such as glyphosate can obliterate bees’ microbial communities and make the insects vulnerable to infection. Historically “it wasn’t recognized that [those bees] don’t just drop dead right in front of you but they become more susceptible to some opportunistic pathogen” she says.

Strikingly Moran’s lab has found that there are many consistencies in the gut microbiomes of honeybees around the world and that there have been for some 80 million years. “Every worker bee anywhere in the world has the same set of bacteria” in terms of microbial taxa she explains even though as Vernier’s study shows strain-level variation within this microbial community is critical for nestmate recognition.

Indiana University Bloomington microbiologist Irene Newton who was not involved in Vernier’s study has also discovered novel roles for the microbiome in bees’ metabolism behavior and health. She was astounded by previous research that showed that honeybees can detect when their queen bee has been inseminated—and distinguish between high and low volumes of semen—based on her smell and may alter their behavior toward her as a result. Newton wanted to learn more about queen biology and has since found that one bacterium—Bombella apis—is particularly abundant in queen microbiomes though worker bees and nectar stores also contain trace amounts. She says it’s the only microbe she has found that can grow in the “potently antimicrobial” environment of royal jelly which worker bees feed to the queen.

Newton’s lab posted a study on the preprint server bioRxiv last year showing that B. apis produces antifungal metabolites suggesting that the microbe helps prevent fungal pathogens from taking hold in bees. “The fact that bees bring pollen back to the colony and that we don’t see fungi as major parts of any components of the bee microbiome is striking” she says noting that bees can interact with thousands of flowers a day yet seem to be resilient against many fungal pathogens that infect plants.

Honeybees represent something of a Goldilocks principle for studies of microbiome functions in insects Newton adds. “They’re the sweet spot of not too complex and not too simple.” Other prominent animal models such as Drosophila melanogaster typically only have a couple types of bacteria and the makeup of the microbiome is much more susceptible to environmental influence because unlike bees flies don’t have a central colony where they can exchange bacteria with one another.

As for Vernier studying honeybee microbiomes has changed the way that she looks at bees she says. “Whenever I see a bee I immediately think about what’s inside of it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zY2llbnRpc3QuY29tL2NlbGluZS1mcmVyZS1jaGFzZXMtZHJhZ29ucy1hbmQta29hbGFzLXRvLWxlYXJuLWhvdy10aGV5LWFkYXB0LTY4MjE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celine Frere Chases Dragons and Koalas to Learn How They Adapt,"By the end of high school Frere sought to escape Switzerland. Its cold climate didn’t suit her and because she identified as a lesbian neither did its socially conservative culture. She set her sights on Australia where in 1999 she enrolled at the University of Queensland and turned her fascination with animals into a scientific pursuit....

Growing up in the lush countryside of Geneva Switzerland Celine Frere spent the bulk of her childhood outside “with nature in nature observing nature and admiring nature” she says. Her parents were dealing with their own problems—her mother struggled with mental illness and her father wasn’t around much—so Frere sought solace in the animals that roamed the rolling hills around her. “I was always fascinated by this inability to communicate [with animals] yet we can have such great connections with them” she tells The Scientist.

After three years of courses Frere researched humpback dolphins for her honors degree comparing individuals found off the coast of Australia with those found in Indonesian waters. Genetic tests analyzing mitochondrial DNA in samples taken from stranded dolphins or ones ensnared in fishing gear revealed that Australian humpback dolphins were in fact a distinct species.

RIANA GARDINER

Frere graduated with a bachelor of science in zoology in 2002 and continued her work with dolphins as a graduate student in evolutionary biology at the University of New South Wales. She joined the Shark Bay Dolphin Project which is one of the longest longitudinal studies in animals she says. She researched how the combination of social and genetic factors interact to influence dolphins’ fitness. Female calving success depends on both genetic inheritance and social bonds Frere and colleagues reported in PNAS in 2010. “Throughout my PhD studies I transitioned from being someone who admired and had a passion for animal conservation to being a real scientist where I fell in love with questions” she says.

In a 2010 PLOS ONE paper titled “Thar she blows! A novel method for DNA collection from cetacean blow” Frere and colleagues detailed a less-invasive way to retrieve dolphin DNA from exhalations through their blowholes instead of using darts that biopsy the cetaceans a method that led to the death of a dolphin in 2000.

“One of the reasons [Frere is] so much fun to work with is because she’s such a creative researcher. She thinks about big problems in a new way” says Georgetown University biologist Janet Mann the senior author of the PLOS ONE paper who praised Frere’s role in developing the new technique.

Although Frere enjoyed her work with dolphins she says she felt they were too difficult and expensive to study in order to learn about human influence on animal habitat. When she went on to a postdoc in 2009 at the University of Queensland she began working with koalas which were starting to see dramatic population declines at the time. She had noticed that governmental bodies and companies often relied on mathematical models to predict where there might be koala habitat so that it could be preserved but Frere was determined to find a better way to locate koala habitat in the field. She turned her attention toward using koala scat to provide definitive evidence for the presence of the animals—an approach that would become the foundation of her later work.

Following her postdoc Frere took a lecturer position at the University of Exeter in the UK before returning to Australia as a research fellow at the University of the Sunshine Coast. There she pioneered the method of using “detection dogs” to sniff out the koala scat helping researchers create detailed maps of koala habitation. Frere and colleagues demonstrated that Maya the dog they trained was 19 times more efficient than other scat survey methods and 153 percent more accurate.

Frere has since become an associate professor at the University of the Sunshine Coast and cofounded the organization Detection Dogs for Conservation which has trained three more dogs. One of the dogs Bear became famous for his role in tracking down and helping rescue koalas in habitats that were affected by the widespread Australian bushfires of 2019–2020 garnering the attention of celebrities like Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio.

As she continued her research Frere became interested in what allows some animal species such as rats to adapt well to human influence and urbanization while others such as koalas have not fared so well. To investigate she turned her attention to an extreme urban adaptor: the eastern water dragon a meter-long reptile that has taken refuge in the cityscapes of metropoles like Brisbane. “It’s almost like the dragons have become my teachers and koalas—we’ve become their caretakers.”

She’s found that city-dwelling dragons have different gut microbiota nesting temperatures and body sizes than their wild counterparts. “We are driving [some] species to go extinct and then you have this flip side of urban adapters—we might actually drive them to speciation” Frere says.

Over the last decade however Frere noticed that many city-dwelling dragons have developed a fungal disease leaving them with yellow lesions that can lead the animals to lose toes and often their lives. Frere and colleagues described the disease late last year in Scientific Reports. In 2020 she was also awarded an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship to investigate the role that dragon social behavior plays in the spread of the disease. “I’ve been working on these guys for 10 years and I’m now having to watch them die” Frere says. “It’s heartbreaking.”

Still she continues to chase her dragons. “I try to approach the challenge that we are facing from an optimistic point of view because it gives me energy to continue to fight every day and ultimately at the end of the day animals will remain once we’re gone” she says.",,,,,,

In March 2020 the agency had postponed routine site surveillance inspections resuming them four months later for “mission-critical inspections” (e.g. those required to approve potential COVID-19 therapies or vaccines critical drugs that are in short supply and novel drugs developed for serious conditions on fast-track approval) and issued guidance (1) on the subject.

Between March and October 2020 the agency conducted more than 200 such inspections Judith A. McMeekin associate commissioner for regulatory affairs with FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs told attendees at the Food and Drug Law Institute’s (FDLI’s) annual conference on October 6 2020 (2).

However based on FDA 483 inspection data for the fiscal year between Oct. 1 2019 and Sept. 30 2020 FDA conducted only 28 biologics plant inspections in 2020 compared with 116 the year before and 349 drug facility inspections vs. 779 in 2019 (34). The lower inspection numbers in 2020 also reflect five months before COVID-19 travel restrictions prevented the agency from conducting inspections.

In lieu of onsite inspections FDA is taking a number of different approaches including document review (permitted under section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act) before or in place of onsite inspections McMeekin said. The agency is also leveraging inspection reports from other global regulatory authorities under the Pharmaceutical Annex to the US/EU Mutual Recognition Agreement.

Data dump vs. communication

Well before the pandemic—in fact for decades now—FDA has emphasized the importance of drug developers communicating with reviewers and inspectors at the agency. “Clearly if one is a sponsor in need of a pre-approval or pre-license inspection being in regular contact with the people at FDA who will be making decisions on your application is key and should extend all the way up the chain of command if necessary” says Mark I. Schwartz director at the Washington D.C.-based law firm Hyman Phelps & McNamara P.C. Schwartz spent 13 years at FDA and left five years ago as deputy director of the agency’s Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality.

FDA’s new remote document review process has underscored the need for sponsor outreach and communication with the agency. Recent examples have shown what can happen when FDA reviews documents remotely without sufficient context. “The biggest mistake a company can make is throwing things over the wall to FDA. It’s up to the owners of the documentation to put it into context for the regulators requesting a meeting to discuss issues with them” says Peter Miller President/CEO of Dynamic Compliance Solutions (DCS) which offers a platform designed to help pharma companies handle remote audits.

In October for example Alkermes received a complete response letter (CRL) from FDA due to tablet coating issues with its new schizophrenia treatment ALKS 3831. Only after the company received the CRL did it discover that FDA was concerned about the tablet coating process that had been used to make development batches. The firm had reportedly resolved these issues for manufacturing-scale batches (5).

“In instances where FDA requests documents it is very important to suggest a call with FDA prior to sending the documents to at least give an overview of any nuances within the documents that exist” says Schwartz. Recalling working on the “other side” on inspections while at FDA he says “One is constantly seeking input from subject matter experts at the facility regarding arcane issues in the company’s records. That connection is completely lacking if the firm just dumps the documents on FDA and it can lead to misunderstandings with tragic consequences for the firm” he says.

So far FDA has been reluctant to approve use of technologies such as 360-degree video (6) to perform remote site tours and inspections. However regulators—including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Health Canada the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency and the Russian Ministry of Health—are all using some forms of remote technology for remote inspections (7).

FDA piloting use of video

McMeekin reported in October 2020 (2) that the agency had begun to pilot the use of new technologies such as live or recorded video in food-related investigations. “As we learn more from the pilot and decide how and when we might use these and other technologies we commit to having transparent dialogues with regulated industry as to how this may affect our procedures in the future” she said (2). However FDA remains cautious about their use in pharmaceutical inspections. “The agency is exploring all options for evaluating facilities when a physical inspection is not feasible [and] is assessing the potential use of other tools to serve as supplements to FDA inspections including remotely evaluating pharmaceutical manufacturing operations using remote live-streamed video and other remote and live interactions with facility operators and records” Charles Kohler press officer with FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) stated in a written response to Pharmaceutical Technology in December 2020.

Some question whether the agency is moving quickly enough to approve the use of supplemental technology for drug and biologics inspections. In the title of an op-ed that was published in December 2020 (8) Schwartz accused FDA of ‘fiddling while pharma burns.’ “It’s difficult to understand the agency’s position but it’s certainly not helpful” he says. Schwartz argues that FDA’s stance against using new technologies for remote inspections has left patients without access to potentially life-saving therapies in 2020. As an example he cites the agency’s failure to approve Bristol Myers Squibb’s (BMS) lymphoma treatment the chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy liso-cel. This approval delay the second so far for the drug happened in November 2020 when a local flare-up of COVID-19 in Texas prevented FDA investigators from traveling safely to BMS’s contract manufacturing partner’s (Lonza’s) facility for an on-site inspection. The postponement occurred even though liso-cel met FDA’s criteria of a ‘mission critical’ inspection in that the therapy had been granted breakthrough therapy and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designations he says.

Schwartz also notes that there is a “real need” for timely pre-approval and pre-license inspections (PAIs and PLIs). “Companies’ livelihoods—and in some cases their very survival—depend on it” he says. It’s also crucial that FDA find a solution for non-mission-critical inspections he says since only a tiny fraction of the inspections that need to be performed have been deemed mission critical by FDA. “While the agency has been performing some record reviews FDA is unwilling to overturn a facility’s Official Action Indicated (OAI) status based on a record review so even if a firm’s records demonstrate full CGMP [current good manufacturing practice] compliance it won’t overturn a previous problematic finding. FDA has also been ambiguous as to whether foreign regulatory reports can overturn a previous problematic FDA finding” he says leaving pharmaceutical firms with few good options.",,,,,,,,,

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vbmV3cy82MDk1MjYvYnJvd24tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20tcHJvdGVzdHMtZW5jYW1wbWVudC_SAVhodHRwczovL2ZvcndhcmQuY29tL25ld3MvNjA5NTI2L2Jyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLXByb3Rlc3RzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Everyone gets to be uncomfortable’: How Jewish students at Brown kept antisemitism at bay,"By Mira Fox May 3 2024

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9ob3ctc2Nob29scy1hdm9pZGVkLXBvbGljZS1jb2x1bWJpYS1lbmNhbXBtZW50cy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFbaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9ob3ctc2Nob29scy1hdm9pZGVkLXBvbGljZS1jb2x1bWJpYS1lbmNhbXBtZW50cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Columbia University’s encampment ended with a mass police operation. Here’s how some schools avoided that,"New York CNN —

After several days of protests pro-Palestinian encampments on the campuses of Ivy League schools Columbia and Brown came down last week.

But while the apparent end of Columbia’s pro-Palestinian encampments was marred by a takeover of a building a mass arrest and a widespread condemnation of the heavy police presence encampments came down voluntarily at Brown and other institutions like Northwestern University.

And other public universities like Rutgers University and the University of Minnesota also peacefully reached agreements with protesters.

Notably none of the schools agreed to fully divest from companies doing business in Israel a demand student protesters have commonly rallied for across the country. While there were people on both sides who criticized the agreements at Brown and Northwestern the deals nevertheless diffused a tense standoff that has boiled over at other colleges and universities across the country.

A delicate balance

College officials face a delicate balance between encouraging dialogue and allowing free expression while keeping their campus safe and running free speech experts told CNN. Some schools achieved it at least temporarily and prevented a situation in which a police presence to break up encampments led to violence and fear.

The schools where an administration “was willing to lay a little lower and treat the speech going on in their public spaces as not a catastrophe but something that might be dealt with through dialogue have done better” said Sophia Rosenfeld a professor of history who teaches a class on free speech at the University of Pennsylvania.

Rosenfeld said Brown provided a conversation — not a concession — and that was enough to dissipate the encampments.

Lena Shapiro director of the First Amendment clinic at the University of Illinois College of Law said when it comes to demonstrations colleges must take preventive measures to make sure everyone has a space to demonstrate.

“First and foremost the safety of all students is paramount” she said. Shapiro added schools can place reasonable restrictions on the time place and manner of the protests to keep order but at the same time should keep open channels of communication with protesters to try to find common ground.

Some school leaders set the tone early on. For example Northwestern President Michael Schill put out a statement expressing his horror at the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. In the same letter Schill who is Jewish made sure to distinguish between himself and his public role as a president. He also reaffirmed his commitment to the Chicago Principles which are a set of commitments to free speech many colleges have adopted.

“Just to be clear as individuals in a democracy we do not give up our rights to have and express our personal political and social viewpoints. We just need to make clear we are speaking for ourselves” Schill wrote.

What the schools agreed to do

On Monday Northwestern announced an agreement with protesters to end the encampment. The school agreed to more transparency over specific investment holdings and fully funding the cost of attendance for five Palestinian students.

Northwestern also allowed protesters on Deering Meadow a stretch of lawn on campus through the end of the quarter if there was only one tent.

Rutgers agreed to meet with student protesters to discuss divestment and to support scholarships for at least 10 displaced Gazan students. Rutgers along with Northwestern agreed to expand spaces for Arab and Muslim students on campus. Rutgers also said it would “revisit and follow up” its existing relationship with Birzeit University in the West Bank and consider a student exchange or study abroad program.

The University of Minnesota said it would allow protesters to present a case for divestment to its board. It also said it would “explore” an affiliation with a Palestinian university and it would make a “good faith effort” to disclose as much information about its holdings as possible as well as not pursue disciplinary action against protesters affiliated with the school.

Brown’s board agreed to hold a vote on divestment in the fall. Brown also said no student or faculty member involved in the protests would face retaliation though they emphasized they would investigate reports of bias harassment or discrimination. Rutgers made a similar commitment.

Inside Brown University

Brown which is located in Providence Rhode Island has not had a police-free campus in six months. Twenty students were arrested in November and 41 in December for trespassing during sit-ins at University Hall that demanded divestment from companies doing business with Israel according to the university’s student newspaper.

Calls for divestment have been ongoing for at least the past decade said Owen Dahlkamp an editor at the Brown Daily Herald.

Dahlkamp said students were uncomfortable with the police presence on campus and many were outraged at the arrests. Student activists are still advocating for charges to be dropped against those arrested in December. Brown dropped the charges against the 20 arrested in November.

But Brown took a different approach as encampments began popping up around the country. On the main lawn which serves as more of a public space than the inside of a hall the university reiterated that though the camps weren’t a legal violation they could violate student conduct policy.

“Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog debate and listening to each other. I cannot condone the encampment which was in violation of University policies” Brown President Christina Paxson said Tuesday in a statement announcing an agreement for five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University in May to present their divestment arguments.

Though some on social media argued Brown agreed to simply push off a divestment decision Dahlkamp said students he spoke to are satisfied with the agreement.

“It feels like a compromise but not a compromise which they feel negatively about” Dahlkamp said. “There are some students who in passing say they believe Brown was able to diffuse the situation but didn’t have to cede much. It will be interesting to see if (divestment) will pass.”

Dahlkamp called CNN from the main lawn where the encampment once stood. He described students lounging around studying and reading as the academic year ends.

Watching the images come out of Columbia as well as the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Texas at Austin Dahlkamp said the resolution is an important step.

“This is not the ultimate victory but still a victory” he said.

A road map for the future

The agreements are not a guarantee for a smooth road ahead. For example the Midwestern branch of the Anti-Defamation League called for Northwestern President Michael Schill to resign writing he “capitulated to hatred and bigotry.” Rep. Elise Stefanik a Republican from New York who has spearheaded congressional hearings on antisemitism called Northwestern students who demonstrated “self proclaimed terrorists” in a posting on X formerly known as Twitter.

Those critical of Northwestern on social media said the students who made the agreement did not advocate for strong enough commitments for divestment from the school.

But with rapidly moving events it can be difficult for schools to keep up said Lena Shapiro of the University of Illinois College of Law.

For example President Michael S. Roth at Wesleyan University said Tuesday the encampments could continue as long as the protest remained nonviolent and didn’t disrupt campus operations.

“There will be many on campus who cheer on the protesters and many who are offended or even frightened by their rallies and messages. But as long as we all reject violence we have opportunities to listen and to learn from one another” Roth said Tuesday in a statement.

But in a letter on Thursday he said the university would not tolerate the acts of vandalism that had taken place and would hold those responsible for the damage accountable. He reiterated the protesters are “bringing attention to the killing of innocent people.”

“We do not want to move in this direction unless necessary and much prefer to talk with protesters about things we can do as an institution to address the war in Gaza. Recent agreements at Brown University and Northwestern University might show the way” Roth wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Njb3Jlcy1zdGFydmluZy1icm93bi1wZWxpY2Fucy1mb3VuZC0yMzU1MDMyNzQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scores of starving brown pelicans found on Southern California beaches,"With the snowy San Gabriel Mountains in the background a brown pelican flies in search of fish at Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve in Huntington Beach. (Raul Roa / Los Angeles Times)

Scores of emaciated brown pelicans too weak to fly have been found on Southern California beaches in the last month and taken to an Orange County rescue center according to its director.

“We’re getting dozens of calls” Debbie McGuire executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach said on Saturday. “People are finding them in parking lots and their backyards.”

The rescued pelicans she said “are coming in at half their body weight. They are also very anemic.”

So far she said it’s unclear why the pelicans which feed on anchovies sardines and mackerel are suffering from malnutrition.

McGuire said that she contacted scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week who told her that there was “plenty of bait out there” for the birds to feed on.

“We don’t know the cause” she said. “They are just all starving.”

Overwhelmed by the number of ailing birds the wildlife center has been erecting pup tents to use as pens she said.

In the last month the center has taken in 89 brown pelicans many of them quickly dying McGuire said. More than 30 have survived she said as the center warmed them under heat lamps and gave them fluids.

She said the center sent tissue samples from the birds to labs for testing.

A similar spike in the stranding of brown pelicans up and down the California coast occurred in the spring of 2022. The cause has not been found.

The California brown pelican was listed as an endangered species decades ago after the spread of the chemical DDT caused the shells of their eggs to thin. The eggs became so fragile that nesting mothers crushed them.

After DDT was banned the pelicans increased in number. The birds were removed from the endangered species list in 2009.

Wildlife officials say that anyone finding an ailing pelican should not touch or try to feed them. They urge people to instead call their local wildlife rehabilitation facilities. The Orange County center can be reached at (714) 374-5587.

A billionaire donor to Brown University said he is pausing his giving — due to the Ivy League institution’s deal with pro-Palestinian protesters.

“The real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht’s scathing criticism of his alma mater is the most immediate blowback against the school’s deal to end protests on campus” reported The New York Times.

“One of Brown University’s major donors the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel calling it 'unconscionable' and saying he had 'paused' donations to the school” wrote the Times.

As GoLocal reported on April 30 ""The group had demanded that Brown divest the University’s investment from a group of defense industry corporations tied to Israel.

The Brown administration did not agree to the demands. Instead Brown President Christina Paxson’s administration committed that the Brown Corporation would consider such an action at its October meeting.”

Latest Protest Fallout

The Times writes ""Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on 'facts and moral clarity' as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.""

According to the Times Sternlicht said he had donated more than $20 million to Brown but would not give more for now.

“Dr. Paxson referred a request for comment to a spokesman for Brown who declined to comment directly instead sending a statement reading in part that 'there are few issues as contentious and deeply felt as those related to Israel'"" the Times reported.

“Mr. Sternlicht in his letter had pointed words for Dr. Paxson suggesting that she should be more critical of Hamas and willing to push out professors who engaged in hate speech” according to the Times. “As for the protesters formerly on the quadrangle Mr. Sternlicht wrote that students who ‘feel like Hamas is noble’ should leave Brown.”

GoLocal unveiled in November the details of the ties between Palestinian donors to Brown and the funding of a controversial professor.

The professor who those gifts supported is Beshara B Doumani the Mahmoud Darwish Professor of Palestinian Studies at Brown. He also simultaneously has served as the President of Birzeit University from 2021 to 2023 located in the Palestinian West Bank territory. His Brown University bio does not mention his role heading the Palestinian University but his Birzeit bio features his role at Brown.

When Doumani was named to the Presidency at Birzeit the American conservation publication the American Spectator wrote ""Palestine’s ‘Terrorist University’ Picks Ivy League Prof as New President."" Doumani is back teaching at Brown and has shared the stage speaking to students about the war along with Paxson.

“The blowback from Mr. Sternlicht who has described himself as a political independent and whose name is on a Brown residence hall shows how quickly the issue of divestment from Israel may vex universities. Until a week ago even discussing the subject was widely considered a nonstarter as it was sure to divide a large swath of students and faculty from many of the businesspeople whose donations fill university endowments” wrote the Times.

Posted on: January 2 2021 10:46h.

Last updated on: January 2 2021 03:47h.

Billionaire casino tycoons Sheldon Adelson and James Packer were spotted together during a New Year’s Eve bash in the French Caribbean. And that’s prompted speculation that Packer could be in discussions to sell his more than 36 percent stake in Crown Resorts to the Las Vegas Sands founder and CEO.

The UK’s Daily Telegraph broke the news that Adelson 87 and Packer 53 were celebrating the end of the most difficult year for their gaming businesses. The media outlet says Packer’s $200 million superyacht was docked next to Adelson’s $70 million Queen Miri. Tender boats were seen going back and forth from the yachts.

According to Forbes Adelson and Packer are respectively worth $36.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Adelson’s Sands owns casinos in Las Vegas Singapore and Macau. Packer’s Crown operates in his native Australia as well as Crown London Aspinalls.

Adelson Acquisition?

Packer’s Crown Resorts is amid an investigation in Sydney officials in New South Wales determining if the casino group is suitable to hold a gaming license in the Australian state. Crown Sydney a AUD$2.4 billion (USD$1.8 billion) integrated resort opened last week but with its casino on hold.

The New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) is set to issue its verdict on Crown’s suitability sometime this month. Lawyers assisting in the ILGA Inquiry suggested that Packer isn’t suitable to be a close associate of Crown Resorts.

Though Packer no longer sits on the Crown board nor has any executive role he maintains a 36.8 percent stake in the company. During his ILGA testimony Packer conceded that he would sell his position in the casino group if that would allow Crown Sydney to maintain its gaming license.

Adelson is bullish on casinos located outside the United States. Sands sold the company’s only US casino not in Las Vegas — Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania – in 2018 for $1.3 billion. It’s also been reported that Sands is looking to sell its Las Vegas Strip properties — The Venetian and Palazzo.

Adelson has at least for the moment called off his company’s interest in investing in Japan. Gaming analysts believe the casino tycoon prefers acquisitions more than new construction. A Crown purchase would fall in line with that thinking and give Adelson two casinos in Australia — Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth — and possibly a third with Crown Sydney.

Crown Affair

As it awaits the NSW Inquiry verdict Crown Resorts is doing all it can to help prop up its public image. The company which has been accused of failing to prevent its casinos from being used to launder money recently changed its deposit rules for gamblers.

Crown also announced in November that it would only work with VIP junket groups that are fully licensed in the jurisdiction where its casinos are located. Crown appointed its first financial crimes officer too.

Critics say Crown’s efforts come too late.

“Crown has acted with impunity and arrogance for years” opined Tim Costello a reverend and CEO of World Vision Australia a nonprofit that advocates for the poor. “Now they are desperate to prove that they are a fit and proper organization.”",,,,,,,,,

No. 1 Alabama Beats No. 4 Notre Dame 31-14 in Rose Bowl,"Alabama rolled into another College Football Playoff championship game.

DeVonta Smith caught three of fellow Heisman Trophy finalist Mac Jones' four touchdown passes Najee Harris ran for 125 yards with a high-hurdling highlight and top-ranked Alabama beat No. 4 Notre Dame 31-14 in the relocated Rose Bowl game Friday to reach its fifth CFP title game.

While the location for this Rose Bowl was truly untraditional the Crimson Tide (12-0 No. 1 CFP) playing for the national title is a common occurrence in seven seasons of the CFP.

Notre Dame (10-2 No. 4 CFP) in football's final four for only the second time has lost seven consecutive New Year's Six games since 2000.

Alabama led 14-0 after scoring the first two times it had the ball including an 97-yard drive on which Harris leaped over 6-foot cornerback Nick McCloud just after crossing the line of scrimmage landed on both feet and then sprinted for a 53-yard gain before getting run out of bounds. Jones threw a 12-yard TD pass to tight end Jahleel Billingsley on the next play.

That touchdown came between drives when Smith who has 16 touchdown catches in his last seven games turned short passes into scores of 26 and 34 yards. Smith finished with seven catches for 130 yards added a nifty toe-tapping 7-yarder in the front corner of the end zone right on the pylon in the middle of the third quarter.

Jones completed 25 of 30 passes for 297 yards.

The Crimson Tide earned a spot in the Jan. 11 championship game in Miami against No. 2 Clemson again or No. 3 Ohio State -- the Tigers and Buckeyes played in the other CFP semifinal at the Sugar Bowl on Friday night. Alabama missed the CFP last year for the only time since the four-time playoff debuted at the end of the 2014 season.

CFP officials moved the Rose Bowl about 1400 miles because of COVID-19 restrictions in California that would have kept family -- or any fans -- from attending the game at its normal home in Pasadena. There was a limited capacity crowd of 18373 at AT&T Stadium the home of the Dallas Cowboys just a bit higher than attendance for the Cotton Bowl game played there two days earlier when Oklahoma beat Florida 55-20.

It was another thud of a finish for the Fighting Irish winning all 10 regular-season games including a home victory over Clemson. But Notre Dame then lost 34-10 in the ACC title game to the Tigers.

Notre Dame lost 30-3 to Clemson in the CFP semifinal Cotton Bowl two years ago that was also played at the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. It was the first time the Irish had played Alabama since the Tide beat them 42-14 in the BCS national championship game eight seasons ago.

While the Alabama defense kept quarterback Ian Book scrambling the Tide offense was rolling from the outset. Book the winningest starting QB ever for the Irish at 30-5 completed 27 of 39 passes for 229 yards and only his third interception this season.

Alabama's opening seven-play 79-yard drive ended with Smith making his first catch in the left flat then sprinting past and through defenders along the sideline for a 26-yard score. After the second-longest scoring drive in Rose Bowl history when Billingsley scored Alabama drove 84 yards with Smith making a catch on a crossing route for the 34-yard score.

The closest Notre Dame got was 14-7 when Kyren Williams plunged in from a yard out on a fourth-down play early in the second quarter to cap a 15-play 75-yard drive that took just over eight minutes.

THE TAKEAWAY

Notre Dame: The Fighting Irish have gone 32 seasons since winning their last national title with a 12-0 record under Lou Holtz in 1988. The Irish were down only 21-7 when they got the ball for the first time in the second half. But any chance to get some momentum evaporated when Book threw an interception when under pressure and Alabama turned that into another TD catch for Smith.

Alabama: The outcome really wasn't unexpected with Alabama entering the game as a three-TD favorite. Alabama is 5-0 at AT&T Stadium with a pair of convincing CFP semifinal wins there. Alabama beat Michigan State 38-0 in the Cotton Bowl five seasons ago.

UP NEXT

Notre Dame goes into another offseason still trying to figure out how to close the gap. The Irish play their 2021 season opener Sept. 5 at Florida State.

A broad ban on single-use containers forks straws and other ubiquitous items takes effect in Mexico's capital one of the world's largest cities after more than a year of preparation.

On Friday Mexico City's environmental secretary said via Twitter that ""from today on Mexico City without single-use plastics."" The message urged people to think of always carrying reusable containers like never leaving home without their cell phones.

Mexico City lawmakers passed the ban on plastic bags utensils and other disposable plastic items in 2019. The city of 9 million people has spent the past year adjusting or in some cases ignoring the impending law change. The ban on plastic bags took effect last year.

Light allegedly biodegradable bags have become more common at the city's street food stalls. Plastic straws are offered less often. Fresh tortillas are handed over wrapped in paper or cloths that buyers bring with them.

But without the imposition of fines the change will likely be slow in coming.

On Friday morning a woman selling tamales under a large umbrella at the corner of a busy Mexico City avenue slid two into a plastic bag and offered two small colorful plastic spoons from a cup filled with them. Asked if she was aware of the ban taking effect she said she was ""but with the coronavirus they (authorities) forgot about it.""

Mexico City is currently under red alert as its hospitals' COVID-19 beds hover near capacity.

The woman who declined to give her name because she didn't want to be singled out for enforcement said it wasn't just her. She said vendors and market stalls were still using plastic all over the city.

She asked how she was supposed to give customers steaming hot tamales without a plastic bag.

The ban also covers disposable plastic cups plastic stirrers single-use coffee capsules and balloons among other items.

In 2019 Mexico City produced about 13000 tons of garbage per day according to the capital's environmental agency.

There is a ton of vocabulary and jargon in the frequent flyer world which can be quite intimidating. You’ll pick up more of the terms as you go along but at the beginning it’s important to distinguish between a few different types of miles and points.

Airline Miles / Hotel Points

Fixed-Value Points

Flexible / Transferable Points

Airline Miles and Hotel Points

Most of us are familiar with at least the concept of airline miles and hotel points – those are essentially a rebate offered by a specific brand in exchange for loyalty to their company. Those companies set the earnings rates redemption values and all the other terms and conditions.

Not only are there airline miles to consider but you likely have (or have heard of) rewards points with a bank or credit card as well. These typically come in two varieties: fixed-value and transferable.

What are Fixed Value Points?

As the name might suggest fixed-value points can be redeemed towards a specific dollar amount of travel. The amounts vary by program but you’ll typically receive 1¢-2¢ per point towards travel.

These include (but are certainly not limited to):

Citi ThankYou points (with some exceptions)

Bank of America Worldpoints

US Bank FlexPerks Rewards

USAA Rewards

Wells Fargo Rewards

Capital One No Hassle Rewards (these are somewhat different than Capital One Miles)

Barclaycard Arrival Miles

Some programs require you to redeem through the bank portal while others will issue a statement credit.

In general however you are redeeming fixed-value points for tickets that could otherwise be purchased with cash.

So if a given airline ticket was selling for $100 and you had a fixed-value currency that gave you 1¢ per point towards travel you would need 10000 points for that ticket.

That’s why these programs advertise as having “no blackout dates” or having the ability to “choose any airline” – your bank is essentially purchasing retail airfare for you in exchange for points you’ve accumulated with their program. Because these tickets are typically revenue fares you will typically earn miles when you fly on a ticket procured with a fixed-value currency!

So why even bother with miles? Fixed-value points sound great!

Fixed-value points are fantastic if you want to travel on domestic economy tickets! Domestic tickets (especially in the US) can be surprisingly difficult to redeem airline miles for so fixed-value currencies are a great alternative.

However if you’re looking at traveling internationally particularly in premium cabins fixed-value points just won’t get you very far. An international business class ticket might require 110000 airline miles but since the retail price is likely upwards of $5000 you’d need over 500000 Bank of America points for example. And that’s a cheap premium cabin ticket. Some first class tickets would cost as much as a new car if paying cash.

So what are the other options?

What are Flexible / Transferable Points?

One of the major perks to bank points as opposed to airline miles is that as a consumer you’re insulated from dramatic changes or unannounced devaluations from a particular airline. So for many people it makes sense to focus on a flexible points currency with transferable rewards.

These programs typically allow you to transfer points directly to their airline or hotel partners. This gives you lots of options when it’s time to redeem your airline miles as you have the opportunity to search for award availability across alliances prior to committing to a certain mileage currency.

Credit Card Transfer Partners

One of the reasons I consistently recommend flexible point currencies is the versatility you have when transferring your points. The same significant balance of credit card points can be transferred to a variety of airlines or hotel partners therefore making them incredibly valuable when used strategically.

Each transferable currency has its strong (and weak) partners so it’s important to think about where you want your points to take you before stockpiling any specific one. The main flexible points currencies are American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards Capital One Mileage Transfer Citi ThankYou and Marriott Bonvoy.

American Express Membership Rewards Transfer Partners

No matter where you want to go in the world there are great ways to redeem Amex rewards points:

Airlines Hotels Aer Lingus Aer Club Choice Privileges Aeroméxico Club Premier Hilton Honors Air Canada Aeroplan Marriott Bonvoy Air France/KLM Flying Blue Alitalia MilleMiglia ANA Mileage Club Avianca LifeMiles British Airways Executive Club Cathay Pacific Asia Miles Delta SkyMiles Emirates Skywards Etihad Guest Hawaiian Airlines HawaiianMiles Iberia Plus JetBlue TrueBlue Qantas Frequent Flyer Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Capital One Mileage Transfer Partners

Capital One’s miles-earning cards can now transfer directly to partners. These include miles earned on the following cards:

And you have over a dozen loyalty programs to choose from:

Premier Citi ThankYou Transfer Partners

Holders of the Citi Premier® Card Citi Prestige Card and Citi Chairman Card are also able to transfer their ThankYou Points to airline partners.

Brex Transfer Partners

Brex is a cool product that offers a streamlined and innovative solution for startups and tech companies. Their rewards can be transferred to the following partners:

Airlines Hotels Aeromexico Club Premier N/A though various hotels are bookable through the rewards portal. Air France/KLM Flying Blue Avianca Lifemiles Cathay Pacific Asia Miles Emirates Skywards JetBlue TrueBlue Qantas Frequent Flyer Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer

Marriott Bonvoy Transfer Partners

Earning Marriott points isn’t as easy or lucrative as it used to be though they do have more transfer partners than any other program:

It is worth noting that while most bank transfers are rather quick (and instant in many cases) Marriott transfers can take a few weeks depending on the program you’re transferring to.

So which miles or points should I be collecting?

Well that depends a great deal on your travel goals! There is always a bit of a balance between accruing the most points or the most valuable points and the only way to determine the best route for you is to know where and how you want to travel."

Now it's being scrapped.,"Another icon of the early days of cruising has been sent to the scrappers.

Ocean Dream which originally sailed as Carnival Cruise Line's Tropicale arrived at the scrapyards of Alang India on Friday after being idle for nearly a year due to the coronavirus crisis.

Unveiled in 1982 the 1422-passenger ship was the first cruise vessel purpose-built for Carnival and it played a significant role in the line's early growth.

Ordered just eight years after Carnival's founding in 1972 the 10-deck-high ship was larger than the line's three existing vessels at the time -- Mardi Gras Carnivale and Festivale. It also was the first true cruise ship at the line.

Carnival had bought its first three vessels on the second-hand market and all were traditional ocean liners that the line had converted for use as cruise ships.

The addition of a purpose-built cruise ship to the Carnival fleet was thus a major milestone in the line's development. In part due to the success of the ship and three more bigger vessels based on the same design that came later Carnival grew rapidly and soon was able to begin buying up its rivals to become the world's biggest cruise company.

Now known as Carnival Corp. the company today operates nearly 90 cruise ships under not just the Carnival brand but eight other cruise brands including Princess Cruises Holland America Seabourn and Costa Cruises.

Built by Danish shipbuilder Aalborg Verft Tropicale initially sailed from Miami to the Caribbean. But the vessel would go on to play an important role in launching Carnival cruises to other destinations such as Alaska and Mexico. Tropicale was the first Carnival ship to be based in San Juan Puerto Rico New Orleans and Tampa.

Tropicale was notably also the very first Carnival ship to boast one of the line's signature ""whale tail"" winged funnels -- a now-iconic design flourish dreamed up by the noted ship designer Joe Farcus. All Carnival ships since Tropicale have had one.

Tropicale left the Carnival fleet in 2000 transferring to sister line Costa Cruises. It sailed for Costa through 2005 as the Costa Tropicale before being transferred to another sister line P&O Cruises Australia to sail under the name Pacific Star. In 2008 the ship was transferred yet again to Spanish line Pullmantur. It was there that it took on the name Ocean Dream.

A few years after that the ship was sold to Peace Boat a Japan-based non-governmental organization that runs educational voyages as part of its mission of working toward peace human rights environmental protection and sustainable development.

Peace Boat has purchased a former Princess Cruises ship to take Ocean Dream's place.

Tropicale is the oldest former Carnival ship still in existence. Once it is scrapped the oldest former Carnival ship to still be in existence will be the 1987-built Celebration which now sails for Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line as the Grand Celebration.

The scrapping of Tropicale comes just just six months after one of the most iconic ships from the early Royal Caribbean fleet Sovereign of the Seas was sent to the scrappers.

The ships are among a growing list of cruise vessels that have been sent to the scrappers in the past 10 months as the cruise industry experiences an unprecedented shutdown.

What happened

Shares of Carnival (CCL -0.14%) (CUK 0.30%) fell 57% last year according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence as the coronavirus took a heavy toll on the cruise industry.

So what

After a series of COVID-19 outbreaks occurred on multiple cruise ships the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued no-sail orders that forced Carnival and other cruise operators to cancel their U.S. voyages. With their ships stuck at port and little revenue coming in the major cruise lines quickly began bleeding cash.

By the second half of 2020 Carnival's cash burn rate had reached approximately $650 million per month. To stay afloat Carnival was forced to raise billions in cash via stock sales and high-interest-rate debt diluting shareholders and increasing its interest costs in the process.

Now what

With health officials in the U.S. and international markets beginning to rescind their no-sail orders Carnival is slowly resuming operations. Promising vaccines developed by the likes of Moderna and Pfizer could accelerate this process if they can help to reduce COVID-19 infection rates and bring about the end of the pandemic. Carnival's stock price in turn could rebound in 2021.

Still risks remain. Higher interest expenses and safety-related costs will make it more difficult for Carnival to achieve its pre-pandemic profit margins. And with more shares outstanding after its stock offerings investors may find is per-share profits less attractive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2xhdGVzdC1waG90b3Mtb2YtY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLXNoaXAtdGhhdHMtYmVpbmctdHJhbnNmb3JtZWQvNDUxNTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest Photos of Carnival Cruise Ship That's Being Transformed,"While the focus has very much been on what Carnival Cruise Line is doing to resume cruises there is one ship that’s about to go through a massive transformation. Things are gradually starting to happen with the Carnival Victory and we’ve got some exclusive photos to show you.

Work Begins on Carnival Victory

Carnival Victory is currently in a rusty state at the Navantia shipyard in Cadiz Spain. However she won’t remain this way for much longer as she’s going through a major multi-million dollar transformation into the Carnival Radiance.

Cruise Hive has the very latest photos of the vessel as work seems to be commencing. It’s mainly early preparations but the interior could be a different story. Cruise Hive has been given special permission from Barcos Por Cadiz to use these very latest photos of the Carnival Victory:

The Carnival cruise ship was originally scheduled to begin a 38-day upgrade starting on March 19 2020. The ship departed on her final journey across the Atlantic in early March 2020 but what came next no one could have predicted.

The cruise line suspensions and the global pandemic have delayed the transformation. The ship has remained in the port since arriving earlier in the year and as you can see she’s not in the best of shape.

There are some more photos that show preparations to remove the ship name on the starboard and port side. The dry dock is costing the cruise line a huge $200 million but it’s not known if some aspects of the transformation will be changed to save some money.

Hopefully we’ll start to see work increase as it’s never easy to see such a popular Carnival cruise ship in this state. Carnival already announced that some ships with scheduled dry docks would already be delayed in 2021.

Even though these are the first signs of working being done to the ship there is no doubt more has been done on the interior. When sister ship Carnival Triumph was transformed in 2019 to the Carnival Sunrise work was already being made to the cabins during the transatlantic crossing to the shipyard.

When Will Carnival Radiance Begin Sailing?

So the big question is when will the newly transformed Carnival Radiance begin cruises? We’ve still got just under a year until her arrival but no doubt Carnival will keep us all teased with updates on the ship.

Carnival’s booking engine is currently showing the first sailings for the Carnival Radiance on November 1 2021. However that could be because the earlier sailings are already sold out especially with the limited capacity to keep guests and crew safe.

Rendering By: Carnival Cruise Line

The ship is set to depart on her inaugural cruise on April 23 2021 with the work starting around now that should be a good time for completion. She’ll be based from the Port of Long Beach California and the first 4-day cruise will make calls at the Catalina Islands and Ensenada Mexico.

What’s Being Added to the Carnival Radiance?

The Carnival Radiance will become a totally new cruise ship that’s one of the reasons she’s been included as a new vessel to debut in Spring 2021. The ship will no longer be named Carnival Victory as she will have totally new features and a fresh new look.

The bow to stern makeover will include new venues such as the much anticipated Shaq O’Neal Big Chicken restaurant the first in the fleet. There will also be 110 new staterooms and suites that guests can choose from. Here’s the full list:

The new-look Carnival cruise ship will be one of the highlights of the year which is will help make up a dismal 2020. With cruises set to resume from March 2021 and Mardi Gras starting sailings from Florida in April 2021 it will be an exciting time for Carnival and the entire cruise industry.

The 1982-built ship was originally Carnival Cruise Line’s Tropicale sailing for Carnival through 2000 when it transferred to the Costa brand.

The Danish-built ship then moved to P&O Cruises Australia owned by Carnival for a short stint as the Pacific Star before eventually being sold to Pullmantur Cruises.

Pullmantur operated the ship for a few years before chartering it to Peace Boat where it sailed until 2019.

Peace Boat was founded in the early 1980s offering shorter cruises and has slowly expanded into global months-long voyages with the purpose of raising awareness and building connections internationally among groups that work for peace human rights environmental protection and sustainable development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Bpb25lZXJpbmctY3J1aXNlLXNoaXAtYXJyaXZlcy1pbi1pbmRpYS10by1iZS1zY3JhcHBlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pioneering Cruise Ship Arrives in India to be Scrapped,"The first newly built cruise ship for Carnival Cruise Lines which was launched at a critical moment in the development of the modern cruise ship industry has ended its 38-year career. Introduced in 1982 as the Tropicale this pioneering cruise ship has been beached at the scrapyards in Alang India.

The construction order for the Tropicale was placed just eight years after Carnival began operations and came at a time when the cruise industry was mostly using older passenger ships repurposed for cruising. No new cruise ships had been built since the mid-1970s and at the time some forecasts doubted that another passenger ship would ever be built. Carnival had survived a rocky start nearly going bankrupt before entrepreneur Ted Arison took full ownership of the line and using a “fun ship” marketing theme successfully turn around the company’s finances. Carnival was operating three former liners while Arison had visions of rapid growth.

The order for the first newly built cruise ship went to the Danish shipyard Aalborg Verft for a 36000 gross ton passenger ship able to accommodate approximately 1000 passengers. At 671 feet in length she was far from the largest passenger ship but was among the ranks of the largest cruise ships then in service. The Tropicale as she would be named would become a transitional cruise ship laying the foundation for the future expansion of Carnival and the cruise industry.

She entered service in 1982 sailing from Miami to the Caribbean but she would also become a pioneer for the cruise line sailing to Mexico and Alaska and later being homeported in Tampa and New Orleans. As a modern ship she featured the latest amenities and also used bright colors in its decor that echoed the fun ship marketing. The Tropicale was also the first Carnival cruise ship with a winged funnel shape known as the whale tail that became one of the signature design elements that continues with all the company’s ships.

Tropicale in 1982 was Carnival's first newly built cruise ship

The success of the Tropicale led Carnival to order three large cruise ships based on the same design as the Tropicale. It was the beginning of the expansion of the company that would make them one of the industry’s leaders and part of the largest cruising corporation in the world.

Shortly after Costa Cruises became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Carnival Corporation the Tropicale left Carnival Cruise Lines in 2001 renamed the Costa Tropicale. She sailed for the Italian cruise line till 2005 when replaced by new constructions she was sent to Australia to sail for P&O Cruises. She sailed as the Pacific Star from Australia and in the South Pacific for the next three years before being sold to Spain’s Pullmantur in 2008 and renamed the Ocean Dream.

The last decade of her long career would see her operating for the Japanese NGO Peace Boat sailing around the world voyages. She joined Peace Boat in 2012 and continue to operate the world voyages as well as short trips in Japan until the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Peace Boat had announced plans to expand its operations with a second cruise ship in 2020 but both ships were laid up.

In the fall of 2020 Peace Boat announced that was retiring the Ocean Dream and when its world voyages resume they would be operated on a newer larger cruise ship. Princess Cruises’ Sun Princess was acquired as part of Carnival Corproation's efforts to accelerate the disposal of older tonnage. The Sun Princess will be renamed the Pacific World to continue Peace Boat’s world cruises.

The Ocean Dream ex Tropicale became like many 1980s vintage cruise ships a victim of the pandemic. Smaller in size and outdated by the growth of the cruise industry she was sold for scrap.

Developed by Graphic Packaging International KeelClip is a unique paperboard design that not only replaces plastic rings top clips and shrink wrap multipacks for cans; it also offers merchandising benefits that similar beverage packaging does not. The concept combines an efficient paperboard lid that covers the tops of the cans. A paperboard flap attached underneath the center of the lid slips in between the two rows of cans. This flap provides stability to the pack in much the same way that the keel provides stability to a sailboat. KeelClip works with the widest range of cans and multi-count configurations and at the speeds required by large beverage operations allowing brand owners to present a premium and sustainable image with a billboard for branding and can orientation.

Notably Coca-Cola HBC has successfully begun the roll out of technology in The Republic of Ireland Northern Ireland and Austria. The firm says this first step in its commitment to replace plastic wrap on all can multipacks in its European Union markets will save more than 3000 metric tons of CO 2 and 2000 metric tons of plastic each year.

This new “Grip&Go” packaging is the result of a €15 million ($17734800) investment by the company in a strategic partnership with Graphic Packaging International and forms part of a wider commitment by Coca-Cola HBC and its partner The Coca-Cola Company to build a more sustainable approach to packaging. The rollout across all the company’s EU markets plus Switzerland will be complete by early 2022.

“By investing in this innovative new technology we are directly supporting our customers and their consumers by providing a more sustainable packaging format” says Marcel Martin Group Supply Chain Director at Coca-Cola HBC. “At the same time we are delivering on our commitment to make a more positive environmental impact.”

Alan Crawford Trading Director SPAR/EUROSPAR Ireland says “Coca-Cola HBC has taken a leadership position in the soft drink category introducing a really new and exciting type of packaging. The move to the new KeelClip and paperboard packaging will eliminate a significant amount of packaging from our supply chain which is very important for us as an organization and the environment we operate within. The appearance of the multipack cans in KeelClip packaging is also more attractive to our customers so we expect the change to support increased sales as well as taking an important sustainability position.”

As part of the initial agreement with Graphic Packaging Coca-Cola HBC will install 11 KeelClip machines in seven countries which will supply the solution across all its EU countries.

“We are committed to work with Coca-Cola HBC to deliver this exciting innovation” says Steve Gould new product development and marketing director of the beverage division at Graphic Packaging. “We will continue to support the ongoing rollout and commercialization across Coca-Cola HBC’s EU markets and are delighted to be partners in this endeavor.”

They’re a big bloated organization running on outdated technology that everyone loves to hate. Despite this they serve a vital purpose. More than likely you’ll have to deal with them at some point as a traveler either by boarding one of their planes or with their frequent flyer program MileagePlus.

Like many large organizations they’ve grown so big that there’s very little accountability even at the top. When United called the cops to remove a passenger they didn’t want to transport he was bloodied up in the process and garnered sympathy around the world. The airline and its CEO still refused to accept responsibility.

Mention United to an infrequent flyer and they’ll likely have a story about how awful it was when they had to sleep on the floor at O’Hare when their flight was cancelled in a snowstorm or how United lost their bag on the way to visit Grandma for Thanksgiving.

Anyone else might complain about their frequent award chart devaluations (three in the past 12 months) their awful technology or their new and very confusing upgrade system.

MileagePlus still remains a useful program. They’re a Chase Ultimate Rewards partner and they’re a part of the largest airline alliance: Star Alliance.

United is the biggest risk taker of any US carrier with their global network and route strategy which leads to some interesting award opportunities. They fly to Australia and New Zealand Tahiti across Asia from Tokyo to Singapore to Mumbai and Delhi from Cape Town South Africa to Lagos Nigeria across Europe the Caribbean Mexico and South America. No matter where you want to go with your miles United (or a partner) can likely get you there.

There’s a lot you’ll need to know about United MileagePlus. Before you transfer miles buy miles or make any kind of redemption make sure you have a good understanding of the program first. This guide will walk you through all of the nuances and sweet spots of the programs including the Excursionist Perk.

Let’s dig in.

About MileagePlus: United’s Frequent Flyer Program

United is one of the “big three” US airlines and their loyalty program United MileagePlus is among the largest in the US. United serves the most destinations of any US carrier and its loyalty program is 40 years old. You can earn and redeem United miles for travel across the planet.

United has four published elite tiers including: Premier Silver Gold Platinum and 1K. There’s a super-elite unpublished elite tier called United Global Services that’s invitation-only. You have to spend at least $50000 with the airline every year to even be considered for the status.

United also has a separate Million Miler Program that rewards flyers with elite status for those that fly over 1000000 miles with the airline. There are tiers for 1 2 3 and 4 million miler status.

This guide will show you how to earn and redeem United miles earn elite status and maximize your earnings when redeeming United miles.

MileagePlus Partners and Alliances

United was a founding member of the Star Alliance. Star Alliance is the largest of the world’s airline alliances. You can earn and redeem United miles across the alliance. United has the largest number of partners of any US carrier which is part of what makes their miles so valuable.

The 26 full members of Star Alliance include:

Aegean Airlines Austrian Airlines EVA Air SWISS Air Canada Avianca LOT Polish Airlines TAP Air Portugal Air China Brussels Airlines Lufthansa Thai Airways Air India Copa Airlines Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) Turkish Airlines Air New Zealand Croatia Airlines Shenzhen Airlines United Airlines All Nippon Airways EgyptAir Singapore Airlines Asiana Airlines Ethiopian Airlines South African Airways Star Alliance airlines

There are two additional connecting partners of Star Alliance which aren’t full members. Those are Juneyao Air and Thai Smile which is a subsidiary of Thai Airways. You can earn and redeem miles on Juneyao flights while you can neither earn or redeem miles on Thai Smile.

Outside of the Star Alliance United also has partnerships with:

Aer Lingus Azul Edelweiss Olympic Air Aeromar Boutique Air Eurowings Silver Airways Air Dolomiti Cape Air Hawaiian Airlines Vistara United’s non-alliance partners

Depending on the partner and the route you may be able to earn United miles and elite credits. You can redeem miles online for any of United’s Star Alliance partners or non-alliance partners on United.com.

United MileagePlus Benefits

United MileagePlus has some great things going for it.

First of all United partners with Chase. You can transfer Ultimate Rewards points to United instantly and at a 1:1 ratio. Chase has some of the biggest sign up bonuses of any bank so earning United miles is easy. United also releases more saver seats to credit card holders so having a United card issued by Chase unlocks lots of benefits.

Best for beginners Earn 2x points on all travel and 3x points on dining Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card Learn More Best for premium benefits Earn 3x points on all travel and dining plus annual travel credits airport lounge access and superior trip coverage and purchase protection Chase Sapphire Reserve® Learn More Best for business purchases Earn 3x points on all travel shipping advertising with social media and internet and phone services Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card Learn More

United has a huge route network and is part of the biggest alliance so getting to any corner of the world is possible with United MileagePlus.

United has very generous routing rules for award travel. While other carriers like American restrict the regions you can connect in en route to your destination that doesn’t happen with United.

Need to get to Bangkok from New York? You can route there via Asia Europe Africa India… Anywhere really. With the number of partners United has this is a really handy feature of the program.

United also makes it easy to book awards. All of their partners show up online so you can book awards on their website or app with ease. Sometimes there are issues with phantom space and discrepancies between what carriers have access to what space and other times United’s website just won’t work. United does have a habit of pulling partner space from their website from time to time but for the most part everything can be booked online.

If your schedule isn’t flexible you’ll have access to more seats on United flights but at higher mileage rates. That’s great for those who would otherwise pay cash for a last minute ticket as the savings for using miles in these situations can be substantial.

If a last minute business class flight from Newark to London is over $6000 but United has a seat for just 155000 miles at the standard level you’re getting more than 4 cents per mile.

United does not charge any surcharges on award travel on any carrier or in any region. They’re one of the few programs worldwide that does that. You’ll only pay the airport taxes and fees.

You can also use United miles to upgrade United flights or flights on many of their partners. It usually requires a cash copay or purchasing a higher priced economy ticket but having the option of using miles for upgrades is a nice perk.

You can upgrade flights with the following partners using United miles:

Aegean ANA Copa Airlines LOT Polish Airlines South African Airways Air Canada Asiana Airlines Croatia Airlines Lufthansa SWISS Air Air China Austrian Egyptair SAS Thai Airways Air India Avianca Ethiopian Airlines Shenzhen Airlines TAP Air Portugal Air New Zealand Brussels Airlines EVA Airways Singapore Airlines Turkish Airlines Redeem United miles for Star Alliance upgrades on these carriers

Star Alliance upgrades are complicated and you need the stars to line up perfectly for things to work out. The only carrier you can waitlist upgrades with miles are ANA otherwise the upgrade space has to be available to confirm the upgrade. You can find the rules for Star Alliance upgrades using United miles here.

How to Earn United Miles

There are endless ways to earn United miles. United miles are the redeemable miles that you can use to redeem for free flights travel experiences merchandise and more. We’re not talking about elite qualification here only redeemable miles.

You can earn United miles by flying with credit cards through United’s promotions or by shopping online or dining out. I’ll break down the best way to earn miles so you can rack them up in no time.

Here are the best ways to earn United miles:

Flying United

The obvious way to earn United miles is by flying with United Airlines. Flying United isn’t actually that rewarding these days as far as earning miles.

The number of award miles you’ll earn depends on a number of factors including whether you’re flying with United Airlines or a partner and which airline issued the ticket. Tickets issued by United earn award miles based on the price of the ticket while tickets issued by partners earn miles based on the distance and cabin of service.

When you fly United the number of miles you earn is determined by your elite status and the cost of your ticket. It’s counterintuitive that United calls these miles as they’re a function of the price of a ticket.

Here’s how many United miles you earn when you fly United:

United MileagePlus Member Level: Total Miles Earned: General Member 5x fare (minus taxes and fees) Premier Silver 7x fare (minus taxes and fees) Premier Gold 8x fare (minus taxes and fees) Premier Platinum 9x fare (minus taxes and fees) Premier 1K 11x fare (minus taxes and fees) United MileagePlus earning rates for United tickets

Instead of earning 2500 miles for a cross country flight from Washington DC to Los Angeles you’ll earn just 1000 miles if you paid $205.60 for that ticket and don’t have elite status.

You may earn more miles with a partner program than you would with United MileagePlus when flying United. It’s always worth checking the specific earnings rates through a tool like WhereToCredit.com.

There are some exceptions where you’ll earn United miles based on the distance flown instead of the price of a ticket. Those include certain tickets where the fare isn’t provided to United so the airline has no way of calculating the miles based on the fare. Those are typically unpublished consolidator/bulk group tour and opaque tickets.

Flying with Star Alliance carriers and other partners

You can also earn United miles by flying with their partners. Depending on how you purchased your ticket you’ll either earn miles based on the price of your ticket or by the distance of the flight segments and the fare code.

If you purchased your ticket with United Airlines you’ll earn miles based on the price of your ticket as you do when you fly United. You’ll want to double check your ticket number. If it starts with “016” you’ll earn the same number of miles as listed above.

Earn United miles when you fly Lufthansa

If your ticket was purchased through a partner airline and includes partner flights the number of miles you earn is determined by the flight distance and the fare code. More expensive tickets especially those in business or first class will earn more miles.

Discounted economy fares can earn as few as 25% or even 0% of miles flown. If you’re flying a full fare economy ticket you’ll usually earn 100% of the miles flown. Premium economy business and first class earn between 100% and 350% of total miles flown.

Spending money on credit cards

It’s easy to earn United miles with credit cards. Chase issues several United Mileage Plus co-branded cards. Any Chase card that earns Ultimate Rewards points also earns United miles as those points can be converted to United miles at a 1:1 ratio instantly.

Chase has several personal and business credit cards that earn United miles. Those are:

Chase’s Ultimate Rewards earning cards are also great for earning United miles. You can earn 2x or 3x points on dining groceries and travel and those points can be transferred to United MileagePlus instantly and at a 1:1 ratio.

Here are some of the best Chase Ultimate Rewards earning cards:

Buying United miles during a sale

United frequently sells miles at a discount or with a bonus. If you’re ineligible for credit card sign ups or someone who doesn’t fly frequently you can purchase miles.

You can score business and first class redemptions at a significant discount when buying discounted miles or with a bonus. It usually doesn’t make sense for economy class awards given how competitively airfare is priced these days.

Either way you’ll want to keep up with United’s latest promotions on purchased miles. As always do the math for any specific redemption to make sure it’s worth your while and don’t purchase more miles than you can use in 6 to 12 months or so.

Shopping online with the shopping portal or the MileagePlus X app

For anyone who shops online it’s easy to earn United miles for purchases. You can shop via the United MileagePlus shopping website or with the MileagePlus X app on any phone or mobile device.

If you’re going to make any major purchases it’s best to check the returns with other cashback portals first before using the United MileagePlus shopping portal. You might get cash back instead of United miles or earn more airline miles with a different program. Rakuten is one of the most rewarding shopping portals.

You can find a full guide to cashback and dining portals here.

Dining out with United MileagePlus Dining

If you’re anyone who orders take out or eats at restaurants with any regularity it’s easy to earn United miles for restaurant purchases. In addition to using a card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve at a restaurant and earning 3x miles you can “double dip” and earn bonus miles for linking that card to MileagePlus Dining.

Members will earn 1 mile per $2 spent at most restaurants. If you subscribe to the United MileagePlus dining newsletter you can earn 3 miles per $1 spent at participating restaurants. After dining out 11 times in a calendar year you will get “VIP Status” with the program and earn 5 miles per dollar spent at participating restaurants.

There are frequent sign up bonuses for new accounts with United MileagePlus Dining so you will typically earn a few extra thousand bonus miles after signing up and your first few dining experiences.

Best Ways to Redeem United Miles

Once you’ve racked up United miles it’s time to spend them. Free flights start at about 5000 miles (plus $6 in taxes) and go upwards to 140000 miles for first class awards from the US to Asia.

Whether you’re spending just a few thousand miles or tens of thousands these are some of the best redemption options:

Flying business class on United Airlines

If you’re flying United in any cabin you’ll also use less miles for saver awards than you will partners. United prices international awards on their own flights cheaper than they do partners. You can fly to Europe with United for just 60000 miles in business to Asia for just 70000 miles in business class or to Australia or New Zealand for just 80000 miles in business.

Redeem United miles for United Polaris business class award flights

Those are the “saver” prices which are awards at the cheapest level. Lately United releases a good amount of saver space both in advance and at the last minute due to the COVID pandemic.

For those that have the United credit card finding saver space on United flights will be even easier as they release more discounted awards to credit card holders and elite members than they do general members.

Redeeming miles for a free-one way with the Excursionist Perk

United has another useful perk for those booking a multi city itinerary. It’s called the “Excursionist Perk” which is a useless name. If you book a multi city itinerary that includes three or more one-ways you can receive one of those one-ways for free if your itinerary meets the following criteria:

Travel for the entire booking must start and end in the same MileagePlus defined award region

The origin and destination of the Excursionist Perk (or free one-way) must be entirely within a single MileagePlus defined award region

The cabin of service for the Excursion Perk must be in the same cabin or lower than the one-way immediately preceding it

If two or more one-ways on an itinerary meet these conditions the first occurring one-way that’s considered an Excursionist Perk will be free. You’ll find a comprehensive overview of the free-way and United’s routing rules here.

Flying short haul for only a few thousand miles

You don’t have to fly long flights in premium cabins to get a lot of value for your United miles. You can find award flights starting at just 5000 United miles.

Those sometimes may even be on expensive routes. Look at the following example:

Nonstop flights from San Salvador El Salvador to Managua Nicaragua start at about $480 USD. The same flight booked with United miles is just 9000 miles and $45 in taxes. You’d save $435 for 9000 United miles. That’s a fantastic deal.

Now that probably seems like a very niche market and it is but this extends across United’s partner network. Any nonstop flight that’s under 800 miles within a single award region starts at just 9000 United miles.

Booking awards during a sale

United occasionally puts award travel on sale. Even though the airline doesn’t publish award charts they advertise discounted award bookings throughout the year.

Typically there are discounts on specific destinations and sometimes for a specific number of passengers. United has put awards to ski destinations Hawaii Europe and Asia all on sale in recent years. It’s worth looking out for promotional emails from United to keep up with the latest award sales.

Redeeming miles for business class on a lux partner like Austrian EVA and Turkish

First class redemptions with United MileagePlus can be insanely expensive. First class from Asia to the US can be as high as 140000 United miles. Travel in business class on the other hand is much more reasonable and can be a great value.

Some of the best carriers in Star Alliance include Austrian Airlines EVA Air and Turkish Airlines. Austrian has perhaps the world’s best business class catering. EVA Air offers exquisite service even in business class. Turkish has maybe the world’s nicest business class lounge at the gorgeous new Istanbul Airport.

You can fly to Europe in business class from 70000 United miles with travel on Austrian or Turkish or from 88000 miles with travel on EVA Air from the US to Asia.

For United’s partners like Ethiopian and Turkish who have huge global route networks you can connect from any continent and route via the carrier’s hub in Addis Ababa or Istanbul using miles.

How to maximize redemptions with United MileagePlus

One of the biggest benefits of the United MileagePlus program is the free one-ways offered through the Excursionist Perk outlined above.

If you travel on United you’ll pay fewer miles than if you were traveling with a partner. United prices awards on their own flights cheaper than they do on partners. Their pricing is complicated and the price of your award will depend on a number of factors for international travel.

You can even waitlist business class awards for travel on United. If there isn’t a seat available in business at the saver level you can pay for a saver business class award confirm a seat in economy and waitlist for a business class seat.

If you travel with United on a transoceanic flight you’ll get the best price for business class awards. Business class to Europe on a United nonstop is 60000 miles. If you connect with a Star Alliance partner in Europe onwards to another destination that will require another 6000 miles. You’d pay 66000 miles for something like Washington DC to Brussels (on United) and Brussels to Berlin on Brussels Airlines.

United MileagePlus Premier Status

United MileagePlus can be a complicated program. At the end of the day it serves two main purposes:

Awarding you with miles that you can redeem for free flights and other goods and services Tracking your elite status with Premier Qualifying Flights (PQF) and Premier Qualifying Points (PQP)

We’ve covered the best ways to earn redeemable miles now let’s dig into elite status.

PQFs vs PQPs

If you’re after elite status you’ll need to keep track of your PQFs and PQPs. You earn a PQF for every flight you take with United or a partner. One flight (take off and landing) equals one PQF.

Earning PQPs is a function of a ticket’s price. You’ll earn 1 PQP for every dollar you spend on a ticket and sometimes even for ticket extras. The taxes/fees on tickets don’t count.

What’s more complicated is that you can earn PQPs when flying with United’s partners as well but as a function of the flight’s distance. For travel ticketed by a partner carrier for travel on United’s partners PQPs will be awarded as a function of flight distance.

If you’re flying a Preferred Partner the number of PQPs earned is the number of award miles earned divided by five. United Preferred Partners are:

Air Canada Austrian Airlines Copa Airlines Air China Avianca Eurowings Air New Zealand Azul Brazilian Airlines Lufthansa ANA Brussels Airlines SWISS Air United MileagePlus Preferred Partners

For non preferred partners or MileagePlus partners you’ll earn just a sixth of the award miles as PQPs (award miles divided by 6). The (non preferred) MileagePlus Partners are:

Aegean Airlines Ethiopian Singapore Airlines Air Dolomiti EVA Air South African Airways Air India Juneyao Air TAP Air Portugal Asiana Airlines LOT Polish Airlines Thai Airways Croatia Airlines Olympic Air Turkish Airlines Edelweiss SAS Egyptair Shenzhen Airlines United MileagePlus Partners

Depending on whether you’re traveling on a Preferred Partner or a MileagePlus partner you’ll earn either a fifth or a sixth of the number of award miles as PQPs.

United modified the earnings requirements for elite status this year (2021) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They realize less people are flying so they’ve made it easier to earn elite status this year. Here is how many PQFs and PQPs you’ll need to earn for each level of elite status with United:

Elite level: PQF + PQP: PQP only: Premier Silver 8 PQF + 3000 PQP 3500 PQP Premier Gold 16 PQF + 16000 PQP 7000 PQP Premier Platinum 24 PQF + 9000 PQP 10000 PQP Premier 1K 36 PQF + 13500 PQP 15000 PQP United MileagePlus 2021 elite status requirements

It’s important to remember that award tickets don’t earn any PQFs or PQPs. You only earn PQF and PQP on revenue tickets. United definitely has one of the more complicated schemes for earning elite status. Thankfully they’ve made it easier to earn status this year.

They’ve launched an additional promotion for earning elite status which you can read more about here. They’re awarding members with more PQP or redeemable miles for shopping with the MileagePlus X app.

United MileagePlus FAQs

Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about United Airlines and United MileagePlus.

What is United MileagePlus Dining?

United MileagePlus Dining is an easy way to earn even more miles whenever you dine out at restaurants. You link your credit or debit card to the program and can earn bonus miles for eating at restaurants that participate in the program. It’s one of the easiest ways to earn bonus miles for something you’re already doing! Signing up is easy. You can register and find more information here.

Is United extending elite status for travelers during the COVID pandemic?

Yes United extended status last year and has made it easier to earn status this year. We have a dedicated post about the reduced requirements for United elite status this year. You can find United’s website with information about earning status during the pandemic here.

What changes has United made to service during the coronavirus pandemic?

United did eliminate hot meals and beverage service on domestic flights during the pandemic. Thankfully United is reintroducing meals and restoring service as the situation improves at least in the US.

When do United miles expire?

United miles don’t expire. They made changes to the MileagePlus program in 2019 so miles no longer expire.

Can I convert my United miles to other airline miles?

No you can’t. United miles can only be redeemed for award flights as well as for other travel awards via MileagePlus. The redemption rate for United miles when used for booking hotels cruises or car rentals is particularly bad and nothing something we recommend.

Can I transfer my United miles to other airlines or hotel programs?

No you can’t. United miles can only be redeemed within the bounds of the United MileagePlus program. You can’t convert them to any other kind of points or miles.

Should I donate my United miles to charity?

If you don’t have any good use for them of course you can! However we recommend recommend donating cash whenever feasible. When you donate miles you’re not necessarily donating travel. The airline will convert the miles to cash usually at a terrible rate of less than 1 cent per miles and any organization won’t actually ever see your air miles. Additionally these kind of donations aren’t tax deductible and are really just an accounting exercise. You can find a post covering better uses of donating miles for charity here."

I was delighted to receive this week’s species from Pat McCool who observed the various lifecycle stages of the pale tussock moth during metamorphosis earlier this year.

Metamorphosis is the biological process of change when an animal after birth and during its growth completely changes its body structure.

This week I am focusing on the pale tussock moth (dosóg éadrom leamhan as Gaeilge) which completely changes its body structure from a caterpillar to the adult moth.

I do believe I have shared this species with you before — however I only had a picture of the adult moth to share with you and according to my records that was back in 2016 when I photographed the adult on a wall of a GAA club!

This adult moth lays tiny yellow/brown eggs on the leaves of their food plant throughout June; and between July and October each year the brightly coloured caterpillars can be seen.

Their preferred food plants include hawthorn blackthorn birches oak and hazel trees.

The caterpillars are greenish or yellow with four distinct tufts of yellow hair. It is suggested that these brightly coloured tufts of hair help to protect the moth from predation by birds.

Pale tussock moths were once commonly referred to as ‘hop dogs’ as they were common moths found among growing crops. Today this moth is not as common in crop fields due to the use of pesticides.

At this time of year the caterpillar is overwintering in its cocoon waiting until the arrival of spring when the adults will emerge.

The adult moth’s forewings are pale grey in colour with darker grey bands visible and these markings help to camouflage itself in the bark of trees.

The adult pale tussock moths do not feed. You can tell the difference between a male and female adult moth as the males often have feathery antennae to help locate the female.

From my colleagues and I at the Bog of Allen Nature Centre I wish you all a peaceful New Year.

rick@greenepublishing.com

Teaching has always been a challenging profession even in the best of times. It takes a special gift to be able to effectively transfer knowledge from one person to another younger person. In recent months those challenges have become even greater. With many teachers having to alter some of their methods to a combination of in-person and virtual teaching greater creativity has become more of a necessity. Often that greater creativity comes with a price tag. With increasingly tight school budgets teachers frequently need help. That is where the national program ""DonorsChoose"" steps in to help.

It all began with a history teacher from Bronx N.Y. named Charles Best who wanted his students to read the classic ""Little House on the Prairie."" As he was making copies of one book he was able to procure he began to think to himself just how often teachers use money out of their own pockets for classroom materials. He began to wonder to himself how many people would be willing to donate if they could see the projects and just where the money was going. He sketched out a website and shared the information with his colleagues. Right off the bat 11 projects were funded and the program took off from there. Now DonorsChoose is available nationwide to every school. Today 85 percent of public schools in America have posted a project on the DonorsChoose website. In total nearly two million projects have been supported by 4682430 supporters. Both those numbers continue to grow. DonorsChoose has received the highest ratings from Charity Watch Charity Navigator and Guidestar. Some of their corporate sponsors include: Chevron the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the Dicks Sporting Goods Foundation Verizon Volkswagen General Motors the Charles Schwab Foundation 3M Kleenex Sonic and many others. Many of these corporate sponsors will match donations on certain projects making each donation have an even greater impact.

Locally approximately 24 projects have been funded through DonorsChoose. Some of these projects have included televisions in the Madison County High School weight room health and safety products such as face shields and hand sanitizers lap desks classroom supplies books and much more. Local teacher Leslie McLeod had one of her virtual learning projects featured on WCTV television. ""It's great I love it"" said McLeod of DonorsChoose. Madison County Central School (MCCS) teacher Jamie Andrews has been designated a DonorsChoose Ambassador meaning she assists teachers in developing their projects helps in finding potential funding sources etc.

Currently there are nine Madison County projects online. These include projects for MCCS Pinetta Elementary School Lee Elementary School and James Madison Preparatory High School. To find current local projects for Madison County schools visit the DonorsChoose website at https://www.donorschoose.org/donors/search.html and type Madison County in the search window. All donations are tax deductible.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Longtime NY1 anchor Roma Torre and her colleagues Kristen Shaughnessy Jeanine Ramirez Vivian Lee and Amanda Farinacci sued the channel's parent company in June 2019 alleging their male colleagues received preferential treatment — a pattern of discrimination that allegedly got worse as the women reporters aged.

According to Gothamist the New York Times and the New York Post the other terms of the settlement are to remain confidential.

""After engaging in a lengthy dialogue with NY1 we believe it is in everyone's interest – ours NY1's and our viewers – that this litigation be resolved and we have mutually agreed to part ways"" reads a joint statement from the five complainants who were represented by the firm Wigdor LLP. ""We want to thank everyone who has supported us through these times – please know that the support from each and every person has made a real difference.”

The firm itself said in a statement ""It has been a true privilege to represent Ms. Torre Ms. Shaughnessy Ms. Ramirez Ms. Lee and Ms. Farinacci who have cumulatively been on air at NY1 for more than 100 years. We thank all of the many people who supported their cause and we thank the many fans who tuned in to watch them fairly and accurately report the news for so many years.""

A PR spokesperson from Charter Communications NY1's parent company thanked the women ""for their years of dedicated service in reporting the news for New Yorkers"" in a statement issued late Thursday and added ""We wish them well in their future endeavors.""

The lawsuit alleged that Charter undertook a so-called modernization effort in 2016 after acquiring NY1. According to the suit that resulted in the older female reporters receiving less airtime. At other times they alleged they were blocked from reporting on high-profile stories.

Their ""then-blossoming careers have wilted"" since the takeover the lawsuit claimed noting the women's complaints to management were either not taken seriously or were flatly ignored leading ""to retaliation and further mistreatment.""

Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

The suit also insisted male talent was paid more than their female colleagues.

In the suit it was alleged Torre — on staff since the channel's launch in 1992 — made ""less than half"" of what morning host Pat Kiernan does.

The lawsuit also alleged Kiernan's 20th year with the network was promoted extensively while ""Ms. Torre by contrast with a longer tenure and celebrating 25 years on air with her own daily live show received no special promotion whatsoever.""

On Twitter New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez commented that the settlement's terms were ""incredibly sad to see. These are top-notch journalists beloved by our city.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbG9jYWwvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL2NoYXJ0ZXItc2Nob29scy1sb3R0ZXJpZXMvMjAyMC8xMi8zMS8yODE2YTMxZS00YWFmLTExZWItODM5YS1jZjRiYTdiN2M0OGNfc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perspective | Can charter schools pick the best students? No but many believe the myth.,I am accustomed to being called ignorant by readers sometimes with good reason. But the disdain for my grasp of reality was overwhelming last month when I tried to explain why I thought the best public charter schools were good examples for raising student achievement throughout the country.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaG93Yml6NDExLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAxL2Rlc3BpY2FibGUtc3BlY3RydW0tY2FibGUtb3VzdHMtbnkxLXZldGVyYW5zLXJvbWEtdG9ycmUta3Jpc3Rlbi1zaGF1Z2huZXNzeS1hbmQtMy1vdGhlci1mZW1hbGUtcmVwb3J0ZXJzLWFmdGVyLWxhd3N1aXQtc2V0dGxlbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despicable Spectrum Cable Ousts NY1 Veterans Roma Torre Kristen Shaughnessy and 3 Other Female Reporters ...,"After 28 years a raft of awards incredibly hard work and colon cancer Roma Torre is out at NY1 on Spectrum Cable. Also out is Kristen Shaughnessy there for 25 years and three other female reporters. The women sued Spectrum and NY1 for sex discrimination claiming they were paid vastly less than their colleagues and weren’t promoted internally in a similar fashion.

The result is that they’ve settled the suit and they’ve been ousted from their jobs. Is that a win? Monetarily maybe. But it’s a loss to the NY1 community and a black eye for despicable Spectrum a company so bad at providing cable — let alone news — that it was recommended they lose their access to Manhattan a couple of years ago.

What a disaster. The three other women are Jeanine Ramirez Vivian Lee and Amanda Farinacci all professionals.

The news reports have been spun that it’s Charter Communications that was sued which obfuscates the trade name Spectrum. But it’s Spectrum let’s not forget it.

In a joint statement issued by their lawyers at Wigdor LLP the five plaintiffs said: “We are pleased to announce we have reached a confidential resolution of our lawsuit against Charter/NY1. After engaging in a lengthy dialogue with NY1 we believe it is in everyone’s interest – ours NY1’s and our viewers – that this litigation be resolved and we have mutually agreed to part ways. We want to thank everyone who has supported us through these times – please know that the support from each and every person has made a real difference.”

The lawsuit said their employer has consistently prioritized male journalists at their colleagues’ direct expense—a pattern of gender discrimination that only escalates as women reporters age the lawsuit claimed.

Allegedly complicit in this was Pat Kiernan the blonde blue eyed star of NY1 whom both Torre and Shaughnessy preceded in tenure at the station. They said he was being paid far more than they were even though they’d been there longer. They wanted Kiernan’s salary records but a judge denied it. On top of that it’s alleged that Kiernan’s agent at UTA Adam Liebner (son of legendary agent Richard Liebner) told Torre’s brother that Kiernan was the star of the network and that she should drop her suit.

But in the end Kiernan stays and five women leave. As a New Yorker I think it’s important now to turn off NY1 which has not been the same since Spectrum bought Time Warner Cable and ousted the original news director Steve Paulus who invented the channel.

Torre by the way has a long and respected family history in New York journalism. Her mother Marie Torre was the first reporter ever to go to jail to protect a source. When she was columnist at the New York Herald Tribune Judy Garland sued her over an article in which Marie Torre quoted an unidentified CBS executive who called Garland “fat.” Marie Torre spent 10 days in jail. She was a pioneer a hero probably inspired the famous “Mary Tyler Moore” episode in which Mary also went to jail for protecting a source.

Let’s hope that all five of these women find good new jobs in the New York market immediately. They’re all deserving of it and we could use them on our TVs. But NY1? Aside from checking the time and temperature it’s completely unnecessary now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvNS1uZXdzLWFuY2hvcnMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLTItZnJvbS1uai1sZWF2ZS1ueTEtYXMtcGFydC1vZi1nZW5kZXItZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24tc2V0dGxlbWVudC5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvNS1uZXdzLWFuY2hvcnMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLTItZnJvbS1uai1sZWF2ZS1ueTEtYXMtcGFydC1vZi1nZW5kZXItZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24tc2V0dGxlbWVudC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 news anchors including 2 from N.J. leave NY1 as part of gender discrimination settlement,"Five female news anchors including two from New Jersey will no longer work for the New York news channel NY1 as part of a settlement of a gender discrimination lawsuit.

Roma Torre who lives in Montclair and Kristen Shaugnessy who lives in Scotch Plains joined Amanda Farinacci Jeanine Ramirez and Vivian Lee to sue NY1 in 2019. The women claimed they had been sidelined through reduced airtime and left out of promotional campaigns after NY1 was purchased by Charter Communications in 2016.

The women all of whom were over 40 argued the station had given preferential treatment to men and younger women. They detailed their claims in an open letter published on Medium and in the New York Times.

The terms of the settlement were confidential but the lawsuit had sought unspecified damages and for the women to be returned to the positions they held before Charter’s takeover. About a month ago a judge allowed some of the women’s discrimination claims to move forward but rejected other claims related to workplace retaliation.

“After engaging in a lengthy dialogue with NY1 we believe it is in everyone’s interest — ours NY1′s and our viewers — that this litigation be resolved and we have mutually agreed to part ways” the women said in a statement. “We want to thank everyone who has supported us through these times — please know that the support from each and every person has made a real difference.”

“We want to thank them for their years of dedicated service in reporting the news for New Yorkers and we wish them well in their future endeavors” NY1 said of the women in a statement.

No suit for the development manager of EFG/Saber Heritage SC of Armonk just work boots jeans open-collar shirt and a very warm jacket.

Berger took time out from his busy schedule to afford the Business Journal a personal tour of the massive $300 million-plus development that Saber Real Estate North LLC and EnviroFinance Group LLC are in the midst of creating on the grounds of the former Hudson River State Hospital in the town of Poughkeepsie.

Berger and company are turning the neglected 156-acre property ”“ long a scavenger”™s delight and a veritable eyesore visible for miles ”“ into an intergenerational live-work-play community called Hudson Heritage that will eventually include:

750 residential units;

350000 square feet of commercial and retail space;

assisted living housing;

a 150-room hotel and conference center;

40000 square feet of urgent and primary care medical facility/office space; ”¢ a 24700-square-foot education/performing arts center;

walking trails; and

more than 60 acres of open parkland and access to a planned 2.7-mile rail trail for walking and biking.

Berger said what initially drew him to the site was demographics ”“ the growth of adjacent Marist College the Culinary Institute of America and Nuvance Health which includes Vassar Brothers Medical Center just to the south.

“So you have 40000 high paying quality prevailing wage union wage jobs within a mile and a half. And you have such a need for multifamily housing hotel retail restaurants and a supermarket” he said.

THE LURE

“So what attracted us was first and foremost the demand generators in the immediate corridor combined with the lack of services. We love to do these live-work-play centers. We”™ve found if you can offer somebody the opportunity to live work and play on one site you get higher rents higher values. You create synergies so there”™s a purpose. We”™re seeing multifamily (developers) want to be here because we have the amenities the retail space hotel.”

Saber has been involved in a number of developments in the New York region including The Duet a luxury rental complex under construction at Hale and Maple Avenues in White Plains; Rivertowns Square an open-air village with dining and shopping in Dobbs Ferry; and The River Club luxury apartments and retail in Bogota New Jersey.

A similar but smaller live-work-play campus 60-acre Eastdale Village on Route 44 in the town of Poughkeepsie recently began its next construction phase for four retail tenants. Eastdale Village which is planned to have 400 residential units is being built by Kirchhoff Cos.

Berger said Marist College gets about 68000 visitors a year with 24000 inquiring as to where they can stay nearby. So a hotel was a natural for the property he said and it could be branded by Marist with its Red Fox logo. In addition they wanted a “Main Street retail” component.

So in the overall plans Berger said there will be 350000 square feet of commercial including a nearly finished 65000-square-foot ShopRite that intends to open early next year with plans to hire 200 workers.

Several other businesses signing leases are:

Chipotle Mexican Grill  2300 square feet. The chain has roots in the Hudson Valley as founder Steve Ellis is an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America.

FROM OLD THE NEW

Berger proudly spoke of the project as he drove through the property from Route 9 to the back by the east gate where on the other side sits Our Lady of the Rosary Chapel which was once part of the psychiatric center until St. Peter”™s Church bought it in 1999 and restored it.

Restoration and adaptive reuse were also on the mind of Berger as he stopped next to the “Kirkbride” administrative building which commands a majestic view of the Great Lawn ”“ designed by the renowned Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux ”“ and the Hudson Valley beyond.

The High Victorian Gothic building was designed by Vaux Withers & Co. when the psychiatric center opened in 1871. Workers were placing new trusses on the roof of the “Kirkbride” which had 360 of its windows replaced.

The Kirkbride and five other buildings ”“ including the 7500-square-foot director”™s house ”“ will be preserved which Berger suggested could be used by a law firm or doctors.

Berger said he found inspiration in the old buildings and the ones that had to be torn down. So much so that “We”™ve taken brick from the demolished buildings and reusing them in the pylons and monuments throughout the site. We”™ve taken windows out of the old buildings and stained glass and using them in some of the retail buildings. Some of the grates and gates and ornamental metal etc.”

Berger said “We”™re going to reuse and rebuild the old greenhouses. It will be an amenity for residents who want to plant vegetables and so forth.”

Saying “it”™s a shame some of these buildings are coming down” and that already the crews have “taken down about half million square feet of buildings” Berger is quick to point out that all but the steel ands tons of asbestos and lead that was shipped offsite has been reutilized.

“Everything else gets processed. So all the material that we”™ve used ”“ rather than bring in 5000 6000 7000 truckloads of material ”“ we”™ve used everything on site.”

In what will be the parking lot for the ShopRite one worker operating a front loader outfitted with a giant magnet on it removed bits of metal from the broken brick and concrete. Another front loader pushed the material onto a conveyor belt that sent it through two crushers. The end material becomes clean fill or stone for road beds with the crushed brick used for liner for laying underground pipes.

LOOK AHEAD

Berger characterized Hudson Heritage as his hardest project.

“We”™re the master developer. We”™re doing all the infrastructure and we”™re building the shopping center (for) $80 million” he said.

“This is really eight or nine or ten projects at once. You have to think about it typically one company does the commercial and then another company will undertake restoration and then another company (will) build a hotel another multifamily.”

Construction is expected to take three to six years. Once finished Hudson Heritage will create 750 permanent jobs and generate $8 million in annual property taxes including $2 million to the town.

“So we”™re fairly far along. About 65 to 70 percent pre-leased. ”¦Out of the 750 residential about 600 plus under letter of intent or contract. We”™re up in the air on the hotel and we”™re up in the air on the administration building” he said.

“I can”™t tell you who but we”™re going to contract with a developer who is going to build 360 units they plan to restore and reuse the church chapel library and one other building.”

The tour ends with a smile.

“When we”™re all done it”™ll be spectacular.”",,,,,,,,,

Following up our “Top 5 Youth Helmets” Let’s look at our top 5 varsity/adult football helmets on the market!

Before we get into the list there are a few important points. For starters no helmet can or will ever be 100% concussion-proof; when you walk on the football field there is always a risk involved. Next there are a number of factors to consider: weight fit comfort and to many aesthetics.

5. Schutt Vengeance Z10 LTD | $499 SchuttSports.com

Schutt has worked to cut weight as much as possible while still being as protective as possible. In recent years they’ve introduced the Helmet Stabilization System (HSS) lighter models and they continue to use their TPU design. Alvin Kamara wears a Schutt Vengeance Z10 LTD

Pros – The Z10 is light with a large variety of facemask options alongside Schutt’s HSS and their TPU padding technology. It also received 5-Stars in the Virginia Tech helmet study.

Cons – The Z10 LTD is used in relatively small numbers at the NFL level; mostly on defensive backs. It also has received conflicting test results; an impressive 5-Stars from Virginia Tech but a lower rating with the NFL’s helmet study.

Final Thoughts– The Vengeance Z10 LTD is a very impressive comfortable lightweight helmet that I would look into using if you’re at a skills position or favor a lighter piece of equipment.

Get the Schutt Vengeance Z10 LTD for $499 SchuttSports.com.

4. Xenith Shadow XR | $549 Xenith.com

From the very beginning of its existence Xenith has been making some of the more unique and scientifically driven helmets on the market. Their newest helmet the Shadow XR continues that trend. Nick Chubb wears a Xenith Shadow XR

Pros – Xenith’s bonnet system has consistently tested towards the very top of every major test since their inception. The XR variation of the Shadow uses new shock absorbers by RHEON that help it perform even better. The Shadow XR has a relatively small shell with a number of very large air vents helping the player’s head breathe during play. Their unique chinstrap system wraps around the head creating a consistent ‘custom’ fit on the fly.

Cons – Every Xenith helmet has been criticized rather heavily for its looks; quite frankly the general consensus is that they’re hideous. Customization options are rather limited; you have a rather small selection of facemasks and chinstraps to choose from.

Finals Thoughts – Xenith’s primary focus has always been to combat rotational forces with their bonnet system. If you’re not put off by the aesthetics of the helmet I would very highly recommend looking into Xenith’s technology.

The most popular and sought after helmet at every level of football the SpeedFlex which launched in 2014 packs every piece of innovation that Riddell offers into its sleek structure. Strap-Loc’s lock the top strap to the helmet the 4-point quick release facemask system helps medical staffs remove it in case of an emergency while the Ratchet-Loc and more recently the Cam-Loc systems have completely revolutionized how chinstraps are connected. Tua Tagovailoa wears a Riddell SpeedFlex

Pros – The SpeedFlex is incredibly popular and packed with technology.

Cons – The SpeedFlex is a large heavy helmet that may not be for smaller players. Customization options can be a bit limited; some of the more preferred facemask options can be a hassle to get your hands on and if you prefer the classic buckle chinstrap you’ll have to look outside of Riddell for good chinstrap options. Visors are a very popular helmet accessory but they’re typically a nightmare to put on the SpeedFlex due to its unique shape; newer models of visors are starting to combat this issue though.

Final Thoughts – When you think of helmets in 2020 your first thought is likely the SpeedFlex. Do some shopping to make sure it’s the right one for your position and body type but I’d be rather comfortable using it in-game.

Get the Speedflex for $410-$500 SportsUnlimited.com.

The fascinating plates along the top and back of the shell are likely the first thing to catch your eye; these are part of an impact system called the Tektonic Plate 3DM System. These plates move independently of the shell on impact absorbing energy. Schutt’s constant innovation has culminated in an impressive helmet the F7 VTD. The F7 VTD is worn by players like Jarvis Landry Kenyan Drake Mark Ingram and James Robinson.

Pros – The F7 utilizes the Helmet Stabilization System (HSS) jaw pads that help lock the player’s head into the helmet. The Tektonic Plate system and Schutt’s tried-and-true TPU padding are packed into the F7 VTD.

Cons – The F7 VTD is the most expensive helmet on this list sitting at $700 as of January 2021 (cheaper non-custom on Amazon). There are other models of F7 that can be found at a lower price but I personally favor the VTD model.

Finals Thoughts – The F7 is one of the fastest growing helmets at the NFL level and it’s easy to see why. If the price tag isn’t a concern the F7 could be a perfect option for you.

1. Riddell SpeedFlex Diamond | $499 Riddell.com

Riddell teamed up with 3D printing company Carbon to produce 3D printed padding for their custom helmets in tandem with Riddell’s Precision-Fit technology. In 2020 they released a retail version of it but this one is available to the public without the eye-popping price tag and the need to be scanned for your own model. Tyler Lockett wears a Riddell SpeedFlex Precision Diamond the custom fit version of the Riddell SpeedFlex Diamond

Pros – The SpeedFlex Diamond offers Riddell’s latest technology that used to be exclusive to the pros. Carbon’s Diamond technology has tested incredibly well during its very short lifetime; all the perks of the original SpeedFlex with even further improved technology!

Cons – The SpeedFlex Diamond is heavy heavy heavy. Coming in at 5 pounds or more the Diamond is undoubtedly the heaviest helmet on this list.

Finals Thoughts – Maybe not for smaller players. If you know exactly what you’re buying the SpeedFlex Diamond will be a great choice for you! The Riddell SpeedFlex Diamond with a clear shell showing the 3D printed padding

There’s our top 5 but we’re not done yet! It was hard to narrow the list down to just 5 helmets so I’ve got two Honorable Mentions I’m going to briefly highlight.

Honorable Mentions

The Speed was basically a coin-flip for the fifth spot on our list. The primary reason the Vengeance Z10 LTD was chosen over the Speed was age. The Speed continues to test well in every major study and is still popular at all levels but it’s over 10 years old at this point. An older helmet does not equal a bad helmet by any means but the newer helmet received the #5 spot.

VICIS ZERO1 | Unavailable

The VICIS ZERO1 worn by Pat Mahomes and Russell Wilson topped every study it was entered into and was heavily funded by the NFL and players that invested in the company but nonetheless the company experienced some financial issues and declared bankruptcy in 2019. Reformed under new ownership and developing a new helmet VICIS should be worth keeping an eye on. The ZERO1 itself bolstered an astronomical price tag and coupled with an uncertainty of its obtainability (currently unavailable on the web) and future it missed our top 5. If you can get your hands on one you’d be very happy wearing it.

Middle Tennessee authorities are on the lookout for a large four-door truck possibly linked to a fire earlier this year that resulted in a significant number of Bibles being burned inside a utility trailer near Pastor Greg Locke’s church.

Surveillance footage provided by the Wilson County Sheriff’s Office shows a truck believed to be white or of a similar light color fleeing the area around the time of the fire The Tennessean reported.

The incident occurred in front of the Global Vision Bible Church on Easter Sunday according to the Wilson County Sheriff’s Office. Police responded to the scene at about 6:30 a.m. prior to the day’s church service. No arrests have been made in connection with the case.

Pastor Locke addressed the congregation regarding the incident during Global Vision’s Easter service estimating that about 200 Bibles were destroyed. No injuries were reported and the Easter service proceeded as planned.

Authorities are treating the fire as an intentional act and are continuing their investigation.

Global Vision Bible Church has previously organized burning events involving materials deemed connected to witchcraft and the occult the Tennessean said. Locke however asserted his belief that the fire targeting the Bibles was directed specifically at the church.

Cash rewards are being considered for any information leading to the apprehension of those responsible for the incident according to officials.

During the Easter Sunday service Locke condemned the burning of the Bibles as evidence of Christianity being “under attack” in the United States.

“If you think Christianity is not under attack more than ever before in the United States of America you’ve not been paying attention. You need to get your head out of the sand. Quit being lukewarm” Locke declared. “I’m telling you they are attacking churches in America. Can I remind you for Evangelical believers and for Catholics for that matter this is the most important day historically and biblically that you can imagine? And now Joe Biden makes it Trans Visibility Awareness Day.”

In a statement posted on Facebook at the time Locke said a witness saw a man dropping off the trailer of Bibles near his church and setting it ablaze.

“Happy Resurrection Sunday. This morning at 6:00AM our security cameras caught a man dropping off a trailer in the middle of the intersection and blocking the road into our church. He then got out and set fire to an entire trailer full of Bibles right in front of our church” Locke wrote. “There was a lady that had driven through the night to get to our church and she was in the parking lot and was able to get the police officers here quickly but it was quite the scene to wake up to on my first morning back from Israel. Had to block traffic in all directions but they are almost finished cleaning it up. It's going to be a great day in the Lord.”

Authorities are urging anyone with pertinent information to come forward as the investigation into this event continues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEwMTFub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDQvc291dGhlYXN0LWxpbmNvbG4tY2h1cmNoLXN1c3RhaW5zLTE1LW1pbGxpb24tZGFtYWdlLWZpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southeast Lincoln church sustains $1.5 million in damage from fire,"LINCOLN Neb.

The church located at 6545 FM 107 was honored with a historical marker placed on its property by the Coryell County Historical Commission in May 1995 according to the Gatesville Messenger.

It was first organized as Coryell Creek Baptist Church in 1882 according to the marker.

In 1929 the church changed its name to Pecan Grove Baptist and moved its present location off FM 107.

The company closed the US$6.3 billion cash purchase of a Cigna Corp unit that sells life accident and disability insurance a transaction announced last December.

The takeover will add roughly 3000 employees and more than 9 million customers with the unit operating as a standalone business to be renamed New York Life Group Benefit Solutions.

""This acquisition the largest in our company's history reinforces our financial strength by generating capital"" New York Life Chief Executive Officer Ted Mathas said in a statement Thursday.

Such deals are a rarity for New York Life which operates as a mutual insurance company owned by its policyholders.

The company is among several life insurers that have made bets on businesses that sell policies through employers. Life insurers have increasingly gravitated toward group benefits because they're less sensitive to the low interest rates that have been a drag on investment income for years.

The coronavirus pandemic has also posed some challenges delaying the deal's completion by a quarter.

Covid-19 also is likely to weigh on New York Life's results this year and next because of higher mortality rates. Still the company is optimistic about the long-term strategy behind the acquisition.

""We are acquiring a great company that is a top-five player in this market that is going to enhance our capital generation and diversify our businesses and our risk"" Alain Karaoglan a New York Life senior vice president who's leading the integration said in an interview.

""We're not a serial acquirer so when we make acquisitions we have to be thoughtful methodical and purposeful about it. And this one fits perfectly.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kisah hidup Sang Nyai bukan sekadar cerita cinta picisan.

Cerita Nyai Dasima menyimpan sentimen rezim penjajah hingga dilema soal agama. Kisah Nyai Dasima begitu melegenda di Jakarta sejak bernama Batavia sehingga orang-orang menganggap Nyai Dasima benar-benar sosok yang pernah hidup di masa lalu.

'Tjerita Njai Dasima' mencuat lewat novelet (novel pendek) karya Gijsbert Francis yang diterbitkan oleh Kho Tjeng Bie & Co Batavia tahun 1896. Francis sendiri menyampaikan ceritanya berlatar belakang tahun 1813. Selepas Gisbert penulis lain kemudian menuliskan ulang (dengan sentimen berbeda) cerita Nyai Dasima salah satunya adalah SM Ardan tahun 1965.

Cerita Nyai Dasima versi G Francis

Pada 1813 hidup Edward W (Tuan W) dan Nyai Dasima di Curuk Tangerang. Dasima sendiri adalah perempuan pribumi dari Kampung Kuripan. Kehidupan rumah tangga mereka berlanjut ke Batavia tempat Edward W bekerja di toko Inggris kawasan Kota. Tuan W bekerja rutin dari pagi hingga jam lima sore.

Lokasi rumah Tuan W dan Nyai Dasima ada di Gambir dekat Kali Ciliwung. Di situ Tuan W dan Nyai Dasima hidup bahagia dan dikaruniai seorang anak gadis kecil bernama Nanci. Kebutuhan hidup Nyai Dasima senantiasa dicukupi oleh Tuan W. Seluruh gaji Tuan W selalu diserahkan ke Nyai Dasima untuk dikelola. Penampilan Nyai Dasima senantiasa memesona warga pribumi. Perhiasan dan kemewahan dia punya.

Dalam waktu dua tahun saja Nyai Dasima menjadi dikenal di kampung-kampung pribumi Batavia. Dia dikenal sebagai perempuan pribumi beragama Islam nan kaya raya menjadi 'bini piare (istri piaraan yang tidak sah)' dari pria kulit putih Nasrani.

Kemasyhuran Nyai Dasima sampai juga ke telinga pria beristri yang tinggal di Pejambon. Nama pria itu adalah Samiun. Dia memang sudah beristri nama istrinya Hayati. Namun demikian Samiun yang bekerja sebagai tukang tadah barang curian ini ingin mengambil hati Nyai Dasima.

Samiun menyuruh perempuan tua bernama Mak Buyung supaya menasihati Nyai Dasima agar meninggalkan hidup 'kumpul kebo' dengan Tuan W dan memulai hidup sesuai ajaran agamanya sendiri. Begini kata-kata Samiun ke Mak Buyung soal Nyai Dasima

""Kasian sekali itoe prampoean; dia dipiara oleh satoe lelaki kafir koewadjibannja kita orang Slam misti toentoen dianja kasi perdjalanan jang betoel tetapi dia kras hatinja dia terlaloe tjinta kapada itoe kafir maka itoe dengen akal kita misti tjaboet dianja dari sitoe"" kata Samiun kepada Mak Buyung sebagaimana tertulis dalam novelet karya G Francis.

Dalam artikel ini Anda akan mengetahui mengapa sulit untuk meninggalkan hubungan yang beracun dan bagaimana meninggalkan hubungan yang beracun untuk selamanya.

Penyebabnya yaitu seringkali karena manipulasi yang terlibat dalam sebuah hubungan. Alasan lain mengapa sulit untuk mengakui bahwa Anda berada dalam hubungan yang beracun adalah karena tidak ada pelecehan lahiriah. Pasangan Anda mungkin tidak memukul atau melanggar batasan seksual yang jelas tetapi itu tidak berarti Anda berada dalam hubungan yang sehat.

Berikut adalah sejumlah contoh racun dalam sebuah hubungan. Apakah pasangan Anda melakukan salah satu dari hal berikut?

- Tidak memberi Anda privasi

- Menjauhkan Anda dari teman keluarga keuangan

- Mencegah Anda bersekolah atau bekerja

- Sangat punya kendali dan cemburu

- Membuat semua keputusan dalam hubungan Anda

- Menekan Anda ke hal-hal yang tidak Anda sukai

- Membuat ""lelucon"" atau mengkritik Anda

- Tidak setia

- Hancurkan sejumlah properti baik miliknya maupun Anda

At a Glance A low-pressure system will track from the Great Lakes to New England through Saturday.

This storm will spread a wintry mess of snow and ice.

The snow and ice could contribute to travel problems in some areas. A New Year's storm spread snow and ice from Texas into the interior Northeast around New Year's Day causing hundreds of accidents from Missouri to Illinois.

The low pressure system named Winter Storm John by The Weather Channel took an unusual path from deep South Texas almost due northward through Texas and Oklahoma before taking a right and pushing across the southern Great Lakes and eventually through New England.

The storm started in Texas's Big Bend Region where it dumped up to two feet of snow near Alpine Texas on Dec. 30 2020.

Parts of western Texas picked up over 8 inches of snow. Big Spring about 35 miles east-northeast of Midland reported 14 inches of snow. Up to 2 feet of snow was reported in parts of Big Bend National Park. Snow drifts up to 20 inches were reported in Cisco about 45 miles east of Abilene.

Freezing rain was this storm's legacy in the Central U.S.

Ice accumulation was reported across several states from Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas to Michigan to Pennsylvania over the New Year's holiday making roads slippery and downing trees and branches.

A 38-year-old man was killed near St. Louis in the first couple of hours of 2021 when he jumped out of his crashed vehicle to warn other drivers of the icy roads but was then struck by another driver and fell from an overpass.

Advertisement In Kansas City hundreds of accidents were reported by state highway patrols including seven injuries.

Up to one-half inch ice accumulation was reported in Farmington Illinois and Seven Springs Pennsylvania. Accretions as high as 0.75 inches were reported in Missouri.

Over 100000 power outages were reported from Texas to Pennsylvania on New Years Day according to poweroutage.us.

Wichita Kansas picked up 6.5 inches of snow on Jan. 1 their heaviest calendar-day snowfall since Feb. 4 2014.

After an evening of freezing rain precipitation changed to heavy wet snow in Oklahoma by Friday morning. Snow fell at the rate of 2 inches per hour in Oklahoma City before sunrise Friday according to the National Weather Service. Will Rogers World Airport reported 5.1 inches of snow. Only the 2009-10 season (14 inches) has started out snowier in the Sooner State capital city than 2020-21.

The storm also produced a tornado in Central Georgia on New Years Day embedded in the storm's trailing cold front.

The winter storm moved eastward out of New England on Jan. 2 after dropping 6-12 inches of snow from northern New York to central Maine.

Do not read on unless you have watched season eight episodes one and two.

It’s hard to fathom that in just four weeks Spiral will be gone from our screens for good. Fifteen years an eight-season run and international acclaim is a good outcome for a French drama. It’s kept a high standard throughout with its signature blend of cerebral procedural and high-octane cops and robbers. Laure Berthaud and her crew of roughnecks will be missed – especially BTL on this blog.

The laundromat murder

The fallout from l’affaire Gilou continues to rain down on our heroes. Three months of criminal chump change have left the gang frustrated and forlorn. What better way to get back in the game than to take on a messy murder guaranteed to make them even less popular? When a dead kid shows up in a tumble dryer Laure is all over that action like caramelised onion on a croissant.

The unfortunate youth known nominally as Shkun was part of a loose collective of undocumented minors from Morocco living in squats and running wild in the 18th arrondissement. Early suspect Souleymane spends his days mugging tourists and his nights bombed on benzos. He is not above violence against his friends either as the assault on Shkun reveals. However when his laser-tag alibi exonerates him of murder we are forced to look elsewhere for the culprit.

The white van that spirits Souleymane away suggests exploitation by organised crime. Bigger players seem certain to enter the fray.

Gilou

That perennial survivor Escoffier is already making a big impression in prison. Turning down the protective custody offered to incarcerated flics he settles down into gen pop targeting le grand fromage of the wing Cisco. A summary beatdown followed by a high-risk bait-and-switch on Cisco’s phone leads to an intense steak-and-chill session in the Romanian’s cell. Cisco is quietly impressed that Gilou never ratted out his colleagues. Gilou is quietly impressed with the tender yet flavourful rump he is presented with. Lovers of bromance will be disappointed however as Gilou is working an angle – getting close to Cisco to try and pin a revenge murder on him. Brémont hints that when Cisco gets out in two days Gilou may be exiting with him to pull off the sting. Two career criminals back on the street – the French justice system continues to perplex.

Laure

We’ve seen Laure’s abandonment issues surface before and with Tintin gone Gilou in prison and Roban replaced with a younger and altogether less friendly model the very last thing she needs is Ali agitating to leave and head up his own crew. Like Tintin before him Ali despairs at the secrets-and-lies culture Laure perpetuates. Whether or not her (literally) phoned-in apology will get him back on board remains to be seen. When she tries to bond with new face Judge Lucie Bourdieu she immediately rubs her up the wrong way. That’s Laure for you – making enemies in high places wherever she goes.

Joséphine

If the early indications were that domesticity with Lola had blunted Joséphine’s edges we are quickly disabused of that notion once she catches a glimpse of herself in the smart feral Souleymane. She can still sniff a procedural infraction from 500 yards and with a flourish of her gown she gets the youngster out of custody and into child protection. The same old Joséphine then? Not quite. The trauma of the last two seasons has left its mark – she now specialises in rape cases presumably advocating for the victims. France’s serial killers and terrorists will now have to look elsewhere for their sturdy defence.

Investor confidence of doing business in the Ugandan economy today has remained low one year after the general election an economist has said.

Ms Sarah Arapta Wojega the managing director Citibank said domestically the election was largely perceived to be peaceful but business confidence took a huge beating in 2016.



“Business confidence saw one it its lowest points in the recent past. Our GDP growth declined to 4.9 per cent against the target of 4.5 per cent. Under pressure from banks some business lobby teamed up and approached government for a bailout. The banking sector saw an unprecedented non-performing loans rate of 8.3 per cent the highest in banking sector industry in the recent past” she said.

She added: “All these events had a huge effect on our economic growth and had effect on the decline of the economic growth.”

Ms Arapta was speaking to Citibank clients who gathered to listen to Dr David Cowan a Citi Research Africa Economist at Citigroup Global Markets Limited.

“While loss of business confidence was understandable in the run-up to and immediately after the February 2016 elections the fact that it has remained under pressure throughout much of last year is perhaps more difficult to explain” Dr Cowan said.

Also addressing top company executives at Kampala Serena Hotel yesterday he said the low confidence is due to many reasons both political and economic factors.

He said the concerns over government fiscal policy particularly the high recurrent expenditure and increased domestic borrowing have spilled over into the Uganda Shilling causing it to weaken further.

During her visit to Uganda International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde warned Uganda on debt accumulation.

Ms Lagarde who held bilateral talks with President Museveni at State House in Entebbe said there was need for Uganda to scale up its infrastructure in order to boost production that would translate into better economic growth for the country. But the pursuit of infrastructural development is also piling up the country’s debt burden raising concerns around its sustainability.

“There has to be a good balance between concessional and non-concessional loans. The second point is that macroeconomic stability is a key that is looked at by the investors and by the lenders; be it from private sector or bilateral institutions or countries” Ms Lagarde said.

In November Uganda’s credit rating was downgraded by credit rating agency Moody’s in part because of concerns on debt affordability that had been a persistent vulnerability for Uganda.

Government arrears

Mr Cowan who is in the country at the invitation of Citibank Uganda also said the slow pace of arrears clearance and the ongoing internal reconciliation exercise of government arrears has slowed down the private sector led growth with many of these companies failing to pay back bank loans thereby crippling the financial sector.

In June last year a group of companies came together to seek for a government bailout to the tune of Shs1.3 trillion owed to banks. The companies claimed some of their debts were owed by government.

Indeed the failure to manage the loans affected some banks with Crane Bank being sold off to dfcu Bank by the industry regulator.

According to Bank of Uganda (BoU) one of the reasons Crane Bank became undercapitalised in a space of a year was because of the failure by borrowers to honour their debt obligations.

In 2015 Crane Bank had a non-performing loans portfolio of Shs142 billion. They made provisions of Shs50 billion for bad and doubtful debts. The high loans eroded the minimum capital causing the central bank to take over the bank.

Shilling depreciation

In 2014 the Shilling depreciated by 10.8 per cent due to the weak commodity exports and global strengthening of the US dollar.

The global strengthening of the US dollar coupled with wide current deficit saw the Uganda Shilling depreciating by 17.5 per cent in 2015. This reflected that the Shilling was weaker compared to the previous year. At 17.5 per cent the Shilling was worst hit by other currencies in the region.

In 2016 the local unit depreciated by by 5.5 per cent.

Mr Cowan said the factor which largely explains this trend is capital flows or the funding of the current account deficit.

“In Kenya this is much more private sector driven whereas in Uganda and Tanzania official flows are more important and they have become somewhat erratic. And the fact that large flows in the market can have a much more de-stabilising impact in Uganda and Tanzania than in Kenya.",,,,,,

Addressing a news conference at the launch of the sale of National Insurance Corporation (NIC) right issue shares in Kampala yesterday the chief executive officer of Crested Stocks & Securities Mr Robert H Baldwin said the importance of having a Ugandan investment bank would help in building the expertise of local citizens as well as provision of jobs internally instead of relying on investment banks from outside Uganda to do investment banking services for stock market brokers who do the technical work of corporate listing of shares or issuing corporate bonds.

He said investment banking helps companies and governments and their agents to raise money by issuing and selling securities/shares in the markets.

One outstanding importance of investment banks services is that they provide corporate finance and advisory work normally in connection with new issues of securities for raising finance take-overs merges and acquisitions.



In the current NIC right issue Crested Stocks and Securities partnered with Standard Investment Bank of Kenya to do the technical work/advise in arranging the right issue shares currently on sale.



Mr Baldwin said most of the investment banks providing technical and advisory works regarding issuing of securities in the Ugandan market are from Kenya.

Uganda currently has licensing classes as per the 2004 Financial Institution Act under which the Bank of Uganda licenses commercial banks Microfinance Depositing taking Institutions Forex Bureaus and Money Remittance.

Commercial banks’ role is more of lending funds to the general public as opposed to investment bank’s roles is which provides advisory services to companies to raise funds in the capital markets.

Commenting on the NIC’s right issue Mr Baldwin said the right issue being done by NIC will lead to increased activities and liquidity levels of the Uganda Securities exchange.

The managing director of National Insurance Corporation Mr Bayo Folayan said that through the right issue they want raise Shs8.4 billion for expansion of the company’s operations to the country side.

The sale of right issue of NIC begins today (Friday November 22nd to December 13) and shareholders have been advised to take their right issue shares in full which go for Shs26 per share.",,,,,,,,,

Masks will still be required for a while and senior shopping hours Clorox disinfecting wipe shortages and even social distancing are here to stay.

There are some intriguing supermarket changes to look forward to though says the Supermarket Guru Phil Lempert. For over 25 years he has been an author speaker and analyst on grocery store consumer behavior marketing trends new products and more. We spoke with him and gathered other data to prepare you for what grocery stores will look like in 2021. (And before your next trip check out the 100 Easiest Recipes You Can Make so you can add the ingredients to your list.)

Less delivery options

Grocery delivery saw a huge increase in popularity this year because it is safer than shopping in-store. Chains updated their websites apps and click and collect services (like pickup lockers!). Some grocers even added pickup for the very first time.

Lempert believes this trend is temporary because some people simply prefer picking their own items even if going inside the grocery store is considered to be more dangerous. With that said the various types of grocery delivery options may be reduced.

For more on how to stay safe should you decide to go to your local supermarket here are 10 Grocery Store Safety Tips From a Health Expert.

More robots

Meatpacking plants saw the number of coronavirus cases among workers skyrocket in 2020. Over 10000 Tyson employees tested positive between March and July. Smithfield was fined thousands of dollars for outbreaks at its meatpacking plants and other companies like Hormel Cargill National Beef and more also saw employees get sick. Lempert believes this will pave the way for robots to have larger jobs in these types of facilities. But you may also potentially see more robots working inside your local grocery store.

Reservation slots for shopping times

Expect to approach grocery shopping like going to a restaurant: You'll go to a reservation making website then pick your preferred time to shop. Next Lempert predicts that you'll be asked to select any non-produce grocery store items (""the stove-top stuffing the Heinz ketchup"" Lempert says) that you'll need during your trip so that those can be retrieved bagged and ready for you once you arrive for your reservation. At that point you can peruse the produce aisles then checkout.

All of this of course will be in an effort to reduce crowding and encourage social distancing. (Related: The Worst Grocery Stores of 2020.)

New grocery store sites

Because of the previous prediction Lempert says grocery store websites are going to be significantly more detailed than they are now. ""The data that's on most retailer's websites is horrible and outdated"" he says. ""The ingredients are typically wrong. The nutritional information is wrong. The product gets updated probably about once every nine months. That's not right.""

One way some grocery chains are already using their platforms to help inspire change is by highlighting minority-owned food brands inside their stores.

Less space

Another huge change you can expect? A new layout! ""The size of your grocery store will likely be cut in half Lempert says. ""The back half of the store will be fully robotic and those robots will now be picking the items that you ordered online.""

The front of the store will be all the fresh items you can shop for yourself as well as the baker butcher and produce sales associates whom you can still ask for help. But this way ""You're going to be able to pick all those fresh foods that you want and you're going to have a much better shopping experience"" Lempert says.

Less time in-store

Because of his new prediction about the way we will shop customers will spend a lot less time inside shopping Lempert says. One trip will consist of about 10 minutes picking out fresh produce and deli items grabbing the bags of items from the center of the store that the robots packed up for you and simply checking out.

Before 2020 Lempert thought it would take about three to five years for this change to happen but because of the coronavirus pandemic he says it will only take six or seven months.

More comfort foods

Kroger also released its predictions for what's in store for 2021 and one trend is the continued rise of comfort foods. Things like quick-cook risotto white cheddar macaroni and cheese and even brown butter truffle ice cream will be on shelves for you and your family. This trend dominated 2020 too. But as you shop keep in mind The Shocking Side Effect of Eating Comfort Food.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

More fresh and prepared foods

Convenience is key especially during—and after—a pandemic. ""We're buying frozen foods and more convenient offerings"" Lempert says. ""And if you look at the prepared foods offerings in the supermarket—the freshly prepared ones—they're going through the roof because people just want to microwave or put food in the oven.""

That said here are 12 Frozen Dinners to Always Leave on Grocery Store Shelves.

Fewer items to choose from

Some of your favorite companies have downsized this year. Coca-Cola announced it's discontinuing 200 drink brands Kraft-Heinz is cutting 20% of its products and quite a few more are cutting down. Even if products return ever so slightly to normal production the way factories are built now doesn't quite allow for safety measures to be implemented (that Lempert believes are here to stay).

For more here are All of the Beloved Grocery Items That Are Secretly Being Discontinued.

More sustainable products and transparency

For the products that do make it to grocery store shelves in 2021 transparency about their ingredients and where they were grown or made will be important. Lempert says companies want to keep sustainability in mind with their products and that will be reflected because now ""we really don't have a choice"" about whether or not to care about the environment. For more on this prediction here are 20 Ways to Be More Sustainable When It Comes to Food.

More Immune-supporting foods

Thanks to the influx of safety rules and regulations COVID-19 gave us the experts at Kroger believe foods that help keep us healthy and support the immune and digestive system will see more popularity in 2021. On your next trip to one of the grocery store chain's almost 3000 stores look out for products like almond butter organic sparkling kefir water caffeinated water and even elderberry gummies. (Related: The 7 Healthiest Foods to Eat Right Now.)

More self-driving trucks

Walmart started to test driverless trucks in Arkansas in 2019 and so far those vehicles have driven more than 70000 miles on their own (but with a safety driver inside) the grocery store chain says. Now the initiative is moving to Louisiana.

Lempert believes this trend will expand next year because of the increased importance of sustainability the cost and much more. But it's not just driverless grocery chain trucks you may see out and about: Walmart is also testing drone delivery.

Fewer CBD food products

All the CBD items you saw sprouting up in your local supermarket this year may not have the same luck in 2021 Lempert says. This is because these products aren't regulated so the amount of CBD in them ranges based on the manufacturer. Lempert does believe they will come back though once the government gets involved and forces companies to show the total CBD percentage and other information on labels. (Related: What Happens to Your Body on CBD.)

Cleaner ingredients in alternative meats

The number of meat alternative products that entered the market in 2020 has given shoppers tons of options. But new options will contain a few other things besides just plant-based protein. ""What we're really seeing is flexitarianism will be much more important"" Lempert says. ""It's not about extremes; being all-vegan or an omnivore.""

This means you may see blended meat options featuring both mushrooms and beef or cauliflower and pork. Until then here are 33 Easy Plant-Based Recipes Even Carnivores Will Love.

More items from restaurant chains

""I think we're going to see a lot more restaurant-supermarket partnerships"" Lempert says of grocery stores in 2021. ""Prepackaged foods made fresh from the restaurant and delivered to the supermarket on a daily basis.""

This is a win-win for both—especially as the restaurant industry continues to struggle because of the pandemic.

A bigger emphasis on health

Right now the most super of supermarkets aka Walmart is starting to distribute one of the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines to healthcare workers in New Mexico with plans to supply it at over 5000 stores and pharmacies across the country. The Supermarket Guru says Walmart will continue to promote and grow the health clinics in their stores. (Related: 8 Ways to Shop Safely at Walmart Right Now.)

More indoor and verticle farming

You may not see these in your local grocery store but they may be popping up just down the street thanks to now-empty office buildings that can be converted into indoor farms. ""That's the perfect place to put in vertical farms because you can serve the population closer"" says Lempert. ""Produce also grows three times faster because it's in a controlled environment. Right now most indoor farming is either tomatoes or leafy greens. But that's about to change.""

Water is boiled to form steam that rotates the turbines that is in turn coupled with a generator produces electricity.The steam formed is then condensed to form water. Some of it is lost to leakage while some more gets evaporated during the condensation process. The Budge Budge plant that was set up in 1997 with one unit of 250 MW to which two more units of same capacity were added in 1999 and 2010 has managed to considerably minimise water loss over the past two decades.Among the many innovative processes adopted to achieve the reduction include the effective “dry fog” system an official said.The internationally-renowned Energy and Environment Foundation (EEF) has awarded the Energy and Environment Foundation Global Award to Budge Budge recognising the achievement.,,,,,,,,,

Developed by Graphic Packaging International KeelClip is a unique paperboard design that not only replaces plastic rings top clips and shrink wrap multipacks for cans; it also offers merchandising benefits that similar beverage packaging does not. The concept combines an efficient paperboard lid that covers the tops of the cans. A paperboard flap attached underneath the center of the lid slips in between the two rows of cans. This flap provides stability to the pack in much the same way that the keel provides stability to a sailboat. KeelClip works with the widest range of cans and multi-count configurations and at the speeds required by large beverage operations allowing brand owners to present a premium and sustainable image with a billboard for branding and can orientation.

Notably Coca-Cola HBC has successfully begun the roll out of technology in The Republic of Ireland Northern Ireland and Austria. The firm says this first step in its commitment to replace plastic wrap on all can multipacks in its European Union markets will save more than 3000 metric tons of CO 2 and 2000 metric tons of plastic each year.

This new “Grip&Go” packaging is the result of a €15 million ($17734800) investment by the company in a strategic partnership with Graphic Packaging International and forms part of a wider commitment by Coca-Cola HBC and its partner The Coca-Cola Company to build a more sustainable approach to packaging. The rollout across all the company’s EU markets plus Switzerland will be complete by early 2022.

“By investing in this innovative new technology we are directly supporting our customers and their consumers by providing a more sustainable packaging format” says Marcel Martin Group Supply Chain Director at Coca-Cola HBC. “At the same time we are delivering on our commitment to make a more positive environmental impact.”

Alan Crawford Trading Director SPAR/EUROSPAR Ireland says “Coca-Cola HBC has taken a leadership position in the soft drink category introducing a really new and exciting type of packaging. The move to the new KeelClip and paperboard packaging will eliminate a significant amount of packaging from our supply chain which is very important for us as an organization and the environment we operate within. The appearance of the multipack cans in KeelClip packaging is also more attractive to our customers so we expect the change to support increased sales as well as taking an important sustainability position.”

As part of the initial agreement with Graphic Packaging Coca-Cola HBC will install 11 KeelClip machines in seven countries which will supply the solution across all its EU countries.

“We are committed to work with Coca-Cola HBC to deliver this exciting innovation” says Steve Gould new product development and marketing director of the beverage division at Graphic Packaging. “We will continue to support the ongoing rollout and commercialization across Coca-Cola HBC’s EU markets and are delighted to be partners in this endeavor.”

The suit [CS 213] filed on April 24 is seeking for an injunction restricting Riham from further infringement on Coca Cola brand contents and shelving all products on the market which are purportedly considered infringements.

The injunction also seeks to stop Riham from producing products that are confusingly similar to the plaintiff’s [Coca Cola]. The row between the two companies began at the start of this year after Harris International launched a soda line manufacturing two brands including Riham Cola and Riham Fun-time with a third one [Riham Wats Up] expected later this year.

The two brands [Riham Cola Vs Coca Cola (500ml bottle)] appear to have similarities in relation to brand colours packaging content colour and names among others.

In an e-mail exchange Mr Bob Okello the Coca Cola East Africa public affairs manager told the Daily Monitor that although they had alerted the offender Riham had seemed undeterred.

“This is a matter of pure trademark infringement which has left us with no any other recourse but to seek court redress” Mr Okello said.

However Mr Alex Rezida the Harris International lawyer told the Daily Monitor that his client was shocked by Coca Cola’s action since negotiations concerning a number of modifications had been on-going.

According to Mr Rezida Riham’s last exchange with Coca cola was on April 24 the date on which the case was filed. He says his clients had sent Coca Cola a modified bottle with a number of changes. However they (Riham) do not understand the turn around.”

Origin

The row originates from the 500ml bottle which according to Coca Cola is confusingly similar to theirs. But in regard to the negotiations Riham had initiated a number of modifications on its 500ml bottle introducing changes in brand colour and bottle top coulour.

The bottle which the Daily Monitor has seen had been modified with its bottle top colour changed from red to chocolate brown coupled with introduction of a brownish allure in the brand colour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbW1vZGl0aWVzL3J3ZW56b3JpLXdhdGVyLXRvLWJlLWJvdHRsZWQtYnktY29jYS1jb2xhLWluLW5ldy1tZXJnZXItZGVhbC0xNTkyMzQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rwenzori water to be bottled by Coca-Cola in new merger deal,"Kampala- Rwenzori Mineral Water will soon be bottled by Coca-Cola following an agreement between SABMiller plc and Gutsche Family Investments (GFI majority shareholders in Coca-Cola Sabco) to combine the bottling operations of their non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages businesses in Southern and East Africa.

The new bottler Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will serve 12 high-growth countries accounting for approximately 40 per cent of all Coca-Cola beverage volumes in Africa.

Rwenzori MineralWater boasts of about 65 per cent share of the bottled water market in Uganda and the anticipated operational efficiencies of this merger are likely to see the company further strengthen its market leadership position.

“A combined Coca-Cola bottling operation is further evidence of our commitment to Africa and our firm belief in the tremendous growth prospects that the continent offers” said Muhtar Kent chairman and chief executive officer The Coca-Cola Company.

“As one of the top 10 largest Coca-Cola bottling partners worldwide Coca-Cola Beverages Africa can leverage the scale resources capability and efficiency needed to accelerate Coca-Cola growth and contribute to the economic and social prosperity of African communities.”

“Soft drinks are an important element of our growth strategy. This transaction increases our exposure to the total beverage market in Africa. The opportunity is significant with favourable demographics and economic development pointing to excellent growth prospects” said Mr Alan Clark the SABMiller chief executive.

He added: “This also signifies a strengthening of our strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company.”

On full completion of the proposed merger shareholdings in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will be SABMiller: 57.0 per cent Gutsche Family Investments: 31.7 per cent and The Coca-Cola Company: 11.3 per cent.

Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) will suspend a clause that allows it to set prices for distributors of its non-alcoholic drinks following a probe by the Comesa Competition Commission.

The probe found that stipulation of prices by CCBA a subsidiary of the Atlanta based Coca-Cola Company subjects consumers to high prices.

The move follows investigation which found that “the stipulation of prices by a market leader was likely to lead to an inflation of prices of competing brands in the market”.

The Coca-Cola unit following findings of the probe the Comesa Competition Commission said has already undertaken to amend its agreements to remove clauses that stipulate the prices and profit margins for its products.

“CCBA undertook to implement a compliance programme designed to ensure that its employees management and directors do not engage in conduct that contravenes the regulations” the commission said.

According to the Comesa Competition Commission monitoring of the beverages sector will continue to ensure compliance in order to create a fair competition.

The commission is charged with the responsibility of checking against anti-competitive practices as well as overseeing mergers and acquisitions across Africa.

Last year the commission cleared the acquisition of Monsanto Company by Bayer paving the way for the acquisition.

Bayer and St Louis-based Monsanto are two of the world’s biggest agricultural companies and currently compete to sell farmers seed and crop protection products."

MTN has said it is not under any pressure to list on the stock exchange arguing the telecom is a private company and has not received any instructions in that regard.

Speaking in an interview a source at MTN familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because he is not authorised to comment about it said they are not aware of any condition that has been put forward in regard to renewing their 20-year licence that is due to expire in October.

The process of renewing the licence he said is on track noting that there was no problem in that area because the company has a 10-year renewal guarantee.

However he said the company was cognizant of the fact that different suggestions will be made during the process by both government and other stakeholders.

In an interview Mr Val Okecho the MTN communications manager told Daily Monitor they had not formally or informally received any communication from the regulator requiring the telecom to list as a prerequisite for renewal of its licence.

“We have not received [any communication to list on the stock exchange] as a condition for the renewal of our licence. We only read about these things in media” he said.

In June Finance Minister Matia Kasaija told participants during the 8th National Competitiveness Forum that his Ministry would table a policy paper before Cabinet seeking mandatory listing of all telecoms.

“I am going to table a memo in Cabinet next week (in June) which seeks to make all telecoms and privatised public companies list [sell shares to Ugandans]” he said noting that other companies such as Uganda Grain Milling Company Kakira Sugar Works Tororo Cement Lake Victoria Hotel and Apollo Hotel now Sheraton Kampala Hotel among others would be required to list.

Daily Monitor could not immediately establish the status of Mr Kasaija’s policy paper as he was reportedly away in China.

Uganda has three privately-owned telecoms including MTN Airtel and Africell.

A report filed by Bloomberg a news website has last month indicated that MTN was being pressured to list on the stock exchange pending renewal of its licence.

However Mr Okecho said there had been no such pressure even as the telecom was oblivious of considerations to list on the Uganda Securities Exchange.

“We are aware that following successful listings by MTN in Ghana and Nigeria the call for MTN Uganda to follow suit has never been clearer. It is [actually] under consideration” he said.

Mr Godfrey Mutabazi the Uganda Communications Commission executive director early this week told Daily Monitor they will hold discussions on the issue (listing on the exchange) with the telecom during licence renewal.

“It is [going to be] part of the discussions that will be taking place during licence renewal” he said but did not indicate whether it will be mandatory for all telecoms to list.

Ms Sumin Namaganda the Airtel communications manager told Daily Monitor yesterday they had not received any communication to requiring them to list on the Uganda Securities Exchange.

Requirement of new licencing regime

The new licencing regime will also require telecoms to have base stations in every parish as well as ensuring that Uganda is 100 per cent covered with 3G network access.

However telecoms have already indicated that this will impact their business operations because it is an expensive affair yet it does not make business sense to have coverage in some areas.

The new licencing regime seeks to enable Uganda Communications Commission to implement the National Roaming Services plan that allows users to be hosted on other telecom’s network in areas where a particular telecom has no coverage.

Such a hefty deal comes with lofty expectations.

When Fisher bolted for ""Aggieland"" it was less than a year after the Seminoles played in their last Orange Bowl game to date and just four years removed from winning a national championship.

That won't be a possibility for the fifth-ranked Aggies (8-1) in Saturday night's Orange Bowl against No. 14 North Carolina (8-3) but a win would signify a similar trajectory for Texas A&M as Florida State found during Fisher's time in Tallahassee.

""We had the Orange Bowl the third year there"" Fisher told reporters Friday recalling Florida State's 31-10 Orange Bowl victory over Northern Illinois to conclude the 2012 season. ""I think first of all getting in and being able to set your culture understand what you want offensively and defensively to the players with any organization the work ethic the practice styles the type of ball you want to play who you want to have as a personality as an organization and then in recruiting going out and getting the kind of guys that you think that fit. There's a lot of great players in this country and you've got to get guys that you think fit your system and what you do.""

Alan Diaz/AP Florida State head coach Jim Fisher celebrates next to the Orange Bowl trophy after defeating Northern Illinois 31-10 at the Orange Bowl Jan. 1 2013 in Miami Gardens Florida.

One season later Fisher's Seminoles went 14-0 with Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston and laid claim to the school's third national championship in program history.

Along the way the Seminoles won 29 consecutive games beginning with the first of three Atlantic Coast Conference championships from 2012-14.

The Aggies who arrived in South Florida on Thursday own a seven-game winning streak headed into the Orange Bowl.

""Hopefully we can keep heading in the same progression in which we had at Florida State and things we did and we were able to have great success there"" Fisher said. ""But you have to get in these situations and play these types of games to understand how to be the team that you really want to be and win championships.""

The coach on the opposing sideline believes Texas A&M's championship aspirations are closer to becoming a reality under Fisher.

""Well Jimbo won a national championship and to do that you've got to have a plan"" North Carolina coach Mack Brown said. ""You've got to be confident and Jimbo knows exactly what he wants in his football team.""

Brown who also won a national championship while coaching at Texas admitted the challenges the Aggies face playing in the Southeastern Conference against Western Division foes like Alabama (A&M's lone loss of the season) and LSU. But if there's anyone who can accomplish it Brown said it's Fisher.

""He knows he's a great coach"" Brown said of Fisher. ""He's done a tremendous job. He gets them in the right place. They've recruited as well as anybody in the country every year and I'm really really impressed with Jimbo Fisher and what he's done at A&M.""

The Aggies haven't won a conference championship since 1998 (when they played in the Big 12 Conference) and haven't won a national title since 1939. That was five years before A&M's first and only other Orange Bowl appearance -- a 19-14 loss to LSU.

Fisher meanwhile is a perfect 6-0 at Hard Rock Stadium winning all four meetings between Florida State and Miami in South Florida and going 2-0 in Orange Bowl games most recently a 33-32 victory over Michigan in 2016.

Alan Diaz/AP Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher raises his fist after the Seminoles won the Orange Bowl Saturday Dec. 31 2016 in Miami Gardens Fla. Florida State defeated Michigan 33-32.

""I've always recruited Florida even when I didn't coach at Florida State and to be able to come back to South Florida -- this was always my area -- I feel very blessed"" Fisher said. ""It's always a good feeling to come back down here. Like I've always said it's one of the best areas of high school football there is in the country if not the best. I mean it's phenomenal. I love coming back here. A lot of great memories. A lot of great battles at the stadium at the Rock and having great games with Miami Orange Bowl different things and very blessed to come out with some great outcomes. Hopefully we'll have another.""

To do so the Aggies will need to stop North Carolina's prolific but depleted offense.

The Tar Heels lead the nation in total offense (6123 yards) and rank third nationally in total points scored (473). However they'll be without four starters including three on offense who opted out of the bowl game.

Running backs Michael Carter and Javonte Williams each totaled more than 1000 rushing yards while receiver Dyami Brown led the team with more than 1000 receiving yards. Those are gaping losses for quarterback Sam Howell who has passed for 3352 yards and 27 touchdowns and has thrown a touchdown pass at least once in all 24 games of his college career.

It's not lost on Fisher what winning Saturday night could mean for the future of his program.

""Well I hope so"" Fisher said of the program turning a corner. ""That's what our plan is. You've got to understand something no matter what you do in the past and how much success you have the next day the score is always 0-0. You have to establish that and I think that's going to be do our young players understand the standard in which we've set down? How do we carry it on and how do we improve it? Because the standard now has to keep going up no matter what happens because that's just the way life is. You've got to continue to get better.""

Sam Craft/AP Texas A&M head coach Jimbo Fisher talks to his team during a timeout of a game against LSU Saturday Nov. 28 2020 in College Station Texas.

So far so good. A&M has finished among the top six in the national recruiting rankings each of the past two seasons and is poised for another top six finish in 2021. Two of the Aggies' early signees -- four-star running back Amari Daniels and four-star receiver Yulkeith Brown -- both hail from Miami.

""We continue to keep recruiting players down here"" Fisher said. ""Our brand and we're recruiting Texas to death but we're also recruiting nationally. This has always been a great area for us. We've signed guys from down here since I've been here. We'll sign more guys this year and it's expanding your brand and what you do and you have a lot of relationships that are in South Florida and so it's always great to get back down and hopefully see some of those folks and let them see you play.""

Come Sunday morning the championship ambitions of Fisher and his program could be one step closer to reality."

The retailer has revealed that the fire sale of assets last year realised Sh657 million—shrinking the value of its moveable assets from Sh753 million in 2019 to Sh136 million as at June 30 2020.

Choppies said that local shareholders would take over 25 percent of the debt (Sh312 million).

Parin Bharatkumar Patel and Birju Pradipkumar Patel are the two directors of the Export Trading Group (ETG) which sold Ukwala Supermarkets to Choppies and became partners in a joint venture.

The Botswana owners have also committed to personally pay 72 million Botswana Pula (Sh681 million) if further Kenya debts materialise.

“All the stores except the equipment of one store were disposed of during the financial year and the realised amounts have been used to settle the liabilities. Choppies Enterprises Kenya Limited and Choppies Distribution Kenya Limited closed with potential liability of (Sh1.2 billion) P132 million to which 25 percent of the amount will be borne by the local shareholders. The remaining formalities will be completed during 2021” the company said.

The company disclosed that it had taken a loan of Sh300 million from Absa Bank Kenya which had been used to expand its footprint that stood at 12 stores in Nairobi six branches in Kisumu city and eight others spread across major towns including Nakuru Kisii and Kericho before its collapse.

Payment for the three-year bank loan at an interest rate of 12.7 percent was supposed to kick in August this year.

The money was however secured by a corporate guarantee provided by Choppies Enterprises Limited and moveable assets.

Choppies also disclosed that it had guaranteed supplier credit to its Kenyan subsidiary to the tune of Sh77 million.

This included money owed to Kapa Oil (Sh20 million) Unga Limited (Sh27 million) Del Monte (Sh10 million( and Tiger Brands (Sh20 million).

Sources among suppliers indicate that not all debts have been settled as they await directions on verification and clearance.

Last year Choppies’ local owners ETG tried to bail out the retailer by settling 50 percent of a Sh600 million supplier debt at the time. Suppliers were convinced to resume stocking the retailer’s shelves and receive part payment with the other 50 percent split into two tranches and paid within three months after every six weeks.

The supermarket chain however continued to suffer stock-outs and ended up closing branches and firing staff before finally deciding to exit the market. The closure of Choppies brings to an end the legacy of Ukwala Supermarkets which is under liquidation over inability to pay debts estimated to be about Sh1 billion.

Its owner ETG an agri-business and logistics company has its origins in Kenya since 1967 and was initially focused on distributing and marketing products manufactured by multinationals in Kenya such as Colgate-Palmolive and Del Monte to neighbouring countries.

The planned closure and exit of Choppies has also sparked a tax dispute with the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) which sought to freeze its bank accounts to secure Sh173.3 million in taxes.",,,,,,,,,

Early on they shifted much of their in-person yarn business to their newly minted website offering pickup for local customers.

Once they were able to open to customers they reconfigured their Kerrytown shop to accommodate social distancing rules ditching their communal tables and other features.

But Spun is no longer cramped for space. In late May the Sickman-Garners relocated to the first-floor location previously occupied by Hollander’s.

Once just 1000 square feet upstairs Spun now occupies triple that amount. It also has two entrances–one inside Kerrytown’s Market Building the other in the Godfrey Building facing Fourth Ave.

The move has long been front of mind Pete emails. “Even before the pandemic we had mentioned to [Kerrytown owner Joe O’Neal] that if a bigger space came up we’d be interested.”

In the five years since Spun opened “we saw demand for many products that we didn’t have room to carry” he writes. “We did our best to stuff the original shop with new items but it became so crowded that it started to have an impact on everyone’s experience guests and staff alike.”

Spun also had a greater demand for classes than its available space could accommodate.

When Hollander’s spot came open “it became a guessing game–will the pandemic recede to the point where the economy can open enough to make it work and when will that happen? So we watched the news read everything we could from the CDC and other sources and eventually took the risk.”

Along with many new colors and types of yarn they’ve added a selection of cross-stitch and other embroidery kits and supplies fiber for spinning spinning wheels drop spindles and Cricket weaving looms used to make fabric.

There’s now a dedicated learning space with tables that can accommodate up to fifteen people when in-person classes resume this month. They plan to offer more than three dozen sessions ranging from beginning knit and crochet classes to ‘project-focused ones. There also will be basic spinning and weaving classes as well as in-person private lessons.

An especially exciting feature is the Fourth Ave. entrance which will let people stay for classes after the rest of the building closes. This month Spun will extend its evening hours from Monday through Thursday; watch its website or Facebook page for updates.

Along with drop-in sessions the store will offer Tuesday night sweater clinics and a beginners’ roundtable on Wednesdays. For those still wary of coming in they’re continuing to offer pickup and curbside collection.

Writes Pete: “We have re-launched everything we do and then some.”

Upstairs in the Godfrey Building Heather Dupuis has opened the Pilates Barn & Wellness–the successor to her Vie Fitness & Spa locations on Ashley downtown and in Arbor Hills Crossing on Washtenaw.

Along with one-on-one instructors spinning and Pilates classes Vie was one of the first places in town to sell upscale Lululemon workout gear along with a variety of skin and body products. When Dupuis installed a smoothie bar and added spa treatments Vie became a hangout for its clients as much as a fitness studio.

Now she’s going back to the basics. The Pilates Barn–the name refers to both the vintage barn she still hopes to find and the onetime warehouse’s open space and industrial feel–will concentrate on Pilates instruction one-on-one training and nutrition counseling with group classes taught virtually.

“I’m very excited about this new chapter and lifestyle” Dupuis said in an email. “No retail. No juice bar. No spa.”

From a staff of fifty-eight spread between her two previous locations Dupuis now will employ just fourteen people leaving her time to advise fitness clients and spend less time managing the business.

“The new business will be very simple which is my new obsession since the pandemic” Dupuis says. “It will be a different experience–no doubt!”

One of the companies that offers that Verizon can boast something that many of its rivals can’t: Its speeds are reliably fast both for uploads and downloads. Most cable companies for instance may be able to offer fast download speeds but can’t say the same about uploads.

“Fios has higher upload speeds than most Internet providers thanks to their fiber-optic network technology” Broadband Now said in its most recent speed test analysis. “While cable and DSL prioritize download speeds above all else the increased bandwidth of Fios fiber allows them to deliver upload speeds in the same range as their download speeds.”

“Fiber Internet is preferred by most customers since it provides gigabit download and upload speeds in the 200–1000 Mbps range which is several times higher than the maximums offered by legacy technologies like coaxial cable and DSL” Broadband Now said in its “expert overview.”

US News in its ranking of the Best Internet Service providers of 2021 ranks Verizon second behind Comcast’s Xfinity Internet although it places Verizon ahead of AT&T Spectrum Cox RCN CenturyLink and other cable and satellite rivals.

While the various companies in the rankings offer different download speeds Verizon offers the fastest minimum upload speeds with a range of 200 Mbps - 880 Mbps per the US News chart. Comcast by contrast offers 1 Mbps to 1000 Mbps while AT&T offers 0.4 Mbps to 940 Mbps. Cox does offer 1 Mbps to 1000 Mbps but it includes a data cap while Verizon’s plan does not even if it does cost slightly more than most cable offerings.

reviews.org recommends going with Fios for Internet if it’s between that and Comcast.

“Verizon Fios might seem expensive but its prices are actually some of the best when it comes to the speeds you get. To top that off you’ll get stunning fiber internet with no annual contract at all. Now that’s a win-win.”

The drawback for Fios? It’s only available in some parts of the country.

Fios like most companies of its kind lost pay-TV customers this year while gaining Internet subscribers as the pandemic has caused cord-cutting trends to accelerate. In the third quarter the most recent for which it has released numbers the company lost 61000 video subscribers after dropping more than 80000 in each of the year’s first two quarters. But the company did add 139000 Internet subscribers in the third quarter which it called the most Internet subscribers it has added in a quarter since the end of 2014.

(WWSB) – More than a week after Frontier Cable’s abrupt and unprecedented decision to drop ABC 7 (WWSB-TV) viewers continue to want answers about why their local television station was pulled from their channel lineup and when it will return.

For almost two weeks Frontier Cable Customers in Sarasota and Manatee Counties have been unable to watch vital local news and weather on ABC 7 (WWSB-TV).

At 4pm on Friday December 18th Frontier Communications notified ABC7 that it opted to delete “Your Local Station” from its lineup and instead carry an out-of-town station after the cable provider walked away from retransmission consent negotiations.

“Frontier is based in Connecticut and they don’t think there is any difference between WWSB-TV which serves Sarasota and Manatee Counties and an ABC station from more than 60 miles away that covers a different city” explained Jeff Benninghoff Vice President and General Manager of WWSB-TV.

Benninghoff explains this is a first for the station which has never been involved in a carriage dispute or dropped by any other operator.

“WWSB has always successfully negotiated its deals in private without involving viewers” said Benninghoff. “We fully expected to get a similar quiet deal done with Frontier. Then without any warning and with one hour to go under our old agreement Frontier pulled out and told us that it would not do any deal with WWSB-TV. We offered a no-strings extension of our existing deal until the end of the year. The extension would have at least given us time to see if there was a solution. Frontier refused and said they wanted to drop WWSB-TV immediately.”

The impacts are prompting long time viewers to take action including Congressman Vern Buchanan. Last week he contacted the FCC after WWSB-ABC7 was pulled from Frontier Cable.

“Our community depends on access to local news for important information that impacts their daily lives” wrote Buchanan. “That’s why I just wrote to the chairman of the FCC expressing my concern at the sudden blackout of a local TV news station here in Sarasota.”

Vern Buchanan (@VernBuchanan) December 22 2020

You can read Buchanan’s letter in its entirety above.

Benninghoff confirmed the station again offered to extend its existing agreement for future talks but Frontier hasn’t changed its position.

“We have great relationships with all other operators including Spectrum and Comcast and Frontier subscribers should switch to another provider because Frontier seems unwilling to even talk with us” said Benninghoff. “We want to serve our community. Impacted Frontier customers and their advocates should contact the cable provider and demand WWSB ABC 7 be put back on channel 507. ""

The Downton Abbey and Paddington star said it happens regularly with fraudsters setting up online accounts in his name.

According to the Daily Mail Bonneville said the people then send private messages to his followers pretending to be the actor.

“Roughly every two weeks some numpty who can't spell sets up two new accounts pretending to be me” the star was quoted as saying.

“They send naff private messages to people who follow me hoping to lure them into a weird cave under a rock near the sea anemones of their imagination.”

Bonneville 57 has his own official website and is also active on social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter where he regularly updates followers on life amid the coronavirus pandemic as well as career bits and bobs.

Last week he gave his followers an early Christmas present when he shared the trailer for his biopic To Olivia on Christmas Eve.

The actor portrays children’s author Roald Dahl in the film which focuses on his marriage to Oscar-winning actress Patricia Neal who is played by Keeley Hawes.

Bonneville is best known for playing Robert Crawley Earl of Grantham in hit period drama series Downton Abbey.

However now that NBC has a streaming service of its own it’s snatched the subscription streaming rights back removing The Office from Netflix as the calendar turned over from 2020 to 2021.

If you like watching The Office over and over again you live in the US and you already have Peacock either as a standalone subscription ($5 per month with advertisements or $10 per month ad-free) or as part of your Comcast package then you’re all set.

Otherwise you may have some decisions to make. Is switching subscriptions — or adding another one to a list that probably also includes services like HBO Max CBS All Access and Disney+ — worth it to you? Peacock does have other content like Parks & Recreation and just launched its Saved By the Bell reboot to positive reviews.

If you really only want to watch The Office then maybe it makes sense to get off the shifting sands of licenses and streaming services and simply buy the show. Snagging the series on Blu-ray for HD viewing is expensive at $120 and sold out at every store I could find. The DVD edition is cheaper at $50 but 480p is a tough ask. Your best and cheapest bet may be buying a digital copy as The Office: Complete Series run is available from retailers like Vudu or Apple’s iTunes for $30.

If you don’t want to pay at all Peacock is streaming the first two seasons for free and has posted some of its add-on content on YouTube for you to enjoy with more coming over the next few days. For paying subscribers there’s considerably more with curated episodes featuring each character’s best moments and even a 24/7 channel dedicated to the sights and sounds of an office environment. They’ve also added some behind-the-scenes extras and extended-cut “Superfan” episodes that add previously unseen footage.

Can you believe we can actually say that now? Here's to a healthier happier and hopefully more relaxed you.

To help you set your intentions for the year ahead we asked six registered dietitians located all across the U.S. to share some tips on how you can employ healthy eating habits right now.

Below you will see nine such suggestions and after be sure to read the The 7 Healthiest Foods to Eat Right Now.

Say ""no"" to fad diets

""Especially as New Year's resolutions are underway many often turn to fad and restrictive diets as a method to quickly see the results they desire. However restriction often leads to bingeing followed-by a continued restrict-binge cycle leading to feelings of guilt. Research shows that calorie deprivation can put extra stress on the body. This year try substituting intuitive eating and mindfulness for restriction. Focusing less on counting every calorie and more on your natural hunger and fullness cues will help you be more in-tune with your body and feel less out of control with food.""

— Lauren Hoover RD MS at SHIFT in Chicago

Make your plate colorful…and balanced!

""Try to fill half of your plate with colorful fruits and vegetables one-quarter of your plate with whole grains (bread pasta rice) and one-quarter of your plate with protein (chicken fish eggs beans).""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

— Sakiko Minagawa MS RD LD

Choose one meal where no screens are involved

""Pick one meal a day to have without with screens. Eating in front of cell phones TVs and computers prevent us from fully savoring our meals. The distraction can cause you to overeat or disrupt the pace of your eating thus disrupting digestion.""

— Sydney Greene MS RD

""We live in such a fast paced go go go society. Try using one meal a day to relax and slow down and limit distractions like your phone computer and TV.""

— Ashley Kitchens MPH RD LDN

Strive to appreciate food by taking the time to savor it

""Practice making a deeper connection with the food that's in front of you and try engaging all your senses as you eat. This year work toward building a confident and healthy relationship with food.""

— Kitchens

Introduce more sugar swaps

""Everyone talks about cutting sugar out of your diet but that's deprivation and sets you up to fail. The better way is to do sugar swaps meaning replace traditional sweets with options that have less sugar but still tons of enjoyment.""

— Dawn Jackson Blatner RDN CSSD

Blatner shared a few helpful examples:

Swap regular chocolate to brands like Lily's Sweets for a no-added-sugar version

Swap ice cream to nice cream made with frozen bananas for a natural sugar fix

Swap sweetened yogurt to plain yogurt topped with mashed fresh berries

Swap condiments to no-added-sugar versions like salad dressings pasta sauce and ketchup

Swap classic plant milks to the unsweetened versions

Stock up on frozen veggies

""This is a quick and simple way to eat more veggies by eliminating the task of washing peeling or chopping. Not a fan of kale? A simple vegetable blend is a great option and can be enjoyed as a side dish or added to a soup. The Birds Eye Steamfresh vegetables are especially handy on those busy days as they can be simply heated right in the bag and served.""

— Kasia Burton MS RDN Principal Nutritionist Conagra Brands Research and Development

Don't skip meals or ""save calories""

""Eating balanced snacks and meals throughout the day can help you stay energized and avoid overeating. Try eating every three to four hours and avoid going long periods of time without fuel.""

— Minagawa

Listen to what's right for you and your body

""Silence all the noise. There's a lot of information and misinformation out there. Figure out what works best for you.""

— Kitchens

Make it a point to try new recipes

""Challenge yourself to learn one new recipe per week. Rotate between healthful and indulgent recipes to boost your confidence in the kitchen and rely less on takeout.""

Bartlesville High sports have been back after it for a week as Saturday marks day No. 8 that practices could be held at Bartlesville following a two-week shutdown because of COVID-19.

School will start again in-person on Monday meaning that activities and athletics will resume next week. The last week gave BHS student athletes a chance to practice without school being in session.

Bartlesville High Athletic and Activities Director Thad Dilbeck says that is a special time of the year.

Biden Jr.’s choice for Treasury secretary Janet L. Yellen collected more than $7 million in speaking fees over the past two years from major corporations and Wall Street banks that have a keen interest in the financial policies she will oversee after her expected confirmation to lead the Treasury Department.

Ms. Yellen’s paid speaking appearances — which included $992000 from the investment bank Citi for nine appearances — were among the lucrative payments from a range of Wall Street Big Tech and corporate interests to three prominent prospective members of the incoming Biden administration.

The payments revealed in disclosure statements covering the previous two years and released on New Year’s Eve have caused consternation among progressive activists concerned about the influence of special interests around Mr. Biden who they see as part of a Democratic establishment that has not sufficiently embraced liberal priorities.

Mr. Biden’s choice for secretary of state Antony J. Blinken was paid nearly $1.2 million by a consulting firm he helped found WestExec Advisors where he advised a range of corporations including Facebook Boeing the private equity giant Blackstone and the asset management company Lazard.",,,,,,,,,

Voters in four states approved ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis use and two new states approved medical use. Oregon went even further taking a page out of Portugal’s playbook and decriminalizing possession and personal use of all illicit drugs.

“We live in times where new stereotypes are being built and a whole bunch of prohibition stuff is falling apart so it’s interesting to be here” he said as an entrepreneur who is heavily invested in the U.S. of late. “We also just passed over casually that a state in the U.S. basically called an entire end to the war on drugs. It feels like the Berlin Wall fell over and somebody said ‘What was that noise?’ The wall fell over for Christ’s sake…at least get a piece of it!”

Linton is founder and former chief executive officer of one the largest cannabis companies in the world Canopy Growth Corp. He spent six years building his baby to a $20 billion valuation and a spot on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 (though he wasn’t allowed anywhere near the bell mind you). When he forged a partnership with international liquor conglomerate Constellation Brands Inc. which committed more than $4 billion in investment he thought the partnership would make his company an even bigger gorilla and provide primacy on the international stage. He was king of the mountain in the fastest-growing industry on the planet.

But then things got complicated.

After a fundamental disagreement with Constellation about the direction of the company and the cannabis stock market’s descent into a slow and steady downslide Linton was terminated in the summer of 2019.

He rebounded quickly. By early 2020 he was back in his comfort zone researching advising and raising money for a new venture: a global hemp technology investment fund that has its sights set high far and wide. Linton also is staking a claim in the American Midwest as an executive with Gage a major player in Michigan and is overseeing his Ruckify “Rent Anything” tech business and…well who knows what else.

Nerd meets suit meets cannabis

As an energetic curious kid who was prone to mischief Linton and his parents moved to a farm in an effort to help him channel his energy and interests in creative more productive ways. Even today at 54 years old he said he struggles to sit still and has the curiosity bug stronger than ever.

“I grew up with a farm experience with parents who worked hard and I wasn’t particularly academic but I wasn’t stupid” he said. “I just didn’t know anything. I was extraordinarily naïve and I went to university because I thought it gave you a universal education. I was quite disappointed to find out you actually had to select certain topics. So I took six years to do a four-year degree so I could do way more topics.

“I’m just curious about stuff. I want to do things that I don’t know how to do” he said. “I believe that’s a 100-percent accurate diagnostic test for entrepreneurs but the regrettable issue is that it’s also an incurable sort of ailment.”

Similar to the tech entrepreneurs who built Silicon Valley Linton takes pride in being a nerd who will geek out on arcane science and tech until he finds something that sparks his interest and enthusiasm. After working in the tech industry for a few decades—selling software and founding startups like Ruckify—he began looking for a new pursuit in 2012 and stumbled onto cannabis which was bubbling up fast in the Canadian cultural economic and political conversation. Much of the debate boiled down to public policy which is another realm he likes digging into.

“If you’re worried about keeping your job you should fire yourself.”

“In grade seven my mum reminded me I did a speech on political candidates and why we should care” he said. “I actually really like to have discussions about public policy because everybody wants to talk about the economy and politics. But at the end of the day the primary governing thing over all of us is public policy which isn’t made by bureaucrats in a vacuum. It’s created by bureaucrats at the direction of politicians who are often wrong.”

As Canadian politicians started to feel the heat to rewrite the rules on cannabis and make weed available to the wider public Linton found the opportunity of a lifetime while reading an article in the morning paper. “I said ‘I know a lot of people really like cannabis so there’s no doubt there’s demand and they’re going to give a few people licenses to produce it. The police are happy because they can regulate it and secure it. So I’m starting a cannabis business’” he recalled. “It took me all of a morning from having read the article to concluding that.”

Over the next six years he became an entrepreneur and activist promoting his grand weed plan to friends family and potential investors. Along the way he became annoyed by people who were still under the spell of the drug war propaganda and misinformation that prevails in the U.S. “I didn’t want to hear the stereotypes passed down through three generations that are just bullshit” he said. “I would say to people ‘Well I did not invent cannabis and it did exist before. And because what I’m doing is simply regulating it I think that’s better than the government ignoring it because ignoring it is only good for criminals.’ I was kind of like nerd meets suit meets cannabis.”

Linton dove headlong into cannabis in 2012 and never looked back. He sees himself as an entrepreneur through and through and understands and embraces the inherent risks that come with the turf.

“Entrepreneurs aren’t the most malleable people. If they’re super malleable you’ve never heard of them because they never got anything done” he said. “If you meet a person who says they’re an entrepreneur and then they say ‘I’ve never been pushed out of a company’ I say ‘Well I don’t know how to do that.’ If money knew what to do if all the cash in the world knew what to do they wouldn’t need entrepreneurs. We need each other and we don’t always agree.”

A complicated Canopy

From 2012 to 2018 Linton steered Canopy from a bright idea to monolith. Then came Constellation’s investment which bought the owner of Corona Modelo and other major alcoholic beverage brands about 35 percent of the company and a major influence on the board of directors. Linton said he expected no less and he was fine with the arrangement because the alternatives were not feasible or favorable for Canopy’s long-term success.

“I knew that if you want to put more money in if I’m not accommodating to [an investor controlling the board of directors] then you might take everything out. And how bad would that turn out?” he said. “The other side is I had done sixteen rounds of financing and [Canopy] was pretty close to going bankrupt on two occasions. Not too close but maybe close on the third. What I did not want was the headline ‘Biggest Cannabis Company in the World Runs Out of Money.’ So with those two book ends you optimize the deal but you always do the deal. If you’re worried about keeping your job versus those two considerations you should fire yourself.”

When Linton proposed Canopy spend billions of dollars to secure intellectual property that would give the company strategic advantages over the long term instead of focusing on short-term revenues the new board disagreed. In a global market that could be worth as much as $500 billion he said investing $8 billion to be the top dog wasn’t a crazy idea.

“Science enables all other branding because you can make things people stand in line to get because they’re completely different than what anyone else has—and that costs money” he said. “I wished to create intellectual property that would have a generation of benefit and do it through very focused science to carve the world into three players. And the result would be the best products in each market.”

As an analogy Linton said Amazon probably could have been very profitable had it stayed small and in the book business. “Wouldn’t that have been a great idea? That’s what the market would tell them to do: Only sell books stay small and be profitable” he said. “But what you actually have to do is have your earnings per share go negative sometimes if you’re investing money back into creating something that has a lifetime of durable value. I had a major agenda on science because I don’t think people necessarily want to buy marijuana. I think what they want is an outcome that marijuana delivers. I don’t care if it’s medical or rec it’s what outcome do you need? And those are all science activities.”

In 2019 cannabis stocks became a rollercoaster ride that eventually sent the global weed market into a tailspin. Canopy shares peaked in May at $49 and plummeted to $15 over the next six months. In July the Canopy board decided to take a new direction with the company and terminated Linton. By December the company had chosen a new chief executive officer: David Klein Canopy’s chairman of the board…and the finance chief at Constellation Brands.

As a veteran of the tech industry Linton didn’t find the turn of events hugely surprising. During the first wave of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s startups were hit-or-miss ventures and the CEO was the first one out the door when the board of directors found balance sheets disappointing. Ironically those same CEOs became attractive job candidates to lead other startups. Their “failure” was a badge of honor more or less; presumably they had learned important lessons about the pitfalls and challenges of the game and would do better next time.

Linton said he doesn’t harbor any serious regrets about the direction he took Canopy or the way things ended and he looks back proudly on what he built. “I always say thanks for that and [the investment] must validate that maybe we built something interesting and valuable.”

These days he is on a mission to build something new interesting and valuable out of the plant but the goal has nothing to do with smoking.

A new direction

As a geek and an entrepreneur Linton always evaluates the science and research before plunging into a new market or opportunity. When he began investigating hemp he soon recognized its limitless virtually untapped potential. Particularly in the U.S. investors view the hemp industry through the lens of CBD products which have exploded in popularity over the past few years. But Linton sees much more potential for hemp and its sustainable and disruptive industrial applications. He believes the plant can play a significant role in more than 200 product categories.

Shortly after he founded Collective Growth Corp. in early 2020 Linton raised $150 million—not bad considering there was a worldwide pandemic at hand. The new acquisition company went public on the Nasdaq exchange in May. The company intends to explore the potential of hemp and invest in disruptive technologies that can turn the plant into food pharmaceuticals sustainable building materials and who knows what else. When Linton talks about the hemp industry he sees unlimited potential but likes to put the opportunities in “two buckets”: food-to-farm and disruptive industrial.

“So you’re thinking about largely the same material and there’s everything from thinking about creams for psoriasis to a super-stable protein option that is from the U.S. and is a third crop. There’s all kinds of technologies now figured out on how to make it taste great and have the protein as one of the most stable plant proteins” he said. “The disruptive industrial bucket is how everything from the fender on your car to the way you make your next injection-molded garbage can is created. They’re both equally interesting but you couldn’t put them all smashed together. That’s how we’re bucketing the world as we look at all the prospects.”

For now Linton is focused on Europe where regulations are more relaxed than in the U.S. and technology development is more advanced in hemp manufacturing and where companies have been building out and scaling up their operations. In terms of investment Linton has been looking in countries that have created successful cottage industries including Holland Italy the Netherlands and Switzerland. “They are doing things with hemp but they haven’t been doing them at scale because the biggest market in the world wouldn’t let it come in” he said.

Once he identifies the products he is most interested in developing and the technologies and manufacturing capabilities needed to produce them Linton plans to set up shop in the U.S. “That’s my whole mission” he said. “I’m going to buy this stuff up all around the world and then create at least one and probably three instances of it in the U.S. Then you can create this interesting facility that’s somewhere between the farmer’s fields and the factories that need to do all the things they need to do from building cars to making products you wear and food you eat. We monetize the entire plant for its many virtues and potentials. And that is naturally disruptive in everything from hydrocarbons to cotton.”

Wowzer me

While Linton’s new obsession is primarily with the THC-less version of the cannabis plant he also has a leading role with a major player in Michigan that is using high-tech indoor cultivation facilities to grow heavy-hitting strains with some of the most popular genetics on the market.

In 2019 Linton was named executive chairman at Gage Cannabis Co. a vertically integrated cannabis producer operating five dispensaries with plans to open three more by the end of 2020. Aside from its own branded products Gage is the exclusive retailer and producer of Cookies which may be the most popular and successful flower brand in the industry. Gage also operates Cookies-branded stores in Michigan. Linton believes the company has a unique opportunity to thrive in both flower production and retail in one of the most promising new markets in the Midwest.

“Part of the reason I like Michigan is that it’s not a young-person state so a high percentage of the people will be eligible to be customers” he said. “I also like the vertical stack because you want to be able to have your own retail but you don’t want to be stuck with crappy product.”

When he discusses other cannabis opportunities he first mentions some of the voids he sees in the market. “One thing I’m looking for is a company that’s terrific at animal care” he said. “Cannabis for geriatric people is a good idea if it’s done right. I think it’s going to be a very good idea for animals as well. I just haven’t found a really solid thoughtful research-oriented company that wants to do that but I think it’s a mega-market that is under-tapped.”

One of the markets expected to blossom in 2021 is cannabis beverages but Linton believes companies haven’t yet developed formulations that will take off among mainstream consumers. “I haven’t tasted any beverages that I was wowzered by” he said. “And imagine I spent five years at Canopy saying ‘We are going to lead the world in making beverages because it’s a socially normal way for people to become intoxicated who don’t currently buy cannabis.’ It’s way easier if you’re going to have a concert to have a special-occasion permit for beverages than it is to have a smoking concert. But I do think we’re going to see—next summer probably—five great beverage entrants in the U.S.”

Like any geeky entrepreneur worth his salt Linton also is taking a long view on plant-based medicinal therapies and is intrigued by the potential in psychedelic drugs most notably psilocybin.

“Why am I looking at the psychedelic stuff now? I just think they were treated poorly” he said. “If they make you hallucinate and have all kinds of psychedelic effects on you that sounds like a pretty powerful molecule. So how could you amend that molecule to make it into something else that maybe works better?

“A lot of people are using ketamine and going to therapies and realizing why they’re angry at themselves” he added. “If you feel better and you don’t hurt anybody I think that’s a good outcome.”

As he looks forward to 2021 Linton said he can’t wait to start traveling again so he can get an up-close look at new technologies. He’s particularly excited about designing facilities that could lead to scientific and manufacturing breakthroughs in the future. For now though he’s stuck puttering around at home. “While I’m talking to you I’m pacing back and forth because I hate sitting around having conversations” he said. “I would much rather be taking you on a tour of a facility and explaining all the stuff we built and telling you how version two is going to be even better. But right now all I’m thinking is ‘This poor bastard. I hope he’s microdosing so he didn’t have to tolerate all of me.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to their unique elemental abilities it is often hard to rank these characters in terms of power and utility. However it seems like the latest Cryo bow-wielder Ganyu can single-handedly dominate any battle in the game.

With every new constellation characters in Genshin Impact gain significant stats and Ganyu is no exception. At her sixth constellation using Trail of the Qilin causes the next Frostflake Arrow shot within 30 seconds not to require charging.

Ganyu’s C6 is a highly overpowered ability in itself and the community believes it to be more efficient than the C6 abilities of Diluc Tartaglia and Venti. Reddit user u/CryyoticFate has now discovered a bug that makes her powerful enough to break the game altogether.

Apparently using Ganyu’s elemental skill and switching to another character at the same time grants her with infinite Lv. 2 charged arrows. Players can deal continuous damage with them and defeat almost any boss and enemy with ease.

It is worth noting that this glitch is extremely hard to trigger and is exclusive to the character’s sixth constellation. Ganyu being a five-star entity is extremely rare and reaching her maximum constellation is still a dream for many players.

Will Genshin Impact give free primogems to the players now?

Genshin Impact runs on a system that resembles a vending machine better known as Gacha. It actively incentivizes the players to spend in-game currency primogems to receive random virtual items. It comes as no surprise that free to play players leave no opportunity to claim primogems for free and the aforementioned bug might lead to the same.

Ganyu’s constellation six bug is definitely miHoYo‘s fault. Some players have even claimed that the bug has been prevailing since the beginning of Ganyu’s banner and has been reported several times already. Regardless the developers haven’t patched it yet.

Cesar Macedo was booked into Tehama County Jail on charges of felony evading resisting arrest possession of drug paraphernalia and parole violation.

An officer was patrolling in the area of McKinley and Toomes avenues just before midnight Thursday and saw a 1999 Honda Civic with expired registration circling the block and running a red light according to a release issued early Friday by the Corning Police Department.

The officer tried to pull over the Honda but it sped off reaching speeds around 100 mph the release said. At one point an object thought to be a handgun was tossed from the Honda. It was later identified as an air pistol.

The Honda traveled north to Gerber and Los Molinos before turning south onto State Route 99E to SR 32 near Hamilton City the release said.

Mechanical problems caused the Honda to crash into a tree and Macedo fled on foot the release said. K-9 Blaze detained him.

Macedo was treated at St. Elizabeth Community Hospital before being booked into jail the release said. There were no other injuries.

Macedo was on California Department of Corrections parole and had an active no-bail warrant.

Samsung Galaxy M51 Review

Design

63.9 x 76.3 x 9.5 mm 213 g

Dual SIM (Nano-SIM dual stand-by)

Samsung Galaxy M51 is strikingly similar to the Samsung Galaxy A71. Both of them have almost the same size.

As we expect the M51 also has a plastic back with a glossy finish which is prone to smudges. Even when I have been very careful about how I place the device the back panel of M51 has gotten scratches and smudges.

So it is very important to use a case if you want to protect it. Sadly Samsung doesn’t include a case with the M51 in the box.

On the front we get a hole-punch design and the front camera is surrounded by a big black border which is what we expect on a mid-ranger.

The power button and volume buttons are on the right whereas there’s a sim tray on the left. On the bottom we get a 3.5mm headphone jack a Type-C port mic and a speaker. On top there’s a single microphone.

The phone is quite big but it fits well in my hands and the button placement feels right for me. The placement of the fingerprint sensor embedded on the power button also feels natural.

With a big battery we expect phones to be heavy but the M51 has pretty good weight distribution. You won’t feel the device too heavy on your hands.

Overall its glastic back is the only drawback with its design.

Display

6.7 inches Super AMOLED Plus

1080 x 2400 Resolution

Corning Gorilla Glass 3

Samsung M51 comes with a huge 6.7 inches FHD+ Super AMOLED Plus display with a screen resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3+ as well.

Samsung M51 has slim bezels all around with a similar chin as the A71. At this point in time the hole punch in the middle doesn’t feel distracting at all.

As for the quality of the display it is the best display for the price. The AMOLED panel has rich color reproduction a saturated color profile and excellent viewing angles. I loved watching YouTube videos and Netflix on the M51.

Normal users won’t be able to differentiate between M51’s AMOLED panel and a flagship AMOLED panel. I was even playing games under direct sunlight which means that its sunlight legibility is very good.

Yes it is not a high refresh rate display but the display felt smooth. Maybe it was due to swift animations I did not feel the need for a high refresh rate display.

Samsung M51 has the best display under Rs. 40000. Period!

Hardware

Samsung M51 rocks Snapdragon 730G chipset which is a premium mid-range chipset.

It has an 8nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G chipset with Octa-core (2×2.2 GHz Kryo 470 Gold & 6×1.8 GHz Kryo 470 Silver) CPU and Adreno 618 GPU. For memory it comes in two configurations: 6GB RAM/64GB storage and 8GB RAM/128GB storage. The variant I’m using has 6GB RAM.

This phone sails through normal tasks like a boss. The animations are smooth and the performance is smooth while opening apps switching between apps and doing normals tasks like browsing.

M51 can perform equally well when it comes to gaming. I tested COD mobile and PUBG mobile on the M51. You can play PUBG mobile up to high graphics and extreme fps setting in smooth graphics. The gameplay is smooth in the highest graphics and highest fps setting. Well you might see rare frame drops but PUBG runs smoothly on M51.

Samsung Galaxy M51 has a triple camera setup on the rear. There’s a 64MP main sensor a 12MP Ultrawide angle sensor a 5MP depth sensor and a 5MP Macro sensor. The main sensor here is Sony’s IMX682 sensor.

NORMAL PHOTOS

Photos from the 64MP main sensor are sharp and have very good details even in normal mode.

If you want better details you can use 64MP mode but the normal mode is more than enough. Also the 64MP photo doesn’t have HDR so exposure is better on normal photos.

The color is saturated as we expect from Samsung phones and the dynamic range is also quite good. The exposure is balanced most of the time but some photos do look slightly overexposed.

And something else that I like about the pictures from M51 is the natural depth effect. It is using a relatively larger sensor than what we see on most phones which helps in achieving a natural depth effect. Some photos really shine with the natural bokeh.

LOW LIGHT PHOTOS

In Daylight M51 has very good camera performance and the performance carries over in low light situations as well. The photos look good even in low light.

Of course the photos do have noise and lack detail but still I was impressed with the low light photos.

Using night mode helps to remove noise and get more detail. Night mode also helps to maintain better exposure with the controlled light source.

You can also use night mode with an ultrawide angle sensor and the night mode works similarly well with the ultrawide photos as well.

ULTRAWIDE ANGLE PHOTOS

Ultrawide photos from M51 have a 123-degree wide FOV and the 12MP sensor provides good details. You will notice noise if you are pixel peeping but the details are very good and the color profile is similar to the main sensor.

I really like the ultrawide angle sensor of the M51. The HDR works really well with ultrawide photos and it manages to capture good photos even in the low light situation.

The distortion correction is also done well and you won’t notice much distortion on ultrawide photos.

PORTRAIT PHOTOS

Samsung M51 has an extra 5MP sensor for depth sensing and it helps with portrait photos. The portrait shots have really good edge detection as it manages to correctly identify the subject even in tough scenarios. Plus the depth effect also feels natural.

The HDR also helps with bright light conditions as it controls the highlights in the background.

MACRO PHOTOS

Most smartphones have macro lens these days but they are mostly useless. Well Samsung M51 has a decent macro lens. The 5MP sensor captures decent detail and I would not hesitate to upload the macro shots captured from M51.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

But it is slightly tough to capture with the macro lens as you have to keep the phone steady to get a good focus.

SELFIE

Selfies from the 32MP have lots of details. The face looks sharp and the colors are saturated. The HDR works most of the time which helps in controlling the background lights. Sometimes the background does come out a bit washed out.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

As for portrait selfies they look good with nice edge detection and excellent background blur.

VIDEOS

Samsun Galaxy M51 can capture up to 4k 30 fps. It can also do 1080p 30 fps but it doesn’t have a 60fps option even at 1080p. So that is a slight disappointment.

Video quality is best at 4k with rich color and nice contrast. The detail level is good and surprisingly stabilization is also good at 4k. Similarly at 1080p the detail level is not bad as I had expected.

Battery

Non-removable Li-Po 7000 mAh battery

Fast charging 25W 100% in 115 min

Reverse charging

Samsung M51 is one of the few phones rocking a 7000mAh battery. And the battery life is as solid as it comes. With moderate usage I did not have to worry about charging the phone for almost 2 days.

On average I was getting about 9-10 hours of screen on time. And I was able to get up to a maximum of 14 hours of screen on time. I was easily able to get through 2 days of usage while I was binging tv shows on Netflix. I did not play games during this usage period though. Check out my usage below.

The problem with a big battery is that it takes a lot of time to charge the phone. With its 25W charger M51 takes about 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100.

Speaker

M51 has a single bottom-firing speaker and I’m quite satisfied with its quality. The phone is more than loud enough and the clarity is pretty decent.

Software

Android 10

One UI 2.5

Samsung M51 runs on One UI Core 2.5 on top of Android 10. The experience is the same as what we get from other Samsung phones like M31 and A71. Some Samsung related apps like Samsung Max Samsung Global Golas and My Galaxy comes pre-installed. Else there is no extra bloatware.

The animations are fluid and the software experience has been amazing. One UI is one of the best UI’s for me.

Conclusion

Samsung M51 is a top-notch phone for the price. AMOLED display with fluid performance is its main highlight along with the humongous battery. The camera setup is really nice. The main sensor ultrawide and macro sensor are among the best under Rs. 40000.

It doesn’t provide you the most value when it comes to price to performance ratio. But if you’re looking for an excellent display good cameras good performance and awesome battery life then M51 is the phone for you. It’s a complete package that excels in almost every department.

It is definitely my favorite phone under Rs. 40000.

COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4tdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wMS8wMS93aHktd29udC1jb3N0Y28tY29tZS1hc2hldmlsbGUtYXJlYS8zOTExNDMxMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why won't Costco come to the Asheville area?,"If any topic has kept the rumor mill spinning in Asheville for the past decade or so it's something along these lines: ""Hey I hear Costco is finally coming to town! They're supposed to go in at (name your location).""

But the massive warehouse retailer is most definitely not in Asheville and that leaves a lot of people driving to Greenville or Spartanburg South Carolina to hit the chain's two nearest stores.

Hendersonville resident Bo Stevenson who's lived in the mountains for six years said he makes the trip to the Spartanburg Costco every 28 days. He's grown accustomed to the 45-minute ride and listens to a lot of good podcasts.

""But I’d be lying if I didn’t say that I wasn’t jealous"" said Stevenson 43. ""The Upstate of South Carolina has two Costcos within 20 minutes of each other and we can’t have one?""

Ask Fairview resident Paula Warrick Stegall 55 how she feels about Asheville getting the Costco cold shoulder in the 21st century and she uses one word: ""Dismayed."" She and her husband David Stegall head to the Spartanburg store every two or three weeks to load up on meat staples and occasional impulse buys.

""I don’t understand why we don’t have one"" said Paula Stegall an oncology pharmacist. ""I know the Spartanburg location would be very disappointed if we did get one here because we see North Carolina plates all over the parking lot down there.""

What Costco says

While in the big scheme of things Costco is just one company that has thus far declined to locate in Asheville; it's also emblematic of some of the struggles the area has in landing such companies. The conundrum encompasses topography land costs and demographics.

It's not like Costco based in Issaquah Washington is struggling. On Dec. 2 the company reported net sales of $15.67 billion for November a 15.1% jump from 2019 according to a company press release. For the twelve-week first quarter that ended Nov. 22 2020 the company had $42.4 billion in net sales a 16.9% leap from last year.

It's a world-wide company with 803 warehouses total including 558 in the United States and Puerto Rico 102 in Canada and 39 in Mexico.

In a Dec. 15 article at Costar News titled ""Costco Bets on Brick-and-Mortar for Long-term Growth as Online Sales Surge"" the reporter notes Costco CEO Craig Jelinek remains gung-ho about getting people into stores citing Jelinek's recent appearance on CNBC.

""I still think brick-and-mortar is not going to go away"" Jelinek told the network.

Costco is notoriously tight-lipped on expansion plans until it's ready to announce a location.

Muriel Cooper who handles corporate communications for Costco responded to a Citizen Times inquiry asking about factors and demographics that drive location decisions as well as the outlook for a store in Asheville.

""Unfortunately it is our company policy to not comment regarding demographic details of future Costco warehouses until we are ready to share details about the new location (usually two-three months in advance)"" Cooper said via email. ""In the future please visit our website https://www.costco.com/new-locations.html.""

The Costar article notes Costco opened a dozen stores this year and ""hopes to open as many as six in the third quarter and eight in the fourth quarter."" But the company website lists just one pending new store and that's opening in February in Ontario Canada.

Brokers say Costco has looked here

Commercial real estate experts in the Asheville area say Costco has definitely sniffed around looking for a good site. That in fact is the toughest nut to crack.

Robin Boylan a Beverly-Hanks commercial real estate broker who's been in the business locally for 32 years said he's heard the rumors about Costco as well as the complaints about them not being here.

""I'm one of the ones that says it too"" Boylan said with a laugh.

Boylan said Costco builds a big store with a large parking lot so it needs a sizable chunk of land — probably about 20 acres. That's the first hurdle to cross.

""We had a piece of property on the corner of Sweeten Creek and I-40 listed for sale —25 acres great visibility from the interstate — and Costco looked at that site for over a year"" Boylan said. ""They looked at it and looked at it.""

Crayton Road in that area did not have a traffic signal and it was problematic to install one. Costco had to have a signalized intersection to ensure smooth ingress and egress so the plan died he said.

Like a lot of chains Costco employs commercial real estate brokers to find suitable sites and work with local governments and officials. They also often reach out to local commercial real estate brokers who are familiar with the territory including folks like Boylan and Rusty Pulliam president of Pulliam Properties based in South Asheville.

""I've worked twice with Costco's broker"" Pulliam said. ""I tried to put them out at Asheville Outlets (when it was being redeveloped). They're kicking themselves because they didn’t put a store there.""

Formerly the site of Biltmore Square Mall the renovated Asheville Outlets opened in May 2015 and has been doing strong business since.

Seeking 'super-sexy frontage'

Pulliam said Costco also showed some interest in the Enka Center site which will now become home in part to a large distribution warehouse but Costco passed. Early plans called for a large retail center there and a movie theater but those plans never materialized.

""With Costco they want super-sexy frontage on the interstate where you can see the business"" Pulliam said adding that Costco needs 15-20 acres ""minimum"" to build a store.

And that's usable land.

""I know they've got good brokers and developers they work with but Asheville is tough"" said Martin Fridy president of Magnolia Development Group in Greenville South Carolina which has developed multiple commercial spaces on Airport Road in Arden. ""It's not the easiest place to develop and there are barriers to entry — the topography is tough and land costs are higher than other areas in the Southeast.""

Some site possibilities exist

One sizable parcel remains on the south side of Airport Road across from the Southridge Shopping Center (home to Lowe's and Target). It's certainly large enough Pulliam says but it also slopes away from the road significantly and would require a lot of fill.

""If they come they may end up there"" Pulliam said noting that Airport Road is about to get a new Ingles and already has other major supermarket players including Walmart Aldi and Target. ""Airport Road has grown so much they’ve got to really consider that site.""

Pulliam represents another large parcel across I-26 on Airport Road but a car dealership is slated to locate its Mercedes-Benz dealership there where the BMW dealership used to be before relocating to Long Shoals Road.

Another possibility is Tunnel Road and Pulliam says of Costco's brokers ""For years they were honed in on Tunnel Road.""

The Innsbruck Mall location could be a possibility but Ingles Markets bought that site in August and Pulliam thinks it's unlikely they'd sell or lease to a competitor. He also mentioned another Ingles-owned site a large parcel of family land across from the WNC Farmers Market not far from I-40 although the topography of that site would be tough.

Ingles Chief Financial Officer Ron Freeman said Ingles does not comment on competitors.

""Ingles has had a long-standing policy of not commenting on competitor activity but I can say there are no use restrictions on either of these properties"" Freeman said.

Maybe by Asheville Mall at Seritage site?

In East Asheville one end of the Asheville Mall where Sears used to be could be another possibility as the former store and parking lot could tender enough acreage Pulliam said.

New York City-based Seritage SRC Finance LLC had filed an application with the city of Asheville for a $45 million redevelopment plan for the site but the company postponed dates with City Council three times in 2019. It looks liked the deal is on pause at the least.

A public relations firm that had been handling requests for information from Seritage did not respond to a Citizen Times inquiry. The Citizen Times has also requested an update from Seritage itself but had not heard back by Dec. 17.

The Seritage plans had called for a six-story apartment building with 205 housing units five one-story retail buildings and a movie theater and a Seritage representative said in the summer of 2019 the company was committed to the plan. But that was before the pandemic and economic spiral that has caused thousands of retail businesses and restaurants to close nationwide.

Coresight.com which tracks the retail industry said Dec. 11 that 8425 retail businesses have closed nationwide in 2020 compared to just 3407 openings.

Shannon Tuch principal planner with the city's Planning and Urban Design Department said Seritage's ""application expired some time ago.""

""We have not had any word from Seritage and are not aware of their plans"" Tuch said.

She also said their department has ""never spoken to anyone from Costco.""

Demographics a consideration too

As the Citizen Times reported last year the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area (Buncombe Haywood Henderson and Madison counties) should pass 500000 in population as early as 2025. The threshold is significant in aspects ranging from economic development to attracting more grocery stores and retailers.

Companies consider factors ranging from educational levels to accessibility to a major airport when considering whether to locate in an area but retailers especially look at population right up front according to the Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce. Population as well as household income drives foot traffic in stores and companies' demographics specialist know that translates into sales per square foot.

That partly explains why Ashville was relatively late in the game in luring stores such as Target and Trader Joe's.

Clark Duncan executive director of the Economic Development Coalition of Asheville-Buncombe County said it's hard to know how many times over the past 10 years he's fielded inquiries from citizens who want a Costco here. And the company is not even one the EDC can go after as the state does not allow incentives to go toward that type of employment base Duncan said.

Typically the EDC recruits industrial and commercial businesses.

""Truth of the matter is we’re not involved whatsoever in recruiting retail establishments” Duncan said. That’s more of a numbers game — those guys are going to go where the demographics make sense for them.""

Stegall the Fairview resident wonders if Costco is content with drawing down a steady stream of Tar Heels to shop at its Greenville and Spartanburg stores.

""I wonder with the two of those close together if between Greenville and Spartanburg they're getting enough share from our market that they don't need to build a store here?"" she said. ""Is it trucking? It's harder to get the trucks through the mountains? I don't know.""

Too much competition?

Ken Flynt the associate dean of the Business School at Western Carolina University says companies running the numbers on potential new locations are ""metric centric"" meaning they closely examine a variety of metrics to make sure a new spot will be able to support a store. So the 500000 population mark is important.

Numbers crunching is a key but Flynt points to another factor: competition. Costco sells a lot of groceries among many other items and Asheville is packed with supermarket chains with Ingles Markets dominating the traditional supermarket niche but Publix Whole Foods and Aldi among others also having a strong presence.

Not to mention Sam's Club Walmart's membership warehouse shopping venture that's similar in concept to Costco.

""It seems to me there may be a feeling when you're looking at the real demographics the real profile of the region there may not be enough room for one more Trader Joe's or two warehouse stores competing against each other"" Flynt said referring to Sam's Club.

About the whole time Costco has been looking at the Asheville region Sam's Club has been operating stores off Patton Avenue in West Asheville and in Hendersonville.

""Sam's has got a beach-head here so maybe (Costco) is a little leery"" Flynt said.

Stevenson the Hendersonville resident cites store employees in Spartanburg who've told him the Asheville area is ""too dug in to Sam's Club that they're not going to switch."" Also a lot of the money flowing into the mountains is tourist dough and those folks are unlikely to hit a Costco while in town Stevenson said citing store employees' thoughts.

But Stevenson readily admits this too is hearsay more grist in the rumor mill that's been turning for a decade.

Flynt who sits on the board of the Haywood County Chamber of Commerce and formerly served as chairman of the Economic Development Council there said patience is key when talking about big fish like Costco.

""I know for a fact Publix had conversations for well over five years before they came to Waynesville"" Flynt said.

Flynt has helped to start five different banks and he knows they're all about crunching the numbers to make sure a new location won't fail. Sometimes retailers and banks can take five to 10 years before pulling the trigger he says.

So for folks like Stevenson who buys for himself his girlfriend and two kids he'll likely have to keep cruising down I-26 to Spartanburg once a month. Stevenson who works as a headhunter for an executive search firm says he prefers ""the earnest blue collar vibe amongst the hard-working clientele in Spartanburg to the well-heeled Clemson-dads in Greenville.

""Of course I’ll go to Greenville if hard alcohol needs purchasing"" he half-jokes.

Like Stevenson Stegall who's an Asheville native said she and her husband will continue trekking down the mountain to get their Costco fix every few weeks.

""I've just never understood it"" she said referring to their company's reluctance to locate here. ""But boy would I love it if they put a store here.""

Pulliam who runs the region's largest commercial development and brokerage firm offers some hope. He thinks Asheville may be a ""one Trader Joe's"" kind of town but...

""I do believe we’ll get a Costco at some point"" Pulliam said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvZm9vZC8yMDIxLzAxLzAxL25ldy15ZWFycy1kYXktZ3JvY2VyeS1zdG9yZS1ob3Vycy0yMDIxLWtyb2dlci1hbGJlcnRzb25zLXRhcmdldC80MDU2OTcxMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Year's Day 2021 grocery store hours: Walmart Publix Whole Foods,"Need a gallon of milk or cup of sugar?

And so we learn to accept the loss of say our favorite classic snack foods or these 50 foods that simply ceased to exist. But 2020? Now this has been a year like no other in terms of its comings and goings.

Old-time restaurants we thought would always be there for us have shuttered their doors—even famous restaurants like these. Sure we've embraced the whole eating-at-home thing. We've even learned patience as we waited for our grocery stores to restock their empty shelves with our favorite items.

""It's just a pandemic-related shortage"" we told ourselves as we walked past said shelves. But as 2020 draws to a close we've come to suspect that some of the foods that have vanished are never coming back.

So we did a little digging. And the news was . . . not as we'd hoped. Read on to learn of the beloved food brands that have in fact disappeared in 2020 never to return again.

Read on to learn about The Saddest Restaurant Closures In Your State.

Snapple in classic glass bottles

Of course we're aware that some of Snapple's tea flavors are among the unhealthiest iced teas around. But if Snapple teas have a special place in your heart and you start noticing entire Snapple product lines have been missing for months from your grocery store how can you not feel alarmed?

In fact something is definitely up. But it's all for a good reason Eat This Not That! learned from a Snapple spokesperson. Turns out Snapple is retiring its iconic glass bottles in favor of environmentally sustainable plastic bottles which is why you're having trouble finding the drink in its recognizable packaging.

Costco sheet cakes

In June Costco customers were faced with what they thought was only a temporary shortage of Costco's famous half-sheet cakes. Of course to call it a ""shortage"" was a vast understatement. Those cakes were nowhere to be found.

And it turns out the beloved Costco sheet cakes are never coming back. A Costco spokesperson told Eat This Not That! that the grocery giant would now be focusing its efforts on smaller cakes. Here are 7 Costco items that may be able to take our minds off the loss of those beloved sheet cakes.

Lean Pockets

Yes Lean Pockets are among the7 foods nutritionists hate most. But some of us thought they tasted good enough to enjoy on an occasional splurge. Well those days are now over. In a tweet parent-company Nestle confirmed that Lean Pockets have officially been canceled.

These Pringles flavors

Among the 20 beloved snacks that vanished from grocery shelves this year were several Pringles flavors including Ketchup Kickin' Chicken Taco and Multigrain Sour Cream & Onion.

At least you can still get the regular Sour Cream & Onion flavor. And if all else fails you can always turn to this handy recipe to make your own potato chips at home.

Lay's Classic Multi Pack

In a year in which many companies found themselves re-evaluating their marketing and supply strategies PepsiCo the parent company of Frito-Lays made the decision to cut back production of a full 20% of its portfolio. At least during the pandemic they said. Well we've now learned that our favorite multi-pack featuring a variety of different Frito-Lays snacks is never coming back.

Yoplait Mix-Ins

Remember all those times this year when you visited the dairy section of your grocery store hoping finally to see Yoplait Mix-Ins back on the shelf? Well it turns out it was all for naught. The yogurt-and-crunch mix has been canceled and the company confirmed the news on Twitter.

These Kellogg's cereals

The year 2020 marked the end of at least two Kellogg's cereals including Rice Krispy Treats and Cinnamon Frosted Flakes. It's not like either of these were among the healthiest cereals on the planet. On the other hand they weren't among the worst.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

But apparently Kellogg's wasn't thinking about nutrition so much as popularity. Here are 19 fast-food items that got canceled due to a lack of popularity.

Fiber One Protein granola style

In a short Tweet reply to an inquiring Fiber One fan General Mills confirmed it had discontinued its granola-style Fiber One Protein cereal. No explanation was offered but the company promised to ""let the team know"" that this cereal's return would be welcomed. And at least you can still find General Mills' original Fiber One at the grocery store which is a very good thing because it happens to be one of the best healthy cereal brands for weight loss.

These Coca-Cola beverages

In late October Coca-Cola announced it would be discontinuing 200 of its brands representing the underperforming half of its beverage portfolio. At the time we already knew Tab Zico and Odwalla were on the chopping block. We have since learned that Coca-Cola Life Diet Coke Feisty Cherry Hubert's Lemonade Northern Neck Ginger Ale and Delaware Punch have been discontinued as well.

Jif Power Ups

Jif Power Ups we hardly knew ye. This creamy yet crunchy peanut-buttery snack food made with Jif peanut butter was introduced in 2018 but was discontinued as early as February 2020. J.M. Smucker Co. which owns Jif announced the cancellation of the Power Ups line in order to remain focused on their biggest crowd-pleaser: peanut butter. In fact the company has since launched a healthier peanut butter spread featuring no added sugar.

Look no further than 2020 for evidence that the long-term trend of the market is up. Despite an unprecedented global pandemic it appears as though the S&P 500 will miraculously end this year up in the mid-teens.

Nevertheless we shouldn't forget we've had two massive downturns in just the past two years which can be awfully scary if you're not prepared. One thing's for sure -- we'll get another. It may be in 2021; it may be further out. But another big downturn will most certainly happen at some point over the next five years.

After this year's big gains some investors may be looking to lock in some profits and preserve capital especially those in or near retirement. Nevertheless stocks still seem like the best place for long-term savings given that bonds yield next to nothing and most asset classes remain somewhat highly priced.

The solution? Position your portfolio defensively in companies that can weather a big storm or even capitalize on the next recession.

With high-flying IPO stocks trading at nosebleed valuations and many ""reopening"" stocks already pricing in a recovery here are three rock-solid defensive stocks you can confidently hold through the next downturn.

Berkshire Hathaway

One of the best ways to protect your net worth is to throw your money in with the most practical risk-off investor of all time: Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.56%) (BRK.B 0.07%) has actually lagged the overall stock market for the past one- five- and 10-year periods.

Still this may be a function of the growth-obsessed market we're currently in with investors paying very high prices for young companies with exciting potential. In comparison Buffett's Berkshire may seem downright old-fashioned.

Yet that's overlooking the topic of risk. As Buffett once said in his 2001 letter to shareholders ""You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.""

Buffett and his partners have built the current Berkshire into a collection of businesses with highly defensive characteristics. After all insurance doesn't fluctuate with economic cycles but with the random frequency of disasters and claims.

Another huge business at Berkshire is its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit which is a huge utility and energy business that covers the U.S. Canada and Great Britain and which is also highly defensive. Another major ""utility-like"" Berkshire business is Burlington Northern railroad. All of these business units remained profitable during the downturn of 2020 with Berkshire Hathaway Energy even increasing profits.

Then of course comes Berkshire's large investment portfolio which consists of wholly owned businesses and $245 billion in public stocks as of Sept. 30. One of the greatest investors of all time Buffett and his team mostly invest in wide-moat stocks with solid staying power at reasonable valuations. And being highly cautious Berkshire held about $142 billion in cash at the end of last quarter giving Buffett and his team the optionality to pick up discounted companies should disaster strike again.

Many investors have ignored Berkshire this year as the market bounced back much too fast for Buffett to swoop in with many large consequential buys. Additionally Buffett sold out of several Covid-affected stocks like airlines at or near the 2020 bottom.

However trading at just 1.28 times book value Berkshire still looks awfully cheap compared to just about any other large-cap company. Its industrial and manufacturing businesses should also bounce back after a vaccine making shares look like a bargain for today's defensive investor.

Costco

When times get tough families look for necessities at a big discount. That likely means heading to Costco Wholesale (COST 1.57%) for its unbeatable prices on bulk items.

Operating as a membership club Costco actually earns most of its profits from annual membership fees which start at just $60 per year. Those membership fees allow Costco to continue cutting prices essentially selling products and services near breakeven to its customers.

Once you become a Costco member you aren't likely to find a better deal anywhere else. Even in this pandemic year Costco was able to increase its same-store sales in the mid-teens as it rolled out enhanced safety measures and grew its e-commerce business. Last quarter Costco grew its e-commerce business by 86.4% and increased overall same-store sales by 15.4%.

Not only that but Costco still has a long runway for growth especially internationally. The company has only one store open in China today but it appears to be a success. If the company can increase its presence in the world's second-largest economy over the next decade it'll be another huge win.

As a defensive consumer staple Costco's stock decreased less than most other stocks in the market during the March swoon. And by December it rewarded shareholders with a special $10 dividend a bonus the company has rewarded shareholders with every few years for the past decade. For defensive-minded investors Costco will definitely help you sleep well at night.

Microsoft

Finally the most defensive way to play the red-hot cloud computing sector is Microsoft (MSFT 2.22%). At the core of Microsoft today is its high-growth Azure cloud computing platform which grew by 48% last quarter and is already a strong No. 2 player behind Amazon's AWS.

We're still in the relatively early innings of enterprises migrating their infrastructure to the cloud and Microsoft seems well-positioned as one of the three big U.S. companies primed to benefit. Last year Microsoft earned its bona fides as not just a second-place player but as a potential leader after it won the $10 billion JEDI cloud contract from the Department of Defense.

Cloud computing is a utility-like service that's also high growth adding a terrific business to Microsoft's already-impressive roster of enterprise-software products like Office and Dynamics. Microsoft is also the owner of business social media network LinkedIn code repository GitHub and the Xbox gaming platform which just released its first new console in seven years.

These highly profitable growth businesses along with a healthy $137 billion in cash on the balance sheet make Microsoft a highly defensive and growth stock all at once. When you look at it that way the company's 35 price-to-earnings ratio doesn't seem so expensive after all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWVscGh0b2RheS5jb20vbGV0dGVycy10by10aGUtZWRpdG9yL2xldHRlci1yZXNpZGVudC1jb25jZXJuZWQtd2l0aC1qYW1tZWQtY29zdGNvLXBhcmtpbmctbG90LWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pYy0zMjIxMzkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LETTER: Resident concerned with 'jammed' Costco parking lot during pandemic,"Resident questions why a small restaurant would have to close when Costco doesn't

Concerned citizen Jen Bailey submitted the following letter to the editor regarding COVID-19 protocols in big box stores like Costco:

Can someone please tell me why a restaurant like The Fat Duck has to close up (they have 4000 square feet of restaurant) because of COVID-19 but Costco can stay open full tilt?

I thought I would head to Costco at 3:00 p.m. today thinking it might be less busy.

As I approached the parking lot looked like what you might expect on a normal holiday season Tuesday. But as we all know this is anything but normal.

With a jammed parking lot you might expect a huge lineup as stores have been told to operate at limited capacity and I remember what it was like in the spring. BUT there was no lineup.

I decided that it wasn’t safe to go in so I turned my car around and left. (Couldn’t find a spot anyway).

Who’s checking up on these places?

January 2 2021

Story By Mike McGlothlin

Every automotive niche has its own way of representing itself. In the diesel realm enthusiasts often honor the engine under their hood more than the vehicle make it sits in. For trucks this means the Power Stroke Duramax and especially the Cummins are the primary celebrities often paid homage long before Ford Chevy and Dodge brand loyalty comes into play. Sometimes it’s a catchy vanity plate other times it’s an amusing sticker on the back glass and sometimes it’s flat-out ingenious. Every time it’s entertaining. From quirky to classy this is what some of the folks in the diesel world are up to.

The Perks Of Owning A Prehistoric Diesel

With older diesels such as the 12-valve Cummins and 7.3L Power Stroke often being described as dinosaurs thanks to their antiquated injection systems Miranda Neeley took it upon herself to have some fun. She had this HUEIsaurus sticker made for her 7.3L-powered ’99 Super Duty which happens to make more than 620rwhp and 1200 lb-ft despite its hydraulically actuated and electronically controlled (HEUI) injection system.

Connecting Rod Cupholders

A heavy-duty equipment mechanic in a previous life LinCo Diesel Performance’s Jeff McCord decided to put some spare 3306 Caterpillar connecting rods and 12-valve Cummins pushrods to use in his ’68 C30 Cummins swap project. The one-off cupholder assembly also plays into the rat-rod theme that’s big in the diesel world right now.

Engine Loyalty Can Even Be Found In Headlights

In the world of customized projector retrofit headlights showing loyalty to the diesel power plant under the hood is becoming commonplace these days. Here the 6.7L Power Stroke dwelling inside of an ’11-’16 F-350 is being celebrated. Some headlight mods are poorly executed while others (like this one) appear so well done you find yourself wanting to know who did the work.

BNT RODS

If you’re pushing the limits why not let everyone know about it. That was exactly what the owner of this Lariat trim F-250 was thinking. With the 6.7L Power Stroke’s connecting rods known to be a weak link beyond the 650rwhp mark—and with this particular engine sporting a Midwest Diesel & Auto 66mm VGT Exergy 10mm stroker CP4.2 custom PCM tuning and making 660rwhp—the license plate offers a hint of what could be on the horizon: bent rods!

6-Deep Burnouts

At least at Blackout in the Country a bustling event put on annually by Bean’s Diesel Performance you’ll find trucks full of people taking in a nice lengthy burnout. Of course one lucky passenger always has the task of recording the festivities on their phone. Watch out for flying rubber!

Soot Life

We swear stickers aren’t really a “thing” in the diesel world but surely you’ve heard of “Salt Life?” Well meet the “Soot Life” sticker a play on the ocean-centered lifestyle represented via the Salt Life banners you see stuck on everyone back glass currently. In this case it’s funny but also fits the mold perfectly. If you come across the average diesel owner you’ll quickly find that they truly do live breathe and sleep compression ignition.

The Vanity Plate That Taunts

Poking the competition through the use of vanity plates certainly isn’t unique to diesel owners—but it is fairly common. And when you’ve upgraded turbos and added a few other go-fast goodies to your ’11-’14 6.7L Power Stroke you can pull off this kind of messaging. Serving as the tow-rig for the guys at Unlimited Diesel Performance their dual rear wheel F-350 Platinum Super Duty is probably more than capable of holding its own against the average “juiced up” Duramax it encounters on the street.

Suburbamax

Surely you’ve heard the terms DuraBurb and DuraKon. Say hello to Suburbamax a name that means the owner took it upon himself or herself to build the SUV GM should’ve: a family hauler powered by the 6.6L Duramax V-8. This type of swap is accepted in all corners of the diesel world as the GM-built engine remains in a GM product keeping it all in the family so to speak. The naming part is simply the icing on the cake or the cue on the cowl in this case…

Not Just A Badge—He Really Swapped It!

Wait what? Your grandparents’ old four-door Lincoln got transformed into a four-wheel drive Cummins-powered luxury sedan… Well somebody’s did and Adam Naeck put in all the legwork. How does a Super Duty chassis a ZF-6 manual and a P-pumped 12-valve sound? It’s just more proof that Cummins die-hards are constantly thinking outside the box whether it’s a junkyard project or a top-of-the-line no-expense-spared build.

It’s an absolute pleasure to debate the selections and my team may not be the same one selected by readers of The Irish Post it’s very much a subjective test and you will be judge and jury on my verdict.

I’m thinking of those summer days again and the spine-tingling sound of the clash of the ash - let’s bring on the seventies.

This decade belonged to Cork and Kilkenny who shared the spoils of four titles each.

Cork started the decade in devasting style when they defeated Wexford in the first 80-minute final. It was also a significant year for ‘The Rebels’ as it brought them level with Tipperary on the All-Ireland rankings with 21 titles apiece.

The Cork three-in-a-row period ’76 – ‘78 was a magnificent campaign and signalled the start of something special with a talented pool of players.

Kilkenny with an air of invincibility about them and a conveyor belt of new talent on show to compliment the old brigade began a winning sequence that would bring them four All Ireland titles in the decade.

In 1973 the cup returned to Limerick after a lapse of 33 years. The revival of Limerick was so welcome. The more teams challenging realistically for the top honour the better.

You may rightly ask what about Tipperary?

Well having bid farewell to some of the old heroes the wheels fell off the wagon after the golden sixties.

At last a time for realignment and the introduction of much needed fresh blood. Although the remedy didn’t immediately pay dividends they did at least get a windfall with victory in ’71.

There you have it the teams that made the ‘70s now time for my choice of the best hurlers of the decade.

Goalkeepers

Noel Skehan Kilkenny

Noel marshalled his defence as if his life depended on it. He was fearless around the goal mouth dashing out through a forest of hurls and clearing his lines.

Seamus Durack Clare

Although success eluded him in the championship he showcased his ability on the bigger stage of Railway Cup competitions. A fine custodian.

Defenders

Phil (Fan) Larkin Kilkenny

From a family steeped in hurling Phil was small of statue but he made up for his lack of physique with a shrewd hurling brain and tremendous skill and courage.

Ted Carroll Kilkenny

A delightful and elegant corner back with a deceptive burst of speed often leaving forwards trailing in his wake.

Pat Hartigan Limerick

Pat was a gentle giant well over 6’3 in height and built like a tank. He was a fullback of incredible talent and for a man of his size never resorted to physical confrontation.

Dan Quigley Wexford

The name Quigley has adorned Wexford hurling for decades. There were so many of them all brothers. A big man Dan was a tough traditional defender who did not stand on ceremony.

Pat Dunny Kildare

A renowned dual star who won provincial honours in both codes for Leinster Pat had this never-say-die attitude matched with great hurling intensity and astute vision.

Iggy Clark Galway

A hurler of great skill and composure who kept the ‘West’ awake during the seventies. He wasn’t around when the honours arrived in the eighties. If anyone was born in the wrong era it was Iggy Clark.

Tom Cashman Cork

From a famous hurling family it was only natural Tom would follow in his father’s footsteps. He was a superb hurling artist the bedrock of the Cork defence for many years.

Martin Coogan Kilkenny

A natural left-handed player with boundless energy Martin was utterly reliable fast hard and fearless.

Pat Henderson Kilkenny

From 1964 and 1991 the Henderson family name never left the Kilkenny team sheet. Pat the eldest played in ten All-Ireland finals winning five of them. He was a colossal hurler.

Ger Loughnane Clare

Ger was clever in his stickwork one of the many facets in his repertoire of skills. He later became manager of Clare hurlers and led them to glory.

Len Gaynor Tipperary

The tough-as-teak defender won his first All-Ireland medal in 1965 and his name is inextricably linked with the great years of Tipperary’s dominance.

Jim Treacy Kilkenny

A robust player with good mobility both on the ground and in the air Jim hurled with Kilkenny at a time when the team had a great understanding between themselves.

Mid-fielders

Mick Jacob Wexford

One of the greatest of all Wexford hurlers a class act who avoided the physical challenges by his swift awareness and movement Mick had a great spirit combined with total commitment.

Eamon Cregan Limerick

From his debut in 1964 to his farewell game in 1983 Eamon played a leading role in Limerick’s All-Ireland success. A born hurler and playmaker with delightful skills that were not fashioned overnight.

Forwards

Gerald McCarthy Cork

Gerald had determination and flair with unerring accuracy from frees as well as contributing scoring opportunities for his colleagues in his general play.

Eamon Grimes Limerick

The blonde-haired flyer was one of Limerick’s top score-getters. A tireless worker who thrived on one-to-one situations and never shirked a tackle.

Pat Delaney Kilkenny

Pat was one of the finest forwards ever to play for Kilkenny. He had the capacity to penetrate the tightest of defences and his scoring record was phenomenal.

Martin Cuddy Laois

Martin was very strong with huge physical presence. He arrived in Oxford around 1968 so I can vouch for his strength. He would go through a brick wall taking man and ball with him.

Babs Keating Tipperary

One of the greatest duel players of all time Babs arrived on the inter-county scene in the early sixties winning his first All- Ireland medal in 1964. A player of great style speed and strength.

Joe Henry Mayo

It is generally accepted that hurling is not native to Mayo. Joe undoubtedly Mayo’s finest hurler of all time carved a niche for himself in the hurling lore of the land winning three Railway Cup medals with Connacht.

Jimmy Barry Murphy Cork

A duel player with amazing talent that would fit into my selection for both the football and hurling all-time greats. A child prodigy who had this propensity for attack and scoring spectacular goals and points.

PJ Molloy Galway

PJ was graced with unlimited hurling skills and a real opportunist in or near the goals. He ploughed a lone furrow for many years but got his rewards at the end.

Ray Cummins Cork

Ray was another duel star with exceptional talent. He played in ten All-Ireland finals in both codes and eventually had a postage stamp issued in his honour.

Mick Birmingham Dublin

The only Dublin player to have won five Railway Cup titles with Leinster testament to his hurling prowess and ability.

Billy Fitzpatrick Kilkenny

Billy played in six senior All-Ireland hurling finals and was successful in five of them. He was Kilkenny’s leading marksmen over many years a classy player with a graceful style.

Joe Connolly Galway

From a famous family in Castlegar Galway he first pulled on the maroon jersey in the late seventies and was still wearing it when he captained the county to All-Ireland glory in 1980.

So that’s it folks. In the meantime do look after yourselves and stay safe.

This news comes as Wexford continues to experience a surge in Covid-19 cases. On Sunday December 27 a further 40 positive cases in the county were confirmed by the HSE meaning Wexford retained the second highest 14 day incidence rate in Ireland with 348.6.

The first batch of the Pfizer vaccine arrived in Ireland on Saturday and vaccinations will begin in hospitals today. However those residing in nursing homes will have to wait a little longer.

Abbeygale House in Wexford town will be the first in the county to receive its consignment of vaccinations on Wednesday January 13 with residents and staff in Cherry Grove Nursing Home in New Ross receiving theirs a day later.

Cherry Grove has had a particularly bleak 2020 a year in which it lost 10 of its residents to Covid-19. Owner and manager Tom Cummins said the vaccine's arrival offered all at the home some solace after an incredibly difficult time.

However he offered a note of caution to those who believed this signalled the end of the pandemic.

'In one way this announcement was the worst thing they could have said because people are going to drop their guard now' said Mr Cummins.

'But from our perspective it's a case of ""bring it on"". We would have liked to have to got it sooner but we can't influence how it works we're just a small fish in the ocean.

'But this is huge for us and hopefully it will mean there's light at the end of the tunnel.'

The Covid-19 vaccine will be administered in two separate doses for all those who consent to taking it.

On January 14 the first vaccinations will be carried out at Cherry Grove with all residents and staff invited to consent to the vaccination in advance.

It is estimated that each vaccination will take 12 minutes to administer and that 35 vaccines will be administered per day.

It will take three weeks to administer the first dose of the vaccination. The process will then be repeated for the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccination with the entire procedure expected to last six weeks.

And following a sombre festive season Mr Cummins is looking forward to the future and a time when Cherry Grove will be Covid-19 free.

'We're aiming to have visitors back for Valentine's Day that's the date we're looking at' he said. 'It's been an awful Christmas for everyone here we had to close completely and had no visitors allowed at all. We tried to make it as festive as we could for the residents but it was a difficult time for them.'

Also due to receive its first consignment of the vaccine on January 14 is Kerlogue Nursing Home in Wexford town. Like Cherry Grove staff at Kerlogue have dealt with the loss of a resident as a result of Covid-19.

And General Manager Edele Lee Morris said residents at Kerlogue were hopeful that some form of normality could resume in the coming weeks.

'The residents are very much looking forward it they all just want their lives back' she said. 'It's been a long year for everyone here they haven't had the same freedom as everyone else haven't seen their families for long periods.

But before anyone could be vaccinated Ms Morris said she and her fellow staff members would be providing as much education and information on the vaccination as possible.

'We will provide education for them and they are entitled to make their own decisions on it that's something which needs to be stressed.

'I think the take up will be high though for example this year 97 per cent of staff took the flu vaccine and 100 per cent of residents took it. In previous years they might have said ""ah I won't bother"" but that changed this year that wouldn't have been the norm before. So if that's anything to go by the take up will be high

And while she too is hopeful that visitors will soon be allowed in to the nursing home Ms Morris said every precaution would be taken before they were permitted to return.

'It depends on how quickly it (the vaccine) can be rolled out in the community there's no point in us allowing people in if the people in here are vaccinated and the visitors aren't' she said.

'But we're looking forward to it it's a huge positive for us; everyone has worked extremely hard this year I've never known a year like it the staff have worked incredibly hard.'

Photo: Getty Images

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson enters the New Year as the top-ranked test batsman after leapfrogging Australia's Steve Smith and India skipper Virat Kohli in the latest official rankings.

Williamson who returned from paternity leave this month hit a match-winning century in the opening test against Pakistan to help New Zealand win by 101 runs at Mount Maunganui on Wednesday.

Smith is in the middle of a rare slump in form and dropped behind Kohli after registering four single-digit scores at the halfway stage of the ongoing four-test series against India.

Kohli who top-scored for India in their eight-wicket thrashing by Australia in the series opener in Adelaide has returned home for the birth of his first child.

India's stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane jumped to number six after his stellar hundred in the second test inspired the tourists to a series-levelling victory in Melbourne.

Australia's Pat Cummins remains the top-ranked test bowler while compatriot Mitchell Starc jumped two places to enter the top five.

India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin (seventh) and quick Jasprit Bumrah (ninth) improved their top 10 positions after their impressive performance in the Melbourne test."

""We continue to do better and therefore meet the criteria to sit at the table when it comes to a possible consolidation of the European banks - and not just as a junior partner"" Sewing told Welt am Sonntag in an interview.

Sewing who is pursuing a long-term drive to boost earnings power at Deutsche after years of underperformance has consistently said that his priority was to complete a turnaround by 2022.

Talks on an all-German banking merger with Commerzbank failed in 2019 and with a stock market value of just 18 billion euros ($21.9 billion) Deutsche would be an affordable target for a more richly valued potential acquirer.

Sewing played up the bank's strategic importance for Europe's largest economy and top exporting nation however and said his restructuring drive was bearing fruit.

""It would be a mistake to rely on imports of financial services"" said Sewing. ""Every quarter in which we are successful makes us stronger.""

Earnings and costs in its private and corporate business were absolutely on track he added and Deutsche's investment bank has outperformed expectations. ($1 = 0.8239 euros)

No suit for the development manager of EFG/Saber Heritage SC of Armonk just work boots jeans open-collar shirt and a very warm jacket.

Berger took time out from his busy schedule to afford the Business Journal a personal tour of the massive $300 million-plus development that Saber Real Estate North LLC and EnviroFinance Group LLC are in the midst of creating on the grounds of the former Hudson River State Hospital in the town of Poughkeepsie.

Berger and company are turning the neglected 156-acre property ”“ long a scavenger”™s delight and a veritable eyesore visible for miles ”“ into an intergenerational live-work-play community called Hudson Heritage that will eventually include:

750 residential units;

350000 square feet of commercial and retail space;

assisted living housing;

a 150-room hotel and conference center;

40000 square feet of urgent and primary care medical facility/office space; ”¢ a 24700-square-foot education/performing arts center;

walking trails; and

more than 60 acres of open parkland and access to a planned 2.7-mile rail trail for walking and biking.

Berger said what initially drew him to the site was demographics ”“ the growth of adjacent Marist College the Culinary Institute of America and Nuvance Health which includes Vassar Brothers Medical Center just to the south.

“So you have 40000 high paying quality prevailing wage union wage jobs within a mile and a half. And you have such a need for multifamily housing hotel retail restaurants and a supermarket” he said.

THE LURE

“So what attracted us was first and foremost the demand generators in the immediate corridor combined with the lack of services. We love to do these live-work-play centers. We”™ve found if you can offer somebody the opportunity to live work and play on one site you get higher rents higher values. You create synergies so there”™s a purpose. We”™re seeing multifamily (developers) want to be here because we have the amenities the retail space hotel.”

Saber has been involved in a number of developments in the New York region including The Duet a luxury rental complex under construction at Hale and Maple Avenues in White Plains; Rivertowns Square an open-air village with dining and shopping in Dobbs Ferry; and The River Club luxury apartments and retail in Bogota New Jersey.

A similar but smaller live-work-play campus 60-acre Eastdale Village on Route 44 in the town of Poughkeepsie recently began its next construction phase for four retail tenants. Eastdale Village which is planned to have 400 residential units is being built by Kirchhoff Cos.

Berger said Marist College gets about 68000 visitors a year with 24000 inquiring as to where they can stay nearby. So a hotel was a natural for the property he said and it could be branded by Marist with its Red Fox logo. In addition they wanted a “Main Street retail” component.

So in the overall plans Berger said there will be 350000 square feet of commercial including a nearly finished 65000-square-foot ShopRite that intends to open early next year with plans to hire 200 workers.

Several other businesses signing leases are:

Chipotle Mexican Grill  2300 square feet. The chain has roots in the Hudson Valley as founder Steve Ellis is an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America.

 2300 square feet. The chain has roots in the Hudson Valley as founder Steve Ellis is an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America. CVS Pharmacy  14866 square feet.

 14866 square feet. Starbucks 2100 square feet.

2100 square feet. Burger King  2570 square feet.

 2570 square feet. Smoothie King 1345 square feet.

Several other tenants have also signed letters of intent to open at Hudson Heritage. Charter Realty & Development of Westport Connecticut is handling commercial leasing.

FROM OLD THE NEW

Berger proudly spoke of the project as he drove through the property from Route 9 to the back by the east gate where on the other side sits Our Lady of the Rosary Chapel which was once part of the psychiatric center until St. Peter”™s Church bought it in 1999 and restored it.

Restoration and adaptive reuse were also on the mind of Berger as he stopped next to the “Kirkbride” administrative building which commands a majestic view of the Great Lawn ”“ designed by the renowned Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux ”“ and the Hudson Valley beyond.

The High Victorian Gothic building was designed by Vaux Withers & Co. when the psychiatric center opened in 1871. Workers were placing new trusses on the roof of the “Kirkbride” which had 360 of its windows replaced.

The Kirkbride and five other buildings ”“ including the 7500-square-foot director”™s house ”“ will be preserved which Berger suggested could be used by a law firm or doctors.

Berger said he found inspiration in the old buildings and the ones that had to be torn down. So much so that “We”™ve taken brick from the demolished buildings and reusing them in the pylons and monuments throughout the site. We”™ve taken windows out of the old buildings and stained glass and using them in some of the retail buildings. Some of the grates and gates and ornamental metal etc.”

Berger said “We”™re going to reuse and rebuild the old greenhouses. It will be an amenity for residents who want to plant vegetables and so forth.”

Saying “it”™s a shame some of these buildings are coming down” and that already the crews have “taken down about half million square feet of buildings” Berger is quick to point out that all but the steel ands tons of asbestos and lead that was shipped offsite has been reutilized.

“Everything else gets processed. So all the material that we”™ve used ”“ rather than bring in 5000 6000 7000 truckloads of material ”“ we”™ve used everything on site.”

In what will be the parking lot for the ShopRite one worker operating a front loader outfitted with a giant magnet on it removed bits of metal from the broken brick and concrete. Another front loader pushed the material onto a conveyor belt that sent it through two crushers. The end material becomes clean fill or stone for road beds with the crushed brick used for liner for laying underground pipes.

LOOK AHEAD

Berger characterized Hudson Heritage as his hardest project.

“We”™re the master developer. We”™re doing all the infrastructure and we”™re building the shopping center (for) $80 million” he said.

“This is really eight or nine or ten projects at once. You have to think about it typically one company does the commercial and then another company will undertake restoration and then another company (will) build a hotel another multifamily.”

Construction is expected to take three to six years. Once finished Hudson Heritage will create 750 permanent jobs and generate $8 million in annual property taxes including $2 million to the town.

“So we”™re fairly far along. About 65 to 70 percent pre-leased. ”¦Out of the 750 residential about 600 plus under letter of intent or contract. We”™re up in the air on the hotel and we”™re up in the air on the administration building” he said.

“I can”™t tell you who but we”™re going to contract with a developer who is going to build 360 units they plan to restore and reuse the church chapel library and one other building.”

The tour ends with a smile.

“When we”™re all done it”™ll be spectacular.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sYWRpZXMtbG9uZG9uLWFsdW0tY2Fyb2xpbmUtc3RhbmJ1cnktMjAxNTMwMjAzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ladies of London Alum Caroline Stanbury Engaged to Former Real Madrid Player Sergio Carrallo,"Ladies of London alum Caroline Stanbury has found love again nearly one year after her divorce.

Star Wars' Oscar Isaac and Pedro Pascal said goodbye to 2020 together on Thursday night celebrating New Year's Eve in a playful photo shared by Isaac's wife filmmaker Elvira Lind.

Pascal who plays the title character on the hit Disney+ space Western The Mandalorian has one arm slung around the shoulders of Isaac (Poe Dameron in the most recent film trilogy) for the photo wearing a pointy silver party hat positioned lopsidedly atop his head.

As Isaac 41 gazes open-mouthed up at Pascal 45 the latter looks straight into the camera tipping a bottle of beer back with his free hand.

""BEEEEYYYYY 2020👋🏼 — we're done with ya"" Lind captioned the fun post on which Pascal hilariously replied ""2020 #ByeB****.""

Pascal also shared images to his Instagram while spending time with his sister Javiera Balmaceda and nephews writing alongside a snapshot of himself with Balmaceda ""All we need is ❤️. Nada mas. Feliz año babies 😘.""

Pascal opened up to PEOPLE in November about The Mandalorian whose second season recently went out with a bang. The finale saw the surprise return of a CGI version of Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker who swooped in to rescue Mando and Grogu/The Child (better known as Baby Yoda).

The Chilean-American actor revealed he was ""immediately convinced"" to make the series after seeing an illustration of the adorable green alien — in fact he was so smitten upon first meeting Grogu that he admitted to ""cooing a little bit"" on set.

""I'd then have conversations in the same way that we did when we were kids with our own little toys"" Pascal said. ""It has everything to do with the amount of work that these people have put into it because it's a very very special creation and it feels as such when you see it in person.""

""I enjoyed the challenge of those films and working with a very large group of incredible artists and actors prop makers set designers and all that was really fun"" said the actor and dad who shares two children with Lind: a 15-month-old son and his big brother Eugene 3½.

The 430 435 530 and 535 were part of the beginning of the ""tight bale"" contest among baler manufacturers. The hydraulic pump that runs the tying system is run by a belt and the belt along with about five other springs all must be in place and of proper strength and length for the baler to tie correctly. So many times when the support is removed to replace the belt the adjustment that allows the hammer latch to be pulled down over its stop is not checked. To check this adjustment open and close the gate and look at the latch and make sure it came down over the arm of the support. I bet you will find that the latch is resting on top of the support rather than down and locked over it. All you need to do is loosen the three cap screws you removed that hold the support and tap the support forward which will allow the latch to rest down over the support after the gate is closed and the tying system is reset.

READER: I am in the process of changing my 8N Ford tractor to a 12-volt system. The tractor has a side-mounted distributor. I have asked several people exactly how to install the battery and how the wires go to the coil. I seem to get mixed answers. Can you give me that information?

STEVE: I get many questions about this 6-volt to 12-volt conversion and it is a little confusing. One reason for the confusion is that many older 6-volt tractors and cars came from the factory as 6-volt and a positive ground. It was believed that when the positive post was grounded to the frame it caused more corrosion than if it were grounded as negative. So the change was made. Another reason for the change surfaced when the alternator came into play on vehicles. The alternator will charge at much slower engine speeds but it will not charge if the system is positive ground. The alternator is sort of neat because it will charge no matter which way it is turning which makes it very flexible. A generator will charge turning only one way. So here is the way to make the conversion work on your 8N: Change the battery to a 12-volt. You can get one the size of your old 6-volt. Change the polarity of the battery to negative ground. The wires on the coil need to be reversed. The hot wire to the positive (+) and the negative (-) side to the distributor. You can use the 6-volt starter. Which alternator you choose (three-wire or one-wire) will make a difference in alternator wiring. One more thing: You will need to either place a resistor between the switch and the coil to drop the voltage or replace the 6-volt coil with a 12-volt coil. I recommend replacing the coil with a 12-volt internal resistor coil.

The R2R movement lobbies for repair-friendly legislation standards and regulations through organizations like the Repair Association. The Association advocates for guaranteeing property rights obtaining equal access to information non-discriminatory pricing of parts and tools and unlocking software.

“We’re trying to maintain our consumer rights which means we’d still like to be able to repair and modify our tractors just like our dad grandfather and great grandfather did years ago” says Kevin Kenney an Alternative Fuel Systems Engineer at Grassroots Energy LLC and a member of the R2R movement tells Food Tank President Danielle Nierenberg on Food Talk Live.

The R2R movement is confronting corporations like John Deere who control machinery that farmers use. These companies prevent farmers from repairing equipment such as tractors and instead force farmers to hire outside contractors. According to Kenney this can cost farmers up to US$150 an hour.

Kenney explains that corporations are able to do this through tactics such as lengthy Extended Use License Agreements (EULAs). Companies argue that farmers who sign these EULAs do not own their tractors but receive a license to operate the vehicle. This forces farmers to comply with the manufacturer’s instructions and prevents them from repairing either the equipment or the software on their own.

Kenney tells Food Tank “with major equipment manufacturers…they make us sign these [EULA]’s; and it’s just like your cell phone where you have the right to use your cell phone but you don’t really own it.”

One of the main concerns of the R2R movement is aging farm equipment often called legacy equipment. When manufacturers introduce new software they often stop supporting the old version making it nearly impossible for farmers to repair existing equipment.

“The problem that we are having is if [manufacturers] decide to quit supporting [equipment] with software we can’t get it fixed” Kenney tells Food Tank.

This practice forces farmers to buy new software and equipment which can reach up to US$600000 dollars.

The cost does not only force current farmers to invest in costly new equipment or repairs to continue their work. Kenney explains that it also acts as a barrier for young farmers who lack access to capital to acquire these technologies when starting their farms.

But while the R2R movement fights for the right to own and repair farm equipment companies are pushing back. John Deere argues that the R2R movement puts farmers’ safety at risk and violates intellectual property rights.

In response to this criticism many farmers are using the auto industry’s Memorandum of Understanding to show that the right to repair is possible. In 2014 car manufacturers voluntarily agreed to make the same information and tools they provide to franchised dealers available to independent repair shops.

Kenney asks “If you can fix your car or truck why not your tractor?”

Kenney and other members of the R2R movement are also advocating for open source software which gives users freedom to share study and modify software. Kenney is currently working with the Free Software Foundation to create open source resources for farmers.

To date 35 states have proposed R2R legislation demonstrating that farmers want to learn how to fix their own equipment and build on-farm ingenuity according to Kenney.

Kenney is urging both urban and rural communities to come together to support farmers in this movement and distribute power from large companies to the many. “We’re tired of this urban versus rural split” Kenney tells Food Tank.

“The fact that you are taking business away from the very very few and offering up assistance to 50-60000 farmers [in Nebraska]…How could that be a bad thing?”

Liam is the son of Howard and Mary Salmon of Anderson California. The family plans to have a celebration of life service post-COVID-19 once large groups are allowed to gather again.

His infectious smile and love of big rigs and John Deere tractors captured the hearts of many in the trucking industry and agriculture community as they rallied around Liam to grant his wish for mail for his fifth birthday wish in October. Law enforcement agencies from across the country mailed him patches calling him “Officer Liam.”

Liam was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) a pediatric brain tumor that infiltrates the pons portion of the brainstem that controls breathing sleeping and balance on January 4 2020.

Soon after hearing about Liam’s fatal diagnosis the St. Christopher Truckers Relief Fund (SCF) provided the Salmons with financial assistance — paying two of the couple’s house payments — so Howard a 24-year owner-operator could take time off of the road to be with Liam during his radiation treatments according to the SCF statement.

Howard and Liam also were featured on the marketing materials for TravelCenters of America’s ‘Be A Champion of Change’ fundraiser benefiting SCF.

“Liam touched so many lives in his short life” Howard Salmon a veteran truck driver said in the SCF statement. “This trucker’s son was a ‘mini-me.’”

Since 2008 SCF a nonprofit 501(c)(3) has helped thousands of professional truck drivers and their families with financial needs due to current medical problems.





“His name will remain in the hearts of many people” Salmon said. “He wanted daddy to be able to help other kids so that is what we will be doing from now on.”

Liam’s heartbreaking prognosis

On Jan. 4 2020 doctors at UC Davis Children’s Hospital in Sacramento discovered a brain tumor. Liam was quickly scheduled for a biopsy but the results were not good Salmon told FreightWaves in October.

After digesting this news the Salmons were dealt another devastating blow. Currently there is no cure for DIPG which has a 0% survival rate.

As an owner-operator Howard Salmon only makes money when his wheels turn. However the Salmons made the decision to park the truck and spend every day with Liam.

Liam was later transferred to the University of California in San Fransisco where he underwent 30 rounds of radiation which he completed on March 17. Before Liam’s death his doctors in California had joined forces with a North Carolina doctor who is working on a new chemotherapy treatment to shrink brain tumors.

‘Tractor boy’ Liam loved mail

Before Liam’s terminal diagnosis of DIPG Salmon described Liam as his “shadow.”

“He used to walk around my truck with me” Salmon said. “If I kicked the tires so did he. That’s what little boys do. They follow dad.”





Liam also known as “tractor boy” by his friends and family had a simple request for his fifth birthday: mail. And boy did he get his wish after FreightWaves posted an article about Liam’s love of mail John Deere and Legos. The trucking industry and John Deere’s Twitter followers quickly responded and found birthday cards and little surprises to send him.

His supporters also donated to his Liam Strong GoFundMe page set up by his aunt Jennifer Syfert so that his dad Howard could park his truck and “make every day about Liam.”

However Liam’s condition worsened in late December. His family and friends held a prayer vigil for him a night before his passing.

The Salmons plan to honor Liam by helping other kids affected by DIPG as they have witnessed firsthand the physical emotional and financial toll this devastating fatal disease takes on families.

Howard Salmon also appeared on WHAT THE TRUCK?!? to update listeners and readers about Liam’s condition educate the industry about DIPG and advocate for more research funding to study this fatal brain cancer affecting children.

According to The Michael Mosier Defeat DIPG Foundation only 4% of all cancer research money is spent on pediatric cancers. The organization said the entire amount spent annually on DIPG research — approximately $3 million to $5 million — is less than 0.0005% of the total funding for cancer research.

Approximately 300 children are diagnosed with DIPG each year in the U.S. The average life expectancy of a child diagnosed with this disease is 6 months to 1 year.

His parents also wanted to thank everyone who helped make Liam’s last year special.

“Drivers please take it from me — make every day with your family full of love” Howard Salmon said. “Liam taught me the meaning of love.”

Air travel is less than half of what it was in 2019 but it has recovered a bit from a staggering 96% decline in mid-April of last year.

It's unclear just how quickly vaccines will be distributed across the U.S. Over the past few weeks Trump administration health officials had talked about a goal of shipping enough vaccine by the end of the month to inoculate 20 million Americans. Earlier this week the government said 14 million doses had been shipped but only 2.8 million injections had been given. Officials said there is a lag in reporting vaccinations but they are still happening more slowly than expected. They expect the pace will pick up next week.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian told his employees on Friday in a New Year’s Day memo that he continues to expect the airline to be cash flow positive this spring despite challenges.

However he did say “While I am optimistic this will be year of recovery the continued uncertainty of the pandemic means that we will need to be nimble ready to adjust our course and adapt to the ever-changing environment.”

Airline executives in C-suites around the world turned to daily losses — or cash burn — as the financial metric to guide their decision making through the crisis. Bastian earlier in December said the slowdown in demand added an average of roughly $2 million a day to the carrier’s fourth quarter cash burn. Its updated forecast anticipates $12 to 14 million in daily losses excluding debt payments during the period.

Still the airline expects the situation to improve in the first half of 2021.

The Covid-19 pandemic has been brutal for U.S. airlines and significant relief isn't expected until the second half of 2021.

U.S. carriers' 2020 net losses likely topped $35 billion according to analyst estimates provided by FactSet. That includes what's expected to be Southwest Airlines ' first annual loss in more than four decades.

The pandemic ended a decade of profits that the historically boom-and-bust industry enjoyed until 2020 a stretch during which they hired tens of thousands of workers bought new planes and expanded their networks.

Airline stocks in 2020 dropped the most in years. American Airlines ' share price lost 45% its biggest percentage decline since before the carrier's 2013 merger with US Airways. Delta Air Lines ' stock lost 31% while United Airlines fell 51% over the last 12 months its biggest drop since 2008. Southwest shed 14%. The S&P 500 meanwhile rose by more than 16% in 2020.

The pandemic forced carriers to quickly shrink cut routes and park hundreds of jets. U.S. carriers' increased their total debt by $67 billion in 2020 to more than $172 billion to weather the crisis according to trade group Airlines for America. Paying that down will be a headwind over the next several years.

The good news is air travel demand has recovered a lot of ground compared with the volumes hit early in the pandemic. On April 16 the Transportation Security Administration screened 95085 people at U.S. airports less than 4% of the 2.6 million people that had passed through those checkpoints a year earlier. TSA airport screenings fueled in part by the yearend holidays surpassed 1 million people a day in the last five days through Wednesday though that's still down about 45% from a year earlier.

With lucrative business and international travel largely sidelined leisure travel became the most important market.

Airlines are expected to trim their losses and in some cases — including Southwest Delta Alaska — turn profitable next year according to analysts' estimates. Authorization of coronavirus vaccines has helped boost optimism about future travel demand though it isn't yet clear when more of the public will resume flying.

""Our mission of connecting the world has been reaffirmed by the events of the past year but we don't yet know what travel demand is going to look like when it rebounds"" said Delta's CEO Ed Bastian in an employee note on New Year's Day. ""Simply re-creating the Delta from 2019 won't be an option; our customers will give us the blueprint for the Delta of 2021 and beyond.""

Bastian reiterated that Delta expects the airline to turn cash-flow positive in the spring.

Airline executives have recently warned that they expect difficult months ahead as they pushed out targets for when they will break even and say they will continue to operate limited capacity to match weak demand. American Airlines President Robert Isom earlier this week said the carrier's January and February capacity will likely be 45% of 2019 levels.

Many potential customers are still not flying as coronavirus infections rise to ever higher records new travel restrictions are implemented and government officials recommend avoiding travel to slow the spread of the disease.

U.S. officials last week said all passengers must test negative for Covid-19 before flying to the United States after a highly contagious strain of the disease was detected in the U.K. though it has also been identified in California and Colorado.

Carriers recently won $15 billion in additional payroll support in the latest coronavirus relief package that President Donald Trump signed Sunday. That requires airlines to keep employees on staff through March 31 and to call back more than 30000 workers they furloughed when the terms of last package which was $25 billion expired on Oct. 1.

United Airlines executives said they expect it will be temporary.

""The truth is we just don't see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months"" CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart said in a Dec. 21 employee note. ""That is why we expect the recall will be temporary.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3Zpcmdpbi1hdGxhbnRpYy1kZWx0YS1kZXZhbHVhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virgin Atlantic’s No-Notice Devaluation Has Delta's Fingerprints All Over It,"My dear readers some links on this site pay us referral fees for sending business and sales.

Virgin Atlantic has massively devalued Delta awards eviscerating any value in all but the narrowest of circumstances without notice. Even absent official confirmation this devaluation has Delta’s fingerprints all over it.

Huge No-Notice Delta Devaluation Via Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Without notice Virgin Atlantic moved to a distance-based award chart on Delta redemptions. Awards are still priced on a per-segment basis and in some cases 175% higher than before.

As a point of comparison prior to 2021 Virgin Atlantic charged the following for Delta premium cabin redemptions:

Let me give you an example. For over a year I have been eyeing a Los Angeles – Shanghai trip on Delta Air Lines to experience Delta One on the A350. The pandemic meant such travel was impossible in 2020 but I hoped to do it this year.

Two days ago the trip cost 60000 miles for a one-way business class ticket. Now the same flight costs 165000 miles one-way. That’s right folks a 175% increase in price without notice.

There really are no more sweet spots in premium cabins unless you are making a shorthaul redemption under 500 miles.

Was Delta Behind This Sudden Move?

Delta acquired a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic in 2012. The two carriers are joint venture partners. Delta charged significantly more miles for its own flights than did Virgin Atlantic. Now the playing field has been leveled.

Do you really think Virgin Atlantic decided to make this change without pressure from Delta? Not when its business model (with partnerships including American Express Chase and Citi) relies upon incoming transfers and consumer redemptions.

I pressed Delta for details and received no response.

Virgin Atlantic’s statement is laughably misleading:

“We recognise how much our members value the extensive range of redemption partner options available through Flying Club including flights with our joint venture partner Delta Air Lines. The recent changes contribute to some considerable savings on reward seats meaning members can go further for fewer Virgin Points. Across all classes the redemption pricing remains competitive.”

Here’s what I think happened: Delta saw an uptick in partner bookings from Virgin Atlantic and decided that it was simply too much. In many cases Virgin Atlantic was charging less than half of what Delta charged for the same flight.

In that sense I suppose the change should not come as a surprise. What does come as a surprise however is that Virgin Atlantic gave us no notice. That is shameful and shows a total and complete lack of transparency and respect for Flying Club members.

CONCLUSION

I have miles in Virgin Atlantic and have no idea what I’ll use them for…certainly not on Delta any longer. It is a reminder that points are a depreciating asset and unpredictable in nature and value. As a consequence make an effort to collect points in flexible currencies like American Express Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards and only transfer when you are ready to book.

I’m done transferring prospectively when a lucrative 40% transfer bonus appears. Because the price of my award went up 175%…

Oh and if you were planning on booking an ANA award with Virgin Atlantic I’d get on that. Today.

Most U.S. investors had a lot of winners in their portfolios this year but some stocks certainly performed better than others.

Here’s a look at the 10 worst-performing stocks in the entire S&P 500 in 2019 as of the Dec. 29 closing price.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY)

Investors will notice a common theme among these worst-performing stocks. Travel restrictions and economic shutdowns crushed oil industry demand and oil stocks in 2020 and Occidental was the hardest-hit in the group. The stock dropped 57.7% in 2020 more than any other S&P 500 stock.

Carnival Corp (NYSE: CCL)

The travel and leisure industries have been hit nearly as hard as the oil industry in 2020. Carnival’s cruises have been shut down completely for most of 2020 and will likely remain shut down for at least a couple of months in 2021 as well. The stock dropped 57.2% in 2020.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NCLH)

Norwegian shares dropped a nearly identical 56.2% in 2020 for nearly identical reasons Carnival shares lagged.

10 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Of 2020

TechnipFMC PLC (NYSE: FTI)

The oil services group struggled in 2020 but offshore oil projects were hit especially hard due to their higher associated costs. Shares of offshore service provider TechnipFMC dropped 56.1% in 2020.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO)

It may seem redundant but no travel or industrial demand coupled with record-low oil prices is bad news for oil stocks like Marathon which is down 51.1% in 2020.

HollyFrontier Corp (NYSE: HFC)

Add refiner HollyFrontier to the growing list of battered energy stocks in 2020. The stock is down 50.2% year-to-date.

United Airlines Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL)

Airline stocks were crushed during the worst of the pandemic. Although shares have recovered throughout the year as bankruptcy fears eased United shares are still down 50.1% overall in 2020.

ONEOK Inc. (NYSE: OKE)

Same energy story different energy stock. Shares of natural gas transportation stock ONEOK are down 49.2% in 2020.

Diamondback Energy Inc (NYSE: FANG)

Permian oil producer Diamondback certainly wasn’t immune from the energy sector carnage in 2020 and its stock dropped 48.7% on the year.

Schlumberger NV (NYSE: SLB)

Rounding out the list of travel and energy casualties in 2020 is oil services giant Schlumberger. The stock lost 46.3% of its value this year.

The 'RHOP' stars rebuilt their after Robyn's bad investment.

Robyn Dixon has a lot to be happy about. In addition to planning her second wedding to her longtime love Juan Dixon the RHOP star is in the process of building her dream home. This comes just a few years after Robyn lost the couple’s fortune.

How Juan and Robyn Dixon lost their fortune

Juan and Robyn were living the good life off of Juan’s NBA fortune but it all came crumbling down in 2012. According to Robyn she trusted a close friend of the couple’s fellow basketball player Earl Badu to invest their money. Instead of investing the money Badu reportedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Dixons. Badu later jumped to his death in a suicide.

Robyn filed for bankruptcy claiming that she was $217000 of debt and earning just about $2000 monthly per Radar Online. Among her debts included $1489813 to a mortgage company $28372 in car payments $16577 to American Express $10871 to Discover and about $3000 to Bloomingdale’s.

A bankruptcy dismissal came in 2014. Still she was forced to enroll in credit counseling as well as pay the IRS $16183 in back taxes. Unfortunately the Dixons also lost their Maryland mansion and divorced in the process.

Robyn has expressed much guilt regarding the loss of their fortune on RHOP explaining that she was the one who chose to invest the money. She told Bravo TV in 2016:

“The pain and hurt that I felt in 2012 was beyond any other hurt that I have ever felt. And although the loss of money really created huge problems for us it was the evil lies and deception that hurt the most. On top of the devastation from the loss of money and the loss of a friendship (he was even a groomsman in our wedding) I experienced the shock of my life when that same friend took his own life in order to avoid the consequences of his actions. This truly was the most difficult time of my life.” Robyn Dixon Bravotv.com

Juan and Robyn rebuilt their finances and are now building their dream home

Robyn and Juan spent the next few years working hard to rebuild their finances. Though split up at the time the couple began living together to save money. They downsized and lived off of a budget.

Juan transitioned into coaching college basketball eventually getting a head coaching position at Coppin State University. Robyn began appearing on RHOP in 2013 and used the money earned from the show to start various business ventures including buying and flipping homes. She also has a hat line now available for purchase online.

The Dixon’s also reconciled and got re-engaged in December 2019. Robyn revealed during the season 5 reunion that the couple are now building their dream home.

“We actually are building a house. We just got the permits so they’re gonna break ground very soon” she said on part three of the reunion. “And then hopefully we’ll be done by May.”

Despite their progress Robyn did run into a snag when the IRS hit her with a $90000 bill. Juan made it clear that Robyn would be responsible for paying it. She now says the debt is behind her.

Her future on the show however is unclear. Rumors are surfacing that she has not been asked to return for season 6. Hopefully she’s invested her money well to extend beyond her time on the show.",,,,,,,,,,,,

David Perdue R-Ga. and Sen. Kelly Loeffler R-Ga. clasped hands during a campaign rally Dec. 21 in Milton Ga. Read more

SAVANNAH Ga. — Two months after the November elections Georgia voters have unfinished business. The outcome will determine partisan control of the U.S. Senate and how lawmakers deal with a new White House.

Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are both on the ballot Tuesday in runoff elections because neither got enough votes Nov. 3 to win outright.

Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have raised staggering sums as they try to capitalize on President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia over GOP President Donald Trump.

Here's a look at how two key Georgia elections pushed into 2021 who's running and what's at stake.

Who’s running?

Both of Georgia's Senate seats weren't supposed to be up for grabs in 2020.

Perdue is wrapping up a six-year term. The Republican was first elected in 2014 after running as a political outsider and former CEO of Reebok and Dollar General. In his first term Perdue became known as one of Trump's chief defenders in the Senate.

The race got shaken up in August 2019 when fellow GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson announced he was resigning because of failing health. Georgia's governor appointed Loeffler to fill the seat but she would have to run in the November election to fill the last two years of Isakson's term.

Like Perdue Loeffler's background was in business rather than politics. Before joining the Senate she worked at Intercontinental Exchange a company founded by her husband that operates the New York Stock Exchange. One of the Senate's wealthiest members Loeffler has spent more than $20 million of her own cash running and traveled the state in her private jet.

As for the challengers Ossoff and Warnock are seeking to become the first Democrats to win a U.S. Senate election in Georgia since 2000.

If he defeats Perdue Ossoff would be the Senate’s youngest member at age 33. His introduction to politics came as a college students when he interned for Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis the Democrat and civil rights hero who died in July. Ossoff runs a company that produces documentary films and ran for a House seat in 2017 which he lost but proved a formidable fund-raiser.

In the wide-open race for Loeffler's seat Democratic leaders united early to endorse Warnock pastor of the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached and one of Georgia's best-known Black ministers. Warnock's activism from the pulpit on issues such as bail reform and expanded voting rights have become centerpieces of his campaign — just as his sometimes fiery sermons have provided ammunition for attacks by Republicans.

Why is Georgia still voting?

Georgia law requires candidates for Congress and state offices to win by getting more than 50% of the vote. Otherwise races get forced into a runoff between the top two finishers.

In November Perdue finished 88000 votes ahead of Ossoff but fell just short of a majority with 49.7% of the vote in a three-way race that included Libertarian Shane Hazel.

A runoff was virtually assured in the special election for Loeffler's seat. Because she was running to complete her predecessor's unfinished term state law requires a political free-for-all with multiple Republicans and Democrats sharing the ballot. Loeffler and Warnock were the top finishers out of 20 candidates with neither getting more than one-third of the vote.

Why wait until 2021 to resolve those races?

Georgia amended its election laws in 2014 to require nine weeks between general elections and runoffs. The runoff period had been just four weeks. But that changed after the U.S. Justice Department sued Georgia arguing military members stationed overseas didn't have enough time to receive and mail back absentee ballots.

What’s at stake?

If Perdue and Loeffler both lose their seats Republicans lose control of the U.S. Senate after six years holding a majority in the chamber.

The November elections resulted in Republicans holding 50 Senate seats and Democrats controlling 48. Only the two seats in Georgia remain undecided.

A win by either Perdue or Loeffler would keep the Senate in Republican hands.

But victories by both Ossoff and Warnock would leave both parties with 50 seats each — and therefore tilt control to Democrats. That's because Democratic Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the Senate's presiding officer and will vote as needed to break any ties.

It would be a big win for Biden as Democrats would control both houses of Congress.

Where do things stand?

Perdue and Loeffler have cast themselves as the last line of defense against Democratic control of Washington. But their closing arguments have been complicated by Trump siding with Democrats in calling for one-time cash payments of $2000 for pandemic relief an amount most congressional Republicans oppose.

Both GOP senators have said they support Trump's demand for the extra money after months of caricaturing Democrats as socialists who favor wasteful spending. Ossoff and Warnock insist their rivals haven't done enough to try to force a vote on the higher relief payments in the Senate.

The two Democrats reported staggering fund-raising of more than $100 million each during the past two months. Their hauls far outpaced the Republican incumbents with Perdue reporting $68 million and Loeffler just under $64 million.

Georgia voters meanwhile have already been turning out in huge numbers despite the holidays and the pandemic. More than 2.8 million have voted early either in person or by mail — more than half of the 5 million total votes cast in Georgia in November.

Both sides are calling on their heaviest hitters to help turn out supporters. Trump has scheduled a Monday rally with Perdue and Loeffler in conservative northwest Georgia. Harris plans to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock on Sunday in Savannah followed by Biden in Atlanta on Monday.

Heading into the final days Perdue’s campaign said Thursday that he and his wife learned they had been in close contact with a staffer who tested positive for COVID-19 and the senator was in quarantine despite having tested negative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd2hhdG5vd2F0bGFudGEuY29tL2xhLW1pY2hvYWNhbmEtbWV4aWNhbi1yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1zZWNvbmQtcmVzdGF1cmFudC10by1vcGVuLWF0LXRoZS1zaG9wcy1hdC13ZXN0cmlkZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La Michoacana Mexican Restaurant's Second Restaurant To Open At The Shops At Westridge,"The newly developed outparcel building at The Shops at Westridge in McDonough in the vicinity of 2158 GA-20 will house the second-ever location for the La Michoacana Mexican Restaurant — a restaurant operated by Mayte Castillo and their family.

A woman shopping in a store. A guy gulping beer.

All represent behaviors people have displayed while testifying in Benton County courtrooms -- online ones.

Judges across the country are using video conferencing systems for court since the covid-19 pandemic started last year. Online proceedings have affected the usual formal courtroom settings.

Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green said she or her bailiff have had to ask individuals to put on clothes for hearings. She's asked people to pull their cars over and park instead of participating as they drive.

""Some defendants will use their phone for their court hearing while clearly shopping in a store"" Green said. ""There have also been a few defendants caught on a hot microphone saying inappropriate things they did not realize we could hear.""

Green recalled one case where the woman was seen standing in an aisle near the cookies at a Dollar Tree.

""I would have been angry but she had good reception"" on her phone Green joked after the October hearing.

Green said she hasn't ruled anyone in contempt of court related to an online courtroom hearing.

Benton County Circuit Judge Brad Karren has warned some about wearing hats. He's also told the occasional person to park his car. Karren reprimanded a man in October who was sitting in a barber's chair waiting for a haircut when his case was called.

Judges have targeted some attorneys for not wearing coats or neckties.

""People using video conferencing still need to conduct themselves in the same fashion as if they are sitting in the courtroom"" Benton County Circuit Judge John Scott said. ""They are still in a courtroom.""

Scott said several of his cases each day now involve using online conferencing. Some of the cases are in person but witnesses may testify using the video conferencing technology.

He stopped a hearing to tell one of the parties to put her dogs out of the room. He's also told one attorney to pull over his car and stop so they could have the hearing Scott said.

Scott said circuit judges sent notices to attorneys the requirements and expectations for video conferencing court are the same as being in a courtroom. He believes it's important to maintain the traditional rules in court.

Benton County Circuit Judge Doug Schrantz agrees with Scott.

""It's coat and tie attire"" Schrantz said of the dress code for male attorneys. ""It's a hearing and just because attorneys are sitting at their desks it doesn't mean the same rules do not apply.""

Schrantz believes it's important that all parties respect observe and preserve the dignity of the legal proceedings. He's had his own unusual video conferencing encounter.

He was presiding over a divorce case during an online morning hearing. Schrantz granted the couple's divorce and then saw the man gulp a beer. He asked one of his staff if it was actually beer she responded ""Yes that's my brand of beer.""

Schrantz didn't confront the man about the incident.

Mike Armstrong a Rogers attorney said it's difficult to have some proceedings via video conferencing. He said one hearing had to be stopped because a man involved in the hearing was outside and there was a train going by. Armstrong said dogs also were barking in the background.

Armstrong doesn't believe the formal setting of the courtroom should be relaxed for video conferencing. He feels more formality should be inserted in the online proceedings.

""I'm not sure how we do that but I feel like allowing the other party to appear in a hoodie from his back porch with dogs barking and trains cruising by in the background takes away from the reverence of a court proceeding"" he said.

Armstrong reminds his clients to dress appropriately for court.

Rogers attorney Drew Miller said he and other attorneys at the law firm tell clients to act and wear clothing like they are going to court. Miller said he thinks judges should keep the formal rules.

Jay Saxton Benton County's chief public defender said he's seen topless men grabbing shirts after the judge comments on their lack of clothing. He said the other classic incidents are people shopping or the ones that constantly walk during their hearings.

""We tell them to stand still and don't go anywhere and it doesn't help"" Saxton said.

Saxton said he feels it important the same court decorum remains.

""I don't think they need to have hats or sunglasses on in court or on video"" he said. ""I don't think they need to be disrespectful to the court in any manner. I guess I'm just that way.""

Armstrong said the difficulties with online conferencing extend beyond court decorum.

He said cross-examination of witnesses is the toughest part. It's impossible to recreate the meaningful interaction that attorneys have with the opposing party or their witnesses for the judge over a computer monitor.

Armstrong said he's found the presentation of evidence to be one of the toughest aspects of online hearings.

""Getting exhibits before the judge can be tricky on a normal day"" he said. ""It's sometimes impossible when you're trying to thread the needle via"" online conferencing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBydWRlbnRwZW5ueXBpbmNoZXIuY29tL3RpZXJlZC10cmF5LXZhbGVudGluZXMtZGF5LWRlY29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,30 Tiered Tray Valentine's Day Decor Ideas,"Get some inspiration for decorating your tiered tray for Valentine’s Day.

Brian Kemp shared the head table at a 4H fundraiser gala with two titans of Atlanta's finance scene: Jeffrey Sprecher whose company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) owns the New York Stock Exchange; and Sprecher's wife Kelly Loeffler at the time the CEO of a cryptocurrency joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

The fundraiser pulled in $200000 and Kemp himself scored $18100 from Loeffler. A few months later Kemp would appoint Loeffler a lifelong executive with no previous political experience to fill Isakson's seat passing over numerous other Republicans incluidng insiders from his own administration former national officials and President Trump's personal favorite Rep. Doug Collins. The decision raised eyebrows at the time and still does today: In bypassing Collins who went on to challenge Loeffler in November's Georgia ""jungle primary"" Kemp not only alienated Trump but created a tight special-election race that may well determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. That showdown — in which Loeffler faces Democratic opponent Rev. Raphael Warnock — culminates next Tuesday.

Even the most innocuous explanation for Loeffler's appointment hinges on the advantages of her tremendous wealth: She promised Kemp she would pour $20 million into her own 2020 campaign and would not require outside fundraising efforts. Kemp was also apparently attracted by a perceived appeal to suburban white women in his rapidly changing state. Even so the appointment is difficult to understand taken on Loeffler's merits biography talents and expertise: She's a onetime Mitt Romney Republican who faced with the era of Trump and its hyper-partisan division was forced to run so far to the right that she hit the road with a QAnon candidate and more recently posed for a campaign selfie with a former Klansman.

Even Loeffler appears to have believed she was a long shot: A month after Isakson announced his retirement last August she was elected to the board of directors at Georgia Power the premier electricity provider for the state and largest subsidiary of the Southern Company — a position her Senate appointment would force her to abandon only two months later.

That brief chapter of Loeffler's pre-government life however opens the door to a deeper history and a new and complex set of unexplored ethical questions for a senator whose sprawling corporate ties overlap with an industry she is charged with overseeing making it impossible to avoid conflicts of interest and accusations (fair or otherwise) of insider dealings.

While Sprecher's involvement with the New York Stock Exchange grabs headlines as a familiar reference his company is mainly grounded in the energy sector which also provides much of the weight behind Loeffler's résumé. Despite this background — or perhaps because of it — she has never articulated exactly where she stands on energy policy.

Intercontinental Exchange underpins an astounding array of energy futures exchanges both in the United States and globally. Well before Sprecher started the company he was developing power plants. After the fall of Enron ICE took its place a position Sprecher leveraged cannily gradually making his company one of the most influential financial firms in the world.

ICE's subsidy the NYSE is itself home to more than 90% of all publicly traded utilities and pipeline companies in the U.S. and many of those use ICE markets to trade and hedge against their energy investments. To that point ICE's website claims that ""more electric power is traded on ICE than any other electronic marketplace in the world.""

The southeastern U.S. — the second-largest energy market in the country and coincidentally home to ICE and Loeffler — is one of the few regions that does not have a unified power exchange and thus no derivatives.

Around the time Loeffler was elected to the board of Georgia Power the major utility companies in the Southeast secretly began engaging in talks about uniting the region into a single exchange. The exchange would include Southern Company (the parent of Georgia Power) as well as major players Duke Energy Dominion and the government-run Tennessee Valley Authority.

The move according to the larger companies involved would benefit renewables and wholesale power sellers through a trading mechanism that more readily distributes excess energy capacity across a wider market which they say will boost renewables and nuclear power. Detractors are skeptical — especially clean energy advocates. Jeff Dennis general counsel at Advanced Energy Economy told Salon that the new exchange called the Southeastern Energy Market (SEEM) would mainly benefit the larger utilities eclipsing the concerns of smaller companies renewables and consumers.

""In general while the SEEM mechanism might help the sponsoring utilities capture additional revenues for their own largely fossil-fuel-generating plants and squeeze some marginal savings for customers out of the existing system it accomplishes little else"" Dennis said. While SEEM's sponsor companies claim that the exchange will save customers $40 million to $50 million annually he said that amount is small when spread across the entire region and the 50 million people it serves.

""Compare that to the benefits customers would get from a more integrated and competitive wholesale power market in the region which one recent study showed could generate $19.2 billion in annual regional savings reducing customer bills by 23% and lowering carbon emissions by 37% all while creating at least 285000 new jobs by 2040"" Dennis said.

""Customers and clean energy developers are concerned that SEEM will not be a stepping stone to a true regional competitive wholesale market and integrated transmission grid in the region"" he added ""and could lock in the region's reliance on existing natural gas and coal-fired power plants instead of serving to help the region transition to lower cost and cleaner renewable and advanced energy resources.""

Because SEEM's first iteration will not be as consolidated as other independent energy networks in different parts of the U.S. which trade on ICE's exchanges the system will not support futures trading. An ICE spokesperson told Salon that the company has not been involved.

""The utilities did this among themselves — no consumer advocates and no regulators"" the lawyer continued. ""There is no effective independent oversight. It's governed by a board run by the utilities. We need public interest stakeholders and government structure so that companies aren't the only ones making decisions.""

But the proposal is far from a done deal. The companies which want to open the exchange sometime next year must first get the go-ahead from federal and state regulators. Last week North Carolina authorities put a hold on their goal of filing with the federal government by Dec. 28. A Biden administration will likely prove a harder sell.

That might help explain why Thomas Farrell CEO of Dominion Power made a maximum donation to the Loeffler campaign last week. Thomas Fanning CEO of Southern Company contributed to Loeffler last February and along with his wife made a maximum donation at the end of November according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. While Loeffler might not have direct oversight over this issue she can act as an ambassador for their industry and a GOP-controlled Senate would be able to check the Biden administration.

The Georgia Power board found Loeffler's background attractive as an ambassador and inside eye for the financial side of the business. Paul Bowers company president and CEO said the board had picked Loeffler not only because of her knowledge about energy markets and European carbon trading markets in which Georgia Power deals heavily but her knowledge of cryptocurrency — Loeffler was at the time CEO of Bakkt the aforementioned joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

""This insight into the global energy market and her unique digital experience will provide an extremely valuable perspective as we evolve as an energy industry and as a business to build a sustainable energy future for our customers and state"" Bowers said in a press release at the time.

Cryptocurrency is also tied into energy markets in more than one way. First blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency is based has several actual or potential applications in energy and power exchanges particularly for new and renewable technologies. But it's also true that the industry itself uses a lot of energy: Bitcoin in which Bakkt deals consumes more energy annually than the entire country of Switzerland.

Loeffler's project with Bakkt was to develop what the company called a ""regulated global ecosystem"" designed to enable payments markets and ""new use cases"" for cryptocurrency — including launching a Bitcoin futures exchange with ICE.

When Loeffler joined the Senate she was named to the subcommittee that oversaw that very industry: Futures trading. She only stepped down from that post after widespread backlash to her remarkably well-timed stock trades ahead of the coronavirus pandemic — including in shares of her own company. She still sits on the broader Agriculture Committee however which has overall oversight of the industry. And she still holds shares of Bakkt which has performed increasingly and surprisingly well this year.

Tim Echols a Republican member of the Georgia Public Service Commission which regulates electricity in the state and sets statewide energy policies told Inside Climate News earlier this year that Loeffler's experience as CEO of Bakkt would be a political asset specifically when it comes to energy regulation and market design.

""For me as a conservative Republican Kelly has the full package"" Echols said. ""She is right on the social issues she knows business and she understands energy minutiae."" He predicted she would favor tax credits for electric vehicles and solar investments while supporting nuclear energy but to this point Loeffler appears only to have made one limited public statement about electric vehicles.

Georgia Power's mix includes coal natural gas renewables and nuclear power. Recent reporting from ProPublica revealed that following the enactment of a new rule mandating environmental disclosures for coal ash Georgia Power paid millions of dollars to buy land near its coal ash ponds often paying above market values before later disclosing evidence of groundwater contamination around those sites.

""In the nearly six years since the coal ash rule was finalized Georgia Power bought about 75 properties for an average price of $8800 per acre — outpacing the growth of average real estate values in rural areas of the state. The company purchased a third of those properties for over $30000 an acre — and a handful for over $100000 an acre"" ProPublica reported.

Loeffler does not sit on the Senate Energy Committee but as mentioned above she sits on the Agriculture Committee whose oversight includes issues regarding rural energy development.

Georgia Power has also been trying for years to finish construction on the Vogtle nuclear plant near Atlanta. The construction project has been a money pit to this point however running billions of dollars over budget.

In February Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar bought between $100000 and $250000 in futures for the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia a nonprofit municipal energy company with a significant stake in Plant Vogtle according to his mandatory federal financial disclosures. In that same period of time Azar had briefed Loeffler among other senators on the looming coronavirus pandemic.

The Loeffler campaign did not reply to Salon's request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAyLzYtcmVhc29ucy0yMDIwLXdhc250LWFzLWJhZC1mb3ItY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtYXMteW91LXRob3VnaHRfcGFydG5lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 reasons 2020 wasn't as bad for climate change as you thought,"What is there to say about 2020 that hasn't already been said? It was the longest the hardest the darkest — and on top of everything else full of bad climate news. The Trump administration continued its steady assault on environmental protections even as the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the country. Despite some late-breaking clean energy funding in the U.S. global stimulus spending devoted far more money to fossil fuels than renewable energy. The dip in emissions brought on by the pandemic was just that — a dip.

But we're here to tell you that this year wasn't a total wash. Even during a global pandemic with powerful forces working against it momentum toward a less fiery future kept pace. Please join us in taking a look back at six ways climate action moved forward this year.

* * *

1. Climate change was a major election issue

2020 was the year climate change finally entered the political spotlight. Look no further than the Democratic primaries where dozens of candidates competed for the title of fiercest climate hawk and tried to one-up each other with progressively more ambitious climate plans. (Senator Elizabeth Warren wowed voters by producing 14 separate documents outlining her climate agenda but the title of ""most ambitious climate plan"" still goes to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders' $16 trillion ""Green New Deal."")

The one-upmanship continued even after Joe Biden had clinched the Democratic nomination when Biden unveiled an updated and more aggressive version of his primary climate plan. And he doubled down as the general election drew nearer — Biden released three climate-themed ads in the weeks leading up to November 3 and made history by saying he'd ""transition the oil industry"" at the final presidential debate in October.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

Why did presidential candidates bend over backward to show voters that they're serious about climate action? Because polls show that climate change matters to Americans. A lot. Ahead of the election a national survey showed that 58 percent of Americans were either ""somewhat concerned"" or ""very concerned"" about their communities being affected by climate change. Exit polls from the League of Conservation Voters showed that among conflicted voters (those who considered voting for both Trump and Biden) Biden was preferred over Trump on ""climate change clean energy and the environment"" by a 58-point margin.

2. Big institutions pledged to pull their cash out of fossil fuel companies

Fossil fuel companies lost a lot of money this year and not just because of the drop in demand for oil and gas caused by the pandemic. The divestment movement scored major wins as schools faith institutions and cities all over the world made new pledges to pull their investments from companies that extract and sell fossil fuels.

Prestigious schools like Oxford and Cambridge in the U.K. and Georgetown Brown American University and Cornell in the U.S. joined a growing list of colleges and universities planning to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies. Pressure mounted on two of the wealthiest universities in the country Harvard and Yale which have a combined endowment of $72 billion as divestment activists ran for open seats on the boards that oversee the teams that manage how their endowments are invested. And while neither school committed to divestment Harvard is dipping its toes in the concept with the announcement of a still-vague plan to bring its endowment to net-zero by 2050 arguing that it will be able to work with fossil fuel companies to achieve it.

Activists weren't happy about that but they did celebrate when the $226 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund the third-largest public pension fund in the U.S. announced it would basically do the same thing by 2040. The main difference was that Tom DiNapoli the state's comptroller laid out a detailed roadmap for how he would achieve net-zero including a pledge to divest from companies that aren't preparing for a low-carbon economy. He's already eliminated 22 coal companies from the fund.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

Whether divestment promotes the broader changes needed to decarbonize the economy is still debated. But what became more apparent in 2020 is the risk of maintaining investments in companies that aren't ready for those changes which are happening regardless. Exxon which hasn't made any commitment to reduce its total emissions did so poorly this year that it got booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average an influential benchmark of top stocks. So if you have money in index or mutual funds there's a chance that you've divested some of your own savings from fossil fuels without even knowing it.

3. Renewables kept growing despite the pandemic

Fossil fuel companies took a catastrophic hit this year when the COVID-19 pandemic ground the economy to a standstill and sent oil prices tumbling. But the renewable energy industry proved to be far more resilient.

Skies clear of smog and other pollutants gave solar panels a boost this year especially in the U.K. where the uptick in solar power efficiency helped the country run on zero coal-fired power plant generation for more than two months for the first time in over a century. And on this side of the pond electricity generated by solar wind hydro and other renewables outpaced electricity generated by coal for 40 days straight.

In November a report from the International Energy Agency projected that renewables will account for 90 percent of the new power capacity added to grids worldwide in 2020. A different report from the global research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie published in December found that U.S. solar installations are expected to grow 43 percent this year.

Renewables are still getting cheaper too. A study by clean energy research firm BloombergNEF found that solar and onshore wind power are the most affordable new sources of electricity for two-thirds of the world's population. The price of electricity from onshore wind farms dropped 9 percent since mid-2019. And falling costs more efficient technology and government support in some parts of the world have fostered larger renewable power plants with the average wind farm now double the capacity it was four years ago.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

To boot polling on how Americans think about energy sources like solar and wind remained consistent this year: The vast majority of Americans say developing alternative sources of energy should be prioritized over developing fossil fuels.

4. Pipelines became nearly impossible to build

Pipeline or pipe dream? Pipeline construction companies and the energy companies paying them to create the infrastructure to transport oil and gas across long distances ran into roadblock after roadblock this year. So many roadblocks in fact that some energy companies just gave up trying to build them.

That's what happened to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline over the summer: The U.S. Supreme Court gave the pipeline the green light to cross under the Appalachian Trail but a few weeks later Dominion Energy and Duke Energy the lead developers of the project decided to take a hike and dump the pipeline altogether.

(Grist)

The Dakota Access Pipeline the approval of which sparked the protests at Standing Rock in 2016 also took a critical hit over the summer when a federal judge said the company behind the project Energy Transfer and the Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct a sufficient environmental review. The judge ordered the pipeline to shut down while the review was conducted. An appeals court swiftly overturned that order but the company and the Army Corps still have to conduct the environmental review. When Biden takes office he could opt to shut down the pipeline entirely.

Speaking of Biden the president-elect has promised to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline by revoking the presidential permit President Trump granted the project in 2019. TC Energy the company building the project has already built some 120 miles of pipeline since last spring but if Biden makes good on his campaign promises (and green groups expect him to) he could put the kibosh on Keystone XL after he's inaugurated.

More pipelines were put on the chopping block this year: The Mountain Valley Pipeline is struggling to keep construction going as judges keep tossing out crucial permits forcing the company to hunt down new ones. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer delivered a serious blow to Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline in November ordering it shut down. Enbridge filed suit against Whitmer arguing that only the federal government has the jurisdiction to shut down pipelines but the incoming Biden administration can reaffirm Whitmer's authority and take other steps to stymie Enbridge's plans.

5. Cities put a check on emissions from buildings

A recent United Nations report found that the carbon emissions from heating cooking and using electricity in buildings hit an all-time high last year and were responsible for 28 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Fortunately in 2020 efforts to rein in emissions from buildings took off.

Just a few weeks ago the cities of San Francisco Oakland and San Jose passed laws limiting the installation of appliances that run on natural gas in new buildings joining 37 other jurisdictions across California that have already done so. These ""gas bans"" have been catching on around the country: Seattle's mayor wants to update the city's building code to prohibit the use of fossil fuels in new buildings; St. Louis has new building performance standards that will effectively phase out gas appliances in larger buildings; and Brookline Massachusetts has petitioned the state to let it ban gas hookups in new buildings after an earlier effort to do so was found to conflict with state laws.

In December Washington state proposed what could be the nation's first state-level gas ban and several new state climate action plans and task forces including in New Jersey Michigan Nevada and Maryland explicitly mentioned the need to electrify buildings.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

But as the idea of moving away from gas in buildings gained currency some states ran in the opposite direction. Under pressure from industry lawmakers in Arizona Louisiana Oklahoma and Tennessee passed nearly identical bills this year that prohibit their own municipalities from banning gas.

To be clear decarbonizing buildings is not as simple as banning gas hookups or appliances. As more buildings go fully electric gas utilities could undergo a slow death spiral and fewer and fewer customers could end up paying to maintain a vast network of gas pipelines. But states are finally reckoning with these questions — New York California Colorado and Massachusetts all opened new investigations this year into the future of gas distribution to try to answer them.

6. The world agreed on achieving net-zero by mid-century

The idea of ""net-zero emissions"" has been around for years but in 2020 it was thrust into the mainstream as an essential tenet of climate policy around the world.

Every week seemed to bring a new announcement of a state country bank utility tech giant or even oil company promising to get to net-zero over the next few decades. Generally that means they'll get to a place where their net emissions between the CO2 they release into the atmosphere and the CO2 they suck out of it through natural and technological means are zero. Microsoft even said it would go beyond that point to ""carbon negative"" by removing all the carbon it has emitted since its founding in 1975.

In theory net-zero is a valiant goal — a 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the world needs to get to net-zero by 2050 in order to avoid the catastrophic effects expected to occur if the globe warms more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).

But that conclusion was based on a crucial premise: First we have to dramatically reduce emissions. The whole ""net"" part of the deal should really only apply to the parts of the economy that are hardest to decarbonize like aviation and shipping. But many of the net-zero pledges made this year by companies are nebulous about when they will reduce their emissions or whether they'll do so at all. The energy companies with net-zero pledges are still expanding the fossil fuel side of their businesses and many of the tech companies with net-zero pledges are still helping those energy companies find and extract more fossil fuels.

The most important development in 2020 may not have been the slew of net-zero pledges but something a little more obscure. Companies finally began publicly accounting for the emissions tied to their supply chains and the products they produce known as ""scope 3"" emissions. Transparency around scope 3 puts more pressure on reducing emissions throughout the economy.

Next year we'll be looking to see which companies shore up their pledges with near-term targets and which ones show up in Washington to lobby for the policy changes that will help them deliver on net-zero.",,,,,,

Domino's is currently ranked as America's number one pizza chain bringing in more than $7 billion annually from more than 6000 stores that average more than $1 million in annual sales each according to PMQ Pizza Magazine. Domino's has always led the pack when it comes to digital innovation delivery online ordering and app integration. When the coronavirus pandemic hit this 60-year old company easily pivoted attracting new customers who were seeking delivery options (via QSR). In fact Domino's was one of only a handful of national chains that showed increased sales at the start of the pandemic (via Nation's Restaurant News).

Domino's franchisees report earning six-figure incomes with over half of franchisees owning more than one store so it's not surprising that there's an uptick in franchise inquiries. The chain offers points toward free pizza when customers enroll in its loyalty program ultimately helping to sell more pizzas and increase app signups. Additionally Domino's popular mix-and-match promos and $5.99 offers attract consumers who are shopping for pizza deals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vb2ZmaWNlY2hhaS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9kb21pbm9zLWluZGlhLXBhcmVudC1qdWJpbGFudC1mb29kd29ya3MtcGlja3MtdXAtMTAtc3Rha2UtaW4tYmFyYmVxdWUtbmF0aW9uLWZvci1ycy05Mi1jcm9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino's India Parent Jubilant Foodworks Picks Up 10% Stake In Barbeque Nation For Rs. 92 Crore,"Jubilant Foodworks is best known for running the Domino’s brand in India but it’s rapidly expanding into other kinds of cuisines.

Jubilant FoodWorks has said that it’ll invest Rs. 92 crore to buy a 10.76 percent stake in the Barbeque Nation chain of restaurants. “The company will acquire 3650794 fully paid-up equity shares of face value of ₹5 each aggregating to 10.76% stake in Barbecue Nation Hospitality Limited (BNHL)” Jubilant said in a regulatory filing. The all-cash deal is expected to conclude by 25 January.

“We are happy to announce our investment in Barbeque Nation a differentiated casual dining restaurant brand of scale with strong unit economics. We are confident that the proposed investment will create value for our shareholders” a statement by Shyam S. Bhartia chairman and Hari S. Bhartia co-chairman Jubilant Foodworks said.

Over the last few years Jubilant Foodworks has been expanding outside its core pizza offering of Domino’s Pizza. The company already runs Dunkin Donuts in India and had launched casual Chinese dining brand Hong’s Kitchen last year. After Covid had hit it had forayed into the ready-to-cook sauces gravies and pastes market under the ChefBoss brand. A few weeks ago Jubilant had also announced a new biryani brand called Ekdum which would operate restaurants and also do deliveries.

Barbeque Nation for its part has 138 restaurants that offer over-the-table barbeque live grills for diners in 73 cities across India and seven restaurants overseas. It also has a presence in the Italian cuisine segment under the brand Toscano.

It’s not a worst time to pick up a stake in a restaurant chain — the coronavirus pandemic has meant that most restaurants have been shut for an extended period and it’s likely that Jubilant has managed to get an attractive price for Barbecue Nation. But with the vaccine around the corner restaurants could well see footfalls go back to normal in the foreseeable future. Also with many companies perhaps continuing to work from home even after the pandemic is over the demand for places for teammates to bond with one another could increase and this is where Barbecue Nation could really come into its own — the chain was already popular with office teams and could see that aspect of its business pick up over the coming years. And having a sit-down barbecue chain would only add to Jubilant’s already-impressive — and rapidly-expanding — portfolio in India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9tb25leS9zaG9wcGluZy1kZWFscy9uZXcteWVhci10YWtlYXdheS1vcGVuaW5nLXRpbWVzLTIzMjQ3ODUx0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L3Nob3BwaW5nLWRlYWxzL25ldy15ZWFyLXRha2Vhd2F5LW9wZW5pbmctdGltZXMtMjMyNDc4NTEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Year's Day 2021 takeaway opening times for McDonald's KFC Domino's and more,"If you can't face cooking today why not treat yourself to a New Year's Day takeaway?

He wore it so often that it began to thin noticeably. Eventually holes formed in the dark-blue fabric. The shirt showed a swirling Milky Way galaxy along with an arrow pointing to one of its outer spiral arms. Above the arrow a caption declared in simple type YOU ARE HERE.

It’s an age-old question—Where are we in the universe?—one that has consumed philosophers and professional astronomers alike.

My friend’s tattered T-shirt I think provided a clever answer. With tongue-in-cheek precision it pinpointed our location in the confines of the Milky Way our cosmic abode that we have never actually glimpsed from the outside. The deeper meaning of the shirt of course was ironic perhaps even existential—serving as a reminder of our smallness against the blue-black backdrop of space. Like the pollen-grain world in Dr. Seuss’s Horton Hears a Who! we drift through the cosmos among objects we can barely perceive subject to forces we have no control over.

Such notions can easily lead to despair or worse apathy. In an inconceivably vast universe does it really matter where we’re located? Isn’t one place fundamentally the same as another?

But knowing where we are with more specificity seems to me like a form of empowerment. If we could understand our place in the cosmos our cosmic address as it were might we change our behavior? Would it alter the way for example that we take care of our home planet and one another? And could such knowledge give us a better sense of where we’re headed? I’m thinking here not merely of our travels through the cosmos aboard spaceship Earth but also of our aspirations as self-propelled voyagers among the stars. We can only begin to ponder such questions once we have figured out our actual location with a degree of accuracy that goes well beyond an arrow on a T-shirt.

Which is to say we need better maps.

That is exactly what a consortium of astronomers known as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is trying to do. For more than 20 years this international team of researchers from dozens of institutions has been building the most detailed 3D map of the universe in existence. The survey’s main tool is a massive custom-designed telescope of a variety known as a Ritchey-Chrétien which to my eye looks like a squid breaking out of a shipping container. Located at Apache Point Observatory in southeastern New Mexico the scope—along with its southern hemisphere counterpart in northern Chile—has been making systematic sweeps of the sky.

The SDSS survey has collected data on millions of deep space objects—stars nebulae and galaxies along with more exotic objects such as black holes pulsars and quasars. With all this data in hand astronomical mapmakers stitched the individual frames together to produce highly detailed three-dimensional color maps. Using specialized software a viewer can “fly” across hundreds of billions of miles and tens of millions of years of cosmic history as if on board a spacecraft traveling faster than the speed of light.

The deeper we delve the stranger things get. Among the profundities of peering far into space is finding that our place in the cosmos is as much about knowing “when” we are as it is “where”—thus trying to visualize the universe in its totality becomes an exercise in time travel. Using the SDSS’s maps we can look back billions of years and get a glimpse of the universe in its infancy during its first 300000 years (if the universe’s 13.7 billion years were compressed into a single day that timespan would be equivalent to the first few seconds after midnight). In this embryonic universe matter as we know it existed in a primordial and incomplete state. Things were hot and jumbled. Electrons roamed free. It would be tens of thousands more years before electrons would get caught up in orbits around positively charged nuclei to form the first atoms namely hydrogen and helium. Some 150 to 200 million years later those elements would congeal forming the first stars.

To the space researcher the potential uses of SDSS data are many. With it scholars can visualize the conditions of the early universe as well as get a better sense of how it’s evolving. Among the key findings of SDSS is that the expansion of the universe which began roughly 6 billion years ago—driven by what physicists believe is a strange and elusive component of the universe known as “dark energy”—is occurring about 10 percent more slowly than predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity. The SDSS researchers don’t know the reason for the discrepancy but suspect that a “previously unknown form of matter or energy” in the early universe could be the culprit.

We non-specialists will most likely experience the Sloan Survey’s findings at the local planetarium. Using these maps planetarium astronomers will soon be able to take visitors on an immersive journey through the cosmos whizzing through our solar system past distant nebulae far beyond the fringes of the Milky Way and into the starless wastes of intergalactic space. Fasten your seatbelts.

As a lover and collector of maps I can’t help but envision the SDSS as a road atlas for future interstellar travelers the equivalent of the tattered map beneath the seat of a tricked-out van. On their journey away from Earth these pioneers may stumble upon some secrets of the universe—perhaps in their voyages they will be the first to learn if we are alone in our cosmic cul-de-sac. “Only those who will risk going too far” wrote T.S. Eliot “can possibly find out how far one can go.”

Here on planet Earth in the first days of the 21st year of the third millennium with our movements restricted by COVID the Sloan Survey allows us to imagine travel on the grandest of scales. Right turn at Neptune proceed on the route for 642 light-years to Betelgeuse. At home with my scope looking out from Earth’s thin crust I envision an updated version of the T-shirt worn by my friend all those years ago. The galaxy is the same but the arrow rather than pointing to one of the Milky Way’s spiral arms is aimed away from the edge of the solar system into space. The caption reads THE JOURNEY BEGINS HERE.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbm9mZ2Vlay5jb20vdHYvZGlzbmV5LW5ldy1yZWxlYXNlcy1qYW51YXJ5LTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney+ New Releases: January 2021,"2020 cursed year that it was represented the first turn of the calendar since 2009 that did not feature an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Johnny Isakson a third-term Georgia Republican announced his surprise retirement following a kidney cancer diagnosis Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared the head table at a 4H fundraiser gala with two titans of Atlanta's finance scene: Jeffrey Sprecher whose company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) owns the New York Stock Exchange; and Sprecher's wife Kelly Loeffler at the time the CEO of a cryptocurrency joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

The fundraiser pulled in $200000 and Kemp himself scored $18100 from Loeffler. A few months later Kemp would appoint Loeffler a lifelong executive with no previous political experience to fill Isakson's seat passing over numerous other Republicans incluidng insiders from his own administration former national officials and President Trump's personal favorite Rep. Doug Collins. The decision raised eyebrows at the time and still does today: In bypassing Collins who went on to challenge Loeffler in November's Georgia ""jungle primary"" Kemp not only alienated Trump but created a tight special-election race that may well determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. That showdown — in which Loeffler faces Democratic opponent Rev. Raphael Warnock — culminates next Tuesday.

Even the most innocuous explanation for Loeffler's appointment hinges on the advantages of her tremendous wealth: She promised Kemp she would pour $20 million into her own 2020 campaign and would not require outside fundraising efforts. Kemp was also apparently attracted by a perceived appeal to suburban white women in his rapidly changing state. Even so the appointment is difficult to understand taken on Loeffler's merits biography talents and expertise: She's a onetime Mitt Romney Republican who faced with the era of Trump and its hyper-partisan division was forced to run so far to the right that she hit the road with a QAnon candidate and more recently posed for a campaign selfie with a former Klansman.

Even Loeffler appears to have believed she was a long shot: A month after Isakson announced his retirement last August she was elected to the board of directors at Georgia Power the premier electricity provider for the state and largest subsidiary of the Southern Company — a position her Senate appointment would force her to abandon only two months later.

That brief chapter of Loeffler's pre-government life however opens the door to a deeper history and a new and complex set of unexplored ethical questions for a senator whose sprawling corporate ties overlap with an industry she is charged with overseeing making it impossible to avoid conflicts of interest and accusations (fair or otherwise) of insider dealings.

While Sprecher's involvement with the New York Stock Exchange grabs headlines as a familiar reference his company is mainly grounded in the energy sector which also provides much of the weight behind Loeffler's résumé. Despite this background — or perhaps because of it — she has never articulated exactly where she stands on energy policy.

Intercontinental Exchange underpins an astounding array of energy futures exchanges both in the United States and globally. Well before Sprecher started the company he was developing power plants. After the fall of Enron ICE took its place a position Sprecher leveraged cannily gradually making his company one of the most influential financial firms in the world.

ICE's subsidy the NYSE is itself home to more than 90% of all publicly traded utilities and pipeline companies in the U.S. and many of those use ICE markets to trade and hedge against their energy investments. To that point ICE's website claims that ""more electric power is traded on ICE than any other electronic marketplace in the world.""

The southeastern U.S. — the second-largest energy market in the country and coincidentally home to ICE and Loeffler — is one of the few regions that does not have a unified power exchange and thus no derivatives.

Around the time Loeffler was elected to the board of Georgia Power the major utility companies in the Southeast secretly began engaging in talks about uniting the region into a single exchange. The exchange would include Southern Company (the parent of Georgia Power) as well as major players Duke Energy Dominion and the government-run Tennessee Valley Authority.

The move according to the larger companies involved would benefit renewables and wholesale power sellers through a trading mechanism that more readily distributes excess energy capacity across a wider market which they say will boost renewables and nuclear power. Detractors are skeptical — especially clean energy advocates. Jeff Dennis general counsel at Advanced Energy Economy told Salon that the new exchange called the Southeastern Energy Market (SEEM) would mainly benefit the larger utilities eclipsing the concerns of smaller companies renewables and consumers.

""In general while the SEEM mechanism might help the sponsoring utilities capture additional revenues for their own largely fossil-fuel-generating plants and squeeze some marginal savings for customers out of the existing system it accomplishes little else"" Dennis said. While SEEM's sponsor companies claim that the exchange will save customers $40 million to $50 million annually he said that amount is small when spread across the entire region and the 50 million people it serves.

""Compare that to the benefits customers would get from a more integrated and competitive wholesale power market in the region which one recent study showed could generate $19.2 billion in annual regional savings reducing customer bills by 23% and lowering carbon emissions by 37% all while creating at least 285000 new jobs by 2040"" Dennis said.

""Customers and clean energy developers are concerned that SEEM will not be a stepping stone to a true regional competitive wholesale market and integrated transmission grid in the region"" he added ""and could lock in the region's reliance on existing natural gas and coal-fired power plants instead of serving to help the region transition to lower cost and cleaner renewable and advanced energy resources.""

Because SEEM's first iteration will not be as consolidated as other independent energy networks in different parts of the U.S. which trade on ICE's exchanges the system will not support futures trading. An ICE spokesperson told Salon that the company has not been involved.

""The utilities did this among themselves — no consumer advocates and no regulators"" the lawyer continued. ""There is no effective independent oversight. It's governed by a board run by the utilities. We need public interest stakeholders and government structure so that companies aren't the only ones making decisions.""

But the proposal is far from a done deal. The companies which want to open the exchange sometime next year must first get the go-ahead from federal and state regulators. Last week North Carolina authorities put a hold on their goal of filing with the federal government by Dec. 28. A Biden administration will likely prove a harder sell.

That might help explain why Thomas Farrell CEO of Dominion Power made a maximum donation to the Loeffler campaign last week. Thomas Fanning CEO of Southern Company contributed to Loeffler last February and along with his wife made a maximum donation at the end of November according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. While Loeffler might not have direct oversight over this issue she can act as an ambassador for their industry and a GOP-controlled Senate would be able to check the Biden administration.

The Georgia Power board found Loeffler's background attractive as an ambassador and inside eye for the financial side of the business. Paul Bowers company president and CEO said the board had picked Loeffler not only because of her knowledge about energy markets and European carbon trading markets in which Georgia Power deals heavily but her knowledge of cryptocurrency — Loeffler was at the time CEO of Bakkt the aforementioned joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

""This insight into the global energy market and her unique digital experience will provide an extremely valuable perspective as we evolve as an energy industry and as a business to build a sustainable energy future for our customers and state"" Bowers said in a press release at the time.

Cryptocurrency is also tied into energy markets in more than one way. First blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency is based has several actual or potential applications in energy and power exchanges particularly for new and renewable technologies. But it's also true that the industry itself uses a lot of energy: Bitcoin in which Bakkt deals consumes more energy annually than the entire country of Switzerland.

Loeffler's project with Bakkt was to develop what the company called a ""regulated global ecosystem"" designed to enable payments markets and ""new use cases"" for cryptocurrency — including launching a Bitcoin futures exchange with ICE.

When Loeffler joined the Senate she was named to the subcommittee that oversaw that very industry: Futures trading. She only stepped down from that post after widespread backlash to her remarkably well-timed stock trades ahead of the coronavirus pandemic — including in shares of her own company. She still sits on the broader Agriculture Committee however which has overall oversight of the industry. And she still holds shares of Bakkt which has performed increasingly and surprisingly well this year.

Tim Echols a Republican member of the Georgia Public Service Commission which regulates electricity in the state and sets statewide energy policies told Inside Climate News earlier this year that Loeffler's experience as CEO of Bakkt would be a political asset specifically when it comes to energy regulation and market design.

""For me as a conservative Republican Kelly has the full package"" Echols said. ""She is right on the social issues she knows business and she understands energy minutiae."" He predicted she would favor tax credits for electric vehicles and solar investments while supporting nuclear energy but to this point Loeffler appears only to have made one limited public statement about electric vehicles.

Georgia Power's mix includes coal natural gas renewables and nuclear power. Recent reporting from ProPublica revealed that following the enactment of a new rule mandating environmental disclosures for coal ash Georgia Power paid millions of dollars to buy land near its coal ash ponds often paying above market values before later disclosing evidence of groundwater contamination around those sites.

""In the nearly six years since the coal ash rule was finalized Georgia Power bought about 75 properties for an average price of $8800 per acre — outpacing the growth of average real estate values in rural areas of the state. The company purchased a third of those properties for over $30000 an acre — and a handful for over $100000 an acre"" ProPublica reported.

Loeffler does not sit on the Senate Energy Committee but as mentioned above she sits on the Agriculture Committee whose oversight includes issues regarding rural energy development.

Georgia Power has also been trying for years to finish construction on the Vogtle nuclear plant near Atlanta. The construction project has been a money pit to this point however running billions of dollars over budget.

In February Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar bought between $100000 and $250000 in futures for the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia a nonprofit municipal energy company with a significant stake in Plant Vogtle according to his mandatory federal financial disclosures. In that same period of time Azar had briefed Loeffler among other senators on the looming coronavirus pandemic.

The Loeffler campaign did not reply to Salon's request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktdXNpbmctZHJ1Z3MtaW4tcGFya2luZy1sb3QtYXQtd2F3YS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man arrested after reportedly using drugs in parking lot at Wawa,"A man was arrested after reportedly using drugs in the parking lot at Wawa at County Road 466 and U.S. 301 in Oxford.

The Sumter County Sheriff’s Office received a report from Wawa employees at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday that a man was in his car using narcotics.

A deputy arrived on the scene and found 28-year-old Donald Donte Parenteau of Inverness in the store purchasing an item at the cash register. The deputy was aware that Parenteau had been ticketed Nov. 24 for driving on a suspended license.

It was the longest the hardest the darkest — and on top of everything else full of bad climate news. The Trump administration continued its steady assault on environmental protections even as the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the country. Despite some late-breaking clean energy funding in the U.S. global stimulus spending devoted far more money to fossil fuels than renewable energy. The dip in emissions brought on by the pandemic was just that — a dip.

But we're here to tell you that this year wasn't a total wash. Even during a global pandemic with powerful forces working against it momentum toward a less fiery future kept pace. Please join us in taking a look back at six ways climate action moved forward this year.

* * *

1. Climate change was a major election issue

2020 was the year climate change finally entered the political spotlight. Look no further than the Democratic primaries where dozens of candidates competed for the title of fiercest climate hawk and tried to one-up each other with progressively more ambitious climate plans. (Senator Elizabeth Warren wowed voters by producing 14 separate documents outlining her climate agenda but the title of ""most ambitious climate plan"" still goes to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders' $16 trillion ""Green New Deal."")

The one-upmanship continued even after Joe Biden had clinched the Democratic nomination when Biden unveiled an updated and more aggressive version of his primary climate plan. And he doubled down as the general election drew nearer — Biden released three climate-themed ads in the weeks leading up to November 3 and made history by saying he'd ""transition the oil industry"" at the final presidential debate in October.

Why did presidential candidates bend over backward to show voters that they're serious about climate action? Because polls show that climate change matters to Americans. A lot. Ahead of the election a national survey showed that 58 percent of Americans were either ""somewhat concerned"" or ""very concerned"" about their communities being affected by climate change. Exit polls from the League of Conservation Voters showed that among conflicted voters (those who considered voting for both Trump and Biden) Biden was preferred over Trump on ""climate change clean energy and the environment"" by a 58-point margin.

2. Big institutions pledged to pull their cash out of fossil fuel companies

Fossil fuel companies lost a lot of money this year and not just because of the drop in demand for oil and gas caused by the pandemic. The divestment movement scored major wins as schools faith institutions and cities all over the world made new pledges to pull their investments from companies that extract and sell fossil fuels.

Prestigious schools like Oxford and Cambridge in the U.K. and Georgetown Brown American University and Cornell in the U.S. joined a growing list of colleges and universities planning to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies. Pressure mounted on two of the wealthiest universities in the country Harvard and Yale which have a combined endowment of $72 billion as divestment activists ran for open seats on the boards that oversee the teams that manage how their endowments are invested. And while neither school committed to divestment Harvard is dipping its toes in the concept with the announcement of a still-vague plan to bring its endowment to net-zero by 2050 arguing that it will be able to work with fossil fuel companies to achieve it.

Activists weren't happy about that but they did celebrate when the $226 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund the third-largest public pension fund in the U.S. announced it would basically do the same thing by 2040. The main difference was that Tom DiNapoli the state's comptroller laid out a detailed roadmap for how he would achieve net-zero including a pledge to divest from companies that aren't preparing for a low-carbon economy. He's already eliminated 22 coal companies from the fund.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

Whether divestment promotes the broader changes needed to decarbonize the economy is still debated. But what became more apparent in 2020 is the risk of maintaining investments in companies that aren't ready for those changes which are happening regardless. Exxon which hasn't made any commitment to reduce its total emissions did so poorly this year that it got booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average an influential benchmark of top stocks. So if you have money in index or mutual funds there's a chance that you've divested some of your own savings from fossil fuels without even knowing it.

3. Renewables kept growing despite the pandemic

Fossil fuel companies took a catastrophic hit this year when the COVID-19 pandemic ground the economy to a standstill and sent oil prices tumbling. But the renewable energy industry proved to be far more resilient.

Skies clear of smog and other pollutants gave solar panels a boost this year especially in the U.K. where the uptick in solar power efficiency helped the country run on zero coal-fired power plant generation for more than two months for the first time in over a century. And on this side of the pond electricity generated by solar wind hydro and other renewables outpaced electricity generated by coal for 40 days straight.

In November a report from the International Energy Agency projected that renewables will account for 90 percent of the new power capacity added to grids worldwide in 2020. A different report from the global research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie published in December found that U.S. solar installations are expected to grow 43 percent this year.

Renewables are still getting cheaper too. A study by clean energy research firm BloombergNEF found that solar and onshore wind power are the most affordable new sources of electricity for two-thirds of the world's population. The price of electricity from onshore wind farms dropped 9 percent since mid-2019. And falling costs more efficient technology and government support in some parts of the world have fostered larger renewable power plants with the average wind farm now double the capacity it was four years ago.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

To boot polling on how Americans think about energy sources like solar and wind remained consistent this year: The vast majority of Americans say developing alternative sources of energy should be prioritized over developing fossil fuels.

4. Pipelines became nearly impossible to build

Pipeline or pipe dream? Pipeline construction companies and the energy companies paying them to create the infrastructure to transport oil and gas across long distances ran into roadblock after roadblock this year. So many roadblocks in fact that some energy companies just gave up trying to build them.

That's what happened to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline over the summer: The U.S. Supreme Court gave the pipeline the green light to cross under the Appalachian Trail but a few weeks later Dominion Energy and Duke Energy the lead developers of the project decided to take a hike and dump the pipeline altogether.

(Grist)

The Dakota Access Pipeline the approval of which sparked the protests at Standing Rock in 2016 also took a critical hit over the summer when a federal judge said the company behind the project Energy Transfer and the Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct a sufficient environmental review. The judge ordered the pipeline to shut down while the review was conducted. An appeals court swiftly overturned that order but the company and the Army Corps still have to conduct the environmental review. When Biden takes office he could opt to shut down the pipeline entirely.

Speaking of Biden the president-elect has promised to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline by revoking the presidential permit President Trump granted the project in 2019. TC Energy the company building the project has already built some 120 miles of pipeline since last spring but if Biden makes good on his campaign promises (and green groups expect him to) he could put the kibosh on Keystone XL after he's inaugurated.

More pipelines were put on the chopping block this year: The Mountain Valley Pipeline is struggling to keep construction going as judges keep tossing out crucial permits forcing the company to hunt down new ones. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer delivered a serious blow to Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline in November ordering it shut down. Enbridge filed suit against Whitmer arguing that only the federal government has the jurisdiction to shut down pipelines but the incoming Biden administration can reaffirm Whitmer's authority and take other steps to stymie Enbridge's plans.

5. Cities put a check on emissions from buildings

A recent United Nations report found that the carbon emissions from heating cooking and using electricity in buildings hit an all-time high last year and were responsible for 28 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Fortunately in 2020 efforts to rein in emissions from buildings took off.

Just a few weeks ago the cities of San Francisco Oakland and San Jose passed laws limiting the installation of appliances that run on natural gas in new buildings joining 37 other jurisdictions across California that have already done so. These ""gas bans"" have been catching on around the country: Seattle's mayor wants to update the city's building code to prohibit the use of fossil fuels in new buildings; St. Louis has new building performance standards that will effectively phase out gas appliances in larger buildings; and Brookline Massachusetts has petitioned the state to let it ban gas hookups in new buildings after an earlier effort to do so was found to conflict with state laws.

In December Washington state proposed what could be the nation's first state-level gas ban and several new state climate action plans and task forces including in New Jersey Michigan Nevada and Maryland explicitly mentioned the need to electrify buildings.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

But as the idea of moving away from gas in buildings gained currency some states ran in the opposite direction. Under pressure from industry lawmakers in Arizona Louisiana Oklahoma and Tennessee passed nearly identical bills this year that prohibit their own municipalities from banning gas.

To be clear decarbonizing buildings is not as simple as banning gas hookups or appliances. As more buildings go fully electric gas utilities could undergo a slow death spiral and fewer and fewer customers could end up paying to maintain a vast network of gas pipelines. But states are finally reckoning with these questions — New York California Colorado and Massachusetts all opened new investigations this year into the future of gas distribution to try to answer them.

6. The world agreed on achieving net-zero by mid-century

The idea of ""net-zero emissions"" has been around for years but in 2020 it was thrust into the mainstream as an essential tenet of climate policy around the world.

Every week seemed to bring a new announcement of a state country bank utility tech giant or even oil company promising to get to net-zero over the next few decades. Generally that means they'll get to a place where their net emissions between the CO2 they release into the atmosphere and the CO2 they suck out of it through natural and technological means are zero. Microsoft even said it would go beyond that point to ""carbon negative"" by removing all the carbon it has emitted since its founding in 1975.

In theory net-zero is a valiant goal — a 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the world needs to get to net-zero by 2050 in order to avoid the catastrophic effects expected to occur if the globe warms more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).

But that conclusion was based on a crucial premise: First we have to dramatically reduce emissions. The whole ""net"" part of the deal should really only apply to the parts of the economy that are hardest to decarbonize like aviation and shipping. But many of the net-zero pledges made this year by companies are nebulous about when they will reduce their emissions or whether they'll do so at all. The energy companies with net-zero pledges are still expanding the fossil fuel side of their businesses and many of the tech companies with net-zero pledges are still helping those energy companies find and extract more fossil fuels.

The most important development in 2020 may not have been the slew of net-zero pledges but something a little more obscure. Companies finally began publicly accounting for the emissions tied to their supply chains and the products they produce known as ""scope 3"" emissions. Transparency around scope 3 puts more pressure on reducing emissions throughout the economy.

Next year we'll be looking to see which companies shore up their pledges with near-term targets and which ones show up in Washington to lobby for the policy changes that will help them deliver on net-zero."

Once a month four union construction workers and a facilities worker from the hospital – better known collectively as the Bingo Guys – would film a Wednesday bingo show to provide some entertainment to the children at the hospital and their families.

These days that TV studio is buzzing.

Since the coronavirus kept some volunteers out of the building the Bingo Guys are now a weekly feature because they're already in the hospital almost daily. They still do their usual educational bingo game but they mix in some trivia and other games to keep things fresh. On Thursday they held a trivia game with a New Year's theme.

""We’re taking care of the kids making sure they have a happy New Year"" said Patrick Creedon a union electrician with Local 313 who is better known as ""Pirate Pat.""

""We do this to help make their stay more enjoyable"" said Josh Manners aka ""Buzz Lightyear"" of Local 199.

Those two are joined by Local 332's Danny Shaw (""Hula Dan"") Local 74's Bill Wintrup (""Officer Richard"") and Nemours plumber George Wilson (""Dr. Pinky) to make up the Bingo Guys.

""They’re like the five stooges"" said Sara Narimanian the Child Life Program coordinator at the hospital.

The ""stooges"" started volunteering their time nearly a year ago before the COVID-19 pandemic. Narimanian said she reached out to the group in March when things were changing and asked if they would be interested in doing more shows. They could even film some she told them.

""They want to go off the cuff"" she said. ""They want to be live.""

COVID-19: Who's next in line for the vaccine?

The weekly interactive shows allow for real-time participation by patients and their family members. They can watch on video and call into the show from their rooms. The studio broadcasts out to a hospital-wide channel that can be viewed in each room.

""As contractors on the job we get to see patients in the hospital all the time"" Manners said in a video produced by the hospital. ""But we don’t really get to interact with them because that’s not what we do. We’re not health care professionals. We build things. Bingo is an avenue that allows us to engage with the patients. … It’s fulfilling for us and hopefully for the patients too.""

""You can just feel it; they’re doing it from their heart"" said Rosa Mendez the mother of a patient in the Nemours-produced video. ""They’re really putting their heart into it and really genuinely care about the kids.

""They were really truly our light in the darkest of moments that we were going through.""

The unions aren't just donating time for smiles. When Halloween came around this year funds were low. Narimanian said James Maravelias of Local 199 and Angelique Rodriguez of Delaware LECET stepped up and helped raise $12500 in funds. Narimanian said the funds went to among other things providing 250 Halloween costumes.

Away from the studio Narimanian said the Bingo Guys have become ""like rock stars."" The kids see Buzz Lightyear (Manners) on their television screens and then occasionally run into him in the halls. The Bingo Guys reciprocate sometimes giving on-air shoutouts to patients.

""A lot of these kids aren’t in the best shape and they really enjoy it"" Narimanian said.

So too does everyone else.

""It’s like therapeutic hours for all of us"" Narimanian said.

Adaptability is the key to success as an MRO says Frederic Dupont Etihad Engineering’s vice-president technical sales and customer service.

“We’re always looking at how we can reinvent ourselves from an efficiency and operational perspective – how we can loop into MRO innovations that can deliver benefits to our customers.”

Companies need to be able to see beyond today’s ‘buzzwords’ to the customer benefits now and in five or 10 years. A customer doesn’t ask if additive manufacturing (AM) for example will produce a part that’s 10g lighter or with lower CO2 emissions; they want to know the cost.

Etihad Engineering has broken new ground with AM since first receiving European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approval. Its AM lab in Abu Dhabi produces cabin parts from polymers – items such as arm rests and arm caps. Dupont says the system “works well”.

Drone technology is rapidly advancing but is not yet mature enough to provide sufficient returns for Etihad Engineering to implement ‘as is’ in a heavy maintenance environment.

A critical success factor is to link the entire ecosystem: from measuring the cracks/defects to the regulatory/OEM approval of the analysis of such data – still a work in progress. At that point he said “You will be talking about bringing real benefits to the customer.”

Etihad Engineering set up an innovation steering committee and roadmap to look at technologies “through our customers’ eyes” and structure the activity surrounding assessment. “We have a business to run” said Dupont. “We don’t have 20 people standing by to explore every new thing that comes along.”

Technology and innovation is never cheap; its adoption and ultimately its success depends on feasibility assessment proof of concept trials and development.

“We can’t go and buy [technology] off the shelf” said Dupont. “We need to customise it adapt it to our business in order to maximise the returns to our customers.”

The overriding question is always: “When will a technology bring enough benefits to effectively outweigh all the implementation costs and disruption to operations?

“At end of the day we’re just MROs we’re not OEMs.”

While re-upping is limited to click and collect for now a unique interior is the easiest way to stand out especially if the store looks like if a Scandinavian vase had a baby with that white room from the Matrix.

Taking the sleek Apple Store approach to weed store blueprint to peak minimalism is Edition X the first location of this Toronto-based cannabis company at 270 Dupont St.

The company from Ryan Roebuck and Dennis Bennie employed Toronto design firm StudioAC to create a shopping experience that at first glance looks like it sells dangly earrings made out of rare moon stones maybe or vials of mountain air.

Product which is relatively on par with most other brands is displayed on counters made out of industrial grating like an airport ramp but stylish.

Edition X sells the usual weed product supply along with a number of lifestyle goods like candles tote bags ashtrays from furniture studio Mary Ratcliffe and vape pens from Greentank.

Six years ago Kevin Warner decided to leave his comfortable position with a large corporation to help lead a small privately held company into the future. That company was Mustang Sampling and Warner now serves as its chief technology officer. BIC Magazine recently visited with Warner to learn more about natural gas technologies and applications and how Mustang Sampling is growing in new markets particularly when it comes to renewable natural gas (RNG).

Q: What led to your position at Mustang Sampling?

A: Mustang Sampling has been a market leader since its inception in 2008 and the company's growth could only be sustained if it developed more technologies to address the expanding natural gas industry which includes LNG RNG and NGLs. I used to sell ultrasonic meters to Mustang Sampling and I knew the owner long before I went to work for the company. During a lunch meeting we developed a plan for Mustang Sampling going forward with the two of us working together. I have a technical background in cryogenics and natural gas measurement that tied in extremely well with the core capabilities of Mustang Sampling plus I brought a more structured approach to the organization from my experiences with Emerson and Elster American Meter which is now Honeywell. We decided to move forward six years ago and I haven't looked back since.

The most important part of my position is providing perspectives on potential opportunities especially as they relate to technical challenges. There are so many areas of potential activity so we need to focus on the right ones or we'll simply distract ourselves from what is most important.

Q: What is the biggest news at Mustang Sampling right now?

A: There are two active fronts within the company as both LNG and RNG markets are growing and Mustang Sampling has unique products designed for each. We have spent a significant amount of effort redesigning our LNG vaporizing and analysis systems to accommodate more applications. As North American exports expand along the Gulf Coast the challenges grow and our engineering team needs to be fully engaged. On the RNG side renewable energy sources are obviously important throughout not only the U.S. but also the rest of the world. The challenges of analyzing the gas from new sources are limitless; however Mustang Sampling's core competency is gas sampling for analysis putting RNG right into our bailiwick.

Q: Are you looking to grow in new markets or expand in current ones?

A: We expect to grow in new markets and expand in traditional ones. As a primary goal in new markets nontraditional methane sources will become more complex making analysis more important. RNG will undoubtedly expand and play a larger role in the global energy picture. We also know hydrogen as a fuel either pure or as an additive will require significant attention. In traditional markets natural gas will continue to gain market share as a portion of total energy sources since it is the cleanest hydrocarbon available. We will continue to work with our traditional customers to provide the cleanest energy possible to residential commercial industrial and power providers.

Q: What should someone know before taking this type of position?

A: All chief technology officers underestimate the amount of time they will spend studying market conditions and managing personnel. The position isn't all technical which would be fun so a solid grounding in people and markets is essential along with an understanding of the technology.

Q: What is a ""fun fact"" about you people might not know?

A: I'm not sure if it's ""fun"" but I grew up in a predominantly Amish area and I attended a Brethren college as an undergraduate. Brethren and the Amish both teach pacifism.

Nine hours later she was joined by Quentin Heisel.

Weitzel was the first baby of 2021 born at a UCHealth hospital in northern Colorado. Heisel was the first born at a Banner Health facility and both infants made their world debuts in Loveland.

Weitzel the daughter of Amanda and Tyler Weitzel of Eaton arrived at 12:46 a.m. Friday at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland. She was 20 inches long and 7 pounds and 6 1/2 ounces.

“I think 2021 is starting off right” said Tyler Weitzel during a video conference call late Friday morning with Amanda and Cambree. “We’re doing good. She’s doing good.”

At 9:24 a.m. Eve and Alex Heisel of Greeley celebrated the arrival of Quentin who was the first 2021 baby in another Loveland hospital — Banner Health’s McKee Medical Center. Quentin weighed in at 7 pounds 15 ounces and was 20 inches long.

Tyler Weitzel a 29-year-old truck driver said so far Cambree is sleeping more than her brother. Caden Weitzel is 16 months old. He was introduced to his sister in a Face Time call and the boy was keen on saying “baby.”

Amanda Weitzel 27 said she and Tyler always liked the name Cambree. The baby’s middle name is Amanda’s middle name and that of Amanda’s mother Lori Domencio.

Amanda Weitzel is a fifth-grade teacher at Jackson Elementary School in Greeley.

“She has my dark hair” Weitzel said. “I think she looks like mama.”

With an original due date of Jan. 7 Cambree Weitzel was born following an approximately 12-hour labor.

Amanda went to a regularly scheduled doctor’s appointment on Thursday. The baby wasn’t moving around a lot and her healthcare team advocated to induce labor. The Weitzels went to the hospital about 12:30 p.m. Thursday.

“I think it’s a blessing all-around” Amanda Weitzel said. “I found out I was pregnant in the middle of COVID and here we are blessing the family.”

Fancy feeling like old-school James bond in a posh London flat?

If you also happen to have a spare £1.6million handy you could be in with some luck.

A luxury apartment in a building previously owned by the late Sir Sean Connery who passed away in October 2020 at the age of 90 is newly on the market.

Sean lived in the townhouse that is now up for sale and owned another next door.

Strangely enough another James Bond previously lived on the same street Eaton Square Belgravia.

Knight Frank agent Stuart Bailey said: ‘At the same time Sir Sean lived at number 6 Eaton Square Roger Moore lived at number 22. By chance they lived really close to each other.’

And in Fleming’s books James Bond lived in a house just around the corner on Ebury Street.

The flat is made up of a large reception room one bedroom one bathroom and a kitchen (Picture: Knight Frank/Triangle News)

So if you’re a diehard Bond fan this really is the place to be.

After Sir Sean departed from the townhouse it was turned into a block of separate luxury apartments one of which is now on sale for £1 59500.

Aside from its Bond links the apartment itself is pretty lovely.

The property’s description says: ‘A very bright second floor apartment overlooking Eaton Square gardens.

‘This west-facing flat has been refurbished to a high standard.

‘There is a large west-facing reception room and a separate kitchen as well as one double bedroom and a bathroom.

‘Eaton Square is located in the heart of Belgravia and is regarded as one of the best addresses in London.

The flat sits on what used to be London’s most expensive street (Picture: Knight Frank/Triangle News)

‘The property is located 0.2 miles from Sloane Square underground station as well as the Kings Road Victoria and Knightsbridge.’

There’s just one bedroom and one bathroom so it’d be ideal for a bachelor like Bond or a couple keen to live in one of the poshest parts of London.

If this apartment doesn’t take your fancy there’s another property previously owned by Connery now on the market.

Sir Sean’s luxury £27 million French Riviera mansion in Nice is also up for sale by Knight Frank.

The stunning home is still referred to as ‘Sean’s place’ by locals after he spent most of his time there in the 80s and 90s.

That five-bedroom villa comes with indoor and outdoor pools as well as a 5000 square metre garden.

Speaking to Bloomberg a US-based media agency the MTN Group chief executive officer Mr Rob Shuter said: “It is regrettable that the value has gone down so much.”

The decline in Jumia’s share price according to the African Report has accelerated since the e-commerce platform said in August that sales consultants in Nigeria had been involved in placing improper orders which were then cancelled.

Jumia has traded as high as $49.77 per share but the stock has fallen to about $11 compared with the IPO price of $14.50 which gives the company a market value of about $867m from $1.5b in 2016.

MTN’s interest in Jumia according to Bloomberg is now worth less than $100m.

The move comes at a time when MTN is behind schedule in its bid to generate about $1b in asset sales over the next three years.

The fall Bloomberg reported makes the e-commerce group less viable for MTN to sell a stake in the near term.

This follows a six-month lock in period where the telecom would not sell its shareholding in the e-commerce platform.

“The post IPO lock up period of Jumia in which we have an 18.9 per cent stake has expired and as at 29 October this stake is valued at approximately $94.3m” Mr Ralph Mupita the MTN Group chief financial officer said in a statement earlier.

Assets disposal

According to Mupita MTN has through its Asset Realisation Programme which was announced in March achieved $141m out of the $1b target.

However the telecom said it hopes to attain more money through disposal of its tower assets in Uganda and Ghana.

“We continue to make steady progress in this regard and following American Towers Corporation’s announcement of its acquisition of Eaton Towers we are in advanced discussions to dispose of our 49 per cent holdings in ATC Ghana and ATC Uganda which we value at between $471m and $539m respectively” he said.

The sale is expected to help MTN meet its target of generating a $1b in asset sales over three years.

A statement by ATC highlighting the definitive agreement to acquire Eaton Towers including the assumption of existing debt of approximately $1.85b said the company continues to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Acquisition of the stakes in each of the joint ventures with MTN in Ghana and Uganda ATC said are also subject to the closing of the Eaton Towers transaction.

MTN group performance

According to Mr Shuter: “Service revenue grew by 9.6 per cent while earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) marginally improving by 0.6 per cent to 35.1 per cent.



“We remain committed to driving access to Internet and financial services and in quarter three we added 4.7 million active data users and 2.2 million mobile money subscribers across the portfolio. Our Ayoba messaging platform is now available across five markets and is already recording 515000 active users per month” Mr Shuter revealed.

Various disposal efforts

Botswana’s Mascom for $300m has been scrapped and events at Jumia Technologies AG have made a sell less viable.

Further proceeds could be generated by the redemption of the Nigeria unit’s preference shares which MTN values at $315m according to Mr Mupita.

The MTN group is awaiting a ruling from the central bank of Nigeria on the matter.

A proposed sale of HIS Towers - which is separate to the $1b plan - may be revived as shareholders including MTN prepare for a fresh tilt at an IPO next year people familiar with the matter said this week.

MTN has been exploring asset sales while focusing on key markets such as Nigeria.

In South Africa MTN and its rivals are battling with regulator curbs on data prices weak consumer confidence and a delay over the release of new spectrum."

Larson fell in love with Mustangs when he was 13 when a neighbor took him for a spin in his 1970 Mach 1 and by the time he was 16 he had saved up $650 to buy his own Mustang. He scoped out a 1967 Mustang Coupe and was ready to put his money down but his mom put the kibosh on the idea. I’m sure his mom took the wrath of his disappointment until his 16th birthday when she showed up in the driveway with that same 1967 Mustang as a gift to him.

For people who want to get on the property ladder buying an Insta-ready showhome is rarely an option.

If you’re a stickler for your interiors though you can always opt to buy an older house and make it your own – just like this Nottingham couple did.

Helen and Ben who have been sharing their renovations journey online bought a 1930s fixer-upper in March and have turned it around since then.

Sharing videos of their formerly-dated abode on their Let’s Make This House a Home TikTok and Instagram you can see just how much work has gone into the property.

The kitchen for example had to be fully ripped out and started again as well as digging into the garden to make an extension.

Old-fashioned tiles and bathroom fittings (such as the blue sink and bath) were taken down the outside of the house was re-rendered and walls were removed or repainted to create an open and modern space.

Many of the walls were panelled or ceilings were artexed which the couple took down opting for a less retro look.

The colour scheme throughout is now mostly neutral and pastel with pops of gold and matte black.

The kitchen is unrecognisable from its former state (Picture: Instagram/@letsmakethishouseahome)

Many of the items the couple have bought for their ‘new’ abode have been from eBay as well as sale bargains from the likes of Zara Home and La Redoute.

The couple’s kitchen was made by Howdens and further products were purchased from Sklum House of Dotcom and Made.

Helen and Ben also saved money by doing digging clearing up sanding and varnishing floors and removing paint and repainting themselves.

The pair’s videos have been a huge smash on TikTok with one in particular having been viewed over two million times.

‘The whole house has been done so beautifully and tastefully. Timeless’ one commenter said.

Another wrote: ‘Finally a house that isn ‘t all grey and boring and the same as everyone else’s. Love your interior.’

Although the couple haven’t been able to have people over due to coronavirus restrictions they’ve been focusing on getting it looking perfect (with plenty of interiors content on their socials) in the meantime.

Ghouls used eBay to sell police files giving grisly details of the Yorkshire Ripper’s murder spree.

Documents listing personal data about Peter Sutcliffe’s victims – and the way they were brutally attacked – were flogged for £390 just days ago.

The insensitive sale came just five weeks after Sutcliffe died and dredged up more harrowing and painful memories for victims’ families and survivors.

Papers in the eBay auction lot were titled “Original Yorkshire Ripper Murder and Assaults Case File Book for Peter Sutcliffe”.

Image: PA) PA)

It carried the West Yorkshire Police logo. Other pages showed apparent clues – with pictures of tyre treads and a car.

They also appeared to reveal the mindset of some detectives at the time.

Sutcliffe’s 13 murder victims included a number of sex workers and one passage in the files read: “Most of the victims are prostitutes or women of loose moral character... it appears the motive is a pathological hatred of women and prostitutes.”

One victim was described as a “heavy drinker” who “cohabited with a number of men”.

Another passage even suggests one woman targeted “was apparently unhappy with her sexual relationship”.

Survivor Tracy Browne 59 – just 14 when Sutcliffe rained five blows on her head with a hammer in August 1975 – said of the dossier sale: “People need to get a life but there will be those with morbid curiosity.

“As far as I’m concerned once he died that should have been it. I don’t want to go round hating people and Peter Sutcliffe is not worth it.

“I’ve read before how the police regarded some of the victims the way they spoke about them. When he died the police apologised for the way they spoke about the victims that was the right thing to do.”

Neil Jackson’s mum Emily – who helped run the family roofing business – was stabbed 52 times by Sutcliffe in Leeds in 1976.

He said: “We all know how they regarded the victims at the time and they have said ‘sorry’ – even if it was years too late.

Image: PA) PA)

“All his victims deserve to be remembered as mums daughters sisters with families that loved them. I don’t think things like this should be being sold people cashing in on him but there will always be interest from the ghouls out there.”

Sutcliffe’s murder spree across northern Britain ran from 1975 to 1980. He was found guilty of 13 murders and seven attempted murders.

Sutcliffe was given a whole-life sentence and piled on the weight during 30 years in jail.

He died last month aged 74 after contracting coronavirus following a heart attack.

Former intelligence officer Chris Clarke examined cold cases with striking similarities and believes Sutcliffe may have killed up to 30 more victims.

West Yorkshire Police said it was investigating the dossier sale. A spokesman said: “The fact that this confidential police case file was in the public domain being offered for sale to the highest bidder is deeply inappropriate.

""As a victim-focused organisation we are acutely mindful of the potential impact this could have on the families of victims murdered by Sutcliffe and surviving victims.”

The force also reiterated the “heartfelt apology” issued by Chief Constable John Robins after Sutcliffe died.

He said at the time: “I apologise for the distress and anxiety caused by the language tone and terminology used by senior officers at the time in relation to Peter Sutcliffe’s victims.

“Thankfully those attitudes are consigned to history and our approach today is wholly victim focused putting them at the centre of everything we do.”"

The Milan Rotary Club has a record of various public service projects over the years.

They also have a student affiliate: The Edison High School Interact Club.

It originated eight years ago with a question to a Milan Rotarian who was a guest at an Elyria Rotary meeting.

Now it has grown to include 74 students – about 20 percent of Edison High’s student body.

“It’s a community service type of organization where we just come up with different projects and we go out into the community and try to do good and be genuine about everything that we do” said Anna James 17 co-president of the Interact Club.

“I think people just really like getting involved and seeing that their helping is directly impacting someone else” said fellow co-president Katelyn Chenevey 18.

“It’s definitely a genuine thing” James said. “It’s very genuine.”

They both are seniors at the school.

Getting started

Nick Georgiafandis is a Milan Rotarian and retired band director of Edison. His wife Kelley Georgiafandis is secretary of the Milan Rotary Club.

While he still was working at the school he recalled visiting the Elyria Rotary Club and speaking to Sam Battle now a retired teacher from Lorain County JVS.

“He said ‘what do you know about Interact?’ I said ‘what’s that?”‘ Georgiafandis said.

He credited Battle for inspiring the group while Battle complimented the high school students and the adult Rotarians.

“I may have been the spark because I was in a position to be the spark but they just flew” he said. “Once they got their wings they just took off. They’re a great example of how an Interact Club and Rotary work together and depend on each other.”

Battle remains Interact Club co-chairman for Rotary’s District 6600 which covers 64 clubs with 3500 members in northern Ohio.

“To me it’s a win-win situation” Battle said. “That’s what gets the teachers and the students and the parents and the Rotary Club all fired up and they do outstanding service for the community.”

The Edison High group began with 14 students recruited by twos from other clubs at the school.

Nick Georgiafandis still serves as Rotary liaison.

“I love doing it” Georgiafandis said adding “So this gets me back into the building.”

School librarian Patty Moyer is club adviser. She said her goal is “to be invisible” in a sense letting the students discover community needs and find ways to help.

“In all honesty at Edison we just have really good kids” Moyer said.

Whenever there is a call for volunteers the students are eager to get to the signup sheets said Kelley Georgiafandis.

“People who knock teenagers have no concept” she said. “They really are awesome. They want to help.”

It happens with little if any recognition for the work she added.

“There’s no list of names of who did what” Kelley Georgiafandis said. “You get nothing except you helped.”

Expanding reach

Rotary International works with almost 15000 Interact Clubs with almost 343000 students across 145 countries.

In Milan the club is open to students of all grades at Edison.

The club started with a $1000 contribution from Milan Rotary and students pay no dues.

Now it is self-sufficient raising money through the annual Pizza Palooza all-you-can-eat fundraiser with local restaurants. That event was canceled this year due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The beginning of November is Rotary International’s World Interact Week.

On Nov. 3 Chenevey and James spoke to the Milan Rotarians as part of their regular meeting.

During the COVID-19 pandemic the students communicate via email and social media Chenevey said.

They planted flowers at the high school and helped with Milan Rotary’s annual Halloween event. They will assist with loading backpacks with food for students who need them.

There is more to come and it will grow out from Milan.

Interact Club members assist OH-go the Sandusky-based mobile food pantry with its Project Happy effort that delivers wrapped boxes with toys snacks toiletries across Erie and Huron counties.

The Edison students have gone as far afield as Willard to give away the gifts. Chenevey will be co-leader of that work this year.

James a member of Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s Teen Ambassador Board said the club aims to join efforts to raise awareness of human trafficking – and maybe offer a way to help others out of it with a national hotline included on hotel soap.

In 2018 the Milan Chamber of Commerce presented its Youth Service Award to the club.

Edison School Superintendent Thomas C. Roth described the work of the club.

“Interact has certainly done outstanding things for the betterment of youth of our community” said Roth who also is a Rotarian. “First by their selfless acts to improve their school community and the world.

“But more importantly in my eyes by setting an example for all of our younger children as to what life is truly about: service above self.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

This remuneration structure has also led to disagreements between the OEM and other developers.

4 Reviews

Huawei famously developed its own version of the Google Play Store (or Apple's App Store) and Google Mobile Services in response to its blockade from using these cornerstones of everyday normal Android. The OEM had offered attractive introductory cuts of the profits to get developers to contribute to its AppGallery.

However that was a while ago and apparently does not apply to big game-makers like Tencent in any case. This company became dissatisfied with its share of app revenue it got from Huawei for adding versions of its titles to the AppGallery reportedly set at 50%. The ensuing conflict caused Huawei to remove the entire Tencent portfolio from its store.

These apps have now reportedly been restored as new negotiations over the software company’s rates have begun. This situation – also said to be why you can’t get Genshin Impact on phones running Huawei Mobile Services – echoes the dispute between Apple and Epic Games.

Then again not even Apple demands the share Huawei apparently extracts from developers. On the other hand the OEM also commands a 41.4% share of the Chinese smartphone market thus representing a consumer-base running into the hundreds of millions that not even companies such as Tencent could afford to miss out on.

The frank lyrics of David Balfe under the pseudonym For Those I Love illuminate a generation who emerged from the wreckage.

“I’ve been with people whose families had lost their livelihoods because of the recession” says the 29-year-old. “At that younger age you don’t have the vocabulary but you see that displacement and you think: ‘Why are we suffering? Why has this happened to us?’”

His superb self-titled debut album out later this year rumbles into this core of working-class Dublin. The near-biographical account carries his deepest sorrows and depressions as well as the accompanying memories of a childhood now laced with nostalgia’s golden glow. Across nine songs Balfe lays his life bare penning Streets-esque passages over electronic productions that recall James Blake or Mount Kimbie. “Red eyes and red credit searching for a way to get out of the estate on Reddit” runs a typical lyric.

With these narratives Balfe moves through the community he has built his life around while also mourning his best friend and fellow artist Paul Curran who died in 2018. “I didn’t have counselling at the time I didn’t have medication I didn’t have any other way” he says. “I didn’t know any other way than to make things.”

Before For Those I Love music began in his teenage years with a shed in his parents back garden a place of refuge from what at times in Donameghde and Coolock was a “very violent upbringing”. When he was six a body was dumped at the end of his road and he still remembers the blood stain on the street. But alongside his friends he found escapism in the shed a place where they “all just cut our teeth” deeply grateful for the “trust to be able to close the door have privacy and make a racket”.

The shed was also an emblem of a family who held him close who “didn’t have fuck all” but whose investment in his interests and future “did help steer me away from certain avenues and down much more positive avenues. If I hadn’t been able to fall back on that love and care I don’t know what I would have done it would have been a very different trajectory of my life.” Eventually bands emerged. Plagues and the Branch Becomes turned out metalcore. Burnt Out with Paul was angst-ridden punk.

When Curran killed himself a deep grief settled over Balfe and seeped into his solo work. The Myth / I Don’t confronts grief’s lasting echo: the PTSD panic that consumes him whenever his phone pings “terrified of what’s on the other end” the possibility of more tragedy.

The bond that held the two friends is now woven through the record: WhatsApp messages and voice notes knit the nine songs together digital residue from years of documenting their days “just recording everything archiving everything”.

“I have a bad memory” Balfe says “and one of my biggest fears is forgetting: people moments things that shaped the person that I am.” Being able to build these pieces into the record was a way “for me to immortalise those moments” he says because “there’s no way you can make a record about the people that I love without having their imprint all over it. They’re more than just those stories it’s their voices it’s the way they speak.”

Making the album after Curran died was “tough” and “ate me up alive” but it was necessary. When it was finished Balfe listened to it every morning as he rode the bus and an “otherworldly comfort” would settle over him. “Maybe it was a way for me to experience that catharsis without having to break down without me having to fall into whatever black hole could come if I let that door open.”

For the past six months Balfe has been caged in Dublin’s strict lockdown. But with the live music industry slowly revving its cold motor he has unearthed the album to rehearse for live performances. That process of “propelling air out of your lungs for the first time in months” has given him grace he says. “I felt light for the first time in a while. It’s going back to how it feels to be human.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoZXJuYmVhY2hlcy5uc3cuZ292LmF1L3RoaW5ncy10by1kby9hcnRzLWFuZC1jdWx0dXJlL2xvY2FsLWNyZWF0aXZlcy9zYW1teS10YXlsb3LSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sammy Taylor,"With the support of a Creative Community Support Grant Sammy has written and produced her new single Something that is being released on 8 January.

Sammy is an emerging singer/songwriter music producer and musician who has performed widely at venues across the Northern Beaches and beyond.

You’re a young emerging singer songwriter musician and performer tell us a little more about your creative practice?

I have been singing and playing guitar since I was 15 which lead me to study music production at Sydney’s Ableton live school. I noticed how very few females were producing and playing at festivals so I wanted to enter the production game and inspire others that anything is possible and hopefully inspire more women to enter the producing side of things. I create indie/electronic music infused with electric guitar and layered vocals. I make all the layers of my songs from the guitar melodies to the vocals and beats and this is something I want to convey in my live show. I feel really strongly about performing all the elements I create and using Ableton live for my live show. I am inspired by other artists like BANKS Tash Sultana and Jack Garratt.

How do you like to connect with music audiences on the Northern Beaches?

I feel I can connect to audiences best when performing in small intimate venues playing my live show where I loop electric guitars drums and sing. Across the Northern Beaches I have performed at Taste of Manly festival in 2018 and regularly play at local venues such as Manly Greenhouse Hotel Steyne and The Newport. Further afield I’ve performed at the Coogee Bay Hotel Sydney Opera House and was selected to play at Party in the Park festival 2017.

How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted your creative practice?

COVID-19 has had a huge impact on my business. DJ'ing around the Northern Beaches was my full-time job however due to restrictions and closures of venues I lost all my upcoming gigs and income. Performing was a huge part of my life and funded my song writing.

How has the Creative Community Support Grant funding help you adapt to the changing environment of 2020?

We lost the night life on the beaches this year. I have adapted to performing completely online instead of in venues/clubs. The funding has enabled me to write and produce a new song to release online. My new single Something is out on 8 January and I will be performing it live on YouTube livestreaming. I have created this online environment for live streaming not only for myself but for other artists and will continue to invite other artists to join me on my live stream to perform their own music. Something is about the start of a new relationship beginning to bloom drawing on my own personal experiences. It’s the start of a new era in my life which is why I think it’s perfect to release in the New Year. Something was written and recorded at my home studio in Sydney’s Northern Beaches before being sent to Brooklyn-based producer Tiger Darrow for mixing and added instrumentation; while Andrew Edgson (Matt Corby Amy Shark) completed mastering at Studios 301.

Looking ahead where do you see yourself in 5 years-time as a creative practitioner?

I believe that anything is possible! In a few years I would love to be touring and playing some big shows/festivals across Australia and the world. I want to be a successful artist and producer creating inspiring uplifting music that will be heard across the globe.

Where would you love to perform when it’s safe to travel again?"

The inclusion will place the solar energy stock among the most valuable companies on the benchmark index. Enphase closed 1.5% higher on Thursday.

Enphase Energy (ENPH) which currently trades on the S&P MidCap 400 will replace Tiffany & Co. in the S&P 500. The change comes after Tiffany shareholders recently agreed to a takeover by French luxury goods giant LVMH. The merger is expected to close on Jan. 7.

Meanwhile Capri Holdings Limited a member of the S&P SmallCap 600 will take Enphase Energy’s place in the S&P MidCap 400.

Earlier in October Enphase reported better-than-expected 3Q results. The company’s EPS of $0.30 per share beat analysts’ estimates of $0.24 per share. Revenues of $178.5 million also exceeded the Street’s estimates of $169.3 million. (See ENPH stock analysis on TipRanks)

On Dec. 24 Roth Capital analyst Philip Shen raised the stock’s price target to $220 (25.4% upside potential) from $160 and maintained a Buy rating. In a note to investors Shen said that solar energy stocks have had a significant run-up through 2020. Looking ahead Shen expects multiple expansion across the solar sector to continue in 2021.

From the rest of the Street the stock scores a cautiously optimistic analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $132.69 which implies downside potential of about 24.4% to current levels. The stock has skyrocketed 571.5% in 2020.

A staff writer for The Sentinel-Record reported that as of 11:30 p.m. Thursday all of downtown Hot Springs was without power and Entergy's online outage map indicated the outage stretched as far east as Cloud 9 RV Park and as far west as Cedarglade Road.

J. Paul Brewster customer service manager for Entergy Arkansas said a crossarm on a transmission line was damaged causing the outages.

""All services have been restored"" Brewster said at around noon Friday.

Brewster said there was no obvious cause but it ""appeared to be lightning-related.""

Rappler speaks to Barbara de Laere about the shift and what it means for Aveda's customers

Beauty brand Aveda announced on January 1 2021 that all of its products are now 100% vegan. That means both future launches and older products are now produced without beeswax one of the last animal-derived ingredients in the brand’s inky list.

The process Aveda global brand president Barbara de Laere told Rappler involved combing through all of the ingredients they used – over 900 of them – going up and down the supply chain and making sure animal-derived ingredients are not involved in any step of the process.

De Laere said the process took several years because the goal was always “go over and beyond the expectations the consumer has when they use a certain product.”

The most difficult to find plant-derived alternatives to said De Laere were honey beeswax and beeswax absolute. Beeswax is used in color cosmetics and hair products and helps in making products easier to apply. Beeswax absolute meanwhile helps in the aroma of Aveda’s products. The company eventually developed a proprietary blend to replace these ingredients.

Carbon-negative goal

Aveda founded in 1978 has always made sustainability a goal.

It’s been cruelty-free since it was founded (which means it doesn’t test on animals) which means going full vegan made “a huge amount of sense for the brand” said De Laere. The point of Aveda she said is to prove that you “don’t need to compromise between being responsible and sustainable and being profitable successful and profitable at the same time.”

It’s important to note however that while Aveda is cruelty-free and 100% vegan its mother company the beauty giant Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) is not. While ELC itself does not test on animals “animal testing on cosmetics products exists if a regulatory body demands it for its safety or regulatory assessment.” Some countries require animal testing on products including cosmetics because they get permits to be sold. Aveda is one of 6 ELC brands that are fully cruelty-free

Neither formulas nor price points will be affected by the shift to vegan said De Laere.

“We have been producing vegan since August of 2019… if there would have been any issue we would have about it and we would have solved it. Luckily we haven’t heard any issue” she told Rappler ahead of the company’s announcement.

On top of consistency with the brand’s ethos De Laere explained that shifting to 100% vegan was a necessary response to consumer behavior. “We’re also seeing with our consumers this incredible drive for ethical consumerism. People vote with their dollars and they’re interested more than ever in the heart and soul of the brand” she said.

Aveda the company announced in a media briefing in December 2020 has bigger goals in mind – it aims to be carbon negative in its production by fiscal year 2024. “Carbon negative” entails the company’s entire ecosystem – which includes its affiliate salons and sourcing pool for its ingredients which had already become smaller because of its shift to 100% vegan. “The ROI (return on investment) on these investments are enormous – not just from a business perspective” she said.”

“The future of beauty has to be sustainable. There’s going to be – and rightly so – an explosion of demand from people wanting to know: what is this product what’s the footprint how about the environment and how are you taking responsibility as a company? It’s a role that we have to play” she added.

The shift has to do with giving people both the choice and the education to consume what’s best for one’s “three homes” – “the body the people that you love and the planet that you live on” said De Laere.

De Laere will also be the first to acknowledge the (rightful) skepticism that comes when a multinational pledges sustainability and environmental consciousness. For Aveda she said the key was “transparency and being very open.” In late October Aveda and ELC tapped blockchain technology to track the production and processing of vanilla from Madagascar.

Veganuary too

Play Video

To mark and perhaps boost the company’s push to 100% vegan products it’s also joining in Veganuary an event run by a UK-based nonprofit that encourages people to go vegan for an entire month. The preparations at the Aveda HQ in Blaine Minnesota is almost as intensive as ingredient audit. De Laere said that months prior non-vegan members of the Aveda team had been slowly switching to vegan alternatives – like using plant-based milk instead of dairy milk.

The effort is company-wide and company-backed – vegan cooking lessons and seminars are being line-up to help the non-vegans ease into the challenge. “We’re using our partners to help our teams without fear to start to dabble into the vegan world” she said.

In a way the Veganuary challenge and how it’s unfolding over at Aveda proves that moving towards sustainability entails both an individual’s and a community’s efforts. Speaking to media during a briefing De Laere said Aveda’s shift to being 100% vegan wasn’t just a challenge to its competitors and colleagues and in the beauty industry but an invitation.

“Naively I believe that we can change the world. The power of one and the choices we make even if they’re tiny [make an impact]” said De Laere who herself is a vegan. – Rappler.com

Cecilia Navarro is used to living life at a fast pace. A native New Yorker raised in the Bronx she first cut her teeth as a court reporter transcribing trials and even working in the infamous Rikers Island.

But she craved a slower life so she moved to Texas settling in Dallas first before migrating west to Fort Worth.

Starting her own business however was never part of the plan. The opportunity seemingly fell onto her lap after she made a dreamcatcher for her daughter. The finished piece caught the attention of folks wanting to order her work so she started an Etsy store and began selling at pop-ups around DFW.

It wasn’t until she found herself at the Acoustic Solstice event on Race Street that she began toying around with the idea of setting up shop in the burgeoning district.

“I was able to take a step back and think to myself ‘I know that I’m not ready to do something like this but in a street that’s also growing there’s a chance that I could’” she says. “My intuition was right.”

She opened Creatively Beaut Goods on Race Street at the most inconvenient time — March 2020 — closing in the same month she opened thanks to COVID-19. But her customers came through still making purchases and ordering custom pieces which allowed her to reopen in a new space on the ground floor of The Union at River East apartment complex.

She’s stayed open since selling handmade macramé and jewelry alongside boho-inspired goods by fellow artisans. She also shares the space with Amy Garcia of Ohm Made Creations who carries a good stock of essential oils and crystals that fit right in with Navarro’s aesthetic.

Looking back Navarro says she doesn’t regret leaving New York. She’s loved being a part of Race Street living the slower-paced life she had so long desired even though she’s still getting used to it.

“I’m still working on slowing down” she says “but it’s what I love. I can’t believe how much of the fast-paced lifestyle is engraved in me. I’m just breaking down those layers and learning from my neighbors in Fort Worth to let things flow be more calm and take things day by day. It’s my favorite thing about Fort Worth.”

How to tell if a Discord user has been inactive for a period of time or set,"On Discord  ""Idle"" status usually means that the user has Discord open on their computer or web browser but hasn't looked at it in a while.

 ""Idle"" status usually means that the user has Discord open on their computer or web browser but hasn't looked at it in a while. If you want to manually change your status so you appear idle while still browsing Discord you can do so by tapping your profile picture and changing your status.

If you frequently use the Discord messaging platform you've probably noticed that sometimes certain Discord users will appear as ""Idle"" instead of online or offline.

What 'idle' means in Discord

In the context of Discord an idle user status means that the user in question has not logged out of Discord but has not looked at or interacted with Discord for a few minutes.

If you're familiar with the term ""AFK"" (Away From Keyboard) Discord's idle status is essentially the same thing. Most Discord users are automatically shown as idle when they have Discord open in their computer or browser but haven't looked at it in a while.

However there is a way to set your Discord status to idle manually - here's how.

How to manually set your Discord status as ""Idle""

1. Open Discord and log in to your account if prompted.

2. In the bottom left corner of your screen click on your profile picture.

3. A small menu will appear listing various user statuses. Click on ""Idle.""

4. Now your user status will appear as idle automatically even if you're currently active on Discord.

What will carry into 2021?,"""Things look a little different this year."" It's a mantra we've all heard and read over and over again as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads changing the norm for individuals and large organizations alike.

Life sure has changed in the last 12 months.

Since March COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 336000 Americans and nearly 1.7 million people worldwide. It significantly disrupted the American lifestyle as stay-at-home orders and mask mandates were enacted in communities around the country.

With the vaccine on the horizon life may go ""back to normal"" in some areas. But it's likely that many of the lifestyle and behavioral shifts we've adapted to will stick around next year.

Masks

One big change we've has largely adapted to is the wearing of cloth face masks.

Soon after the pandemic started Etsy crafters and large manufacturers alike began selling face masks in cute patterns and designs.

As the vaccine rolls out you might be wondering if it's the end of the hot new accessory.

Don't say goodbye to your face masks just yet. Even as health care systems begin to distribute COVID-19 vaccines it will take some time before everyone can be vaccinated against the illness.

The vaccine requires two doses to be effective. And experts don't yet know whether the shots prevent asymptomatic transmission as well as symptomatic disease.

Working from home

As social distancing guidelines quarantines and stay-at-home orders rolled out in March many American companies had to shift their workflow. Remote work from home became the norm for many offices and other non-essential businesses.

If you're among the remote workforce right now you may have been surprised at how well your office adapted this year.

The practice may carry into 2021 and beyond as employees outfit their homes for telecommuting and corporations realize the advantages of a dispersed workforce.

For one mobile work cuts operational costs by eliminating some brick and mortar building space. Also after months of working in pajamas surrounded by your pets many employees may not be so quick to embrace their business attire all over again.

According to a study by Slack a remote forum application company roughly one third of employees working remotely don't want to return to the office when the pandemic ends.

Sanitization

Since the first case of the virus businesses that remained open have adopted more stringent sanitization practices including increased cleaning schedules plexiglass shields separating workers from customers and ""sanitation stations"" offering wipes and hand sanitizer at the front of their stores.

Some businesses began offering this because local governments required it. Others did it as a courtesy to make their customers feel safe.

Now many customers have come to expect the new standards for cleanliness. As vaccines are just beginning to roll out the increased cleaning practices are likely to follow us into the new year.

The increase in sanitization extends to individuals as well. As demand outpaces supply Clorox wipes aren't expected to start staying in stock at retail stores until mid-2021 the company's Chief Operating Officer said Saturday.

Online shopping delivery and pickup

Remote consumerism has risen in tandem with remote work since March according to the United States Commerce Department.

To avoid exposure to COVID-19 more consumers shopped online and brick and mortar stores closed around the country as large retailers like JC Penny declared bankruptcy.

The National Retail Federation the largest retail trade association noted in March that nine in 10 consumers changed the way they shopped as a result of COVID-19 business disruptions.

More than half of respondents to the federation's survey said they'd purchased products online that they would normally buy in store.

Keeping with social distancing guidelines large chain stores and small restaurants alike began offering delivery and curbside pickup options for merchandise meals and even alcohol.

While the virus forced many consumers to turn to these shopping options the convenience may have created shopping habits that will be hard to shake once the pandemic is over according to a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Survey.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards a more digital world. The changes we make now will have lasting effects as the world economy begins to recover” said Conference Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi.

Nightlife and socializing

Quarantining and social distancing measures meant everyone's social lives took a hit in 2020. In Knox County curfews went into effect for bars and restaurants. Concerts and other events were cancelled or went virtual and movies set for release in theaters this year were cancelled or released for on-demand purchase instead.

With variable vaccine rollout it's likely these restrictions will carry over into 2021.

Play video content 12/26/20 @keyonharrold / Instagram

Miya Ponsetto is now in the crosshairs of authorities for her antics in an NYC hotel and TMZ has learned she also caused quite a fuss -- allegedly -- at the Peninsula hotel in Bev Hills back in February.

Miya and her mom Nicole apparently wore out their welcome when Peninsula staff ordered them to leave but they refused. Law enforcement sources tell us someone from the hotel called police told them the women looked drunk and refused to leave ... so Beverly Hills cops showed up to handle the situation.

Our law enforcement sources say when they arrived and tried to get Miya and Nicole to leave Nicole allegedly pushed and kicked a cop. Both women were arrested ... Nicole for battery on a police officer and being drunk in public. While Miya was arrested for being drunk in public. They have a court hearing later this month.

Now get this ... the L.A. County District Attorney charged both women on May 27 2020. The very next day Miya was arrested again this time for drunk driving. She pled no contest and was sentenced to 3 years probation 30 hours of community service and she must take a 9-month alcohol/drug counseling program.

As for the phone incident -- in case you don't know turns out she left her phone in an Uber -- seems Miya has a thing for phones -- her Etsy page is littered with custom phone cases she favors. Even if she's obsessed with phones it's no reason to flip out on 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. New York authorities are considering serious charges against her.

The $30 million (Shs111.9b) Afrexim Bank regional headquarters’ establishment in Kampala is an African financial institution formed by 50 states and private investors. The bank is expected to promote and finance trade within the African continent and trade between Africa and other continents.

In an interview yesterday Mr Patrick Bitature chairman Private Sector Foundation Uganda and a renowned businessman said: “Afrexim having foot prints in Kampala is good news that the continental bank will have a satellite regional home in Uganda.”

He said this brings decision makers nearer to the businesses giving the private sector here easier access to the bank.

“Uganda needs more pockets of money parked here. Nearly 80 per cent of the long-term funds are in South Africa Ivory Coast or Kenya. The good news should be spread around more equally” Mr Bitature said.

High rate

Responding to the 10 per cent interest rate the continental bank will be offering for long-term loans Mr Bitature said this is still relatively high in dollar terms.

“The rest of the world has been trading at four to five per cent since 2008. Interest rates are poised to increase now with USA leading the way. So we should expect a rise in the coming days” he said.

Dr Fred Muhumuza a Makerere University lecturer and economist says Afrexim is an international bank which follows member countries’ applications.

“If Ugandan firms don’t compete or qualify they may fail to comply much as the regional headquarters will be in Kampala” Mr Muhumuza shared.

Kampala City Traders’ Association (Kacita)’s chairman Mr Everest Kayondo said: “Afrexim offering 10 per cent interest rate is being offered by some local commercial banks in Uganda. So they will be doing nothing special but they shall only join the competition with the existing banks.”

He said if you are taking a loan in foreign exchange Afrexim will be offering alternative services like the existing banks.

“When you compare this rate with what the African Development Bank offers which staggers at about 2 and 3 per cent it makes Afrexim’s rate more expensive and not appealing” Mr Kayondo said.

“We have now settled on the location which is Wales Estate” Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo told Stabroek News as he explained that “the critical decisions regarding the geotechnical geophysical and the environmental studies that will advance the project have been made.”

Landing the gas project at Wales would also enable the rejuvenation of a community hard-hit by the closure of the sugar estate. The former APNU+AFC government was unable to provide alternatives after shuttering the estate at the end of 2016 and the new PPP/C government had floated the prospect of a development authority but without fleshing out the idea.

The Gas to Shore Project Advisory Committee which is led by former Chief Executive Officer of NICIL Winston Brassington and comprises other technical experts analyzed all options and past studies before advising on the choice.

Government had said that fiscal terms will also be an area focussed on and the committee would have analysed financial models to determine the best options. The gas would come from ExxonMobil’s Liza-1 well which has been in operation for a year and from which gas flaring has sparked severe environmental and other concerns.

“This is a project we are committed to and as a matter of fact we are hoping we can start the actual project – [the] laying of pipelines – from next year and maybe simultaneously build the power plant at the same time” Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat has said.

The PPP/C had campaigned on reducing electricity costs and pledged to “hit the ground running to reduce power costs with natural gas.”

Shortly after being sworn in and as he announced plans for the oil and gas sector Vice President Jagdeo reiterated the party’s position. He had also stated that his government has gathered that ExxonMobil was moving rapidly on the project but that the past APNU+AFC government had “put… roadblocks in this regard.”

“We have a couple of studies we are going through. We cannot look at what they didn’t do. We have to get it done and we want this done urgently. We have to be guided by the best technical minds but we want this project on the road as early as possible. In that engagement we will have to get the cost that is very different than is in the contract. The contract locks in a price for the first 300 to 400 megawatts of power. We need the electricity to generate [power for] this country and fulfill the promise that we will cut their electricity bill. This is a project of high priority we want to engage with Exxon… ExxonMobil is eager to move along and from what I gather is they have been waiting for government to show interest” Jagdeo had said.

But he added that environmental issues for all projects of the US oil major must be harnessed and government will “ensure that we have a commitment from ExxonMobil because all of these issues are interlinked a commitment that there will be adequate provisions for any environmental disaster in the contract and by Exxon. We have to satisfy ourselves that that is so. Flaring [from oil extraction] is a key issue and we have to deal with that. We have already signalled that we don’t want flaring. We don’t want flaring.”

Petroleum Advisor to the former APNU+AFC government Dr Jan Mangal has said that ExxonMobil would have already done an offshore survey of the sea bed so he believed it would not have been difficult after a location was determined and he believed that the West side of the Demerara River would have been the most ideal location.

“My suggestion was where the pipeline was going to land where we would need a small gas plant to treat the gas and then a large power plant to produce electricity we should also consider the development of a large industrial zone and provide cheap electricity.

It would attract industrial firms from Brazil and elsewhere and that industrial zone should be near to a new deep-water port. Hence there were many factors to be considered in choosing the site to land the pipeline and this was why we needed the comprehensive feasibility study.

“ I initially suspected the west side of the Demerara River would be one of the options to consider” he had added while pointing out that he never thought that as was suggested by the APNU+AFC government a location at Mahaicony would be suitable.

While identifying Clonbrook Mahaica on the East Coast of Demerara as the best location for bringing natural gas to shore for domestic use a 2017 desk study done for the APNU+AFC government had put the cost of doing this at US$304 million at least.

The desk study of the “Options Cost Economics Impacts and Key Considerations of Transporting and Utilizing Natural Gas from Offshore Guyana for the Generation of Electricity” was undertaken by a United Kingdom company Energy Narrative.

The study stated that the US$304 million cost would include US$165 million for the offshore pipeline US$43.5 million for a compression station and separation plant onshore and US$95.4 million for onshore pipelines to bring natural gas to power stations at Vreed-en-Hoop Kingston Garden of Eden and Canefield.

Comparing the cost to seven other locations the study notes “The offshore pipeline is estimated to cost between US$165 million and US$270 million to build depending on the size and landing site location. On shore compression and separation of the LPG is estimated to cost between US$43 million and US$114 million. Finally distributing the natural gas to the various electricity generation locations is estimated to cost between US$95 million and $127 million for the various proposed landing sites.”

Guyanese international attorney Melinda Janki has however argued that this country’s gas has no market value and maintains that several studies including those from the IDB would support her claim.

“The IMF the World Bank the IADB the European Investment Bank leading economists (e.g. former World Bank Chief Economists Lord Stern and Joseph Stiglitz) the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and a host of other financial and industry experts can all give you excellent reasons why Guyana should not touch gas” she said.

“The ‘associated gas’ is worthless. Esso would sell it if Esso could get money for it. ExxonMobil posted a loss earlier this year; they need money. But nobody wants to buy the gas. Last year the Inter-American Development Bank concluded that Latin America and the Caribbean is second only to the Middle East in un-burnable gas [and oil]. Guyana’s ‘associated gas’ has no market value. It is already a stranded fossil fuel asset. Guyana should leave the gas right where it is – as Esso’s problem” she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzZGFpbHlhZnJpY2EuY29tL2JkL2JyaWVmcy1wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9vaWxpYnlhLXJlYnJhbmRzLXRvLW9sYS1lbmVyZ3ktMjIyOTQyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OiLibya rebrands to Ola Energy,"Oil marketer Libya Oil Kenya Limited (LOKL) which operates under the trade name OiLibya has rebranded to Ola Energy.

The oil marketer said its new brand will be affected on all its outlets in the 17 countries across Africa where it has market presence.

Ola Energy Kenya general manager Duncan Murashiki said the rebranding was part of the firm’s expansion strategy with more fuel stations expected to opened across the country.

“By the end of 2019 we expect to have more than 100 stations in Kenya with more resources being dedicated into our lubricant market as well as Liquefied Petroleum Gas

Ola Energy which is the local subsidiary of Tamoil Africa Holdings Limited (TAHL) retained its Libyan roots in the rebranding as the new name means Oil Libya Africa.

Fully owned

TAHL group is fully owned by the government of Libya through the Libyan-African Investment Portfolio (LAP) a government agency set up in 2006 to spearhead a $5 billion investment plan in Africa.

TAHL made its debut in the petroleum distribution and marketing business in Kenya in December 2006 after signing an agreement with ExxonMobil Corporation.

The firm did not readily disclose how much it will spend to brand its 1100 stations spread in 17 African countries but its regional board chairman Elmarimi Kashim said they will be keen to gradually phase out the OiLibya tag during the transition expected to be completed by mid 2020.

“You still see a little symbol of OiLibya in our stations as we transit because it’s a brand we have built and we don’t want anyone to imagine were a new company with no experience in this market” Mr Kashim said.",,,,,,

The Covid-19 pandemic has been brutal for U.S. airlines and significant relief isn't expected until the second half of 2021.

U.S. carriers' 2020 net losses likely topped $35 billion according to analyst estimates provided by FactSet. That includes what's expected to be Southwest Airlines ' first annual loss in more than four decades.

The pandemic ended a decade of profits that the historically boom-and-bust industry enjoyed until 2020 a stretch during which they hired tens of thousands of workers bought new planes and expanded their networks.

Airline stocks in 2020 dropped the most in years. American Airlines ' share price lost 45% its biggest percentage decline since before the carrier's 2013 merger with US Airways. Delta Air Lines ' stock lost 31% while United Airlines fell 51% over the last 12 months its biggest drop since 2008. Southwest shed 14%. The S&P 500 meanwhile rose by more than 16% in 2020.

The pandemic forced carriers to quickly shrink cut routes and park hundreds of jets. U.S. carriers' increased their total debt by $67 billion in 2020 to more than $172 billion to weather the crisis according to trade group Airlines for America. Paying that down will be a headwind over the next several years.

The good news is air travel demand has recovered a lot of ground compared with the volumes hit early in the pandemic. On April 16 the Transportation Security Administration screened 95085 people at U.S. airports less than 4% of the 2.6 million people that had passed through those checkpoints a year earlier. TSA airport screenings fueled in part by the yearend holidays surpassed 1 million people a day in the last five days through Wednesday though that's still down about 45% from a year earlier.

With lucrative business and international travel largely sidelined leisure travel became the most important market.

Airlines are expected to trim their losses and in some cases — including Southwest Delta Alaska — turn profitable next year according to analysts' estimates. Authorization of coronavirus vaccines has helped boost optimism about future travel demand though it isn't yet clear when more of the public will resume flying.

""Our mission of connecting the world has been reaffirmed by the events of the past year but we don't yet know what travel demand is going to look like when it rebounds"" said Delta's CEO Ed Bastian in an employee note on New Year's Day. ""Simply re-creating the Delta from 2019 won't be an option; our customers will give us the blueprint for the Delta of 2021 and beyond.""

Bastian reiterated that Delta expects the airline to turn cash-flow positive in the spring.

Airline executives have recently warned that they expect difficult months ahead as they pushed out targets for when they will break even and say they will continue to operate limited capacity to match weak demand. American Airlines President Robert Isom earlier this week said the carrier's January and February capacity will likely be 45% of 2019 levels.

Many potential customers are still not flying as coronavirus infections rise to ever higher records new travel restrictions are implemented and government officials recommend avoiding travel to slow the spread of the disease.

U.S. officials last week said all passengers must test negative for Covid-19 before flying to the United States after a highly contagious strain of the disease was detected in the U.K. though it has also been identified in California and Colorado.

Carriers recently won $15 billion in additional payroll support in the latest coronavirus relief package that President Donald Trump signed Sunday. That requires airlines to keep employees on staff through March 31 and to call back more than 30000 workers they furloughed when the terms of last package which was $25 billion expired on Oct. 1.

United Airlines executives said they expect it will be temporary.

""The truth is we just don't see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months"" CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart said in a Dec. 21 employee note. ""That is why we expect the recall will be temporary.""",,,,,,,,,

Pacioni announced Wednesday that her Consumer Protection Unit — along with the San Diego County District Attorney’s office and the Stanislaus County District Attorney’s office — has entered into a final stipulated judgment with Minnesota-based Fastenal Company regarding allegations that it charged walk-in retail customers undisclosed “shipping and handling” fees.

Fastenal sells industrial and construction supplies at its 138 retail facilities in California. Many of these stores are open to the public for walk-in sales including at its branch stores in Seaside Salinas and Soledad.

Since at least 2015 prosecutors alleged Fastenal sold certain in-stock goods to customers at these stores without disclosing that it was adding “shipping and handling” surcharges for these products in violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law.

The prosecutors alleged that Fastenal further failed to provide customer-facing screens that display the prices of goods and surcharges as they are scanned as required by section 13300 of the Business and Professions Code preventing customers from noticing the surcharges prior to payment.

At the time of these violations Fastenal was under a permanent injunction not to intentionally engage in these same acts within California.

On Sept. 13 2011 the California Superior Court for the County of San Diego entered a stipulated judgment against Fastenal Company in a similar public enforcement action by the People of the State of California which enjoined Fastenal Company from these violations and from otherwise engaging in false advertising or unfair competition.

Pursuant to the stipulated judgment in this current case Fastenal Company must pay $625000 in investigative costs and civil penalties plus $25000 in cy pres restitution to the California Consumer Protection Prosecution Trust Fund. Fastenal is also ordered to establish and maintain an audit program and an employee training program to ensure future compliance. The stipulated judgment includes a new permanent injunction that enjoins Fastenal from intentionally engaging in similar violations in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Even when pandemic-avoidance measures were loosened over the summer and many workplaces filled back up the 81000-square-foot building remained dark. Then in November the Jacksonville Florida-based company announced that the staff would continue to work remotely and that the Durango building — the largest of its kind in town — would close for good.

This phenomenon — one-time cubicle workers becoming full-time telecommuters liberated from corporate headquarters — deprived Durango of one of its largest private employers and has driven up office vacancy rates nationwide. Yet at the same time it is also fueling housing booms in so-called “Zoom towns” Durango included as the born-again remote workers seek out more desirable areas.

The telecommuter-migration is just one of many reasons behind the current real estate craze. Rock-bottom interest rates have also contributed along with wealthy investors seeking refuges during tumultuous times. “It’s clear that many buyers are being driven out of large cities by both COVID-19 and civil unrest” wrote the authors of the Jackson Hole Report regarding the recent uptick in homes priced over $3 million. “Most have been contemplating a move for some time and felt that now was the right time.”

The Zoom economy has come at Durango from two directions. The housing market went berserk in the third quarter of 2020 and the median home price shot up to about twice the amount that a median-income earner could afford. Meanwhile economic development officials are trying to figure out what to do with a giant empty office building. One option: Convert it into affordable housing.

(WMC) - “In transit.” Two words that frustrate Mid-South postal service customers still waiting for holiday packages to arrive.

“Neither rain nor snow nor heat nor gloom of night” can stop the post office from delivering says the old saying. But that expression was adopted in 1914 long before COVID-19 and shopping on the web which proved to be a one-two punch that KO’d the US Postal Service in 2020.

At the Mail Center in Midtown Memphis owner Mark Weber said they’re tracking the delays.

“We can see through the packages that we ship” said Weber “that some of those packages are behind as much as two to three weeks.”

He said with an unprecedented number of packages being shipped this year the United States Postal Service faced an impossible challenge.

“FedEx and UPS can limit their volume he said “but the post office cannot. So if somebody calls and says we have 1000 packages that we couldn’t give to FedEx or UPS they give them to the post office and they have to take them.”

Between the COVID-19 pandemic and record online shopping this holiday season shipping software developer Ship Matrix said more than 2 million packages a day got delayed. Dozens of WMC Action News 5 viewers expressed their shipping struggles on social media:

Jamie said: “I’m still waiting on a package I ordered at the end of November.”

Rex said he’s “had a delivery stuck in Raleigh since December 22nd.”

And Dave said: “I’ve had two packages in Memphis since December 13th and I’ve gotten two emails about COVID from the USPS.”

In a statement sent to WMC Action News 5 Susan W. Wright the spokesperson for USPS in Memphis said “we delivered a record amount of packages this holiday season in the midst of the pandemic which significantly impacted our workforce availability. We will continue to work around the clock to deliver all packages and mail entered into our system.”

USPS hired more seasonal workers and expanded Sunday delivery and Christmas delivery to try and meet the demand. But there weren’t enough aircraft trucks or employees to handle the volume of mail. A national union rep told CNN more than 18-thousand postal employees are out every day in quarantine. The people needed to sort and deliver packages simply aren’t there.

In a tweet to WMC Heather said she understands: “I mailed one package on December 1st. No update since December 26th. And I don’t blame the postal workers!”

“They’re all doing the best they can to get your package where it’s supposed to go” said Weber. “Nobody wants your package not to get there.”

Weber said their peak day was Dec. 14 and it’s usually the 19. So people got their gifts in the mail earlier this year. But with a record 3 billion packages shipped this holiday season the volume was simply overwhelming.

(UMSL/Mundelein Seminary)

The Christmas star shining over Mundelein Illinois this season was the sun as a 300-kilowatt solar energy project went into commercial operation Dec. 25 on the campus of the University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary. The project was inspired by Pope Francis' encyclical ""Laudato Si' on Care for Our Common Home"" as well as by Cardinal Blase Cupich who as leader of the Chicago Archdiocese has stressed the importance of energy efficiency university president and seminary rector Fr. John Kartje told EarthBeat. It is the first solar energy generating plant on a U.S. Catholic seminary campus and the first in the Chicago Archdiocese according to a statement from the university. Because the once-rural campus includes some 1300 acres of land and solar technology has become both more economical and more efficient Kartje and other administrators decided to look seriously at the possibility that the school could generate some of its own power. The solar array which took about a year to plan and build will generate 20-25% of the kilowatt hours of electricity that the university and seminary use. It is expected to recover the initial $800000 investment in fewer than 10 years and it will save the school $1 million in energy costs over the next 35 years according to David Brochu CEO of PureGen Power a local solar energy development firm that provided the technical expertise for the project. For Brochu who usually builds much larger projects the 5-acre project at Mundelein was a way of ""doing something good for the Earth"" while supporting the seminary where he and his wife are benefactors and have participated in spiritual formation and other activities. ""Using solar or renewable energy ... and decreasing the amount of energy consumed [that is generated] by fossil fuels is in alignment with parts of [the pope's] encyclical"" he said.

Among other things Laudato Si' calls for ""developing renewable and less polluting forms of energy"" and ""encouraging a more efficient use of energy.""

A mechanical engineer who has been working in the solar energy field since 2007 Brochu took the lead in bringing together a group of investors who were supportive of the seminary as well as in planning and design obtaining the necessary permits and overseeing installation. The Mundelein project takes advantage of ""Illinois Shines"" a state-managed incentive program that provides credits for solar energy systems. Program participants can either install a solar energy system on their own property to offset their energy use as Mundelein did or subscribe to a community solar project in exchange for a share of the electricity it generates. In Mundelein's case the utility company buys back the credits from a group of investors who formed a limited liability company USML Laudato Si' Solar which takes its name from the university and the encyclical. That company owns the solar energy system leasing the land from the university. In turn it sells the electricity generated by the solar array to the seminary at a discounted rate. The university eventually will take ownership of the facility. ""What it allows us to do is build a solar power plant and sell the electricity back to the university so that they save money over the life of the project"" Brochu told EarthBeat. The strategy of recruiting investors allowed the university and seminary to avoid paying the up-front costs in a lump. ""Eight hundred thousand dollars would be a lot of money for the university"" Brochu said. ""Doing it this way where you use a third party and outside investment you still have to pay for the electricity from the solar plant but it should be less expensive than what you're paying the local utility.""

The campus will draw energy from the system during the day supplementing it with electricity from the conventional grid if necessary. It will also draw from the conventional grid at night. On a very sunny day excess energy that is generated can be exported to the grid further offsetting costs under the metering system used in Illinois.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvMi8yMjIxMDY2Ny9zb2xhcndpbmRzLWhhY2std29yc2UtZ292ZXJubWVudC1taWNyb3NvZnQtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SolarWinds hack may be much worse than originally feared,"The Russia-linked SolarWinds hack which targeted US government agencies and private corporations may be even worse than officials first realized with some 250 federal agencies and business now believed affected the New York Times reported.

Microsoft has said the hackers compromised SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring and management software allowing them to “impersonate any of the organization’s existing users and accounts including highly privileged accounts.” The Times reports that Russia exploited layers of the supply chain to access the agencies’ systems.

The Times reports that early warning sensors that Cyber Command and the NSA placed inside foreign networks to detect potential attacks appear to have failed in this instance. In addition it seems likely that the US government’s attention on protecting the November elections from foreign hackers may have taken resources and focus away from the software supply chain according to the Times. And conducting the attack from within the US apparently allowed the hackers to evade detection by the Department of Homeland Security.

Microsoft said earlier this week it had discovered its systems were infiltrated “beyond just the presence of malicious SolarWinds code.” The hackers were able to “view source code in a number of source code repositories” but the hacked account granting the access didn’t have permission to modify any code or systems. However in a small bit of good news Microsoft said it found “no evidence of access to production services or customer data” and “no indications that our systems were used to attack others.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDM4MDkyWDIwMzExODkw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Calculating molten-salt central-receiver lifetime under creep-fatigue damage,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038092X20311890 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDM4MDkyWDIwMzExODkw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhza3kub3JnL3NwYWNlL2phbi0xLTE4MDEtZGlzY292ZXJ5LW9mLWNlcmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,220 years ago today: Ceres 1st asteroid discovered,"On January 1 1801 the Italian priest mathematician and astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the first asteroid now called Ceres. It orbits in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. These days Ceres is no longer classified as an asteroid however. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union decided Ceres was big enough to be designated a dwarf planet. Ceres became the first-ever dwarf planet to be orbited by a spacecraft from 2015 to 2018 when NASA’s Dawn mission peered down at Ceres and unlocked some of its mysteries.

EarthSky 2021 lunar calendars are still in stock but going fast. Order now!

The story of the discovery of Ceres goes back to German astronomer Johannes Kepler and to Tycho Brahe a Danish nobleman and inveterate night sky observer in the 1500s. When Kepler obtained Tycho’s astronomical data he searched it for the explanation behind the motion of the planets in particular Mars’ retrograde motion. This work led Kepler to what is one of his most praised discoveries what we today know as Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion.

However Kepler’s analysis also led him to discover something else. He noticed an unusually large empty area between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. This gap combined with his realization of the regularity of the planets’ orbits provoked Kepler to assert there must be something in the gap. He thought it might be an undiscovered planet and famously wrote:

Between Jupiter and Mars I place a planet.

Kepler wasn’t the only one to notice this strange gap. At the beginning of the 18th century Johann Titius a Prussian astronomer stated a relationship between the planet’s orbital distances from the sun later popularized by German astronomer Johann Bode today called the Titius-Bode Law. Briefly … begin with a 0 and then 3 and then double each subsequent number. If you do that you get a series: 0 3 6 12 24 48 etc. Then add 4 and divide by 10 and you get (more or less) the distances in astronomical units (AU) to the major planets of our solar system: 0.4 0.7 1.0 1.6 2.8 5.2 and so on. But notice that 2.8 AU. It corresponds to the distance of the space between Mars and Jupiter.

But still nobody thought much about a possible planet between Mars and Jupiter until 1781 when William Herschel accidentally discovered a new planet – the first one found since humans began gazing at the sky – which we now call Uranus. Its distance from the sun was close to the one predicted by Titius-Bode.

And so the search was on! By the end of the 18th century a group of astronomers who called themselves the Celestial Police took on the task of finding out what lay in the gap between Mars and Jupiter.

Giuseppe Piazzi was supposed to be one of the members but before he received his invitation he had already discovered Ceres in early 1801. At first he thought the small spot he was seeing was just a dim star not included in his chart. On the next day however Piazzi saw that it had moved and therefore could not be a star. Illness and unfavorable weather prevented Piazzi from observing his new finding for a few nights. But by January 24 1801 – by tracking its motion in front of the stars and thereby calculating its distance – he was certain the object was a member of our own solar system.

It was of course hailed as the missing planet! Piazzi named it Ceres after the Roman goddess of agriculture fertility and harvest. Soon though other astronomers began finding similar bodies at Ceres’ approximate distance from the sun. German physician and astronomer Heinrich Olbers discovered the asteroid Pallas in 1802 and Vesta in 1807.

The Titius-Bode Law was disproved in 1846 with the discovery of Neptune whose distance is much closer than predicted by this law. Today astronomers still can’t explain why it seemed to work at first; most regard it as a coincidence.

Fast forward to 2006. The IAU designated Pluto Ceres and Eris as dwarf planets. A year later NASA launched the Dawn spacecraft the first spacecraft ever with two destinations to explore: first Vesta (which it orbited in 2011 and 2012) and then Ceres (which it orbited from 2015 to 2018).

Therefore Ceres has been “discovered” a second time as a wealth of data about the dwarf planet poured in from Dawn. We’ve learned that organics exist on Ceres such as those found near Emutet Crater. We discovered bright spots of salt deposits water in shadowed craters and under the surface plus a volcano that might be responsible for recent geologic activity. You can read more about Dawn’s discoveries at NASA’s dedicated mission page.

Bottom line: Ceres the first asteroid to be discovered on January 1 1801 is now known as a dwarf planet and has revealed many of its secrets to NASA’s Dawn spacecraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL2EtaGFydmFyZC1wcm9mZXNzb3Itc2F5cy1hbi1hbGllbi12aXNpdGVkLWluLTIwMTcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Harvard professor says an alien visited in 2017 — and more are coming,"When the first sign of intelligent life visits us from space it won’t be a giant saucer hovering over New York. More likely it will be an alien civilization’s trash.

Avi Loeb chair of Harvard’s Department of Astronomy believes he’s already found some of that garbage.

In his upcoming book “Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) out Jan. 26 the professor lays out a compelling case for why an object that recently wandered into our solar system was not just another rock but actually a piece of alien technology.

The object in question traveled toward our solar system from the direction of Vega a nearby star 25 light-years away and intercepted our solar system’s orbital plane on Sept. 6 2017.

On Sept. 9 its trajectory brought it closest to the sun. At the end of September it blasted at about 58900 miles per hour past Venus’ orbital distance and then on Oct. 7 it shot past Earth’s before “moving swiftly toward the constellation Pegasus and the blackness beyond” Loeb writes in the book.

The object was first spotted by an observatory in Hawaii containing the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) — the highest-definition telescope on Earth.

The space object was dubbed ‘Oumuamua (pronounced “oh moo ah moo ah”) which is Hawaiian for — roughly — “scout.”

As space travelers go it was relatively small at just about 100 yards long but it was a big deal in the scientific community.

For starters it was the first interstellar object ever detected inside our solar system. Judging from the object’s trajectory astronomers concluded it was not bound by the sun’s gravity — which suggested it was just traveling through.

No crisp photos could be taken but astronomers were able to train their telescopes on the object for 11 days collecting reams of other data.

At first scientists thought it was an ordinary comet. But Loeb said that assumption ran the risk of allowing “the familiar to define what we might discover.”

“What would happen if a caveman saw a cellphone?” he asked. “He’s seen rocks all his life and he would have thought it was just a shiny rock.”

Loeb soon opened his mind to another possibility: It was not a comet but discarded tech from an alien civilization.

A number of unusual properties about the object helped Loeb make this conclusion.

First were ‘Oumuamua’s dimensions.

Astronomers looked at the way the object reflected sunlight. Its brightness varied tenfold every eight hours suggesting that was the amount of time it took for it to complete a full rotation.

Scientists concluded the object was at least five to 10 times longer than it was wide — sort of like the shape of a cigar.

No naturally occurring space body we’ve ever seen has looked like it — or even close.

“This would make ‘Oumuamua’s geometry more extreme by at least a few times in aspect ratio — or its width to its height — than the most extreme asteroids or comets that we have ever seen” Loeb writes in his book.

What’s more ‘Oumuamua was unusually bright. It was at least “ten times more reflective than typical solar system [stony] asteroids or comets” the author writes.

He likens its surface to that of shiny metal.

But the anomaly that really pushed Loeb toward his ET hypothesis was the way ‘Oumuamua moved.

“The excess push away from the sun — that was the thing that broke the camel’s back” he said.

Using physics scientists can calculate the exact path an object should take and what speed it should travel due to the gravitational force exerted by the sun. The sun’s pull will speed up an object massively as it gets closer then kick it out the other side only for the object to slow considerably as it gets farther away.

But ‘Oumuamua didn’t follow this calculated trajectory. The object in fact accelerated “slightly but to a highly statistically significant extent” Loeb writes as it moved away from the sun.

In other words it was clearly being pushed by a force besides the sun’s gravity.

At first the explanation seemed simple. Comets show a similar acceleration because as they approach the sun their surface is warmed releasing once-frozen gases which act like a rocket engine.

Those released materials however form a comet’s distinctive tail. Scientists looked carefully for that tail or any sign of gases or dust that might propel ‘Oumuamua and came up empty.

Loeb calculated that with these and other anomalies the chances that ‘Oumuamua was some random comet was around 1 in a quadrillion leading him to his blockbuster hypothesis.

But what was it exactly?

One possibility weirdly enough could be found in technology we already have here on Earth.

Some 400 years ago astronomer Johannes Kepler observed comet tails blowing in what looked like a solar breeze and wondered if that same force could propel rocket ships through space like the wind pushes boats through water.

It was a smart idea that scientists now use to develop light sails for probes. Thin reflective sheeting is unfurled in space to capture the particles streaming off the sun propelling a ship at great speeds through the empty void. Alternatively powerful lasers from Earth could be aimed at the sail to make it go even faster.

Loeb who is involved in a light-sail project to send a tiny unmanned craft to a nearby star said if we Earthlings have thought of this idea then why couldn’t aliens?

He and a colleague crunched the numbers and hypothesized that ‘Oumuamua was not actually cigar-shaped but possibly a disk less than a millimeter thick with sail-like proportions that would account for its unusual acceleration as it moved away from the sun.

As to its purpose Loeb isn’t entirely sure. He speculated it could be “space junk” that once served as a kind of space navigation buoy used by a long-ago civilization.

“The only way to look for [alien civilizations] is to look for their trash like investigative journalists who look through celebrities’ trash” Loeb said.

Of course not everyone in the scientific community agrees with his theory.

In July 2019 the ‘Oumuamua Team of the International Space Science Institute published an article in Nature Astronomy concluding “We find no compelling evidence to favor an alien explanation for ‘Oumuamua.”

Loeb admits his theories have raised astronomers’ eyebrows but he is resolute about his findings. “Some people do not want to discuss the possibility that there are other civilizations out there” he told The Post. “They believe we are special and unique. I think it’s a prejudice that should be abandoned.”

‘Some people do not want to discuss the possibility that there are other civilizations out there.’ Avi Loeb Harvard astronomer and author of “Extraterrestrial”

Loeb said the skeptics are bending over backwards to assign natural origins to the object and that the explanations they’ve given to explain its weird properties don’t stand up to scrutiny.

For example some scientists have suggested that ‘Oumuamua’s acceleration was caused by frozen hydrogen on its surface turning to gas and driving it like a comet and that hydrogen would have been invisible to Earth’s infrared cameras which is why we didn’t detect it.

But Loeb and a colleague published a paper showing that “a hydrogen iceberg traveling through interstellar space would evaporate long before it reached our solar system.”

Whatever the truth the stakes are high.

The acceptance that an alien race has made contact — even through its trash — would trigger a serious search for more trash leading us to scour the moon and Mars for example for debris that might have crash-landed thousands or millions of years ago.

And if more evidence is found we Earthlings would have to start building tools to help us grapple with extraterrestrials such as space treaties and academic fields like astro-linguistics and astro-economics.

But perhaps more important any further discoveries could redefine our place in the universe.

“It would put us in perspective” Loeb said. “If we are not alone are we the smartest kids on the block? If there was a species that eliminated itself through war or changing the climate we can get our act together and behave better. Instead we are wasting a lot of resources on Earth fighting each other and other negative things that are a big waste.”

Since ‘Oumuamua’s appearance a second interstellar object known as 2I/Borisov was spotted entering the solar system by a Crimean telescope in 2019. But that turned out to be a plain old comet.

Until recently our instruments have not been sensitive enough to pick up these kinds of visitors. But Loeb said technology will soon make it possible to locate more space travelers and the only way the mystery of ‘Oumuamua will be settled is if a similar object is spotted and more thoroughly investigated with a probe.

He said his book “should motivate people to collect more data on the next object that looks weird.”

“If we find another and we take a photo and it looks like a light sail I don’t think anyone will argue with that.”"

Chicago hasn’t beaten Milwaukee since Dec. 26 2017 and on paper didn’t look to have much of a chance to break that streak in their first matchup of the season. Chicago came into the game as one of the league’s worst defensive teams were playing in the second night of a back-to-back and were missing four players due to league health and safety protocols.

The Bucks (3-3) quickly took advantage of the circumstances – and a rebuilding Bulls team (2-4) – with Giannis Antetokounmpo creating offense as the two-time reigning most valuable player handed out three assists and scored six points in an early 21-3 run that gave the Bucks a 27-21 first quarter lead.

In the decisive second quarter Antetokounmpo handed out another three assists – all on three-pointers – and the Bucks ended the period on a 15-2 run to take a 60-42 lead going into the break.

In the opening half Antetokounmpo had 11 points seven rebounds and seven assists giving him a chance at being the first Buck since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to post back-to-back triple doubles. Abdul-Jabbar accomplished the feat in 1973.

BOX SCORE: Bucks 126 Bulls 96

""Not necessarily this game but previous games I've seen a lot of bodies in front of me I see the defense moving with me and the only to break them down is by passing the ball finding my teammates"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Obviously I want to be aggressive obviously I want to get in the paint...But at the end of the day I think my teammate are open and I think in the long run it’s going to help me find my teammates and facilitate for the team when I have to.”

Milwaukee shot 50% from the three-point line (12 for 24) in the opening half including a 3-of-4 showing from Donte DiVincenczo. His 11 points marked the sixth straight game he reached double figures in scoring a career-best stretch.

The hot shooting from distance and Antetokounmpo’s dominance continued into the third quarter when the Bucks pushed their lead to as many as 31 points. The Bucks went 7 for 12 from beyond the three-point line and Antetokounmpo scored 15 points.

The fourth was much of the same with the Bucks hitting two more early three-pointers and Antetokounmpo imposing his will. Antetokounmpo scored four points and had an assist before the starter’s night ended with 9 minutes 27 seconds left in the game and the Bucks up 108-80.

He finished just two assists shy of matching Abdul-Jabbar's accomplishment with 29 points 12 rebounds and eight assists. He added two blocks and two steals.

""It always starts with Giannis attacking in transition and hopefully spacing well around that attack and him reading the defense and finding shooters"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said of Antetokounmpo's passing. ""He's worked as the pick-and-roll ball handler a little bit more. He's certainly taking advantage of guys who can get shots and create shots out of the pick and roll.""

Bryn Forbes (18 points) Khris Middleton (14) Bobby Portis (13 points 12 rebounds) Jrue Holiday (11) Pat Connaughton (11) and DiVincenzo (11) all finished in double figures for the Bucks.

Forbes went 4 for 6 from the three-point line and is shooting 50% from distance over the last three games.

""I think it took some time to get acclimated"" he said. ""New system new players new coach. It took awhile just to find my groove and where I fit in on this team. They've got confidence in me and playing with guys like Giannis and Khris makes my job easy. I just had to find my place in there.""

The Bulls were led by Zach LaVine who had 16 points and six rebounds. Denzel Valentine added 14 points for Chicago.

Friday was the third time in six games the Bucks made at least 20 three-pointers a feat they accomplished just twice all of last season. They finished with 22.

“I’m not sure what it starts with – the ball moving and passing or good shooters"" Budenholzer said. ""We feel like we’ve added a little more shooting depth more guys that can make shots.""

The Bulls came into the game without starting forward Lauri Markkanen key reserve Tomáš Satoranský and bench players Chandler Hutchison and Ryan Arcidiacono after the quartet were placed in the league’s health and safety protocol before they played Washington on Thursday. They did not travel to Milwaukee.

The Bulls are the first team the Bucks have faced this season that had players removed from action for safety reasons after beginning play outside of the bubble format.

“We’ve seen a few teams have to deal with multiple players being held out for safety and protocol procedures and each time you see that I guess you’re first probably mindful that it’s not your team and your group and it just reminds you to stay diligent” Budenholzer said before the game. “The league has always taken our health and safety with a real priority and is going to continue to make that paramount to the success of the season and make sure that nothing serious happens to any team or any player.”

Craig out after surgery

Bucks forward Torrey Craig will miss several weeks following surgery Thursday to repair fractures in his nose suffered in the game against New York on Dec. 27. Craig a free agent acquisition from Denver had played less than seven minutes in two games before being hurt late in the Bucks’ loss to the Knicks.

Craig 30 suffered a broken nose in 2019 as well when playing for the Nuggets.

He is expected to resume contact activity in two weeks and then will ramp up his activity after that.",,,,,,,,,

The two companies determined that they will not complete a previously announced automotive joint venture between their respective companies.

The decision follows the passing of the December 31 2020 'longstop' or expiration date of a definitive agreement the organisations entered into in October 2019 Ford Motor Company said in a statement.

The outcome was driven by fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions – caused in part by the pandemic – over the past 15 months. Those changes influenced separate decisions by Ford and Mahindra to reassess their respective capital allocation priorities it added.

Ford further said its ""independent operations in India will continue as is"".

""The company is actively evaluating its businesses around the world including in India making choices and allocating capital in ways that advance Ford's plan to achieve an 8 per cent company adjusted EBIT margin and generate consistently strong adjusted free cash flow"" Ford Motor Co said.

Ford's plan calls for developing and delivering high-quality high-value connected vehicles – increasingly electric vehicles – and services that are affordable to an even broader range of customers and profitable for Ford it added.

The company said it is moving quickly to turn around its automotive business – competing like a challenger while simplifying and modernising all aspects of the company.

Also it plans to ""grow by capitalising on existing strengths disrupting the conventional automotive business and partnering with others to gain expertise and efficiency"".

In October 2019 the two companies had announced an agreement under which Mahindra & Mahindra would acquire majority stake in a wholly-owned arm of Ford Motor Co (FMC) that will take over the automotive business of the US auto major in India.

The new entity was to develop the market and distribute Ford brand vehicles in India while also selling both - Mahindra and Ford - cars in the high-growth emerging markets.

As part of the agreement M&M was to acquire 51 per cent stake in a wholly-owned arm of the US auto major -- Ardour Automotive Private Ltd presently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company Inc USA for around ₹657 crore. The balance 49 per cent equity shareholding in Ardour was to be held by FMC and/or any of its affiliates.

The new venture was also envisaged to acquire the automotive business of Ford India Pvt Ltd (FIPL) a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMC that has been engaged in the automotive business in India since 1995.

The automotive business to be acquired includes vehicle manufacturing plants of Ford India at Chennai and Sanand but excluded the separate powertrain facility in Sanand which is essentially used for FMC's global markets and the powertrain division of FIPL also did not form part of the deal.

The origins of more than 50 carmakers are charted here.

Karl Benz built the first car in 1885 and since then many thousands of companies have sprung up trying to make a name for themselves.

But few have survived and here we take a look at how some of those survivors. Sometimes things are a lot more convoluted than you think though with some companies claiming two (or even three) first cars…

Mercedes-Benz (1886)

This is where it all started – the first company to build a car. Karl Benz built his first car in 1885 and he patented it in January 1886 but the Mercedes name wouldn't be adopted until 1901. That first car (called the Patent Motorwagen pictured here) had just three wheels and a 0.75hp 954cc single-cylinder engine but in 1893 Benz built his first four-wheeler the Viktoria powered by a 3hp 1745cc engine.

Peugeot (1891)

Peugeot started out in 1842 making salt and pepper grinders before moving into bicycle production 40 years later. Then in 1891 Peugeot built its first car a four-wheeled machine with a rear-mounted V-twin engine driving the rear wheels via a chain. Just five cars were made in that first year but this grew to 29 in 1892. By 1900 Peugeot production was up to 500 cars in one year.

Ford (1896)

Henry Ford built his first experimental car in 1896. Known as the Ford Quadricycle the vehicle would remain a one-off. By 1899 Ford had set up the Detroit Automobile Company which in 1901 was renamed the Henry Ford Company. Within a year Ford had fallen out with his financial backers and he left to set up a new venture in 1903 – the Ford Motor Company.

Renault (1898)

Louis Marcel and Fernand Renault set up Société Renault Freres in 1899 having already built a prototype 1CV voiturette the previous year. Capable of 32kph the Type A got an annual facelift until it went out of production in 1903 by which point it was fitted with a 5hp engine in place of the original 1hp unit.

Fiat (1899)

Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino was founded in 1899 and its first factory opened in 1900; that year just 24 cars were made. The company's first model was the 4HP which was initially fitted with a 679cc flat-twin engine; later cars got an 837cc unit. Fiat started out with just 35 employees; by 1908 it had 2700 people on the payroll and was capable of producing 5000 cars each year.

Opel (1899)

Adam Opel set up a company in 1862 to make sewing machines before diversifying into bicycles in 1886. He died in 1895 but his widow and five sons continued the business introducing their first car in 1899. The engine was a 1545cc 3.5hp single-cylinder unit and buyers could choose from two- or four-seat editions but the car didn't sell well; just 11 found buyers in 1899 and 24 in 1900. Opel became part of General Motors in 1931 which then sold the company to PSA in 2017.

Buick (1899)

America's oldest surviving car maker Buick was founded in 1899 which is when it produced its first car – although it didn't make a second until the following year with the third coming in 1903. Initially named the Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company series production didn't start until 1904; a year later the company was renamed the Buick Motor Company. That first car was the Model B (pictured here) with a 2605cc flat-twin engine rated at 16hp. By the end of the year Buick had sold 37 cars but by 1908 annual production had mushroomed to 8800.

Oldsmobile (1901)

Ransom Eli Olds built a series of experimental and prototype cars in the late 19th century before launching his first production car in 1901: the snappily named Oldsmobile Curved-Dash Runabout which featured a 1565cc single-cylinder engine a two-speed gearbox and chain drive. Despite anything Ford might have to say on the subject it was Oldsmobile that was the first to offer a mass-produced car with 425 Runabouts rolling off the production lines in the first year – a figure that jumped to 2100 in 1902.

Cadillac (1902)

When Cadillac was incorporated in 1902 by Henry Leland to make affordable cars for the masses his initial offering was the Runabout retrospectively named the Model A which was facelifted in 1904 to become the Model B. Power (all 10hp of it) came from a 1609cc single-cylinder engine mounted under the rear seat.

Ford (1903)

The Ford Motor Company's first product was the Model A which went on sale in July 1903 and by the time production ended in October 1904 an impressive 670 examples had been made. Pictured is Henry Ford's great grandson Bill Ford Junior with the world's oldest surviving Model A built in 1903 – he bought the car for USD 264000 (nearly Rs 2 crore) in 2012. The Model A featured a 1645cc flat-twin engine mounted under the rear seat a two-speed transmission and chain drive.

Rolls-Royce (1904)

Engineer Henry Royce built his first car in 1904 just a month before he met the wealthy aristocrat Charles Rolls by chance. The latter had seen the Royce in action and said to its maker that he would take every car that Royce could make as long as it also had his name on it too. By December 1904 the first Rolls-Royce was ready although Rolls-Royce Ltd wouldn't be founded until 1906.

That first car was fitted with a two-cylinder 1809cc engine but by the end of 1906 Rolls-Royce had already built its first car with an eight-cylinder engine.

Rover (1904)

When Rover created its Safety Bicycle in 1885 it created the modern template for the pushbike. Next came motorcycles (in 1902) then in 1904 Rover built its first car the two-seater Rover Eight. In production right the way through until 1912 the Eight was fitted with a 1327cc single-cylinder engine that developed a decently gutsy 8hp at 900rpm but the engine was red-lined at a screaming 1500rpm. Your Range Rover Evoque ultimately started here.

Skoda (Laurin & Klement 1905)

Skoda grew out of a company called Laurin & Klement which started by making bicycles in 1895 moved into motorcycle manufacture in 1899 and then built its first car in 1905. That first car was the Voiturette A (seen here) which was powered by a 1005cc (later 1100cc) V-twin engine that developed 7hp. Just 55 were made before the Voiturette B took over in 1906 with a 9hp 1399cc engine.

Lancia (1907)

One of the most innovative carmakers ever it's a tragedy that Lancia is now just about defunct. Founded to build sporting and race cars Vincenzo Lancia set up his own company in November 1906. His first car was ready for trials in February 1907 but before it had left the workshop the factory burned down taking the car the drawings and Lancia's tools with it. Seven months later Lancia had a new car built from scratch; 100 examples of the Type 51 would be made each with a 2544cc four-cylinder engine.

Audi (1910)

August Horch's first car company (founded in 1904) bore his own name but when he fell out with fellow board members he set up a new company in 1910 called Audi. Its first model was the Type A fitted with a 2612cc four-cylinder engine. Just 140 examples were made before the Type B arrived in 1911.

Alfa Romeo (1910)

Launched in 1910 Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili realised that it really needed a snappier name; ALFA was the result. After Nicola Romeo took the company over in 1915 it was renamed Alfa Romeo in 1918 and its first car was the Torpedo 20-30. However ALFA's first car was the 4.1-litre 24HP seen here which remained in production until 1914.

Morgan (1910)

Harry (HFS) Morgan opened a garage in Malvern to sell and service cars. By 1909 he'd built his own car for his personal use; a year later he put his three-wheeler into production. The first cars were single-seaters but these were never going to be very popular in the marketplace so by 1911 Morgan's three-wheeler was available with either two seats or four. Power came from a 961cc JAP V-twin engine.

Chevrolet (1913)

Although Louis Chevrolet set up his company in 1911 his first car wasn't sold until 1913. Introduced at that year's New York Auto Show the Chevrolet Type C (or Classic Six) was pretty impressive with its six-cylinder engine and three-speed gearbox. But it was costly compared with rivals which is why Chevrolet quickly introduced a four-cylinder model to compete.

Dodge (1914)

John and Horace Dodge set up shop in 1901 to produce bicycle components before moving into car parts supply in 1903; very quickly virtually their entire output was for Ford. Seeing that Ford was producing more and more parts in-house they decided to go it alone with their own car which arrived in 1914. Offered only as a five-seat tourer Dodge's car featured a 35hp 3480cc four-cylinder engine and a three-speed gearbox. By 1916 Dodge was America's fourth best-selling brand of car with over 70000 made in that one year.

Aston Martin (1915)

The first Aston Martin named Coal Scuttle was built in 1915. Following Coal Scuttle and the Great War three more prototype cars were built including one called Bunny but none of these cars survive. By 1921 Aston Martin was ready to start selling cars and its first production model featured a 1496cc four-cylinder engine. Just 69 were made before the company went bust – and not for the last time. The car pictured is the oldest surviving Aston Martin chassis number 3 now owned by the Aston Martin Heritage Trust.

Mitsubishi (1917)

Founded as a shipping firm in 1870 Mitsubishi didn't build its first car until 1917. Just 22 of these leviathans were built each powered by a 2765cc four-cylinder engine. Capable of seating seven the Mitsubishi Model A was based on the Fiat Tipo 3 with a front-mounted 35hp engine that drove the rear wheels and could take the car to 96kph.

Bentley (1919)

Walter Owen (WO) Bentley and his brother Horace sold cars before WW1 but in 1919 they set up Bentley Motors to make and sell sporting carriages for the well heeled. The company's first car was ready for delivery in 1921; by 1930 Bentley had won the Le Mans 24 Hours five times. Bentley's first model was the 3-Litre 1622 of which were produced between 1921 and 1929 each with a 2996cc four-cylinder engine with four valves per cylinder.

Citroën (1919)

Throughout WW1 André Citroen's factory was churning out armaments and although he didn't make his first car until 1919 as early as 1916 he'd decided to go into vehicle manufacture. In March 1919 just four months after WW1 ended Citroen showed his Type A with a 1327cc four-cylinder engine that gave a top speed of 64kph. By the time production ended in 1921 more than 24000 Type As had been built.

Jaguar (Swallow Sidecars 1922)

Jaguar didn't start out as Jaguar – it began life in 1922 as Swallow Sidecars or SS to make bodies for an array of small cars such as Austin Singer and Wolseley. Trying to sell cars after the events of World War Two with the name ‘SS’ was never going to be successful which is why the name Jaguar was adopted. This was first used as a model name in 1935.

MG (1923)

William Morris (later Lord Nuffield) founded Morris Motors in 1913; a decade later Morris Garages (MG) was born. There's much debate as to what MG's first car was but it seems to be the Morris Garages Chummy a sporting two-seater based on the Morris Cowley. Those first cars featured Morris and MG badges and the first adverts for MG were placed in 1923 although the trademark wasn't registered until the following year.

Triumph (1923)

Based in Coventry Triumph entered the bicycle market in 1885; motorcycles followed in 1902 and then in 1923 the company built its first car. This was the result of a takeover of the Dawson Car Company with Triumph's first model being the 1.4-litre 10/20. Built until 1926 around 2500 of these two-seater steel-bodied tourers were made although there was also an aluminium-panelled sports model offered.

Chrysler (1924)

Walter Chrysler had turned around the ailing Maxwell-Chalmers car company which had been founded in 1904. That company closed down in 1923 so the next year Walter created a new company bearing his own name – and here he is with his very first car the 70. Fitted with a 3301cc side-valve straight-six the 70 was highly innovative with its aluminium pistons full-pressure lubrication and oil filter. No wonder 32000 were sold in the first year.

Skoda (1925)

Just like Laurin & Klement Skoda was also started in 1895 mainly to build armaments but it expanded rapidly to also offer locomotives bridges power stations ships and much more. In 1919 it started to build steam trucks and heavy road tractors but in 1925 Skoda merged with Laurin & Klement to start offering cars. The company's first model was the Type 110 an evolution of L&K's Types 100 and 105 powered by a 1791cc four-cylinder water-cooled engine.

Pontiac (1926)

In the 1920s General Motors had Chevrolet at the bottom end and Cadillac at the top. There was also Oldsmobile which was closer to Cadillac than Chevrolet; what was needed was a brand that offered affordable high-quality cars. Pontiac was launched in 1926 to fill that gap; its first model was a 3.1-litre car available in two-door sedan or coupé forms both priced at USD 825 (about Rs 60000). The car proved a big hit with almost 77000 sold in the first year.

BMW (1927)

BMW started out as a manufacturer of aircraft engines in 1916 in 1923 it launched its first motorcycle then in 1927 came the Dixi 3/15 BMW's first car. It was an Austin Seven built under licence with barely any changes; aside from the steering wheel moving from the right to the left the two were pretty much interchangeable.

Volvo (1927)

Founded by Assar Gabrielsson and Gustav Larson Volvo built its first car in 1927. Called the OV4 and offered only as an open tourer power came from a 1940cc four-cylinder engine with a peak power output of just 28hp at 2800rpm. At this stage only eight airbags were fitted as standard along with 31 warning lights on the dash and 14 buzzers but Volvo soon upped its game.

Nissan (1931)

Nissan started out as the Kaishinsha Motorcar Works in 1911 before changing its name to DAT Motorcar Co in 1925 then again to Nissan in 1934. However many of the company's products were sold as Datsuns (initially Datsons) until 1986 when Nissan was adopted as the global brand. Although cars were made in limited numbers from as early as 1914 the first Datsun didn't arrive until 1931.

The Type 10 was a clone of the Austin Seven and initially it featured a 495cc four-cylinder engine which was later enlarged to 747cc – the same displacement as the Austin unit.

Toyota (1936)

Toyota’s first car was the AA presented in 1936 and powered by a 3.4-litre six-cylinder engine; 1404 were made. The first home-built car for the Japanese market its public debut at an exhibition in Tokyo together with a cabriolet version (the AB) helped prompt the Japanese government to give the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works permission to build vehicles opening the way for the founding of Toyota and the immediate construction of its first auto factories.

Jeep (Willys 1941)

Hmm – where to start with this one? The first Jeeps were made by Willys and Ford in 1941 and later on by French companies Hotchkiss and Delahaye. Power came from a 2.2-litre four-cylinder engine which drove all four wheels via a three-speed manual gearbox. In time the Jeep would become a staple product for Willys-Overland which went on to launch the Station Wagon Truck and Jeepster.

Jaguar (1945)

Rising from the ashes of SS Cars was Jaguar which was incorporated in March 1945. With six years of hostilities just having taken place Jaguar hadn't been able to develop a new car so it just put the SS 2.5-litre sedan back into production. Alongside a 3.5-litre sedan this 2664cc car would have to sustain Jaguar until the arrival of the MkV in 1948.

Volkswagen (1945)

Although the first examples of Hitler's KDF wagen were built in 1936 the first production cars weren't made until 1945. When the British Army liberated VW's Wolfsburg factory the car the Type 1 was offered to various British companies all of which turned it down saying it could never be commercially successful. Unofficially called the Volkswagen Beetle the air-cooled sedan went on to become the most successful car in history with more than 21 million built by the time production ended in 2003.

Ferrari (1947)

When Enzo Ferrari severed his ties with his previous employer Alfa Romeo (he was the company's competition manager) he was forbidden from building any cars bearing his own name for seven years. So his first cars were built under the Auto Avio banner in 1940; after just two were built the company's focus turned to making machine tools and ball bearings for the war effort. The first Ferrari appeared in 1947: the Tipo 125 featured a 1498cc V12 rated at 118bhp. A year later Ferrari would take part in its first Grand Prix using this engine in supercharged form.

Maserati (1947)

There were six Maserati brothers and five of them (Carlo Bindo Alfieri Ettore and Ernesto) devoted their lives to cars and motorsport. They launched their own car-making company in 1926 but the focus was exclusively on racing cars; it wouldn't be until 1947 that the Tipo A6 arrived powered by a 1488cc straight-six. Later would come a 2.0-litre version and an array of special-bodied cars.

Jaguar (MkV 1948)

So here it is – Jaguar's third first car. The company's original first car was when Jaguar was called Swallow Sidecars the second was just an SS car that was sold as a Jaguar and this was the first car from Jaguar that didn't start out as an SS. The MkV came in saloon or drophead forms and was fitted with the same choice of 2664cc or 3485cc straight-six engines as before. Production lasted until 1951 when the MkVII took over; there was no MkVI probably because Bentley was selling its own MkVI at the time.

Land Rover (1948)

Now owned by Tata Land Rover was originally an offshoot of the Rover Car Company which wanted to increase its exports and it also spotted a gap in the market for a vehicle capable of tackling harsh terrain. The result was the Series 1 of 1948 powered by a 1.6-litre petrol engine. Production started in July 1948 and within three months Land Rover had dealers in an astonishing 68 countries around the world.

Porsche (1948)

Ferdinand Porsche founded a design and engineering consultancy in 1931 but he wouldn't build his own car until 1948 having already created the VW Beetle before WW2. Porsche's first car was the 356 and here is Ferdinand Porsche with his son (confusingly also Ferdinand Porsche) with that first car which was effectively a rebodied Beetle complete with 1131cc engine.

Jeep (1953)

Willys continued production of the Jeep until 1953 when it was swallowed up by Kaiser Motors renamed Kaiser-Jeep in 1963. At first there was an updated version of the wartime Jeep available but the big news was the Wagoneer station wagon which came with a 3770cc six-cylinder engine and could be ordered with rear- or four-wheel drive.

Suzuki (1955)

Suzuki started out as a motorbike manufacturer but in 1955 it moved into making cars and small trucks with the Suzulight brand – the first ever kei car. First came the SF (Suzuki Four-wheel car) in two-door sedan van and pick-up forms each with a 360cc two-cylinder two-stroke engine driving the front wheels. But with just a handful of sedans built these first forays into four-wheeler production were effectively just commercial vehicles.

Subaru (1958)

A world away from the turbocharged four-wheel drive rally monsters of the 1990s this was Subaru's first passenger car which arrived in 1958. It featured a rear-mounted 356cc two-cylinder engine a three-speed gearbox and came in two-door sedan estate or convertible forms. Incredibly the 360 proved popular in the US – until the press ran stories of how badly the Subaru fared in a head-on crash with a contemporary US car.

Mazda (1960)

Mazda started out as Toyo Kogyo in 1920 making machine tools. Four decades later the company built its first car the R360 pitched squarely against rivals from Subaru and Suzuki. With room for four (allegedly) the R360 initially came in two-door coupé form only although a convertible was added later. The 356cc V-twin engine was rated at a throbbing 16hp; enough to whisk its occupants all the way up to a heady 84kph.

Honda (1963)

Soichiro Honda didn't build his first four-wheeled vehicle until 1963: the T360 pick-up. But he'd started out as a mechanic in 1937 before moving into parts supply motorised bicycles engines and motorcycles; by 1959 Honda was the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer. Within two months of the T360 going on sale Honda launched its first car; the S500 roadster with a 531cc four-cylinder engine. Honda built 1363 of them in a year before the S600 took over.

Lamborghini (1963)

Lamborghini got off to something of a false start as its first attempt at producing a road-going production car was so badly received that it had to go back to the drawing board and come up with something different. That first prototype was the 350 GTV unveiled in 1963 and fitted with a front-mounted 3.5-litre V12 rated at 365hp.

Lamborghini (1964)

After the 350 GTV had been so poorly received Lamborghini tried again to come up with a two-seater grand tourer with a V12 in the nose. The result was the 350 GT launched in 1964 and fitted with the same V12 that featured in the Miura. However while the 350 GT's V12 displaced 3.5 litres the Miura's was a 4.0-litre powerplant. Production of the 350 GT ran until 1966 with 120 examples produced.

Kia (1974)

When you consider what Kia has achieved it's incredible to think that it's one of the newest mainstream carmakers here. Kia was founded in 1944 as Kyungsung Precision Industry and started to make Honda motorcycles under licence in 1957 and Mazda trucks under licence from 1962. However it wouldn't be until 1974 that Kia would make its first car. Even this was a Mazda produced under licence. Called the Brisa a 1.0-litre engine was fitted and production ran through until 1981.

Hyundai (1975)

Hyundai was founded as a construction company in 1947 and 20 years later it started to build various Ford cars and trucks under licence. Having hired Brit George Turnbull (formerly of British Leyland) Hyundai introduced its first car in 1975. The Pony was a rear-wheel drive sedan that looked like a hatchback and was fitted with Mitsubishi-sourced engines and running gear. Styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro the Hyundai Pony was simple rugged and affordable which was just what the market demanded at the time.

Acura (1986)

Honda launched its upmarket Acura brand in 1986 as a response to import limits set by the US government. Allowed to import only so many cars Honda focused on its more costly models and stuck an Acura badge on them to appear more exclusive. Few were fooled though; the first models were the Integra and Legend sold through 60 dealerships across the US.

Infiniti (1989)

Introduced in a bid to take Nissan upmarket in the US the Infiniti brand could offer just one model when it was launched. The Q45 was a luxury saloon with a 288hp 4498cc V8 borrowed from the Nissan President. Launched in 1989 within a year the Q45 could be ordered with four-wheel steering and hydraulically controlled active suspension.

Lexus (1989)

When Toyota decided to move upmarket in the US in 1989 it created a new brand that would go on to revolutionise the luxury segment. Uncannily refined incredibly well equipped and supremely reliable the Lexus LS400 wasn't much fun to drive but for those who wanted a luxurious large sedan it was a world apart from the usual offerings from the likes of Cadillac Mercedes and Jaguar.

McLaren (1992)

The first McLarens were M6 racing cars built by a company called Trojan in the late 1960s. A couple of these were converted into road cars but the McLaren we know wasn't born until 1985 when Ron Dennis set up a new company to build road and racing cars. The first fruits of McLaren's labour was the incredible F1 of 1992 – a car that went on to claim the production car speed record at a monstrous 386kph.

Tesla (2008)

Even Tesla probably didn’t realize how important its first car the Tesla Roadster would be to not just Elon Musk’s own company but the wider industry as well. This Lotus Elise-based sports car was not only the first mainstream electric car with a usable range (of around 240-320km) but also totally reversed perceptions of electric cars with sweet performance with 0-96kph acceleration of under four seconds. Tesla didn’t look back and the industry has been playing catch-up with it ever since. In leading the world to electrification the last car company in this story may also be one of the most important.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL25ld3MvZm9yZC1tYWhpbmRyYS1jYWxsLW9mZi1qb2ludC12ZW50dXJlLWluLWluZGlhLWR1ZS10by1jb3ZpZC1yZWxhdGVkLWRpc3J1cHRpb25zLTExNjA5NDc2ODQ3NTg3Lmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9uZXdzL2ZvcmQtbWFoaW5kcmEtY2FsbC1vZmYtam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS1pbi1pbmRpYS1kdWUtdG8tY292aWQtcmVsYXRlZC1kaXNydXB0aW9ucy9hbXAtMTE2MDk0NzY4NDc1ODcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&M Ford pull the plug on joint venture | Mint,"Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Ford Motor Co. said that the global disruptions brought about by covid-19 and the ensuing change in capital allocation priorities forced them to abandon a proposed partnership for engine and vehicle development in India.

The move is a blow to Mahindra’s plans to get access to manufacturing capacities and new technologies for engines and connected vehicles. At the same time Ford will have to continue its independent battle to garner a bigger share of India’s market where it has lagged most of its rivals despite a more than two-decade-long presence.

Mahindra India’s largest sport-utility vehicle maker said the pressure to conserve cash need for investments in emerging technologies and intensifying focus on its core automobile business in India have influenced its step.

The automaker is aiming at direct cost savings of more than ₹3000 crore next fiscal through the separation with Ford and a potential stake sale of its bankrupt Korean unit SsangYong Motor Co.

The decision to part ways “follows the passing of the 31 December ‘longstop’ or expiration date of a definitive agreement the organizations entered into in October 2019"" the companies said in separate statements.

Pawan Goenka managing director of Mahindra said the joint venture (JV) with Ford was impacted by the global upheaval due to covid.

“In the current scenario the investments would have been significantly more than what was envisioned. Therefore it did not make any business sense for either partner"" Goenka said on Friday.

In October 2019 Mahindra and Ford announced an initial pact for a JV to develop vehicles for emerging markets. Mahindra was to hold the controlling 51% stake and Ford the rest. They planned to share BS VI-compliant engines besides developing connected vehicle solutions. Ford’s assets in India including a factory each near Chennai and Sanand Gujarat were supposed to have been absorbed by the JV and run by Mahindra.

The partnership with Ford and acquisition of SsangYong were meant to enhance Mahindra’s offerings for both domestic and export markets. The decision to pull the plug might negatively affect Mahindra’s product strategy at a time when its SUV market share in India is under severe strain and competition in electric vehicle space has risen.

Mahindra which has announced plans to sell its controlling 70% stake in SsangYong may sign a term sheet with a potential investor as soon as next week said Anish Shah deputy CEO and group CFO M&M.

“With the kind of change happening in the economic and business scenario specific to the auto industry the shift taking place to the kind of vehicles that will be popular in the next 3-5 years we have to prioritize where to put our money"" Goenka said.

To be sure Mahindra’s new management has been re-evaluating the capital allocation strategy and has decided to exit loss-making businesses across its core and non-core group companies globally.

“The recent announcement is a part of its new asset allocation strategy of focusing on its core businesses of tractors SUVs. Scaling back to its core competence will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and improve the return profile"" said Md Shaukat Ali an analyst at Asian Markets Securities.

Niels Teusink of Dutch cybersecurity firm EYE discovered a secret hardcoded administrative account in the latest 4.60 patch 0 firmware for some Zyxel devices.

$ ssh zyfwp@192.168.1.252 Password: Pr ******* Xp Router> show users current No: 1 Name: zyfwp Type: admin (...) Router>

This account does not show in the Zyxel user interface and has a login name of 'zyfwp' and a static plain-text password. Due to the severity of this vulnerability BleepingComputer decided not to publish the password.

Teusink found that the account could be used to log into vulnerable devices over both SSH and the web interface. Since the SSL VPN interface operates on the same port as the web interface Teusink found that many users have allowed port 443 to be accessible on the Internet.

""As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally more than 100.000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet"" Teusink reported.

VPN device vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous as they can be used to create new VPN accounts to gain access to an internal network or create port forwarding rules to make internal services publicly accessible.

""Someone could for example change firewall settings to allow or block certain traffic. They could also intercept traffic or create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device. Combined with a vulnerability like Zerologon this could be devastating to small and medium businesses"" Teusink warned.

These types of vulnerabilities have become a favorite among threat actors who are known to exploit Pulse Secure Fortinet and Citrix Netscaler VPN vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware or compromise internal corporate networks to steal data.

Administrators of affected devices should upgrade their devices to the latest firmware as soon as possible.

Zyxel releases new firmware for firewalls

In an advisory Zyxel thanked EYE's for their disclosure and stated that they used the hardcoded credentials to deliver automatic firmware updates via FTP.

""A hardcoded credential vulnerability was identified in the “zyfwp” user account in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP"" states Zyxel's advisory.

Zyxel has released ZLD V4.60 Patch 1 to remove the hardcoded credentials in vulnerable ATP USG USG Flex and VPN devices. Zyxel states that ATP USG USG FLEX and VPN firewalls using earlier firmware or SD-OS are not affected.

The patch for NXC AP controllers is expected to be released in April 2021.

The table of affected Zyxel products and the patch availability is below.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Just a super quick post to provide a tiny bit of context on an issue some (but not all) folks are seeing where your recorded GPS track is offset by upwards of a hundred meters or more. In general the pattern of your route is correct but it may be displaced to one side or the other. However in many cases by the completion of the workout it sorts itself out. In other words it’s mostly a one-time issue.

The issue largely appears to be impacting companies that leverage the Sony GPS chipset in their devices which is basically all new Garmin devices in the last few years most new Suunto devices in the last few years all Polar devices in the last few years all COROS devices the Wahoo RIVAL and more. More or less everyone except Apple.

Very rough list of impacted devices (I’m missing a ton here these are just the most popular ones)

– COROS GPS watches (need to double-check original Pace though)

– Garmin Forerunner 45/245/745/945/Fenix 6/MARQ/Vivoactive 3/4/Venu

– Garmin Edge 130 Plus 530/830/1030 Plus

– Polar Vantage V/M/V2 Grit X Ignite

– Suunto 5 & Suunto 9

– Wahoo RIVAL

Again I’m missing a boatload here but that’s the big-ticket ones off the top of my head.

All these companies have switched to the Sony GPS chipset since around 2018 with Polar and Suunto initially jumping onboard followed quickly thereafter by Garmin COROS and more. The Sony GPS chipset is widely used by these companies because of the power savings delivering longer battery life.

But – that’s all besides the point and not the cause of the issue. The issue has to do with the ephemeris data file also called the EPO file (Extended Prediction Orbit) or Connected Predictive Ephemeris (CPE). Or simply the satellite pre-cache file. That’s the file that’s delivered to your device on a frequent basis (usually every few days). This file is what makes your watch near-instantly find GPS satellites when you go outside. It’s basically a cheat-sheet of where the satellites are for the next few days or up to a week or so.

Your watch or bike computer automatically gets this file via Bluetooth Smart from your phone WiFi or USB depending on how you connect your watch. Most companies deliver it anytime your watch syncs and needs a new version. So from your side you never do anything – it just quietly happens in the background.

Right now the data in this file is wrong and thus the data your watch uses for those first few minutes is also wrong – leading to the offsets. You can see an example of this below from one DCR reader:

And another:





As the watch sustains its connection with GPS satellites over the length of the workout it’ll generally re-correct itself as it pulls in updated data from above. Most people are reporting that it’ll resolve itself either by the end of the workout or the next workout. You can see that here from yet another DCR reader:

Same here – identical errors on start point on my Fenix 6X Pro and my wife’s Forerunner 45S then they sort themselves out – I walked she ran so my route is more accurate as it had more time to get a fix I guess… pic.twitter.com/tZ4ysgYPtW — ac72 (@ac72) January 2 2021

To help resolve this you can simply stick your watch/bike computer outside and let it record an hour workout then just discard it after that. It’ll have received the required satellite information to likely correct itself.

But it won’t impact everyone. For example I tried today with two Sony-based watches (Garmin FR745 and FR945) to get it to lay down an incorrect track – and it wouldn’t. I suspect this is because in my case the watch had been bumped on a few times while playing with my kids yesterday and today so my guess is it had already re-downloaded what it needed to be correct out of the gate. I also tried with two non-Sony chipsets (Fenix 5S and Apple Watch SE) and didn’t see any problems either.

In talking to Garmin today they’re working on a fix for the issue that they believe will most likely be that they just update the satellite pre-cache data from the server which in turn your watch will grab just as it always does. But first they (and others) are working to sort out what exactly is wrong with the data that’s causing this.

In talking to another person in the industry dealing with the issue they noted that technically 2020 had 53 weeks and this is the 53rd week. As such the suspect Sony data file issue might actually be tied to that complexity.

See…just when you thought you escaped 2020 it’s still there waiting for you at the start of your run.

With that – thanks for reading!

The reason with hindsight should be obvious: the UK was just over a week away from its first coronavirus lockdown and it didn’t feel responsible to take public transport to an event where I’d be sharply inhaling and exhaling around a whole bunch of fellow potential viral hosts.

It would turn out to be the last UK parkrun of the year with events still yet to return to the country as the pandemic continues to dominate headlines and mindsets.

I still don’t know for sure if I got coronavirus later that month — as a freelancer who works from home 90% of the time it didn’t feel necessary to use one of the tests to find out. All I can say for sure is that I had mild flu-like symptoms while my girlfriend developed the more obvious ones. Nonetheless months later I would go on to develop symptoms that the CDC tags as common long covid ones: fatigue chest pain and joint pain.

(Image credit: Garmin)

These literal painful symptoms prompted another more figurative pain: my 5K times plummeted. I went from running the distance in a respectable 24-26 minutes to being unable to run 3km without needing to stop to walk. This added an unacceptable 5 to 10 minutes to the average times I’d nurtured over 212 parkrun events.

I know that in the greater scheme of things that there are worse things in the world than this but nonetheless I found this a depressing turn of events. I genuinely feared that I would never get up to full speed again and that the pride in running a medium distance (let alone a long distance) without stopping was something that I would never enjoy again.

But then I remembered the device that was tracking my decline could also be used to put that trend into reverse. I bought a Garmin Forerunner 245 back in 2019 but hadn’t bothered with the built-in Garmin Coach because I hadn’t needed it. Now however I was certainly in need of coaching. I wasn’t sure how much of the inability to run more than 3K was in my head. Maybe in lockdown I’d just forgotten what the feeling of runner’s discomfort felt like?

(Image credit: Alan Martin)

For those unfamiliar with Garmin Coach it’s a feature of select Garmin watches (the Forerunner 45 or Vivoactive 3 seem to be the cheapest compatible options) that schedules a training program based on your 5- or 10K goals adapted to your performance and the metrics it picks up along the way. This can be as simple as just running it without stopping or it can train you to a certain time goal. You select the days you can work out on and Garmin comes up with instructions for that day all readable on the wrist.

So I set up a 3-month training program with the ultimate goal of hitting 5K in 26 minutes by February. This involves four runs per week with different goals each time; sometimes it will involve a slow-pace run for 30 minutes and other times it will involve doing short sprints. For each segment the watch has a handy meter to show you if you’re going too fast or too slow — just stay in the green segment and you'll be fine. Each session has a built-in warm up and warm down time and there’s usually the option of doing an extra 5 to 10 minute ‘encore’ if you’re feeling strong.

Four weeks into the program and I have to say the goal still feels a touch optimistic to me but currently the Garmin ‘confidence’ rating about my chances of success has me just on the edge of “extremely confident”. Tomorrow’s run is a “Time Trial” where I have to run 1.61km as fast as I can so I guess we’ll see how far I’ve come then.

(Image credit: Alan Martin)

But whether I succeed or not I would recommend anyone in a similar running slump give it a go provided they feel up to it (and if in doubt consult your doctor). Not only is it making me feel better and more confident that my illness was just a blip but the schedule is giving me a sense of purpose in a pandemic-packed world where it’s all too easy to feel adrift as days blur into one.

Now I'm rolling on to February 20 for race day. If all goes to plan I might start it all over again with a more ambitious time target or up it to 10K.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGV2ZXJnZS5jb20vMjAyMC1yb3VuZHVwLzIyMjA2NzQ1LzIwMjAtaG9tZS1leGVyY2lzZS10ZWNoLWdhbWVzLWFwcHMtdnItYXBwbGUtd2F0Y2gtY292aWQtcXVhcmFudGluZS1wYW5kZW1pYy1zaGVsdGVyLWluLXBsYWNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The exercise tech that helped us stay fit under quarantine,"With all the mental burdens that came with living in 2020 — including gyms closing their doors — many have found it tough to get in their normal level of exercise. Here at The Verge we coped with this as you might expect: with tech that could enable or motivate us to get some activity in. These are the gadgets apps games and services we used to work up a sweat while still staying safe and which might prove useful if your New Year’s resolution involves exercise.

Beat Saber

I named Beat Saber my favorite game of 2018 but I lapsed hard since until Oculus released the Quest 2 in October. It’s the first VR headset I like wearing and I used SideQuest to add bootleg custom tracks that support my embarrassingly narrow musical taste turning my Quest into a nearly single-purpose beat sabering machine. (I probably owe Muse and the New Pornographers royalties or something? Look I just really like the unofficial Expert beatmap of “The Mary Martin Show.”) Pro: I remember I have a body again. Con: I get OK Go stuck in my head every morning. — Adi Robertson

Nike Training Club and Reddit

I’ve been a Nike Training Club user for a while now but this year I needed it more than ever as my cycle commute disappeared and my step-count plummeted. Nike’s app offers a collection of workouts you can filter based on how much equipment you have available how much time you have whether you’re after a strength or a cardio workout and so on. This year my filters were “none” “all the time in the world” and “I’ll take what I can get” respectively.

What I like most is how simple most of the workouts are which leaves me free to alleviate the boredom of exercise by listening to podcasts while I work out. Instead of having to listen to a personal trainer’s motivational tidbits alongside their instructions Nike’s app mainly shows simple looping videos of each exercise and leaves my mind free to wander. (The app also includes more traditional workout videos but they’ve never clicked with me.)

Early in the year I also got a lot out of working out as a group with my flatmates. Here the routine devised by Reddit’s Bodyweight Fitness community was invaluable. It includes strength exercises you can do with minimal equipment and different variants of each to let you adjust their difficulty. While you don’t need much to get started we found adding a pullup bar gymnastics rings and resistance bands was a relatively affordable way to give us a lot more exercise options. — Jon Porter

Instagram

While I typically keep my social media habit limited to Twitter one of my early strategies for staying active while staying home was collecting posts of at-home exercises with Instagram’s Saved Posts feature. Fitness instructors have always shared some content on Instagram but the closing of gyms and fitness studios brought a wealth of free guided workouts to the app. It’s no Pinterest but my collection in Saved Posts lets me keep easy exercises on hand and eliminates one of my many excuses for not moving: I rarely know what I’m doing when it comes to working out.

As the year has dragged on I’ve fallen off my Instagram health kick but I still collect and sort exercise posts. Obviously there are fewer physical benefits but I still find it very soothing. — Ian Campbell

The Garmin Fenix 6X

I know I’m tempting fate by saying this but my fitness improved dramatically during the pandemic. I was motivated by boredom and frankly a fear of dying but also by Garmin’s do-it-all Fenix 6X Pro smartwatch with ten-day battery and giant outdoor-readable display. It helps that my local government has promoted safe socially-distanced outdoor activities instead of issuing strict stay-at-home orders.

I was motivated to run faster and longer using Garmin’s PacePro feature

Prior to the depletion of fitness gadgets on Amazon and beyond I managed to amass a set of adjustable resistance bands I had read about on Wirecutter and a luxurious pair of weighted jump ropes from Crossrope. In March and April I worked out with these items pretty much every day while sequestered at home. The Garmin watch did a fair job of automatically tracking my chest and shoulder presses and bicep curls but it was far less capable of detecting other movements failing miserably at tracking my Crossrope sessions for example. Crossrope makes an app with paid membership tiers but I found it superfluous to my needs. While I’m not quite at the level of a pro boxer I’ve managed to perfect several jumping skills like crossovers doubles and a variety of skips to keep the repetition interesting.

I also took up yoga at this time to help maintain my sanity and increase flexibility. While the Fenix 6 can guide you through animated yoga sessions as an absolute beginner I found it impractical and disruptive to keep peeking at my wrist to study pose mechanics. YouTube is a much better living room coach. I completed Kassandra’s 30-day challenge (Adriene is too chatty for me) and yoga is now part of my regular routine.

As spring sprung I took to running outside through the glorious tourist-free Amsterdam city streets and parks. Here the Garmin watch excelled. I was motivated to run faster and longer using Garmin’s PacePro feature to inject my Spotify playlist real-time coaching and turn-by-turn navigation into my AirPods Pro earbuds. I soon became addicted to setting new personal records and lowering my fitness age in virtual competition with my running friends who prefer Garmin watches over anything else.

By summer I was using the Garmin Fenix 6 to track my kitesurfing sessions all-day bike rides and open-water swims in the ocean. By fall I took up golfing motivated by Garmin’s super impressive ability to track each shot played on hundreds of golf courses around the world. The Fenix 6 isn’t accurate enough to track putts but it does an amazing job of tracking each shot from the tee to the green allowing you to measure club performance keep score and see trends after each round.

The Fenix 6 has proven to be a jack of all trades and master of some while motivating me to try new activities like mountain biking to see how it adapts. After nine months of intense and uninterrupted usage the Garmin Fenix 6 now says that my fitness age is 20 something I’m proud of as a 53-year-old gadget-obsessed human trying to outlive a virus. — Thomas Ricker

The Apple Watch Nintendo Games and Fitbod

When I got an Apple Watch in November 2019 there were two things I didn’t expect: the upcoming pandemic that would make going to the gym impossible and just how well the gamified rings system would work on me. The desire to fill every ring every day (which I have done thank you) has made it so at the very least I get up and speed-walk around my apartment every day.

I also managed to find a copy of Wii Sports Resort at a local game store so I didn’t have to pay the eBay scalper prices that started popping up around March (hardcore gamers weren’t the only ones dealing with those). It’s not really what I would call a workout but it’s fun and it gets my wife and I off the couch. Would I rather be playing Beat Saber? Yes but I couldn’t get my hands on the VR rig I wanted this year. That’s on the list for 2021 once we can find PC hardware again.

Proof. There’s more where that came from. Screenshot by Mitchell Clark / The Verge

For a Nintendo game that actually provides a workout I turned to Ring Fit Adventure. I cranked it up to the highest difficulty and immediately regretted it… but pushing through has been rewarding and I feel like I’ve actually gotten a workout in. It’s not the heart-pounding sweating everywhere workout I’ve gotten from YouTube workout videos or Apple Fitness Plus but I’m usually sore the next day.

Finally while I wouldn’t call adjustable dumbbells “tech” I paired mine with the app Fitbod which tracks your exercises and builds sets based on which muscle groups are fresh. Combined with the fact I now have a full set of weights that can actually fit in a small apartment I do more strength training now than I ever did at the gym. — Mitchell Clark

What exercise?

Lifting this monitor onto my desk was perhaps my most strenuous task in 2020.

I went into the pandemic with the best of intentions and an array of gadgetry at my disposal: a VR headset with exercise games a motorized standing desk a genuinely good road bicycle a smartwatch even an array of relatively new power tools (leaf blower hedge trimmer pressure washer) then I bought intending to clean up the yard.

Instead I proceeded to become an utter couch potato for the duration of the year.

I might have used the standing desk’s standing feature... twice? I had a few intense VR sessions of Pistol Whip sure but the staying power wasn’t there and I’m not sure playing through Half-Life: Alyx ever saw me break a sweat. Heck I used an automatic tire inflator the one-and-only time I hit the park with my bike to test an awesome new phone mount. I did rake all the leaves in the backyard twice I suppose. But if I’m telling the truth I probably burned more calories breaking down a mountain of Amazon cardboard boxes than any other activity this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcm9hZC5jYy9jb250ZW50L2J1eWVycy1ndWlkZS9nZXQta25vdy1nYXJtaW4tZWRnZS1ncHMtYmlrZS1jb21wdXRlci1yYW5nZS0yMjI4MTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get to know the Garmin Edge GPS bike computer range,"If you’re thinking about buying a GPS bike computer chances are that at least one Garmin Edge has made it on to your shortlist. How do you choose between them? That’s where we can help.

Garmin pioneered the cycling GPS unit back in the mid-2000s with the first Edge 205; that first-mover advantage has kept them at the forefront of the category despite strong competition

Like other cycling GPS units Garmin's fall broadly into two categories: with and without maps. Non-mapping Edge models are good for ride-recording and fitness tracking mapping units add detailed navigation capabilities

Garmin Edge GPS units capable of ANT+ and Bluetooth communication are available with and without sets of sensors; unless you really need a speed and cadence sensor the premium is usually silly and you're better buying a third-party heart rate sensor

The Garmin Edge GPS bike computer range

We’ve reviewed most of the Garmin Edges here on road.cc so whether you want something simple to show your speed and track your ride or you want advanced navigation and/or high-tech training features we can talk you through what’s on offer.

As ever we've cited the best on-line prices we can find at the time but they do vary. If you really want to save money you can also consider older Garmin Edge computers. These have been superseded in the range but can still be found second hand.

The current Garmin Edge cycling GPS computer range

RRP: £599.99 (Performance bundle)

Size: 58mm x 114mm x 19 mm

Display size: 88.9 mm diagonal 282 x 470 pixels

Weight: 124g

The Edge 1030 Plus is Garmin's flagship on-bike GPS but it's an incremental improvement over the Edge 1030 below rather than a great leap forward.

In addition to the Edge 1030's features and 282 x 470 pixel screen the Edge 1030 Plus gets Garmin's Climb Pro app which gives you a load of data about the climb you're toiling up to a) distract you from the pain and b) help you pace yourself so you don't blow it all on the first steep bit. Climb Pro was first launched on the Edge 530 and has been added via a software update to the Edge 1030.

For off-road riding the Edge 1030 Plus has the Trailforks app preloaded with trail details from “more than 80 countries.” Its Forksight mode lets you know about upcoming forks in the trail and shows you where you are in a trail network.

The Edge 1030 Plus also lets you pause turn guidance on a route you're following and pick it up later. That means you can go explore a newly-discovered byway or divert into a town for cake without the unit trying to recalculate your route or tell you you're off course.

Last but not least Garmin has beefed up the battery compared to the Edge 1030 and now claims it'll go up to 24 hours even with multiple paired sensors and connected features including LiveTrack running.

Buy if: You want the latest features largest screen and longest battery life

RRP: £349.99 - with sensor bundle: £429.99

The Edge 830 is the Edge 530's big brother with a touchscreen and fewer buttons but otherwise almost identical set of features.

The significant differences between the 830 and 530 relate to navigation. The 830 can find and navigate you to a specific address or point of interest which the 530 can't and you can use the 830 to create a course linking a series of points or create a roundtrip course. In combination with popularity routing which uses Garmin's vast database of rides to point you down the rods other riders use it should substantially improve navigation compared to previous Edge units.

RRP: £259.99 - with sensor bundle: £349.99

The cheaper of the pair of new GPS units that Garmin launched in April 2019 is physically the larger of the two because its case has room for buttons while the Edge 830 is mostly touch-screen operated.

The Edge 530 is a mapping GPS with a colour screen and a claimed battery run-time of 20 hours. Plus it can be used with Garmin's Charge power pack which was introduced with the Edge 1030.

In fact what Garmin has done with the Edge 530 is bring the Edge 1030's feature set to a cheaper unit by trimming the screen size and dropping the touch screen. You therefore get a plethora of training and fitness features such as VO2 max Recovery Adviser FTP/Watts/kg tracking and performance condition/lactate threshold/stress score among others.

Most importantly the 530 and 830 boast new processors which substantially improve the speed with which they perform tasks like loading and planning routes.

One major new feature is the ClimbPro app which shows you the remaining ascent and grade when you’re climbing while following a route or course. The idea is to help you gauge your effort over the remainder of your ride so burning out on your first climb of the day when there are plenty more to come should become a thing of the past.

RRP: £169.99 - Performance Bundle £219.99

The latest version of Garmin's smallest GPS unit gets the Climb Pro app from the Edge 830 and 1030 Plus and mountain bike metrics that'll tell you jump count jump distance and hang time after you've been out shredding the gnar. It's very much an incremental change over the Edge 130 below.

RRP: £219.99

Size: 105mm x 55mm x 22mm

Display size: 39mm x 65mm 240 x 400 pixels

Weight: 116g

Not to be confused with the Explore 1000 or Explore 820 the Edge Explore is a mapping GPS unit for riders who don't need all the training and fitness orientated features of the more expensive Edge units but who do want a decent-sized screen and map and the ability to connect to heart rate monitors for basic fitness measurement.

You don't get the level of customisation of the 1030 830 or 530; the unit assumes you have just one bike for example and there are just two customisable screens. But you still get features such as LiveTrack and GroupTrack for keeping in touch with home base and other riders support for Connect IQ apps incident detection to send an alert if you crash Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity for everything but power meters and loads more.

And unlike previous Edge Explore and Touring models the price is sensible.

Buy if: You want a general cycling and navigation GPS without the power measurement and training bells and whistles of the more expensive Edge units.

The Edge 1030 boasts the largest screen of any Garmin cycling GPS aside from the recently-launched Plus version and Garmin says the touch-screen function works in the wet or with gloves. It also has ambient light sensors to automatically adjust the screen brightness to suit the riding conditions. Battery life has been extended to a claimed 20 hours and there’s a new Garmin Charge battery pack accessory to double the run time to 40 hours for longer rides.

Garmin has beefed up the navigation and course planning features. Trendline utilises the many activities uploaded to Garmin Connect to provide routes using the most popular roads and off-road trails backed up by preloaded Cycle Maps for turn-by-turn directions on all terrain with alerts for sharp corners and elevation information. You’ll also be able to choose from three round-trip suggestions by choosing a distance and starting direction if you want the Edge 1030 to recommended new routes.

Strava fans will be able to make use of the latest version of Strava Live Segments while Strava Premium users will get further access to real-time races against personal best times. There’s also a new Segment Explore feature that lets you view popular nearby segments. If you want to use the Edge 1030 for serious training Garmin has developed the new TrainingPeaks Connect IQ app to let you put your daily workouts on the Edge 1030 and it’ll also guide you through the workout in real-time with intensity targets and intervals.

The new Garmin Edge 1030 will cost £499.95 while a bundle option which includes a premium heart rate monitor as well as cadence and speed sensors has a suggested retail price of £549.99. There’s a new flush mount that puts the Edge 1030 in line with the handlebars — not above them — for a sleek appearance.

The Edge 520 Plus was launched in 2018. It packs many of the features from the more expensive 820 and 1030 units into a unit that is the same size as the regular Edge 520.

The big new feature is the integration of Garmin Cycle Maps as opposed to the more basic mapping and navigation on the first 520. The turn-by-turn navigation works for on and off-road courses and also has alerts that notify you of upcoming turns. It comes with the rider-to-rider messaging service first seen on the Edge 1030 although your ride buddies will need a Garmin computer with this feature too in order for it to work.

Other highlights of the Edge 520 Plus include preloaded Strava Live Segments and advanced performance feedback when used with Garmin Connect and accessories such as power meters and/or a heart-rate device.

The Edge 130 offers a lot of performance in a small package with ANT+ and Bluetooth sensor and smartphone connectivity decent battery life an easy-to-use button-controlled layout and perhaps best of all an absolutely pin-sharp display. You don't get fully fledged navigation like the pricier Garmin models but the basic setup is usable if that's not your top priority.

Packed inside the small unit are sensors that use GPS GLONASS and Galileo satellites for positioning with a barometric altimeter. We found it picks up the satellites very quickly so there's no delay to starting a ride and it hasn't shown any sign of dropping signal during any rides so far. That's using just the GPS mode which the Edge 130 is set to by default. It worked fine. For more challenging areas you could try either the GPS + GLONASS or GPS + Galileo but they come with a battery penalty. Unless you're having issues in the stock mode you shouldn't have to worry about changing anything.

The 130 packs a lot more data screens in than Garmin's previous entry-level GPS devices with up to 8 viewable at once. There's no fancy touchscreen just simple buttons on the side of the unit and there's no colour in that screen either but clarity is excellent in all conditions.

The Edge 520 is one impressive piece of kit. It works smoothly with a good interface and clear display and is bang up to date with all the features (barring full mapping) you could want from a cutting edge performance monitoring tool.

Headlining with the built-in ability to support Strava Live Segments (also available on the 820 and 1000 below) Garmin takes live monitoring of your performance out on the road to new levels here. It's a development that will delight segment hunters out there and it works very well although you need to pay for Strava Premium membership to enjoy this feature.

Your Strava starred segments are used to populate the 520's database of live segments along with a selection of popular segments from your local area. You just ride up to the segment and the device cuts in with warnings of its approach and live comparisons against the KOM the fastest person you follow or your own PR.

The Edge 520 has a button interface rather than being touchscreen and we find that that makes for faster response to commands. Course uploads from Strava and Garmin and syncing with Garmin Connect are much quicker than with previous units too.

The 520 is packed with features. It includes GPS and GLONASS satellite chips a barometric altimeter phone message compatibility all the usual sensors including left and right pedal power recording from Vector pedals and compatibility with other power meters Shimano Di2 integration LiveTrack Varia bike radar and light compatibility training zone measuring Functional Threshold Power monitoring VO2 recording and recovery time predictions.

It even boasts a basemap although this can't be used to plot a route home. Still it gives a general idea of where you are.

With all the features stashed inside as well as that improved display and smaller lighter design you might expect battery life to take a hit. It has compared with the previous 510 but the 520 still offers up to 15 hours of life – long enough for a full day's ride and then some even with the backlight working and scrolling through multiple pages.

Garmin offers the 520 as a single unit (£279.99) and as a bundle with a heart rate monitor cadence sensor and speed sensor (£349.99) all of them communicating via ANT+.

There are still a handful of Edge 520 units in retailers but unless you can find one at a significant discount you're better gettking the Edge 520 Plus.

If you want a simple GPS cycling computer for tracking your speed and distance and sharing rides through popular social training websites like Strava the Garmin Edge 20 is easy to use compact and provides a decent battery life.

It's discontinued but there are still a few around. However it's now as expensive as the more capable Edge 130 so it's hard to see why you wouldn't buy that instead.

The Edge 20 isn’t Bluetooth or ANT+ compatible so you can't use it with a heart rate or cadence sensor. For some that might be a deal breaker.

The Edge 20 is tiny barely any bigger than the mount and looks great on the stem. Garmin's own quarter-turn mount is a doddle to use and the computer will work with a vast number of aftermarket mounts.

The battery is charged via a special cradle that clips to the back of the computer and the USB lead also uploads your activities to the web. Battery life is a claimed eight hours and we got pretty close to that in testing.

The display is sharp and shows all the data you really need when you’re riding. You get two different screens and it’s easy to switch between them.

It's very intuitive to use and after a couple of minutes you have the measure of the device. The buttons are easy to operate when wearing gloves as well.

While there's no extensive navigational capability you can download a route from Garmin’s Connect website and follow a breadcrumb (non-detailed) trail. It's not as easy as following a map but does keep you on the right track.

If you're sure you're never going to want to keep an eye on your heart rate the Edge 20 will be just fine but if you might want to add a heart rate monitor in future the Edge 130 is a better buy.

The Edge 25 is very similar to the Edge 20 (above) but with the addition of Bluetooth and ANT+ wireless connectivity. The former allows you to sync the device with a smartphone and Garmin's Connect app so you can easily upload completed rides.

ANT+ allows you to pair heart rate cadence speed sensors although the Edge 25 isn’t compatible with power meters.

While the Edge 25 isn't designed for navigation (the bigger Edges are far better at route mapping) you can download courses from Garmin Connect to the Edge 25 and follow a breadcrumb trail which works reasonably well. It even does turn-by-turn navigation but there's no base map so you can't make up a route on the fly.

The Edge 25 will also provide Live Tracking so friends and family can go online and see where you are.

You get three screens during a ride and you can configure two of them to display metrics from a whole range on offer: ride time distance current speed ascent calories and so on. You can't add any extra screens. If you're a data hungry cyclist that might be an issue.

Still the Edge 25 is an excellent option if you’re after something small with a good set of features.

The Garmin Edge 820 is a feature-packed compact and neat computer – an impressive piece of kit.

It’s aimed at the performance cyclist who wants to be able to navigate so isn't as bulky as the 1000 (below) but packs in more features than the 520 (above). The size of the screen means it's not at the same level as the 1000 in terms of navigation but it might be enough for your needs.

You get some excellent navigational features such as Round Trip Routing which allows the computer to create a route for you giving options based on distance climbing and intensity. Maps have a clear layout making it easy to see exactly where you are going and turn-by-turn prompts are simple to follow. After adding in a postcode town or specific site the 820 will get you to the correct place without fuss.

As with other Garmin units you can customise the data you see on each page and set activity profiles which means you can have different setups for different uses.

Garmin has also added GroupTrack which allows you to track up to 50 riders (they must have compatible Garmin computers and follow you on Garmin Connect) within 10 miles of you. If you get dropped or lost you can easily see where others are.

The unit is operated predominantly through touchscreen but with two buttons at the bottom and the on/off button on the top left. The touchscreen works okay but compared with button-controlled computers and the 1000 it seems a little sluggish sometimes taking a second to react. However it worked just as well with touchscreen-enabled gloves and was still usable in the wet.

The unit is ANT+ and Bluetooth compatible and is simple to pair with sensors on the bike. It also shows notifications and information from your smartphone.

Garmin is catching up with other bike computers in delivering 'incident detection' which means that a text message and location can be sent to a pre-determined contact number in the event of a crash.

Recording is as good as anything we have seen from other GPS computers. There can be a little loss when riding under cover (trees and tunnels for instance) and occasionally you can see an erratic twitch in your recorded route when riding between tall buildings.

Uploading from the 820 is done through Bluetooth to your smartphone which is quick and easy through the Garmin Connect app. From there you can either download the file to your desktop or share it with other sites like Strava.

Battery life is around 15 hours and there are also battery saver modes that can help to extend this essentially turning off the display while still recording.

If you want heart rate and speed and cadence sensors as well it's currently cheaper to buy them separately than to buy a bundle that includes them.

RRP: From £499.99

The Edge 1000 is larger than any of the cheaper models in the range with a screen that’s bigger and easier to read. It's been superseded by the Edge 1030 and Edge 1030 Plus and has just about vanished from retailers but there are plenty around second hand.

Unless you're planning to go somewhere incredibly remote you'll probably find the OpenStreetMap-based mapping to be complete and accurate. The maps are good enough that you can plot yourself a route around an area you don't know just by using the screen. The maps lose a lot of detail as you zoom out because the screen resolution can't show you all the little roads on a wide view of an area so a certain amount of zooming in and out is required if you're in unfamiliar territory.

The Edge 1000 is capable of turn-by-turn navigation over a prescribed route or of routing you to a location (or a series of locations) by itself. There are myriad ways of making a GPX file containing a ride you want to do; Garmin's own Connect portal will do it as will any number of third-party websites. Once you have your file you can connect your Garmin to your computer and download it.

Rather than the resistive screen of the 820 (the touchscreen works by sensing the pressure of your finger not its electric signature) the 1000 uses capacitive technology like a smartphone (the screen carries a charge and the natural conductive properties of your finger affect the screen's charge when you touch it). We’ve not had any false input from rain and it has worked fine with gloves on.

The Edge 1000 will pair with ANT+ devices including various power meters and Shimano's Di2 widget. Displaying the data is simple enough: within each profile (you can set up as many as you need) you can configure five data screens with up to 10 metrics on each. Essentially if it can be measured and you have an ANT+ sensor capable of measuring it it can probably be displayed!

The Edge 1000 also has a low-power Bluetooth 4.0 chipset predominantly so that it can pair with a smartphone. This makes uploading rides simple via the Garmin Connect app. As soon as you save a ride it's automatically uploaded to Garmin Connect and because Connect now plays nicely with Strava from there it's automatically synced to Strava.

The Bluetooth tether to your phone also allows you to use Garmin's Live Tracking to broadcast your position to whoever you choose using the phone's data connection. It relies on a data signal being available so if you're riding through somewhere with limited coverage updates will be patchy.

The Edge 1000 is also WiFi enabled. That means you can set it up on your home or work network and as soon as you get back it can auto-sync your ride data that way instead.

The Edge 1000’s stated run time is up to 15 hours but we’ve found that in real world conditions it's more like 10-12 hours. The screen backlight has the most obvious effect on battery life; if you have it always on at maximum brightness you'll not get anything like 10 hours out of it.

Whether you’re a tough-as-nails mountaineer a mad person who likes competing in triathlons or just an appreciator of long walks outside Garmin has always your back with a series of wearables that are ready for a tumble and capable of providing all the info you could possibly need.

The only downside to this is that Garmin has largely marketed its fitness gear to those diehard enthusiasts willing to spend a little more for a quality product. With more and more people beginning to take an interest in healthier more active lifestyles Garmin has been in need of a product to appeal to those users. You know the kinds who enjoy a jog four days a week but aren’t really enthusiast about climbing mountains.

That’s where the Garmin Venu Sq comes in. The cheaper version of Garmin’s beefy Venu swaps out some of the more expensive parts of it’s older siblings for assets that may be more cost efficient but certainly don’t degrade its performance. If anything after using it for a week this has turned out to be an excellent new smartwatch for the average joy and it’s always nice to have more options.

Design

Apple really has been massively influential in the design space with it’s range of smartwatches huh? The Venu Sq looks like it’s borrowed more than a single page for the Apple Watch; more like an entire chapter. Having said that if something ain’t broke it might be worth copying it. The 1.3in touchscreen and double-button design have been used because they clearly work well and the use of the square display will probably trick a few folks into thinking you splurged on Apple’s product.

The aluminium bezel is a nice clean touch but at the same time the actual size of the screen feels very… small. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the entire watch feels dated to use and look it. Fortunately there’s a wide range of colours for the watch face and strap to choose from. By the way the quick-release silicone strap is very comfortable to wear but you could replace it with other materials such as nylon suede and leather if you so choose.

Overall the Venu Sq is certainly not as utilitarian as Garmin’s more specifically focused fitness watches. It actually looks pretty nice if you’re willing to ignore a screen that’s a touch small by today’s standards.

Features

Despite it’s notification system being somewhat limited (hope you have an Android device lying around) it’s also stuffed with all the kit you’d need to monitor your fitness and health levels. Seriously this thing can track things like hydration respiration menstruation as well as a boatload of different exercises. It also comes with GPS an optical heart-rate sensor and can even run PulseOx tests. PulseOx actually just means blood-oxygen levels but it sounds way cooler to say right?

The amount of things the Venu Sq is able to monitor is truly staggering and it’s made all the better by how simple it all is to use. Just a single press of the button and you’ll be stopping and starting your workouts with everything displayed in an easily visible fashion on the screen. It’s efficient which is arguably the most important part of a smartwatch.

Software

The Venu Sq is running Garmin’s own software which if we’re honest is a little basic. Having said that you’re not exactly looking to calculate NASA launches with something like this right? It does what it needs to do and that’s perfectly okay. Still the pre-installed and downloadable watchfaces aren’t especially appealing considering many of them are user created. It’s nice to have that as an option but it would be nice if a there was a touch more attention pay to presentation.

Really the biggest issue we have with the software of the Venu Sq is that you have to use Garmin Connect to make the most of it. The companion app is very hit-or-miss in that it handles the basics well enough but need to use it at all complicates what should be a very straight forward process. Once you get to grips with it though the displays for all the data and important information are straight forward and easy to understand. Just a pity you have to jump through a few extra hoops to get to them.

Performance and Battery Life

As can be expected the battery life of the Venu Sq is fantastic. You’ll easily squeeze out six days of life from this thing without a charge. Of course that depends on what features you’re using but an average user won’t have to worry about the watch dying at an inopportune moment. If you’re looking at using more intense features such as the PulseOx mode combined with music and a sizable run every day you should still get roughly three days of battery life which is nothing to turn your nose up at. Oh and flat to full charge only takes 90 minutes which is a real pleasure even if you do have to use Garmin’s special charging cable.

It can struggle to keep up with activity on the watch face though. If a WhatsApp chat is particularly busy it there’s a notable bit of lag which can make using it a pain a hassle exacerbated by the fact that the display is so small but we’ve harped on about that long enough at this point.

Garmin Venu Sq Verdict

The fact that the Venu Sq is stuffed with so many features touts the battery that it does and comes in a cheaper than it’s siblings means that it’s definitely worth paying attention to. While it might not be as powerful as some competitors and features a screen that’s just a touch to small there’s still a lot to love about Garmin’s more budget conscious fitness tracker/smartwatch."

Cosmetics?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m not going to lie it was - and still is - hard! But at the same time it was exhilarating. The world to come is going to be like this: we’re all going to be disrupted 70000 times in our lives and we’re going to have to get out of our comfort zone more regularly. For managers like me this means making quick decisions based on partial information and no longer with full knowledge of the facts. And this is not an ability that can be learnt overnight it’s a muscle that you train throughout your life.

What measures have you taken to withstand the crisis?

Sabrina Herlory - We have trained our sales consultants in ""virtual selling"" i.e. one-to-one personalized advice at a distance. This has been appreciated by the teams who have suffered quite a lot during these periods of partial unemployment which are very depressing. They realized that even if there was pressure on the retail sector their occupation could evolve thanks to digital technology and not disappear!

And does ""virtual selling"" work for makeup?

Sabrina Herlory - Many doubted it but I can tell you that yes it’s very interesting from a human point of view and from a pure business point of view as well. The one-to-one digital concept is a bubble even more insulated than the physical experience in the store. It allowed us to maintain a connection with our customers who are used to human interaction when buying makeup. We launched these virtual appointments in September 2020 and 70% of the customers who received advice remotely then moved on to a physical store. Real remote personalized advice can channel traffic for brands when the stores reopen.

Is the humanization of digital the next step?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m convinced it is! This was the missing piece and the lockdown allowed us to implement it thanks to digital tools. It’s quite satisfying to say that yes there has been an explosion of the digital but what we’re learning is that consumers need to talk to real people! For me the brands that understand this will be the ones that will remain sustainable. If we can prove that the humanization of digital is turning into R.O.I. live chats will be one-to-one remote consultations will be one-to-one... Because we are all social animals with a real need for quality human interactions. And that goes beyond sales.

What does that mean?

Sabrina Herlory - Today if a brand is not organically socially committed to a 360-degree project I think it will not be able to count in the world to come: it’s ""how I treat customers my suppliers what footprint do I leave how do managers treat their employees"". I see more and more managers deeply preoccupied by this global commitment. They often come from the next generation I must say. They are socially engaged and that’s very gratifying!",,,,,,

It's an outcome that surprised Dr. Sumanta Chaudhri Saini KPC Health's chief academic officer.

""I was personally vaccinating healthcare workers and I would say I was surprised when I would ask a healthcare worker 'OK we can give you the vaccine now do you want to come in' and they would just say 'No thank you not right now.'""

So far nearly 3000 employees at KPC Health's seven hospitals have rolled up their sleeves for the vaccine but in Orange County between 30-40% of the staff declined to be vaccinated. In Riverside County the number is between 25-40% and at the one hospital KPC Health runs in San Bernardino County 40% of healthcare workers there decided not to get the vaccine.

""One did mention that they were in an immune-compromised state"" Chaudhri Saini said. ""They had inflammatory bowel disease and they felt that they were worried that taking the vaccine might somehow worsen their condition and I tried to allay their fears but they said that they just wanted to see how things went and over some time would reconsider taking the vaccine.""

She said she hopes that those who have not yet been vaccinated choose to get the shot since she said the best way to communicate to staff and the public that the vaccine is safe is for healthcare workers to get vaccinated.

""We also have been giving information about the type of vaccine that it is which is a MRNA vaccine and kind of trying to educate as to why some of the greatest fears — mainly people are worried that this is going to be incorporated into their own DNA and then somehow cause mutations and that kind of thing — why that's actually not possible"" Chaudhri Saini said. ""And we do have our infectious disease experts and other physicians and clinical folks helping to disseminate that information.""

Vaccines are not mandated for employees at KPC Health's seven hospitals but are strongly recommended.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzLWNvYS5vcmcvc3BlYWtlcnMvbHVpcy1mZWxpcGUtY2FycmlsbG_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luis Felipe Carrillo,Luis Felipe Carrillo is the president for GE's Central Area of Latin America (CALA) region.

A new study however reported a positive association between health insurance broker commissions and premiums paid by employers offering fully insured group health plans to their workers.

What's more brokers are also paid various types of bonuses by insurance carriers based on the amount of total business the broker has placed with the carrier the amount of new business delivered to the carriers or other types of metrics based on profit delivered to the carriers.

If you're an employer looking for fully insured health insurance plans your broker has every incentive to sell you a higher-priced plan compared to a lower-priced plan a plan structured to produce more profit for the carrier rather than savings to you a plan sold by the carrier that has a better bonus structure compared to a better plan for you offered by another carrier.

Larger employers often hire one of a handful of major insurance carriers to administer a self-funded plan in which the employer pays all of the medical claims incurred by its workers. The carrier is merely a claims processor writing checks to hospitals and doctors out of the employer's own bank account. What incentive does that carrier have to make sure the employer isn't being overcharged billed erroneously fraudulently or billed for inappropriate and unnecessary care at more expensive sites of care? None. They just mail the check. It's not their money on the line.

So fully insured employers buy plans sold by agents who have no incentive to keep costs down or recommend the most suitable plan; self-funded employers have carriers that have no incentive to keep costs down or quality high. That economic jujitsu is stealing prosperity and growth from American businesses and stealing the American dream from the working class.

What are employers to do? First smoke it out. Fully insured employers should ask their broker to disclose all dollars flowing to them as a result of the employer's business including all commissions and bonuses paid for health plans as well as for ancillary lines such as disability or life insurance. Employers should also ask their broker to disclose any end-of-year carrier overrides or bonuses that the broker will receive and from which carriers. If a broker is suggesting a specific plan offered by a carrier the employer should ask whether the broker is paid a different commission or monthly fee for that plan compared to other plans not being recommended. Transparency will help the employer understand the incentives the broker has to recommend certain carriers.

Second self-funded employers may want to enter into a direct fee arrangement with their broker who would receive no commissions from any carrier and instead is paid a flat rate or a per-subscriber-per-month rate directly from the employer. Some innovative brokers are also willing to guarantee their work by taking a portion of their fee as a percentage of savings year over year. The broker serves as a plan architect designing benefits and building a plan using an independent administrative entity an independent stop-loss carrier pharmacy solution and patient navigation services usually without needing the help of any of the well-known health insurance oligarchs. These unbundled plans are increasingly being used by employers who want to both save money and offer their workers generous benefits at the same time. Through flexible management and financing structures these plans are also becoming possible for small employers -- even those with under 50 employees.

Our broken healthcare status quo makes service providers brokers and insurance carriers do better financially when patients are sicker and are charged higher prices. Re-humanizing employer-sponsored health benefits will require competition on the basis of delivering the highest quality care for the lowest possible cost. The only way this will happen is when all the incentives in the supply chain including brokers and carriers are re-aligned to the best interest of employers and their workers.

The main emergency and specialist hospital serving north-west London will still get its upgrade but it might look quite different now. “Covid-19 has dramatically changed things” says James Kinross a surgeon who works at St Mary’s and sits on its redevelopment planning committee.

Before the pandemic Kinross says the committee’s goal was to improve the efficiency of existing care pathways; now it’s to rethink those pathways entirely. St Mary’s is a test case but the shape of healthcare is being reconsidered everywhere and that has major implications for the way hospitals will look in future.

George Mann an architect and pioneer of evidence-based hospital design at Texas A&M University in College Station compares the coming transformation to that of commercial airports in the past. The first airports resembled train stations because it took people time to realise that transport would never be the same again. “I don’t think we totally understand that we’re in the middle of a paradigm shift” he says.

That might sound like hyperbole given the eternally cash-strapped state of many healthcare systems and the anticipated economic downturn due to Covid-19 but think of the changes the pandemic has already forced through. The Chinese built a hospital in 10 days while in many countries medical consultations shifted online. Meanwhile existing hospitals – even and perhaps especially in the wealthy global north – buckled under the sudden immense strain.

Pictures flashed around the world of Covid-19 patients sitting in their cars outside a hospital in Naples breathing oxygen from tanks. Non-Covid patients have seen their potentially life-saving treatments postponed indefinitely while hospitals have themselves seeded Covid clusters.

None of this is surprising says hospital architect Thomas Schinko of Vasconi Architectes in Paris because the world’s richest countries have all but eliminated the concept of contagion from their hospitals infectious diseases no longer being the biggest killer there. “We’ve lost that reflex of protecting personnel from patients or patients from other patients” says Schinko. Result? “Our health systems are completely unadapted to this kind of disease.”

The pandemic has accelerated some trends such as the one to a “hospital without walls” – the hospital conceived as a digitally connected community rather than a circumscribed physical space. The twin pillars of digital health are electronic health records (EHRs) which allow patient information to be shared across health systems and telehealth which allows patients and physicians to communicate at distance.

Almost overnight we’ve gone from face-to-face consultations to the vast majority being by phone text or online

Many countries had been moving towards both since the 1990s but at different speeds and with different degrees of success. In the UK for example most GP surgeries now use EHRs but hospitals are further behind. There are genuine obstacles to embracing digital health provision says Saira Ghafur a respiratory physician and the lead for digital health policy at Imperial College London’s Institute of Global Health Innovation. These obstacles include inequality of access to IT and concerns about cybersecurity.

The risk of cybersecurity breaches was dramatically highlighted in 2017 with the WannaCry hack of the NHS while in the last year US hospitals have seen a wave of them. Such breaches can happen in any tech-enabled industry or domain but the case in September of a patient who died during a cyber-attack on a German hospital served as a reminder that the stakes when it comes to healthcare are the highest.

Nevertheless Ghafur says since Covid during which we have experienced the benefits of receiving care in the comfort of our own homes such obstacles seem surmountable. “Almost overnight we’ve gone from face-to-face consultations to the vast majority being what we’d call digital-first – by phone text video call or online” she says. “That has fundamentally changed the way that we deliver care.”

And she thinks those changes are here to stay. The results of a survey of nearly 10000 patients in London which her group will publish soon suggest that in general they want more not less digital healthcare. Though it certainly doesn’t suit everyone in future people will have more choice in how they access healthcare – being able to mix and match channels.

With the move to digital Schinko says we’ll see medicine becoming more preventive as well as more personalised and precise. Patients with asthma and diabetes are already used to monitoring their peak flow and blood sugar (respectively) through dedicated apps for example. And the adoption of a more “salutogenic” approach which emphasises health rather than disease is visible in China and the US which have invested heavily in digitisation.

In China for example the care pipeline for infectious disease starts at the airport with routine temperature checks (even outside a pandemic) while the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia considered one of the most technologically advanced in the US offers services through its web portal and in 2019 launched a pilot telehealth programme in schools. The goal in each case is to prioritise surveillance and early intervention.

This is the hospital without walls – the hospital that is everywhere embedded in our lives. And since some medicine will always require patients and medical personnel to meet it will inevitably shape the places where that happens too. Kinross says that before the pandemic the St Mary’s planning committee was considering shifting resources from inpatients to outpatients. Now they’re thinking more boldly. “Maybe we can just do away with some aspects of outpatients and deliver all of this care outside the hospital” he says. “Maybe we can leverage digital in a radical new way.”

Kinross envisages primary- care physicians or GPs taking on more responsibility (aided by decision-support technology) secondary care or specialist doctors spending more time in the community and an expansion of social care. Hospitals as physical entities will become specialist hubs he says with each specialism concentrated at one or a few hubs within a region rather than replicated across many generalist hospitals.

Such a health system might have been better equipped to manage this pandemic and reduce its impact but it’s unlikely to have prevented it. Since future pandemics are inevitable and since we don’t know when or where they will emerge how should healthcare systems prepare? “What we can’t afford to have is lots of empty beds in hospitals doing nothing waiting for a once-in-a-century surge” says Kinross.

Hospitals plan for all kinds of mass casualty events. But as John Mazziotta who runs the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) healthcare system said in a recent podcast planning is easier when these events involve a sudden influx of patients whose numbers then taper off. “This [pandemic] is a mass casualty event that evolves in slow motion in the other direction and keeps getting worse until it peaks and it was harder to plan for” he said.

Several solutions have been proposed. All patient rooms at the Ronald Reagan hospital which was opened on the UCLA campus in 2008 can be converted into intensive care rooms and all of them can be switched to negative pressure which stops airborne germs from escaping the room. Similarly after the Asian epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003 Singapore and Hong Kong adapted their hospitals equipping them and developing protocols so that they could be transformed quickly in the event of an epidemic.

The disadvantage of this approach is that the disease may erupt far from the hospital so an alternative solution is to rapidly build a facility dedicated to the detection and treatment of epidemic patients where it is needed as the Chinese did during Sars completing the Xiaotangshan hospital in Beijing in just seven days. They replicated that feat several times this year building Wuhan’s Huoshenshan hospital in 10 days for example. Made out of prefabricated units Huoshenshan incorporated testing and research labs and accommodation for personnel.

Other countries built fast too in response to Covid-19. Surge hospitals went up all over the US last spring while the UK constructed the temporary Nightingale hospitals. But many of these were underused or not used at all sometimes because they were understaffed. Architect Huang Xiqiu of the China IPPR International Engineering Corporation in Beijing who designed both Xiaotangshan and Huoshenshan hospitals says that the facility alone is not enough: “A systematic approach should be followed.”

That involves conceiving of the temporary hospital as part of a larger city- or area-wide disaster prevention plan organising on-site stores of medical and protective equipment maintaining a roster of available qualified staff and setting up an emergency command centre to oversee the execution of the disaster plan. It helped in China that the state assumed all the costs of the Covid-19 response.

Annmarie Adams a historian of hospital architecture at McGill University in Montreal says that it’s no coincidence the UK’s temporary Covid-19 hospitals are named for nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale. Architecturally they mark a return to the “pavilion plan” favoured in the 19th century when infectious diseases were still the biggest killer globally and ventilation was considered key. The original Nightingale ward had a barracks-like arrangement of bed-window-bed-window embedded usually in plenty of green space. After the advent of antibiotics the pavilion gave way to the “hospital-as-office-tower” model which bundled the specialties together in the name of efficiency and relied on those very antibiotics along with hygiene to keep infection at bay. Not surprisingly this model has proved the least well adapted to a novel viral disease. “We became addicted to antibiotics” says Mann.

If the hospital of the future is a specialist hub digitally embedded in the community those that specialise in infectious disease must also be capable of responding to an epidemic meaning that they must have built-in flexibility. Luca Aldrighi a hospital architect with RMJM Prague in the Czech Republic envisages a pavilion-monoblock hybrid. “In my opinion the future of the hospital is to take the best of these two layouts” he says.

There are different ways of achieving that but one way he could imagine is to have pavilions surrounded by gardens or piazzas and connected underground. In the event of a surge the pavilions could be expanded into the surrounding space through the addition of modular units.

Hospitals don’t just reflect the evolution of medicine Adams says. They are also shaped by wider cultural influences. Hospitals that once looked public resembling prisons and other reform institutions now look more like hotels shopping malls or airports reflecting a more consumerist culture. Nevertheless she agrees that adaptability will be the watchword in the post-Covid-19 world which has learned that it is still vulnerable to infectious disease. As she said recently: “I suspect hospital architects will focus on preparing for the unexpected.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYW5zd2Vyc2luZ2VuZXNpcy5vcmcvc2FuY3RpdHktb2YtbGlmZS9mZWFyZnVsbHktYW5kLXdvbmRlcmZ1bGx5LW1hZGUtYW5hdG9teS1leGhpYml0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fearfully and Wonderfully Made: The Anatomy of an Exhibit,"Meet the team of artists and writers behind the world’s most pro-life museum exhibit.

On September 25 2020 the first guests experienced the Creation Museum’s newest exhibit Fearfully and Wonderfully Made. They marveled at mesmerizing videos of 4D ultrasounds awe-inspiring details of human development and stunning lifelike models of babies depicting the nine-month development from fertilization to just before birth.

But just a few miles away the museum’s design studio was quiet with the lights turned off computers dark and desks deserted. After more than a year of planning designing crafting—and several weeks of long days that were necessary to meet the grand opening deadline—the designers and fabricators were taking some well-earned vacation time.

The psalmist declares “I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well” (Psalm 139:14). The design team certainly knows. Lead production designer Allen Greene said “Our team has tried in a small way to fearfully and wonderfully create this exhibit. It’s been a labor of love.”

In the beginning God formed the first human Adam from dust and breathed into him life (Genesis 1:26 2:7). Creating an exhibit that merely mimics that life was an incredible effort. But the challenge of creating gives these artists a deeper understanding of the Creator.

Masterpiece on Display

Fearfully and Wonderfully Made (FAWM) is a bit different from the museum’s other exhibits which focus on the authority of God’s Word starting with the six-day creation just over 6000 years ago. Though Answers in Genesis (the ministry behind both the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter) has always been pro-life this is their first exhibit that specifically celebrates the sanctity of human life created in God’s image from fertilization.

“It’s very controversial and very timely” noted Patrick Marsh vice president of attractions design. “People get lied to by so many people out in the world about what is a baby. We’ve lost the preciousness of life.”

There’s never been a better time for the Creation Museum to unveil this life-promoting exhibit to showcase the Creator’s masterpiece—us.

Casting the Vision

From the first vision-casting meeting in May 2019 the team decided that the exhibit would focus on celebrating human life and the fact that we are made in the image of God rather than focus on abortion. In fact the word abortion doesn’t appear until halfway through the exhibit.

With their vision in place it was time to think about the message. Content manager Tim Chaffey met with lead production designer Allen Greene to discuss a strategy for tackling the number of sensitive concepts in a way that would blend with the style proposed by the designers and artists.

Being able to see the details of little babies moving and smiling in the womb gives us insight into our Creator’s handiwork that no generation before us has ever seen.

—Tim Chaffey Content Manager

They brainstormed with people of different ages and backgrounds who were committed to the sanctity of life. They met with medical professionals people involved in pro-life ministries young women from other countries parents who adopted parents of premature babies and many others. They also viewed footage of 4D ultrasounds getting a close-up look at how babies grow.

Tim and Allen interviewed expert scientists like Dr. Georgia Purdom (PhD molecular genetics) Dr. Elizabeth Mitchell (a former obstetrician) and the late Dr. Tommy Mitchell. They also relied on the indispensable expertise of AiG’s anatomist Dr. David Menton (PhD biology) an award-winning former professor from Washington University’s School of Medicine and a long-time advocate of the unborn. (A plaque honoring Dr. Menton’s lifetime of research that informed this new exhibit is on display for museum visitors.)

In addition to describing the science behind the process of development the exhibit also addresses other issues such as adoption abortion and what happens after a baby dies—all topics that require a sensitive approach. But it would take more than just words to create an environment that would both inspire wonder at God’s design and communicate God’s comfort and forgiveness.

A Life-Giving Design

The delicate design language of FAWM stands in stark contrast to the other exhibits Allen Greene has worked on such as the ruggedness of Noah’s workshop at the Ark Encounter and the rusty warehouse textures of the new Relevance of Genesis space in the museum. But as a designer Allen has learned to be flexible to make his style faithful to whatever message an exhibit means to convey.

I’ve had three kids and I’ve never understood the kind of stuff that I’m just beginning to peer into.

—Allen Greene Lead Production Designer

“We are God’s art” Allen explained. “So this exhibit is a celebration of creativity and art.” The walls feature soft watercolor textures and cursive font. At the entrance the exhibit’s sign features a unique lighting effect pulsating with the slow calming tempo of breathing or a heartbeat. That was graphic designer Jenelle Cervenka’s idea.

Jenelle said she designed the walls and signs for the exhibit with one thing in mind: “We wanted it to be a space that would be healing and truly be pro-life and not in just the terms you might think of but truly be life-giving.”

Studying anything God made gives you a deeper understanding of who he is.

—Jenelle Cervenka Graphic Designer

The team knew that some guests who would visit the exhibit would have lost a child through miscarriage or some other tragedy and even some who might have chosen to abort their baby.

Jenelle’s past work at a support clinic for women facing unexpected pregnancies allowed her to lend a first-hand perspective of the challenges these women face.

“They are usually afraid and lack the support they need. Knowing this I thought it very important for the [exhibit] space to be gentle and genuine.”

The sensitive atmosphere Allen and Jenelle created prepares guests to appreciate the main attraction—the stunningly lifelike model babies.

Making Babies

Instead of sculpting nine models one for each month the team sculpted twelve representing the baby’s age when certain features are developing particularly features that people often identify with personhood. For example one model corresponds to the age when the heart begins to beat and another to the age when fingerprints appear.

Rather than purchasing models of babies from an outside source lead artist Doug Henderson wanted to design his own that he could pose as if they’d been moving and changing in the womb.

For 20 years Doug has sculpted likenesses for museums around the world among them sculptures of Kentucky Fried Chicken’s Colonel Sanders baseball legend Roberto Clemente and actor Matthew McConaughey.

But the babies for the FAWM exhibit were probably the hardest human models he’s ever worked on.

“Making something that looks like what God has made is one of the most difficult things you could possibly do” Doug said. “The difference between something that looks like a baby and an actual baby is like the difference between a photo of a skyscraper and a skyscraper. No matter how good of a job we do it’s not even comparing to what God has done.”

But guests at the exhibit who leave with a tissue pressed against their tears testify to the team’s masterful ability to replicate the Creator’s elaborate design.

Getting Started

Each of the baby models began on a computer screen. Studying the footage of 4D ultrasounds consulting medical textbooks and seeking Dr. Menton’s expertise exhibit artist Eric Remus created a digital sculpture of each model in a 3D modeling program called ZBrush.

Next using a 3D printer Eric printed the sculptures out of resin. The printed sculptures came out with a slightly uneven texture. Unlike the Ark Encounter animals Doug and his crew sculpted in the past a model of a baby has no scales or feathers to hide imperfections. A baby’s skin is smooth so the sculptures had to be carefully sanded with any cracks filled in with modeling putty. Too much sanding could flatten a curve or round a straight edge.

From his years of sculpting Doug knows the importance of precision. “The differences look big until you start measuring and realize that we’re all very tiny bits different from each other. A millimeter on a model can make a huge difference.”

First Things First

Next the design team used the sculptures to make precise molds that would hold the material necessary to form the models.

The first model doesn’t actually look like a baby at all. But that’s because the designers chose to replicate the first part of life—fertilization when the DNA in the father’s sperm combines with the mother’s DNA within the egg to create the unique combination of information necessary for an individual human.

The first eight models were made of clear resin carefully custom tinted by exhibit artist Jesse Pié to get just the right translucency of an embryo. Then starting with the ninth model the babies were cast from flexible silicone better for showing a growing baby on the move.

But Doug was puzzled over how to mold the silicone babies without showing seams all over. One night in a dream he pictured a mold with only one slit in the back. When the silicone had cured (hardened) the team could crack open the seam and “birth” the baby out the back.

Easier dreamed than done. The process was more like a nightmare. Due to chemistry problems with the material the team was left with only one good copy of each of the last four models. Time was closing in and the final deadline had to be met. Yet some of those castings had to be patched with more of the silicone used to cast them. Silicone is temperamental requiring exact conditions to cure. The team learned that silicone was “allergic” as Doug called it to their nitrile gloves and to latex. With even a small latex rubber band in the room the silicone refused to cure.

“If this was my first experience I would have said I need to find something else to do for a living” Doug confessed. “It was the worst experience of my entire career.”

When a silicone model cured Doug poured in a liquid soap to help loosen the silicone from the mold. Even then the models sometimes came out with parts of the mold attached and other times the model left behind bits of fingers or toes in the mold and even a chunk from the neck.

When it came time to mold the full-term baby the silicone cured on the outside of the model but not the inside. Just weeks out from the exhibit opening the model looked like a baby-shaped bag of pudding. So he wrapped it in plastic wrap and propped it up. Eventually the silicone cured—but it bore a wrinkled texture all over from the imprint of the plastic wrap. He had to resculpt the surface out of silicone.

Once the babies were molded Doug and his team scooped the silicone out of the floppy sculptures and threaded wires into the arms and legs to make them posable. Next they poured resin inside to anchor the wires.

Sounds of Life Benjamin Iocco has been fascinated with sound his whole life. As a boy he took a tape recorder outside and recorded sounds in nature for hours. When he was 12 he started composing his own music. “I love telling stories” Ben said. “Music is one of the best story languages.” Ben is a production designer with Answers in Genesis attractions not a full-time composer. But in 2019 Ben composed music for the Biblical Authority exhibit at the Creation Museum. It seemed a natural fit then for him to compose music for Fearfully and Wonderfully Made. First Ben learned what kind of message the designers wanted to reflect in the exhibit. Then he collected and tested sounds that captured the mood and emotion. “I look for the right sonic blend to tell a story. I wanted to reflect a feeling of wonder and beauty as well as a simplistic familiarity and intimacy.” He settled on sounds of the piano to bring an intimate feel with ambient textures in the background to give a sense of awe. He meant the underlying rhythm to replicate a heartbeat and the softness to resemble the way a baby hears sound within the mother’s womb. Though you won’t see Ben’s design his creativity plays a large part in preparing guests to receive the message. “I just hope the music allows the guest to reflect on the wonder of life.”

Final Touches

When all the models were finally molded Doug’s team set up a “clean room” where he could add his final touches in a dust-free environment. Someone hung the word nursery in pink and blue letters above the big windows in the front of the room. For weeks anyone passing by could watch Doug daubing the babies with flesh tone paints.

Doug claims he’s always resented sleep. “Why would I be sleeping when I could be making something?” His nonchalant relationship with rest serves him well. For weeks he spent 10–14 hours a day seven days a week working on the models. The pace caught up with him while he was painting. He shuddered. “The most unforgiving valuable thing I ever painted and I fell asleep right in the middle of painting.”

The Fine Details

To represent the fact that there is truly only one race of humans the designers intended for the babies to be ethnically ambiguous referencing a variety of genetic traits. The dark hair they decided to use meant a tedious task for the workers who would be punching (inserting) each individual hair into the silicone heads.

While trying to decide which kind of hair would work best on the models Doug ordered a bag of yearling goat hair for $60. The bag that arrived was the size of a sandwich baggie. “That’s ridiculous” he thought. There had to be a less expensive option. One day while walking through the fabrication rooms in the studio he spotted some yak skins most likely left over from the team’s work on the Ark Encounter animals in 2016.

Doug showed a small team of designers how to punch hair. After cleaning and coloring the yak hair they practiced punching it into the silicone heads. The designers learned to appreciate the complexity of growth patterns as well as the varying density and length across the head reflecting often on the knowledge that God numbers the hairs on our heads.

A professional who punches hair into models like these on a regular basis takes 33 hours for one head of hair. But the complications with the silicone models had left the designers with under two weeks to punch hair into the baby models. The work was worth it. The silky hair adds a final touch that makes these models look like real babies adding to the wonder of life.

Allen hopes these specific details will inspire each guest in individual ways. “For one person it might be a choice to let their baby live instead of taking the baby’s life. For another person it might be to find the eternal life God gives through the gospel. For another person it might be they’ve had a miscarriage and they see the hope of the gospel in that situation. Others might be contemplating suicide and see that they are fearfully and wonderfully made—that their life is valuable because they are God’s creation.”

Secrets on Display

“By the time you’re at the end [of designing an exhibit] you think ‘I’ll never do that again.’” Doug chuckled. “And about a week later you think ‘That wasn’t that bad. I could do that again.’”

And the design team will do it again.

Fearfully and Wonderfully Made is the first phase of an expanded exhibit which if all goes as planned will open later this year at the Creation Museum. Though the message of life will be the same the expanded exhibit will include more technology more of the lifelike models of babies in different stages of development and more educational aspects such as a section exploring the placenta’s amazing design.

The Psalmist said we are “made in secret intricately woven in the depths of the earth” (Psalm 139:15). But some of those secrets are now on display exquisitely crafted to give guests a greater appreciation of life created in the image of the Creator.

With the world in a tailspin oral histories have never seemed more urgent. For self-preservation. To add to collective memory. And to make sense of who we were how we got here and where it could all be headed.

“Oral history works on recording presenting and interpreting the voices of those who are often not included in mainstream history. This is about preserving an alternative public history” says Chowdhury who teaches at the Centre for Public History of the Srishti Institute of Art Design and Technology Bengaluru. She is one of the founders of the Oral History Association of India (OHAI) set up in 2013.

In the pandemic a new generation has been logging on. As OHAI moved all its activities online in October its Zoom workshop Starting Your Oral History Project was overbooked. Over 90 people — most of them students — signed up and OHAI had to conduct two workshops instead of one.

This was followed by two public lectures again well attended on Zoom and Facebook. The themes here were how Partition touched the lives of ordinary people conducted by OHAI member and author Saaz Aggarwal and oral histories of the Narmada struggle conducted by current OHAI president Nandini Oza 55 a writer and archivist.

OHAI members include chief archivist of the Godrej Archives Vrunda Pathare; Surajit Sarkar associate professor at the Centre for Community Knowledge Ambedkar University Delhi; and Pramod Kumar Srivastava retired professor of Western history at Lucknow University.

If it seems surprising that Gen Z would be interested in oral histories it might help to think of them as public histories instead. And in that sense it is easy to see why the OHAI mission resonates with a generation committed to recording the everyday in real time — on Instagram Twitter Facebook YouTube.

So is any person willing to tell their story automatically an oral historian? “While personal memoirs and diaries can be a rich historical source these do not fall under oral histories as here an interviewer is absent. In oral history the interviewer or oral historian is an integral and an important part of the process” Oza says.

A core skill for all oral historians to develop is the ability to listen without judgement to probe with the right questions. “For example when someone says ‘my first salary was Rs 100 per month’ ask gently or curiously how much did bread cost in those days or what was the rent for your home. And you might learn that the Rs 100 was a respectable sum back then” says author Saaz Aggarwal 59 who has recorded the oral histories of Sindhis and is an OHAI member.

Author and OHAI member Saaz Aggarwal interviews Ram Advani the renowned late bookseller of Lucknow .

The biggest give-backs of oral historians is that business histories and other institutional histories could be a new social history and throw new light in the making of modern India. At OHAI conferences Pathare who is also secretary OHAI has talked of her independent oral history work at Godrej.

“While corporate oral histories provide insights into responses of employees to changes in policies processes office culture etc. sports also emerges as an essential part of office culture in the 70s and 80s and employees’ participation as a part of ‘the Godrej team’ in various sports tournaments including cricket tournaments such as the Thane Vaibhav Tournament that helped create a sense of belonging” she says.

What are the histories that OHAI hopes young people will record? S Bharat 29 an OHAI member and an archivist at the French Institute of Pondicherry says young historians should find interesting ways of “capturing the contemporary moment”.

“We are at a major point of transition. There is so much social upheaval. There are stories and conversations such as those of the migrants that need to be caught so that they don’t fall through the cracks when we try to tell larger narratives of the nation” he adds.

Bharat a volunteer since July joined OHAI in December. “I joined because I felt it was important for practitioners to come together in a space that can give rise to collaborative work” he says. “Archiving can be lonely work. You can’t just work in isolation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRvbnJvc2VmdWxicmlnaHQuY29tL2VuL2tub3dsZWRnZS9wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMvOWNmNWZkOTkvaW1wYWN0LW9mLWJyZXhpdC1vbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZC1pbm5vdmF0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Impact of Brexit on technology and innovation | Global law firm,"Publication

More than three-quarters of the Pittsfield company's employees switched to remote working during the pandemic. PITTSFIELD Mass. — One of Pittsfield's largest employers has been able to maintain successful operations and help its neighbors during the pandemic.

General Dynamics Mission Systems has given back to the community with donations modified its workplace to prevent transmission of the virus preserved their internship program and were even able to expand in these unprecedented times.

""Despite the ongoing pandemic"" Director of Strategic Communications Brenda L. Burdick said. ""General Dynamics Mission Systems' Pittsfield team has adjusted their operations to ensure the safety of Pittsfield employees their families and the community while fulfilling our commitments to our vital U.S. and partner nation customers.""

Since the pandemic began the company has donated $194000 to various food banks and other charities that support communities near their operating locations with more than $85000 donated to organizations in and around Pittsfield.

General Dynamics have also supported medical facilities across several operating locations including Pittsfield donating more than 57000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves gowns and face coverings.

About 1250 of Pittsfield's 1600 General Dynamics employees have been working from home since March. To ensure the safety of employees and their families GD has shifted the majority of its more than 12000 employee workforce to work from home.

Manufacturing or classified workspace employees who are not able to work from home are protected from the exposure of COVID-19 by procedures such as restructuring work schedules to reduce the number of employees in the workspace requiring social distancing and mask-wearing in all GD facilities restricting travel to only support mission-critical needs and increased cleaning and sanitation in the workspace.

Burdick noted that despite the new regulations GD has delivered products to their customers in the same timely fashion they did before the pandemic.

""Despite this major shift in how and where we operate General Dynamics Mission Systems has maintained a nearly 100 percent on-time delivery rate"" she said. ""Ensuring our customers receive the capabilities they need to accomplish their vital missions.""

General Dynamics was able to provide internships to 50 Pittsfield professionals by preserving the annual internship program with adjustments made for it to be COVID-19 safe. Interns involved in non-manufacturing processes were provided equipment to work from home and a curriculum was established to ensure that interns have critical interactions with fellow interns and mentors in their programs.

""General Dynamics Mission Systems' internship program is a critical component to recruiting highly sought-after specialized engineers"" Burdick said.

GD's Pittsfield team also opened a new 8400 square-foot state-of-the-art manufacturing space for building the middle fire control system for the nation's new Columbia class and the United Kingdom's Dreadnaught class submarine fleet. The new addition will support about 40 production and test personnel into the next decade as the program's production phase will go through the early 2030s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNkYy5nb3YvbW13ci92b2x1bWVzLzY5L3dyL21tNjk1MTUyZTEuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine ...,"On December 20 2020 this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

On December 18 2020 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) vaccine (ModernaTX Inc; Cambridge Massachusetts) a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). This vaccine is the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized under an EUA for the prevention of COVID-19 in the United States (2). Vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine consists of 2 doses (100 μg 0.5 mL each) administered intramuscularly 1 month (4 weeks) apart. On December 19 2020 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation* for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥18 years for the prevention of COVID-19. To guide its deliberations regarding the vaccine ACIP employed the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework† using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.§ Use of all COVID-19 vaccines authorized under an EUA including the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should be implemented in conjunction with ACIP’s interim recommendations for allocating initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccines (3). The ACIP recommendation for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine under EUA is interim and will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Since June 2020 ACIP has convened 10 public meetings to review data on the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the potential use of COVID-19 vaccines including the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (4). Within the EtR Framework ACIP considered the importance of the public health problem of COVID-19 as well as resource use benefits and harms patients’ values and preferences acceptability feasibility and equity for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. To inform the EtR Framework the COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group comprising experts in infectious diseases vaccinology vaccine safety public health and ethics held 28 meetings to review COVID-19 surveillance data evidence for vaccine efficacy and safety and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines including the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. After a systematic review of available data the Work Group used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to the vaccine rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty) (5). Work Group conclusions regarding certainty of evidence for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were presented to ACIP at public meetings.

The body of evidence for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was primarily informed by one large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial that enrolled approximately 30000 participants aged 18–95 years (median = 52 years) (6–9). Interim findings from this clinical trial using data from participants with a median of 2 months of follow-up indicate that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine efficacy after 2 doses was 94.1% (95% confidence interval = 89.3%–96.8%) in preventing symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among persons without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection which was the primary study endpoint. High efficacy (≥86%) was observed across age sex race and ethnicity categories and among persons with underlying medical conditions. Ten hospitalizations due to COVID-19 were documented; nine in the placebo group and one in the vaccine group (9). Preliminary data suggest that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine might also provide some protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (7). Among vaccine recipients reactogenicity symptoms defined as solicited local injection site or systemic adverse reactions during the 7 days after vaccination were frequent but mostly mild to moderate. Systemic adverse reactions were more commonly reported after the second dose than after the first dose and were more frequent and severe in persons aged 18–64 years than in those aged ≥65 years. Most local and systemic adverse reactions occurred within the first 1–2 days after vaccine receipt and resolved in a median of 2–3 days. Severe local or systemic adverse reactions (grade ≥3 reactions¶) occurred more commonly in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients (21.6% versus 4.4%). Among vaccine recipients 9.1% reported a grade ≥3 local injection site reaction and 16.5% reported a grade ≥3 systemic adverse reaction. The frequency of serious adverse events** observed was low in both the vaccine (1.0%) and placebo (1.0%) recipients and without meaningful imbalances for specific serious adverse events between the two groups (8). No specific safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age race ethnicity underlying medical conditions or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. A detailed summary of safety data including information on reactogenicity is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html.

From the GRADE evidence assessment the level of certainty for the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was type 1 (high certainty) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19. Evidence was type 2 (moderate certainty) for the estimate of prevention of COVID-19–associated hospitalization and type 4 (very low certainty) for the estimates of prevention of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and all-cause death. Data on COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths are limited at this time; however a vaccine that effectively prevents symptomatic infection is expected to also prevent associated hospitalizations and deaths. Regarding certainty of evidence related to possible harms after vaccination evidence was type 2 (moderate certainty) for the estimate of serious adverse events and type 1 (high certainty) for the estimate of reactogenicity. Data reviewed within the EtR Framework supported the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. ACIP determined that COVID-19 is a major public health problem and that use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is a reasonable and efficient allocation of resources. Whereas there might be uncertainty about how all populations value the vaccine it was determined that for most populations the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects making the vaccine acceptable to implementation stakeholders. In addition implementation of administration of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is feasible. Although the vaccine requires a freezer (–20oC [–4oF]) for long-term storage it is stable at refrigerator temperatures (2–8oC [35–46oF]) for up to 30 days after thawing. This characteristic will facilitate feasibility of administration of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in most community settings once supply allows. Advancing health equity however will require efforts to identify and reduce access-related barriers to vaccination as well as engagement with community organizations and leaders among groups who experience disproportionate COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality and to expand access to clear and accurate information on COVID-19 vaccines (10). The GRADE evidence profile and supporting evidence for the EtR Framework are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-moderna-vaccine.html and https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-moderna-etr.html.

Before vaccination the EUA Fact Sheet (11) should be provided to recipients and caregivers. Providers should counsel Moderna COVID-19 vaccine recipients about expected local and systemic reactogenicity. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is not interchangeable with other COVID-19 vaccine products; the safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series have not been evaluated. ACIP does not state a product preference; a person may receive any recommended COVID-19 vaccine series. However persons should complete the series with the same COVID-19 product they received for the first dose. Additional clinical considerations including details of administration and use in special populations (e.g. persons who are pregnant immunocompromised or who have a history of severe allergic reactions) are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html. The interim recommendation and clinical considerations are based on use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine under an EUA and might change as more evidence becomes available. ACIP will continue to review additional data as they become available; updates to recommendations or clinical considerations will be posted on the ACIP website (3).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmdhemV0dGUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvMjAyMS8wMS9yb2JlcnQtYi1ib2ItZGF5dG9uLWpyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert B. ‘Bob’ Dayton Jr. | News Sports Jobs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sungazette.com/obituaries/2021/01/robert-b-bob-dayton-jr/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmdhemV0dGUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvMjAyMS8wMS9yb2JlcnQtYi1ib2ItZGF5dG9uLWpyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9saW1hb2hpby9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1tYWxvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD04MTg4NTA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Malon Obituary (1949 - 2020) - Lima OH - The Lima News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/limaohio/name/robert-malon-obituary?id=8188507 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9saW1hb2hpby9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1tYWxvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD04MTg4NTA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2hvdy11cy1mLTM1LXN0ZWFsdGgtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzLWhhdmUtYmVjb21lLWV2ZW4tbW9yZS1sZXRoYWwtd2l0aC1uZXctZ2F0bGluZy1ndW5zL9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2hvdy11cy1mLTM1LXN0ZWFsdGgtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzLWhhdmUtYmVjb21lLWV2ZW4tbW9yZS1sZXRoYWwtd2l0aC1uZXctZ2F0bGluZy1ndW5zLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How US’ F-35 Stealth Fighter Jets Have Become Even More Lethal With New Gatling Guns,"The US’ most advanced F-35 stealth fighters will soon be equipped with its 25mm Gatling guns which would make them more lethal on the battlefield according to reports.

American aerospace giant Lockheed Martin is known for fielding some of the most modern aircraft in the world including the Nighthawk Blackbird SR-71 and the F-22 Raptors.

And its most advanced fighter to date F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat single-engine all-weather multirole fighter designed to perform both air superiority and strike missions.

The fighter is incredibly stealthy has advanced avionics and can provide electronic warfare and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.

The fighter which comes with an impressive weapons load will turn more lethal with the integration of the Gatling guns.

The four-barrel 25mm Gatling gun also known as the Gun Airborne Unit or GAU-22/A has been designed for rapid-fire so as to quickly blanket an enemy with gunfire and to destroy targets.

The weapon’s maker General Dynamics said in a statement that it can fire 3300 rounds per minute. It has been under development for a number of years and was successfully test-fired in California back in 2015.

“This milestone was the first in a series of test flights to functionally evaluate the in-flight operation of the F-35A’s internal 25mm gun throughout its employment envelope.” according to a Pentagon statement.

The integration of the gun to the F-35 has been carried out in separate phases with the first phase of test execution consisting of 13 ground gunfire events. According to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) office this was carried out over a period of three months to verify the integration.

On the other hand the second phase of testing was aimed at the further integration of the gun into the fighter’s airframe during various types of flying conditions.

The integration of the weapon to the F-35 stealth fighter will further enhance its ability to carry out air-to-air attacks and provide close air support to troops on the ground.

According to reports the gun is also set to be integrated with the fighter jet’s software which will enable the pilot to spot and take down targets with the help of his helmet-mounted display.

The F-35 is the most sought-after fighter in the world currently with the demand coming from the Middle East and a host of other nations. It is already in service with nine nations.

The US F-35 is probably the only fighter that has the ability to take on the lethal Russian-made S-400 missile defense systems.

The F-35s and F-22 Raptors are the most capable fighters especially due to their advanced stealth features which enable them to evade detection on enemy radars.

Anything installed on the F-35 needs to be integrated in a manner that the fighters remain stealthy as ever and the integration of the Gatling gun has not made any impact on its stealth configuration.

A statement released by the JSF office said “Three bursts of one 30 rounds and two 60 rounds each were fired from the aircraft’s four-barrel 25-millimeter Gatling gun. In integrating the weapon into the stealthy F 35Aairframe the gun must be kept hidden behind closed doors to reduce its radar cross-section until the trigger is pulled.”

And so we learn to accept the loss of say our favorite classic snack foods or these 50 foods that simply ceased to exist. But 2020? Now this has been a year like no other in terms of its comings and goings.

Old-time restaurants we thought would always be there for us have shuttered their doors—even famous restaurants like these. Sure we've embraced the whole eating-at-home thing. We've even learned patience as we waited for our grocery stores to restock their empty shelves with our favorite items.

""It's just a pandemic-related shortage"" we told ourselves as we walked past said shelves. But as 2020 draws to a close we've come to suspect that some of the foods that have vanished are never coming back.

So we did a little digging. And the news was . . . not as we'd hoped. Read on to learn of the beloved food brands that have in fact disappeared in 2020 never to return again.

Read on to learn about The Saddest Restaurant Closures In Your State.

Snapple in classic glass bottles

Of course we're aware that some of Snapple's tea flavors are among the unhealthiest iced teas around. But if Snapple teas have a special place in your heart and you start noticing entire Snapple product lines have been missing for months from your grocery store how can you not feel alarmed?

In fact something is definitely up. But it's all for a good reason Eat This Not That! learned from a Snapple spokesperson. Turns out Snapple is retiring its iconic glass bottles in favor of environmentally sustainable plastic bottles which is why you're having trouble finding the drink in its recognizable packaging.

Costco sheet cakes

In June Costco customers were faced with what they thought was only a temporary shortage of Costco's famous half-sheet cakes. Of course to call it a ""shortage"" was a vast understatement. Those cakes were nowhere to be found.

And it turns out the beloved Costco sheet cakes are never coming back. A Costco spokesperson told Eat This Not That! that the grocery giant would now be focusing its efforts on smaller cakes. Here are 7 Costco items that may be able to take our minds off the loss of those beloved sheet cakes.

Lean Pockets

Yes Lean Pockets are among the7 foods nutritionists hate most. But some of us thought they tasted good enough to enjoy on an occasional splurge. Well those days are now over. In a tweet parent-company Nestle confirmed that Lean Pockets have officially been canceled.

These Pringles flavors

Among the 20 beloved snacks that vanished from grocery shelves this year were several Pringles flavors including Ketchup Kickin' Chicken Taco and Multigrain Sour Cream & Onion.

At least you can still get the regular Sour Cream & Onion flavor. And if all else fails you can always turn to this handy recipe to make your own potato chips at home.

Lay's Classic Multi Pack

In a year in which many companies found themselves re-evaluating their marketing and supply strategies PepsiCo the parent company of Frito-Lays made the decision to cut back production of a full 20% of its portfolio. At least during the pandemic they said. Well we've now learned that our favorite multi-pack featuring a variety of different Frito-Lays snacks is never coming back.

Yoplait Mix-Ins

Remember all those times this year when you visited the dairy section of your grocery store hoping finally to see Yoplait Mix-Ins back on the shelf? Well it turns out it was all for naught. The yogurt-and-crunch mix has been canceled and the company confirmed the news on Twitter.

These Kellogg's cereals

The year 2020 marked the end of at least two Kellogg's cereals including Rice Krispy Treats and Cinnamon Frosted Flakes. It's not like either of these were among the healthiest cereals on the planet. On the other hand they weren't among the worst.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

But apparently Kellogg's wasn't thinking about nutrition so much as popularity. Here are 19 fast-food items that got canceled due to a lack of popularity.

Fiber One Protein granola style

In a short Tweet reply to an inquiring Fiber One fan General Mills confirmed it had discontinued its granola-style Fiber One Protein cereal. No explanation was offered but the company promised to ""let the team know"" that this cereal's return would be welcomed. And at least you can still find General Mills' original Fiber One at the grocery store which is a very good thing because it happens to be one of the best healthy cereal brands for weight loss.

These Coca-Cola beverages

In late October Coca-Cola announced it would be discontinuing 200 of its brands representing the underperforming half of its beverage portfolio. At the time we already knew Tab Zico and Odwalla were on the chopping block. We have since learned that Coca-Cola Life Diet Coke Feisty Cherry Hubert's Lemonade Northern Neck Ginger Ale and Delaware Punch have been discontinued as well.

Jif Power Ups

Jif Power Ups we hardly knew ye. This creamy yet crunchy peanut-buttery snack food made with Jif peanut butter was introduced in 2018 but was discontinued as early as February 2020. J.M. Smucker Co. which owns Jif announced the cancellation of the Power Ups line in order to remain focused on their biggest crowd-pleaser: peanut butter. In fact the company has since launched a healthier peanut butter spread featuring no added sugar.

Mondelez International Inc. is adding a new Oreo variety to the brand’s permanent lineup: Java Chip. The sandwich cookies feature coffee flavored crème with chocolate chips sandwiched between two chocolate wafers. Each two-cookie serving contains 140 calories less than 1 gram of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

Kellogg Co. expanded its Raisin Bran brand with new Kellogg’s Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey. The cereal features bran flakes and raisins paired with whole grain toasted oats and a touch of honey. Each 1-cup serving contains 190 calories 5 grams of fiber 4 grams of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

“As a classic cereal staple we're always looking to innovate and deliver new experiences to our dedicated Kellogg's Raisin Bran fans” said Erin Storm senior marketing director of Kellogg All Family Cereal. “Just like the original cereal Kellogg's Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey is a heart-healthy option and makes for an irresistible flavor combination — combining our signature bran flakes and juicy raisins with whole grain oats and a hint of honey.”

PepsiCo Inc.’s Frito-Lay business is debuting Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix which combines traditional Cheetos with Cheetos Popcorn. Each 1-cup serving contains 160 calories 1 grams of protein and 1 gram of sugar.

“2020 was a year unlike any other in that we saw the incredibly popular introduction of Cheetos Popcorn in January quickly followed by world-changing events that affected every industry differently” said Rachel Ferdinando senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Frito-Lay North America. “For our brands we saw trends like Cheetos recipe searches skyrocketing 190%. So now we’re thinking with that lens through everything we introduce to the world. Hopefully Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix can provide a small moment of joy and bring a few smiles this year.”

General Motors is on a roll and the North American powerhouse plans to supercharge its electrified ambitions by spending upwards of $27 billion to develop thirty new global EVs by 2025. One of these new debuts will be a Chevrolet-branded pickup truck similar in size to the recently-revealed GMC Hummer.

Whilst its name has yet to be confirmed it’s rumored to carry on the Silverado moniker. Our very own Michael Gauthier got the low-down from GM’s recent investor conference which displayed a glimpse of the unrevealed full-size truck behind GM chief EV officer Travis Hester. Keen to see what it looks like? Well let’s shed some light and investigate further before the truck’s official debut.

Aggressive Appearances

While some rivals have embraced a radical approach with their upcoming EV pickups Chevrolet has struck an eye-catching blend of traditional truck mixed with a hint of Corvette DNA. The front facia has body-coloured contouring in place of a conventional grille and a lattice-like lower section with black plastic cladding. A unique lighting arrangement features split-level headlamps: the main beams are positioned low whilst the LED daylight running lamps are mounted high up.

The profile reveals tense sheet metal sculpting with flared fenders and many subtle creases. The deep sills and angled rear pillars are reminiscent of those on the new Hummer EV and unlike the Silverado there is no separation between the bed and the cabin.

Under The Skin

For the interior expect utilitarian practicality quality materials and immersive digital displays for the instrument cluster and infotainment touchscreen. The latter will feature Google’s voice assistant navigation and app ecosystem ditching the current in-car setup found in many other GM vehicles. Super Cruise will help take the stress out of commuting with hands-free driving and automatic lane changing available on compatible roads.

GM’s BT1 800-volt electric vehicle architecture will provide a stiff platform with optimized weight distribution and a low center of gravity. It also forms the basis for future Chevrolet GMC-Hummer and Cadillac electric SUVs and trucks and like the new Hummer an SUV variant will debut at a later date.

‘Ultium’ Performance

GM’s ultra-flexible Ultium EV architecture will offer performance that will leave today’s trucks for dead. If GMC’s Hummer EV3X is anything to go by we could potentially see 800 horsepower/9500 lb-ft of torque three electric motors and all-wheel-drive for a 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) time in as little as 4 seconds.

Of course those figures would be for a range-topping version; regular models will make do with a single motor/rear-wheel-drive setup or dual-motor/all-wheel-drive and an estimated driving range of 300 miles (~483 km) to a full charge. The high-density battery pack will have 350 DC kW fast-charging capability and future improvements will yield 450 miles (~724 km) of charge.

Electrified Rivals & Reveal

Rivals include the upcoming electric Ford F-150 Tesla Cybertruck Rivian R1T and Lordstown Endurance. Nikola’s Badger EV pickup was also to be a competitor; however General Motors have abandoned their original deal with Nikola and the Badger’s road to reality has evaporated.

The Chevrolet store on Plymouth Road that bore his surname was barely making ends meet. It sold about 120 new and used vehicles a month despite its desirable location that could easily deliver double or triple that amount.

So that year General Motors put it on the list of 2400 U.S. dealerships it would terminate under federal bankruptcy protection over the next year.

The showroom was stale the service area needed upgrades. The staff was downtrodden and defeatist recalled Jay Feldman owner of Feldman Automotive Group.

Yet Feldman saw potential in the store and its location. He would end up being the guy to team up with Tennyson to turn it around restoring the dealership's revenue and Kit Tennyson's reputation.

""The best part for me was Kit. In everybody’s eyes he was going out of business"" Feldman said. ""But when he retired he retired as one of the biggest Chevrolet dealers in the country and I thought that was pretty cool. That was cool for his family.”

A May-December friendship

Christopher ""Kit"" Tennyson who lived in Grosse Pointe Farms retired in 2017. He died this past October of ""a brief illness"" at age 73 his obituary said.

His dealership now called Feldman Chevrolet of Livonia is part of Feldman Automotive Group owned by Feldman. It has nine dealerships in Michigan and employs about 800 full-time and part-time employees. Jay Feldman's five Chevrolet stores sell the most Chevrolet vehicles in Michigan GM said.

Feldman Chevrolet of Livonia sells 400 to 500 total cars each month Feldman said. It is in the top 50 best-selling Chevrolet stores in the country a Chevrolet spokesman confirmed. There are about 3000 Chevrolet stores in the United States.

The store's success is a story of a young eager car dealer befriending an older veteran amid one of the most volatile times in the auto industry's history.

Tennyson and Feldman both grew up in the business; their fathers were car dealers. Kit took over the dealership from his father Harry in the 1980s Feldman said. At that time Feldman was still selling cars for his dad Marty and wouldn't become a dealer until the early 1990s. There was a 24-year age gap between Tennyson and Feldman who is just 49.

""But he and I knew each other for a long time being a fellow Chevy dealer since the early 1990s"" Feldman said. ""We were very friendly. We weren’t close friends or anything but we talked on the phone over the years and had been on dealer trips together.""

But their business friendship almost came to an end in 2009.

The unspoken wind down

Feldman is reluctant to talk about what he said was Tennyson getting ""caught up in the GM wind down in 2009. He was not receiving cars from the factory. I don’t know what he did to stay afloat; it probably was not easy.""

Part of Feldman's reticence is the fact that GM doesn't like its dealers to talk about that period when it went through a federally guided bankruptcy and government bailout.

But here's what happened. At the end of 2008 GM was in the red by $30.9 billion. GM's CEO at that time was Rick Wagoner. He led an auto delegation that included Chrysler Group and Ford Motor Co. to Washington seeking government funding to save the industry and keep GM out of bankruptcy.

But ultimately Chrysler and GM needed to restructure under federal bankruptcy protection. On June 1 2009 GM filed for bankruptcy protection and that sent a shiver down thousands of dealers' spines.

A month earlier it was widely reported that GM would cut 1100 of its dealerships in the first wave of the company's restructuring to reduce its dealership count. In total the company planned to eliminate about 2400 of its 5969 stores at that time.

In the end Chrysler terminated 789 dealerships in 2009 about a quarter of its pre-bankruptcy total. GM told about 2600 dealership owners that they would be closed in the fall of 2010 a 40% cut to total dealership count Automotive News reported in 2017.

Chrysler and GM eventually reinstated some dealerships but most of the terminations stuck.

Not ready to go

When GM sent termination letters out Tennyson Chevrolet got one. Livonia's mayor at the time Jack Kirksey lashed out at GM and Chrysler for closing three dealerships along Plymouth Road a strip that was a car dealership corridor.

Besides Tennyson John Rogin Buick and Livonia Chrysler-Jeep owned by the Holiday Automotive Group were to be closed down too.

But in a reversal of fortune in March 2010 GM sent letters to 661 dealers indicating they will be reinstated. One of those was Tennyson Chevrolet.

“This is a tremendous boost to the city we’re overjoyed” Kirksey told Crain's Detroit Business.

Livonia Chrysler-Jeep eventually got reinstated too. But nearby John Rogin Buick is now RightWay Auto Sales a used-car dealership.

Feldman said that Tennyson convinced GM “to give him another shot.”

“He wasn’t totally ready to get out of the business and it’s a great market” Feldman said noting Bill Brown Ford one of the largest in the nation is almost next door. “It is a great town to do business.”

Let's have lunch

In fact the store had caught Feldman’s eye years earlier.

“I knew it could be a lot more successful than it was"" he said. ""It was a good market with a lot of traffic and decent income in Livonia.""

Feldman has a knack for turning struggling stores into a success. In 1992 he became a finance manager at Jay Chevrolet and the store was struggling. His dad wanted to sell it. But Feldman was undeterred. He paid off Motors Holding as part of a year-long plan to get its debt off the books and boost its revenue.

In 1992 Jay Chevrolet's revenues were $25 million. Today Feldman Automotive Group's total revenues are $1.2 billion he said. That includes the dealerships in Ohio that he owns with movie actor Mark Wahlberg.

So in late 2011 Feldman called up Tennyson with a proposal: ""I’d like to talk to you about buying you out or partnering.""

Tennyson declined saying he was not ready to do a deal. Feldman invited him to lunch anyhow at the California Pizza Kitchen at 12 Oaks Mall in Novi.

""We just talked about the business family and what his long-term goals were"" Feldman recalled. ""His three daughters were not in the business so eventually he knew he had to do something ... build a new building and a lot of things he wasn’t really excited about.”

Tennyson assured Feldman he felt they would make a good team and if something changed he would let him know. So the two kept in touch a little here and there and Feldman trusted that ""Kit was that kind of guy to not do anything else without talking to me.""

He was right. In the spring of 2012 the two met for lunch again this time at the Cheesecake Factory in Novi to ""talk about what a deal would look like"" Feldman said.

By the third quarter that year the two signed a five-year partnership.

A brand new dealership

There was a lot to get done to turn things around at the dealership.

First it needed a whole new building because ""the old facility was really really old.""

To do that meant they could not store any cars on the lot while builders constructed a new service lane and showroom. So given that Livonia Chrysler Jeep down the street was still in its termination process and not open for business Feldman leased the parking lot there from the owners and stored the Chevrolet inventory there for a year.

Tennyson and Feldman started construction on the new facility in 2013 building an entirely new showroom and service lane. He declined to disclose the cost but said it was ""a significant amount.""

""We doubled the size of the service department put in new floors and paint"" Feldman said. ""We added 15000 square feet to the building repaved the entire lot put in new landscaping and new lighting.""

It took about 18 months to complete but by then Tennyson had ""the confidence to then see the way we operated our business and he trusted me a lot. I had the energy I was younger than him to push things along and he wasn’t ready to do that again.”

Merging company cultures

One of the more difficult things to do was make the cultural change that was needed to truly get the store's sales going. That means letting go of those employees who were downers.

""We just had to change the culture. We had a good number of people that worked there who had so many years of being the red-headed stepchild in the area and going through the whole wind-down process they didn’t see what I saw"" Feldman said. ""Some of them did — we maintained a lot of the staff — but manager wise there was a general manager who was pretty negative.”

He said some people left on their own when they realized it was not a fit there. The culture Feldman wants is one of ""winning"" and creating a fun work environment that will lead to long-term career-oriented employees mitigating turnover.

""We want to win and keep our staff informed of all the things we’re doing"" Feldman said. ""Before COVID we’d have quarterly lunches at every single store and give prizes recognize birthdays other employees would nominate employees for awards. … It’s a culture of having fun. We work hard we push hard but have a happy atmosphere.""

In 2014 Feldman changed the name on all his stores to Feldman to be consistent and created a brand so Tennyson became Feldman Chevrolet of Livonia.

A first partnership

After Tennyson retired at the end of 2017 Feldman bought out his half of the partnership. The two men stayed in touch.

""We would have dinner together the couples even meet up in Florida together and sometimes the Detroit Athletic Club"" Feldman said. ""Emily his widow I talk to and she is heartbroken because he died way too young. He got ill and it was fast.""

Feldman said he retains a soft spot for Tennyson his first business partner long before he met Wahlberg. Wahlberg and Feldman own a small empire together that includes three GM dealerships and a recreational vehicle store in Ohio five Wahlburgers restaurants in Michigan two in Ohio and two in Georgia and they are investors in F45 Training which specializes in high-intensity group workouts.

For Feldman his partnership with Tennyson remains special. He learned the value of consistent service to customers but the ability to always evolve too ""because the business is always changing.""

He simply cannot afford to have dirty books of accounts.

To him it is more fulfilling to maintain clear returns than register money that the business did not earn and rightly register. In his office on plot 188 Sixth Street in Industrial Area he recounts the three-decade journey one that started on a default line of his search for a source of livelihood.

In 1987 Kaahwa was a fresh graduate with a Bachelor’s in Social Sciences from Makerere University. His hopes of finding formal employment were slim because as he explains jobs were only readily available for the sons and daughters of the privilledged. He decided to venture into helping people process documents such as import licences application of import taxes driving permits tax documents travel clearances and this was largely for the illiterate semi-illiterate and busy business people.

The first job

At the time he lived in the boys’ quarters of the late Joan Kakwenzire who was a professor of history at Makerere University. Her husband worked for the Cotton Oil Seed Company and talked to Kaahwa about the company’s search of someone who could provide repairing services. The youngster was happy to take up the opportunity.

In 1989 he teamed up with a friend Blasio Kityo and pooled resources to start the spare parts company. They undertook a few on-sight garage training and within a short while the duo started repairing vehicles.

“We applied to Bank of Uganda (BOU) to trust us to service their vehicles and they contracted us. Within a year I was able to buy a car a Nissan Sunny at Shs2.8m. I occasionally mortgaged it to the Cooperative Bank to raise extra capital for the company when we had big contracts to execute” Kaahwa recalls.

Opportunity

In 1992 Eagles Motors applied to Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) for a tender to supply spare parts. At the time the electricity company had a policy of running an in-house workshop at Lugogo in Kampala so they asked the motor company to supply the workshop with spare parts. Whereas there were many mechanical workshops that also competed for the tender many could not interpret spare parts catalogues which was important when a company wanted to make orders for importation.

With the tender to supply spare parts Kaahwa and Kityo grew their enterprise from offering repairing and servicing services to importing spare parts. It was a capital intensive venture so Kaahwa had to sell his Sunny to raise more money for the business. They imported from Kenya.

At the time the business workshop was situated on plot 114 Sixth Street in Industrial Area. “I was mobile and would move with a ‘no problem’ bag looking for business. In my bag was a stamp and proforma invoice. If a client made an order I would sign them up and invoice them there and then.

By 1996 we had raised some considerably good capital to a tune of $10000 (about Shs36.8m). We moved to Prince House in Katwe which has since become Quality Chemicals. In 1999 we got a tender with British American Tobacco (BAT) to service their vehicles. It was another big boost” he recounts.

Buying current premises

With BAT came a good proposition. Part of the tobacco company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) was to encourage its vendors to buy premises. They had a special arrangement with Barclays Bank. BAT would guarantee its vendors to the bank to purchase property. Kaahwa attests that they enabled him acquire his current premises at a fee of $50 000 (about Shs184m) which has become one of the best investments the company has made.

As luck would have it Uganda Wildlife Authority Monitor Publications Limited Uganda Telecom Celtel Uganda gave Eagle Motors business and in effect a boost. The company grew from importing spare parts from Nairobi to directly importing from Dubai UAE. The company’s clients were the first platform of marketing its genuine parts.

“In 2002 we introduced an accounting system for managing and tracking repair history of vehicles we have worked on. One of the things that endears us to customers is transparency. The non-government organisation community likes accountability” the Eagle Motors’ director attests.

Training

Some of his clients include Plan international Uganda Concern International Goal Uganda Oxfam International and World Food Programme (WFP). “Our clientele is small but happy with the services we give. Five years ago Uganda police heard of our original and patented spare parts and asked us to supply their workshop and we have supplied them since to date” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG8vYmV0d2Vlbi1hLXByZW1pby1hbmQtcHJvZ3Jlc3Mtd2hpY2gtb25lLXNob3VsZC1pLWJ1eS0tMTgxNjExNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Between a Premio and Progress which one should I buy?,"Hello Paul I am keen on replacing my old Toyota Premio with a Toyota Progress. My friends are however discouraging me saying it is a very unreliable car. Kindly share your opinion. Francis.

Hello Francis the unreliability of a vehicle is usually caused by absence of readily available spare parts technical know-how to maintain the vehicle and handling. The other factor is procuring a car that has a poor maintenance and repair history. It is rare to find a car whose bad design makes it unreliable. That said Toyota Progress is a car whose maintenance and repair parts are readily available both at the main Toyota dealer and independent parts outlets.

Technicians with the skills level required to maintain the Progress are readily available. What is left is for you to find a car with a good service or repair history and to have the commitment not to cut corners by buying genuine parts and using a good mechanic to maintain the car.

Remember we often buy used cars with mileages around 100000kms. At this mileage the Toyota Progress needs to have service B mileage based parts replaced. Start with the timing belt and tensioning kit valve cover and timing case cover oil seals long life fuel filter ignition cables/coils and long life spark plugs. This will prevent oil leaks and the famous ignition and emission system faults. Renew all fluids including brake fluid engine coolant Toyota TIV gearbox oil and engine oil. Thereafter inspect and replace any damaged engine or body suspension. That ought to be the first major service before you ‘enjoy’ your ride.",,,,,,,,,

As the year ended the United States surpassed 20 million infections from SARS-CoV-2 and more than 346000 deaths. Globally cases rose to 83832334 and 1824590 deaths.

Cases in some parts of the country began surging again in the weeks after Thanksgiving; the same effect may be seen in January as health officials are gravely concerned about the extent of travel for the Christmas and winter holidays. The Transportation Security Administration said it screened the most passengers (1.3 million) on the Sunday before Christmas the most since March 15.

While vaccines began to roll out in the last month of the year distribution challenges became evident and the United States fell short of its goal of providing an initial dose to 20 million people by December 31.

This is an updated look at how the pandemic progressed throughout 2020.

January 9 — WHO Announces Mysterious Coronavirus-Related Pneumonia in Wuhan China

At this point the World Health Organization (WHO) still has doubts about the roots of what would become the COVID-19 pandemic noting that the spate of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan could have stemmed from a new coronavirus. There are 59 cases so far and travel precautions are already at the forefront of experts’ concerns.

January 20 — CDC Says 3 US Airports Will Begin Screening for Coronavirus

Three additional cases of what is now the 2019 novel coronavirus are reported in Thailand and Japan causing the CDC to begin screenings at JFK International San Francisco International and Los Angeles International airports. These airports are picked because flights between Wuhan and the United States bring most passengers through them.

January 21 — CDC Confirms First US Coronavirus Case

A Washington state resident becomes the first person in the United States with a confirmed case of the 2019 novel coronavirus having returned from Wuhan on January 15 thanks to overnight polymerase chain reaction testing. The CDC soon after deploys a team to help with the investigation including potential use of contact tracing.

January 21 — Chinese Scientist Confirms COVID-19 Human Transmission

At this point the 2019 novel coronavirus has killed 4 and infected more than 200 in China before Zhong Nanshan MD finally confirms it can be transmitted from person to person. However the WHO is still unsure of the necessity of declaring a public health emergency.

January 23 — Wuhan Now Under Quarantine

In just 2 days 13 more people died and an additional 300 were sickened. China makes the unprecedented move not only to close off Wuhan and its population of 11 million but to also place a restricted access protocol on Huanggang 30 miles to the east where residents can’t leave without special permission. This means up to 18 million people are under strict lockdown.

January 31 — WHO Issues Global Health Emergency

With a worldwide death toll of more than 200 and an exponential jump to more than 9800 cases the WHO finally declares a public health emergency for just the sixth time. Human-to-human transmission is quickly spreading and can now be found in the United States Germany Japan Vietnam and Taiwan.

February 2 — Global Air Travel Is Restricted

By 5 pm on Sunday those en route to the United States have to have left China or they can face a 2-week home-based quarantine if they had been in Hubei province. Mainland visitors however will need to undergo health screenings upon their return and foreign nationals can even be denied admittance. Other countries beginning to impose similar air-travel restrictions at this point include Australia Germany Italy and New Zealand.

February 3 — US Declares Public Health Emergency

The Trump administration declares a public health emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement comes 3 days after WHO declared a Global Health Emergency as more than 9800 cases of the virus and more than 200 deaths had been confirmed worldwide.

February 10 — China’s COVID-19 Deaths Exceed Those of SARS Crisis

The COVID-19 death toll surpasses that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak from 17 years ago totaling 908 reported deaths in China in the last month compared with 774 deaths in the SARS crisis.

February 25 — CDC Says COVID-19 Is Heading Toward Pandemic Status

Explaining what would signify a pandemic Nancy Messonnier MD director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases says that thus far COVID-19 meets 2 of the 3 required factors: illness resulting in death and sustained person-to-person spread. Worldwide spread is the third criteria not yet met at the time.

March 6 — 21 Passengers on California Cruise Ship Test Positive

Twenty-one people of just 46 tested aboard a cruise ship carrying more than 3500 people off the California coast test positive for COVID-19 with 19 being crew members. The ship is held at sea instead of being allowed to dock in San Francisco while testing is conducted. Since the event 60 passengers have sued the cruise line and parent company Carnival Corp for gross negligence in how passenger safety was handled.

March 11 — WHO Declares COVID-19 a Pandemic

CMS provides new rules for insurance coverage increasing what Medicare pays hospitals for COVID-19 treatments. Trump and Congress had enacted legislation calling for COVID-19 vaccines to be free but new rules were necessary to fit that policy into the various payment requirements for public and private insurance. The new rules waive co-pays or deductibles on vaccines for seniors with Medicare.

November 4 — US Reports Unprecedented 100000 Cases in 1 Day

The US hits a grim milestone with 100000 new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day for the first time. The unprecedented spike in cases leads to a shortage of N95 face masks at health care facilities despite increased production and workers continue to ration and reuse masks with no end in sight.

November 5 — Study Predicts Difficulties in Nationwide COVID-19 Immunity

An analysis of flu vaccination rates during the 2019-2020 flu season suggests that the path to vaccinating the majority of the country for SARS-CoV-2 thus achieving sufficient immunity will not be an easy one. Just 52% of the US population received a flu vaccine in the time frame of the analysis and the study also highlighted disparities: Lower vaccination rates were recorded in Black and Hispanic adults than White adults and elderly adults were more likely to receive a vaccine.

November 9 — President-Elect Biden Announces COVID-19 Transition Team; Pfizer Publishes Vaccine Results

After former Vice President Joe Biden is determined to be the president-elect on November 7 he announces the names of the scientific medical and public health professionals who will serve on his Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board.

November 9 — FDA Issues EUA for Eli Lilly’s Antibody Treatment

The FDA issues an EUA for Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab a monoclonal antibody treatment that mimics the immune system’s response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and appears to protect high-risk patients with COVID-19 from progressing to more severe forms of the disease. Clinical trials showed reductions in COVID-19–related hospitalizations or emergency visits in these patients within 28 days of treatment compared with placebo.

November 11 — Indoor Venues Responsible for Much of COVID-19’s Spread

A new study in Nature observes that most new cases of COVID-19 originated from indoor gatherings in places like restaurants gyms and grocery stores according to analysis of cell phone mobility data from large cities. The authors suggest that low-income neighborhoods have higher new case burdens because their public venues are more crowded and residents are more likely to work outside their homes.

November 16 ­— Moderna Reveals Vaccine Efficacy Results

The positive vaccine news continues with Moderna’s announcement that its experimental vaccine reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection by 94.5% in participants who received it. Like Pfizer’s vaccine the Moderna vaccine works using mRNA an innovative approach that has not yet been used in approved vaccines against any disease.

November 16 — FDA to Move Rapidly on EUAs for Pfizer Moderna Vaccines

On CNBC’s “Squawk Box” HHS Secretary Alex Azar says the FDA will move “as quickly as possible” to clear Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccine candidates for emergency use as long as the data support authorization. Both authorization applications are currently being completed but Azar says that the FDA’s teams are working with both companies to “remove any unnecessary bureaucratic barriers.”

November 17 — Fauci Highlights the Need for Long-term Follow-up of COVID-19 Effects

During a talk at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions Fauci discusses the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 and highlights the need to follow up with patients to better understand the long-term effects of infection. He points to symptoms like profound fatigue shortness of breath muscle aches sporadic fevers and an inability to concentrate which up to one-third of patients live with for weeks or months after contracting COVID-19.

November 18 — Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine Is 95% Effective

The results of a nearly 44000-person trial demonstrate that the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech is 95% effective making it as effective as vaccines for shingles and measles. Pfizer also announces that it will seek FDA approval within days so that distribution of the vaccine can happen by the end of the year.

November 20 — Pfizer BioNTech Submit EUA Application; CDC Warns Against Holiday Travel

Pfizer and BioNTech submit their COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA for an EUA making them the first companies to seek such an approval in the United States. The EUA submission includes safety data on about 100 children between the ages of 12 and 15 years.

At the same time the CDC urges Americans to stay home for Thanksgiving amid national spikes in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The agency recommends that people avoid mingling with people who have not resided in their household for the last 14 days. As cases in the United States surpass 11 million CDC officials worry that the situation could worsen during the holiday season.

November 23 — AstraZeneca Reports Vaccine Is 90% Effective; FDA Grants EUA for Second Antibody Treatment

When AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine is administered as a half dose followed by a full dose at least a month later it can be approximately 90% effective. This vaccine is easier to distribute and scale up than other vaccines and the drug maker says it can have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020 and 700 million by the end of the first quarter of 2021.

Meanwhile the FDA grants an EUA for a second COVID-19 antibody treatment. The cocktail manufactured by Regeneron was administered to Trump when he was battling COVID-19 at the beginning of October. In a clinical trial of 800 people the treatment significantly reduced virus levels within days.

December 10 — FDA Advisory Panel Recommends Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine

An FDA advisory panel endorses the first COVID-19 vaccine. The application for the Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine is heard in a public day-long meeting; voting 17-4 with 1 abstention the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) decides the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks for those 16 and older.

Examples include Ayvakit (avapritinib Blueprint Medicines Corporation) for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation (12); Koselugo (selumetinib AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) the first treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing tumors to grow on nerves (13); Pemazyre (pemigatinib Incyte Corporation) the first treatment approved for adults with certain types of previously treated advanced bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) (14); Tabrecta (capmatinib Novartis) for the treatment of adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body and whose tumors have mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping (15); and Retevmo (selpercatinib Loxo Oncology Inc. a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company) for the treatment of three types of tumors with alterations of the “rearranged during transfection” gene (16).

FDA also approved Zokinvy (lonafarnib Eiger Biopharmaceuticals) as the first treatment to reduce the risk of death due to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and for the treatment of certain processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies in patients one year of age and older (11).

Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals both received approvals for first treatments for two metabolic disorders: Dojolvi (triheptanoin) a highly purified synthetic seven-carbon fatty acid triglyceride as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (9) and Oxlumo (lumasiran) for the rare genetic disorder primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) (10) respectively. Effort to achieve the latter approval was coordinated by the Oxalosis & Hyperoxaluria Foundation and the Kidney Health Initiative.

Tepezza (teprotumumab-trbw) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) from Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC for the treatment of thyroid eye disease that can potentially spare patients from multiple invasive surgeries (8). It was granted priority review fast track and breakthrough therapy designations and supported in part by the FDA Orphan Products Grants Program.

COVID-19 wasn’t the only disease for which first therapies were approved. In fact many of the drugs granted marketing authorization by FDA in 2020 are first treatments. In May FDA approved the first drug for treatment of severe malaria (7). Amivas’ artesunate for injection was previously only available to patients through FDA’s expanded access program. Artesunate received priority review and orphan drug designation.

One of the most exciting approvals went to Gilead Sciences for its new treatment for patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (6). Veklury (remdesivir) originally was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in May 2020. Unlike the EUA the approval does not include pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg. The drug received accelerated approval under FDA’s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. Remdesivir was also granted fast track and priority review designations and a material threat medical countermeasure priority review voucher.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic FDA’s approval rate in 2020 remained high. As of Dec. 17 2020 50 new drugs had been approved by the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) (1) surpassing the 48 new drugs approved in all of 2019 (2). An additional 65 first-time generics were granted marketing authorization in 2020 (3). As the year wound to a close six small-molecule and two biologic drug applications had Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) decision dates scheduled before the end of 2020 (4) creating the potential for 58 approvals which would be comparable to 2018 (5).

A few first-in-class drugs too

Three drugs with notable mechanisms of action were approved by FDA in 2020. Rukobia (fostemsavir ViiV Healthcare) is a new type of anti-retroviral medication for adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have tried multiple HIV medications and whose HIV infection cannot be successfully treated with other therapies because of resistance intolerance or safety considerations (17). Rukobia received fast track priority review and breakthrough therapy designations. Winlevi (clascoterone cream 1% Cassiopea) for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older is the first acne drug with a new mechanism of action to receive approval in nearly 40 years (18). It operates via a non-antibiotic approach targeting androgen receptors directly in the skin.

Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) is a first-in-class anti-B-cell maturation antigen therapy for patients whose disease has progressed despite prior treatment with an immunomodulatory agent proteasome inhibitor and anti-CD38 antibody (19). It is one of five drugs from GlaxoSmithKline approved by FDA in 2020 and one of 10 ADCs receiving agency approval (1). Blenrep comprises a humanized B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via a non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; the mAb is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.

Alzheimer’s advance

Tauvid (flortaucipir F18 Avid Radiopharmaceuticals) is the first drug designed to help image tau pathology (20). It is used with positron emission tomography of the brain to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles a primary marker of Alzheimer’s disease.

Another T-cell therapy

In July Kite part of Gilead became the first company with multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approvals (21). Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel) is the first approved CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The autologous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy uses the XLP manufacturing process which includes T-cell enrichment a necessary step in certain B-cell malignancies in which circulating lymphoblasts are a common feature.

Patient-friendly treatments

Several new drugs approved by FDA in 2020 address both the disease in question and patient needs for ease and/or convenience. Vyepti (eptinezumab-jjmr Lundbeck) was approved as the first intravenous preventive treatment for migraine (22). The therapy allows many patients to experience relief within days and then over a period of several months. This ADC binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks its binding to the receptor. Biohaven Pharma’s Nurtec ODT (rimegepant) is another CGRP receptor antagonist for treatment of migraine but the only one available in a fast-acting orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) (23). According to the company a single oral dose of Nurtec ODT 75 mg can provide fast pain relief and return patients to normal function within one hour with many also experiencing sustained relief for up to 48 hours

Inqovi (decitabine and cedazuridine) tablets from Astex Pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical is a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia that can be taken at home (24). Previous intravenous therapies required a visit to a healthcare facility. Evrysdi (risdiplam Genentech) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy is also an oral therapy and the first for this disease (25).

FDA takes new international approach

International collaboration was emphasized by FDA in 2020. Two drugs were approved as part of Project Orbis an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners (26). Collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions regardless of whether the product has received FDA approval according to the agency. With a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs Project Orbis also facilitates a collaborative review to identify any regulatory divergence across review teams.

The kinase inhibitor Tukysa (tucatinib Seattle Genetics) was approved in combination with chemotherapy (trastuzumab and capecitabine) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced forms of HER2-positive breast cancer that can’t be removed with surgery or has spread to other parts of the body (27). FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Health Canada Health Sciences Authority (HSA Singapore) and Swissmedic (SMC Switzerland) on the review—the first time the agency worked with HSA and Swissmedic. Tukysa was also reviewed using the real-time oncology review (RTOR) pilot program to streamline data submission and the assessment aid to facilitate discussions among the regulatory agencies and regulatory review. The drug received priority review breakthrough therapy fast track and orphan drug designations.

Qinlock (ripretinib Deciphera Pharmaceuticals) another kinase inhibitor is the first new drug specifically approved by FDA as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (28). FDA collaborated with TGA and Health Canada on the review of this application as part of Project Orbis. Qinlock received the same four designations as Tukysa and the RTOR and assessment aid were used for its review.

Finally FDA granted approval to the first treatment for Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus) infection in adult and pediatric patients to Inmazeb (atoltivimab maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) a combination of three mAbs from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (29). The data used to evaluate Inmazeb were collected from a clinical trial and through an expanded access program conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during an Ebola virus outbreak in 2018–2019. FDA stated in its press release about the approval that international collaboration was key to achieving success in the fight against Ebola virus.

The pandemic has led to a surge in online spending speeding up the shift from physical stores by half a decade or so. Forget the chimney; Christmas gifts in 2020 came flying through the letterbox or were dumped on the doorstep. Workers at a handful of firms including Amazon and Walmart have made superhuman efforts to fulfil online orders and their investors have made supernormal profits as Wall Street has bid up their shares on euphoria that Western retailing is at the cutting edge.

Yet as we explain this week (see article) it is in China not the West where the future of e-commerce is being staked out. Its market is far bigger and more creative with tech firms blending e-commerce social media and razzmatazz to become online-shopping emporia for 850m digital consumers. And China is also at the frontier of regulation with the news on December 24th that trustbusters were investigating Alibaba co-founded by Jack Ma China’s most celebrated tycoon and until a few weeks ago its most valuable listed firm. For a century the world’s consumer businesses have looked to America to spot new trends from scannable barcodes on Wrigley’s gum in the 1970s to keeping up with the Kardashians’ consumption habits in the 2010s. Now they should be looking to the East.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3dvcmxkbGluZS5jb20vZW4vaG9tZS9tYWluLW5hdmlnYXRpb24vcmVzb3VyY2VzL3Jlc291cmNlcy1odWIvYmxvZ3MvMjAyMS93aGF0LXdlLXRhbGstYWJvdXQtd2hlbi13ZS10YWxrLWFib3V0LWRpZ2l0YWwtY3VycmVuY2llcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Worldline Global | Tap into our crypto currency knowledge: What we talk about digital currencies,"For something that may be the hottest topic in finance and technology this year digital currencies are the subject of a surprising amount of misunderstanding. Much of this misunderstanding is the result of some basic conceptual confusion so let’s try to clarify what we mean when we talk about money currencies and crypto:

Money is a type of value that is tangible like gold silver or diamonds. It is used as a means of exchange something that can be used to buy goods and services. Money has intrinsic value.

is a type of value that is tangible like gold silver or diamonds. It is used as a means of exchange something that can be used to buy goods and services. Money has intrinsic value. The euros and dollars you hold in your wallet are not technically speaking money. They are currencies. Currencies are a vehicle for transferring money value for example to buy something or pay someone. They represent value.

Whether money itself can ever be digital is an interesting question. Currencies certainly can be. For many years we have been using digital transactions to transfer representations of value. How many of us still sign card receipts to confirm a payment?

The most recent step in the digital transformation of payment is the digital currency often called as cryptocurrencies.

A small group of technological building blocks make cryptocurrency possible: Bitcoin is the best-known example of this. The Blockchain protocol supports Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. It is based on a smart mix of existing technologies such as cryptographic signature (hence the word crypto) peer-to-peer networks and hash functions. Blockchain is often referred to as distributed ledger technology (DLT). It creates trust and traceability in a digital workflow – in the case of Bitcoin for payments.

The first generation of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin attracted a lot of excitement as well as some critical attention because of a number of issues including:

The high volatility of their market value

The pseudo-anonymity they offer has made them popular with criminals who want to launder money

Now we are seeing the development of more stable and efficient digital currencies so-called stablecoins. Central banks and commercial entities have already begun to issue these currencies.

Stablecoins avoid price swings by pegging their value to real-world assets such as fiat gold and other commodities. They are based on blockchains that are private and permissioned: these blockchains are open only to identified users.



The new breed of digital currencies has been hailed for their perceived advantages when compared with any other currency or form of digital payment on the basis they are safer to store easier to manage and faster to transfer.

Current and future applications for stablecoins include:

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). An estimated 80% of central banks are already working on CBDCs potentially transforming their monetary systems.

issued by regional governments to reward good citizenship. Loyalty and retailing schemes to reward people for their custom.

schemes to reward people for their custom. Safe havens with intrinsic value. Tokenisation will also increase the liquidity of the market for the collateral asset.

Today there is extensive debate about the social and economic consequences of digital currencies.

Implemented responsibly they could pave the way towards a more democratic decentralised and efficient financial ecosystem. This could transform the way we make payments and transfer value.

The long-term impact of digital currencies is still uncertain. But the technologies underlying them are proven and the starting gun has been fired.

Black Box AI problem

Imagine that you go to your usual bank to request a loan to carry out works in your home and after a quick analysis on his/her computer the bank manager informs you that it cannot be approved. You have been a good customer of the bank for the last fifteen years and therefore you don’t understand the decision and you ask for an explanation. However the bank manager tells you that unfortunately it is the result dictated by the bank’s new Artificial Intelligence algorithm and s/he cannot explain to you the reason for the rejection. This situation is unfortunately already being played out in real life. In fact several notorious cases have occurred in the industry recently. For example in 2019 Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak accused Apple Card of gender discrimination through its algorithm denouncing the fact that the card gave him a credit limit ten times higher than his wife's despite the fact that the couple shared all their assets.

Artificial Intelligence provides great benefits for organisations boosting their efficiency and enabling new ways of working. But explainability is extremely crucial in systems that are responsible for decisions and automated actions.

Powerful AI/ML (Machine Learning) models in particular Deep Neural Networks tend to be very hard to explain (“Black Box problem”). Sometimes there is the dilemma of having to accept a particular model (a LSTM Neural Network for example) that works much better than another (a simple Logistic Regression) although it is more difficult to understand and explain.

Another major problem is that if there is a bias in the data used to train AI/ML algorithms then that bias will be present in the decisions that the algorithms make and this is clearly unacceptable.





The importance of explainable AI

Explainable AI refers generally to methods and techniques that enable an understanding of why an AI/ML model is giving specific results. This understanding of a model’s behaviour is very important for the following main reasons:

Presenting the model to a non-technical audience with interests in the treated use case.

Explaining why an individual entry receives a concrete prediction or classification improving human readability.

Debugging odd behaviours from the model.

Controlling the model’s behaviours to avoid discrimination and reduce societal bias.

The inclusion of explainable AI techniques by design in the AI/ML models offers significant benefits to those involved:

Company / Organisation End Users / Consumers Regulators Improve understanding Increase trust Compliance and regulations Improve performance Increase transparency Provide trust and transparency Evaluate the quality of the data used Understand the importance of their actions Ensure the proper use of sensible data Avoid bias Be aware of the data they share Avoid bias and discrimination

In order to have the benefits of explicability Data Scientists must design accurate AI/ML models but also take the challenge to explain the models’ predictions in a way that is comprehensible to a non-technical audience.

Explainable AI is becoming more and more a “must” in the design of AI/ML-powered systems and solutions (see the graph below)."

Special to The Courier

South Terrebonne baseball player Cameron Trosclair has signed with Loyola of New Orleans after he participated in the Fifth Annual International Power Showcase at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas home of the Texas Rangers on Nov. 5.

The 6-foot-3 240-pound Trosclair said he will likely play first or third base in college and might even pitch.

Loyola is a four-year NAIA school led by second-year coach Jeremy Kennedy who guided the Wolfpack to a 17-9 record last season.

“Not only is Loyola a very good academic school but the baseball program is moving up with Coach Kennedy” Trosclair said. “He had them going from .500 every year to being nationally ranked in NAIA. Just meeting with the coaches I knew then and there that it was the spot. It’s also in a great part of New Orleans. I am within walking distance of everything I need. It’s a great opportunity and gives kids around this are hope that they can make their name for themselves no matter if you are from Houma Thibodaux Chauvin or Montegut. Just keep playing.”

Trosclair said he enjoyed his time at the showcase in Texas which was held a few days following the World Series there between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Tampa Bay Rays. He placed sixth out of 38 competitors from the class of 2021 in the home run derby and had the third longest ball hit at 478 feet.

“They had pro scout day where they had scouts from 30 teams and they had the home run derby” Trosclair said. “I had a blast. It was a great experience. A couple weeks prior you had the Dodgers and the Rays playing in that same park. It was crazy. We were sitting in the first base dugout and guys like Cody Bellinger could have been sitting right where were the guys getting paid the big bucks.”

South Terrebonne coach Mike Barba said he was proud of Trosclair for picking Loyola.

“I am proud of him for not only reaching the next level in baseball but for the way he prioritized his academics by choosing an institution like Loyola” Barba said. “He has always had a high IQ for the game of baseball. We often talk through game situations allowing our team to think and perform at a higher level than our opponent. His intelligence will give him the opportunity to contribute right away at Loyola but his intelligence in the classroom will give him the opportunity to contribute to society for the rest of his life.”

Barba also said Trosclair signing with Loyola was also a big accomplishment for the Gators program.

“We will continue to grow into a state-wide respected program year in and year out because of the standard Cam and the rest of the seniors have set for the future” Barba said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL2Zvb3RiYWxsL25ld3MvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZm9vdGJhbGwtbm8tNy1kdW5jYW52aWxsZS1rZWVwcy10ZXhhcy10aXRsZS1kcmVhbXMtYWxpdmUtcm91dHMtbm8tMjEtZGVzb3RvL9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL2Zvb3RiYWxsL25ld3MvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZm9vdGJhbGwtbm8tNy1kdW5jYW52aWxsZS1rZWVwcy10ZXhhcy10aXRsZS1kcmVhbXMtYWxpdmUtcm91dHMtbm8tMjEtZGVzb3RvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High school football: No. 7 Duncanville keeps Texas title dreams alive routs No. 21 DeSoto,"The dream for Duncanville to get back to the state title game – but this time win – is still alive.

The former Federal Reserve chair disclosed a list of more than 50 paid speaking events for financial firms that included $67500 from Goldman Sachs $54000 from an event at Barclays and $292500 from a single speech for hedge fund Citadel.

The documents were submitted to the US Office for Government Ethics as part of Yellen’s efforts to secure the top role at the US Treasury. While she has already been chosen for the post by the president-elect Joe Biden she still has to secure formal approval from the US Senate.

The filings showed Yellen also earned $112500 from a single speaking engagement with UBS $225000 from a speech for PwC and $270000 from an event with the London-headquartered bank Standard Chartered.

It is common for high-profile government officials such as Yellen to take paid speaking roles after retirement. Ben Bernanke who served as chair of the US Federal Reserve before Yellen reportedly earned about $250000 for a single speech after leaving the central bank where he earned $199700 a year.

However Yellen – who earned just over $200000 a year when she headed the US Fed between 2014 and 2018 – said she would get official permission before taking part in decisions involving any companies that had paid fees to her once she was formally appointed to the Treasury.

Yellen also promised to step down from the Australian investment firm Magellan Financial Group from which she has earned $125000 as a consultant and about $225000 in speaking fees. She pledged to give up assets in 13 firms including the telecoms giant AT&T pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer and chemicals firm Dupont to avoid any conflict of interest.

Similar filings from the current Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood film financier before his appointment in 2017 did not reveal any significant speaking fees.

However Mnuchin promised to divest at least $94m worth of investments in 43 firms once he was appointed to Donald Trump’s cabinet. He was later criticised for failing to properly disclose he owned nearly $100m worth of real estate and held a directorship with offshore business vehicle based in the Cayman Islands a tax haven.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9ld2Fsc2gvMjAyMS8wMS8wMS95ZWxsZW4tZWFybmVkLTcyLW1pbGxpb24taW4tc3BlYWtpbmctZmVlcy1vdmVyLWxhc3QtdHdvLXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yellen Earned $7.2 Million In Speaking Fees Over Last Two Years,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/01/01/yellen-earned-72-million-in-speaking-fees-over-last-two-years/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9ld2Fsc2gvMjAyMS8wMS8wMS95ZWxsZW4tZWFybmVkLTcyLW1pbGxpb24taW4tc3BlYWtpbmctZmVlcy1vdmVyLWxhc3QtdHdvLXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEveWVsbGVuLW1hZGUtbWlsbGlvbnMtaW4td2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtc3BlZWNoZXMtNDUzMjIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janet Yellen made millions in Wall Street corporate speeches,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/01/yellen-made-millions-in-wall-street-speeches-453223 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEveWVsbGVuLW1hZGUtbWlsbGlvbnMtaW4td2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtc3BlZWNoZXMtNDUzMjIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy90ZXNsYS1zdG9jay1wcmljZS1vdXRsb29rLXRhcmdldC13YWxsLXN0cmVldC1hbmFseXN0LWdvbGRtYW4tanBtb3JnYW4tMjAyMC0xMi0xMDI5OTI4NTc30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Tesla Price Targets From Wall Street's Top Analysts,"Tesla's stock price skyrocketed 740% in 2020 but Wall Street is split on where the shares will move next.

2020 was a wild ride Tesla's stock. It opened on January 2 2020 at $84.90 (adjusted for the stock split) and will close 2020 above $700—that's a gain of over 740%. Here's where five analysts say Tesla shares are headed in 2021.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan analysts rate the stock ""underweight"" with a price target of $90 an 87% drop from current levels.

Tesla stock is ""in our view and by virtually every conventional metric not only overvalued but dramatically so"" a team of JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said earlier in December.

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs has a ""neutral"" rating for Tesla and 12-month price target of $780. On December 2 analysts led by Mark Delaney raised the price target to $780 from $455 telling clients: ""We believe that the shift toward battery electric vehicle (EV) adoption is accelerating and will occur faster than our prior view.""

Wedbush Securities

Wedbush's Dan Ives rates the stock ""neutral"" with a 12-month price target of $715 and a bull case price of $1000.



""Heading into year-end and 2021 we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025"" Ives said on Dec 29 in a note to clients. ""We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales.""

CFRA Research

Garrett Nelson senior equity analyst at CFRA Research senior equity strategist has a ""hold"" rating on Tesla and a 12-month price target of $750.

""After a YTD run-up of over 700% we think future growth expectations are now appropriately bullish and after a multi-quarter run of positive news we struggle to identify the next catalyst in the story. In early January TSLA will report Q4 vehicle production/sales and we continue to forecast it will fall just shy of TSLA's full year sales goal of 500K units"" Nelson said. "" While TSLA has materially strengthened its balance sheet through recent equity offerings the company's longer-term growth plans will require significant capital and we anticipate TSLA will face some bona fide competition in the EV space from Lucid Rivian and others in 2021.""

RBC Capital Markets

RBC Capital Markets has a $339 price target for Tesla more than a 50% drop from current levels.

""Our $339 price target takes a look at EV/sales- and EV/EBITDA-based multiple approaches and probability weights them (65% base 17.5% each for upside/downside)"" analysts led by Joseph Spak said on Dec 22.

Samuel D. Dobbs 22 is charged in Blackford Circuit Court with child molesting rape sexual misconduct with a minor and dissemination of matter harmful to minors.

He is being held in the Blackford County jail under a $50000 cash bond.

According to a report by Cody Crouse a Hartford City Police Department lieutenant Dobbs on Oct. 25 sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl near a mulch pile in the 500 block of South Monroe Street.

The girl reported she was attacked after she either tripped or was pushed to the ground by Dobbs who allegedly told her ""You're not going to be able to get away from me.""

Another girl who is 15 years old told police she and Dobbs had sex in her home's garage. The incident is alleged to have taken place on the same evening the other girl was sexually assaulted an affidavit said.

Dobbs is also accused of sending his older accuser and another 15-year-old girl photographs of his genitals.

During a Dec. 12 interview Dobbs told Crouse the allegations against him were false.

""I can definitely tell you that nothing happened between me and those two girls"" the Hartford City man reportedly said.

The molesting count against Dobbs is a Level 1 felony carrying up to 40 years in prison while the rape charge is a Level 3 felony with a maximum 16-year sentence.

Sexual misconduct with a minor is a Level 4 felony which carries up to 12 years of incarceration.

Judge Brian Bade has scheduled Dobbs' trial for April 6.

In 2018 Dobbs — then listed at an address in Arcadia Ohio about 45 miles south of Toledo — was convicted of driving while suspended and possession of marijuana in Henry County.

Dobbs told authorities he moved to Hartford City after meeting his current girlfriend through a dating website.

The town will not seek to purchase all or any part of the Asylum Avenue property bisected by Trout Brook Drive allowing its “right of first refusal” to expire Thursday along with a maintenance agreement for the property Town Manager Matt Hart said Thursday.

The property’s owner Ideanomics sought a buyer for the property — one of the few large properties left to be developed in West Hartford — after its plans for the $400 million FinTech Village dissolved.

Before the town took over maintenance of the former UConn regional campus in West Hartford the property became overgrown. The maintenance agreement expired Thursday.

Hart said the town has extended its lease another six months for the baseball fields on the property leased by the town from UConn since the 1990s and subsequently from Ideanomics.

“I know that Ideanomics is talking to one or more parties” Hart said. “I’m hopeful they will be able to come to terms with one of those parties in the near future and that we will be able to work with that entity to secure the ballfields and see that the property is remediated and redeveloped in a manner consistent with our plan of conservation and development.”

Hart said he has not seen the proposals being considered by Ideanomics and does not know the identity of the developers. But he has had multiple conversations with the broker Colliers International in recent weeks and has become comfortable that the entities submitting the proposals are reputable and they generally involve housing.

The former University of Connecticut campus in West Hartford is divided by Trout Brook Drive. At right 1700 Asylum Ave. is the location of baseball fields leased by the town. At left are the now vacant UConn campus buildings.

Colliers could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.

The redevelopment of the former campus is viewed as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost the town’s tax rolls. But the redevelopment has been complicated because portions of the property where many of the campus buildings now stand remain contaminated by PCBs. The cost of clean-up could figure heavily into the scope of future development.

It is unlikely that single-family development on the campus portion of the property would be a viable option given the costs of environmental cleanup. So that could mean apartments as an option which would be within walking distance of Bishops Corner.

But because the area is zoned only for single-family houses and uses such as churches a zone change or special permit would be required. UConn as a state entity was exempt from local zoning.

The property was listed without a sale price in September and brought to a painful close Ideanomics plan for a high-tech hub that was touted for its potential to bring hundreds of high-paying jobs to greater Hartford.

Fortunately it could not stop the flow of great Optimus Prime toys coming our way. Here are my Top 10 favorite 2020 Optimus Prime releases:



1. Earthrise Leader Optimus Prime

This figure isn't perfect but neither was the original Generation 1 Optimus Prime. For me the robot is almost perfect with regard to the look in robot and alternate modes articulation and the transformation almost all of which has been preserved and improved on from the original Diaclone Battle Convoy. Yeah the trailer is too small and featureless but NONNEF Productions fixed a lot of that (see below).



2. Daban 9907 Masterpiece IDW Optimus Prime

Sadly the IDW Optimus Prime has hardly been recognized by Hasbro or Takara but the third party Daban production of this MP scale and quality figure is hard to beat except for the original Generation Toy this is a reproduction of but I think this has a better price point even if its not quite as good as the GT-03.



3. Civil Warrior CW-01 General Grant

Civil Warrior has created the definitive IDW War Within Optimus Prime figure that not only captures the character very well but they have also improved and added to it with the amazing trailer and accessories.



4. Netflix SEIGE Nemesis Prime Spoiler Pack

What's not to like about this set it has got the SIEGE Robot with the Earthrise Trailer and a bunch of cool weapons and accessories that put the Takara TOMY Mall exclusive to shame.



5. R.E.D. Optimus Prime

I was sure I was going to hate this figure but it turns out to be really fun and is almost perfectly in scale. I am sold on these Robot Enhanced Design toys.



6. Masterpiece MP-38+ Burning Convoy

A sucker for clear plastic and repaints I am all over this release that was all the more attractive for the nicer price than the MP-32 and MP-38.



7. AOYI MECH Sai Star Commander Shattered Glass Edition

The Studio Series SS-38 Optimus Prime is such a good figure that it is hard to imagine the AOYI MECH Sai Star Commander is a little better and with Shattered Glass.



8. NONNEFF Earthrise Optimus Prime Upgrade Set

Just What the doctor ordered NONNEFF Productions filled all the gaps left in the Earthrise Leader Optimus Prime. While Hasbro did offer some accessories in the Generation Selects Centurion pack they didn't fix anything like NONNEF has with a new trailer door hoses repair arm and so much more.



9. Cyberverse Battle Call Optimus Prime

Cyberverse released a lot of Optimus Primes that were small ugly poorly designed and cheaply made. However the Battle Call Optimus Prime managed to offer a large-scaled toy that looks good with improved articulation and cool features even if it still feels a bit cheaply made.



10. Cyberverse Ark Power Optimus Prime

I am not going to lie the Ark Power Optimus Prime is a hideous monstrosity that doesn't even make sense. However conceptually the combined mode is something I just love for its over the top look and colors.

Beast Wars! 1995 McDonald’s Toy Document Gives Us a Previously Unseen Look at Early Franchise Development and Several Unused Toy Concepts!



Warm up your transwarp drive and grab some drive-through because we’re heading to the bygone era of 1995 to catch a glimpse at Transformers history! To a time before it was even called…BEAST WARS!



Thanks to Nathan at



In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”. However the most interesting thing in this section is the design that would become Cheetor being referred to as “Prowl” while utilizing the color scheme reminiscent of the McDonald’s toy that would ultimately see release as “Panther”. It’s often been suspected that the decision to deco the deluxe toy that became Cheetor as a cheetah may have been a decision that occurred after the sculpting phase was complete; it seems it may have originally been intended to be a panther version of G1 Prowl which would explain Cheetor’s very Prowl-like head sculpt.



Also mentioned in the document is the pitch for “Auto-Rollers” as the potential auto-transformation gimmick (another carry-over from G2) including four vehicle mode ones which unfortunately were not included in the document; though Nathan managed to grab an image of the moon buggy Prowl from another auction listing.



Check out the images mirrored below which include concept sketches of toys that saw release some that didn’t like sea turtle and dragonfly versions of Megatron and some that were originally conceived as different characters—like the Predacon Manta Ray who was originally intended to be Optimus Prime! Oh and a concept sketch for a lion Optimus Prime that pre-dates Lio Convoy as well as the evolution of the Under-3 toy from a G1-themed Optimus to the lion head that ultimately saw release! Warm up your transwarp drive and grab some drive-through because we’re heading to the bygone era of 1995 to catch a glimpse at Transformers history! To a time before it was even called…BEAST WARS!Thanks to Nathan at RoboticPlanetToys on Instagram who acquired a McDonald’s Happy Meal toy presentation binder at auction and has given us scans of the Transformers content within. I say “Transformers” because not only do these concept pages use the Generation 2 logo the name “Beast Wars” was seemingly not decided upon yet as it appears nowhere in the document. While we know Hasbro/Kenner initially intended Optimus Primal and Megatron to be the original G1 characters before the show opted to make them new individuals this document reinforces that as this predates the change from “Prime” to “Primal” in the toyline proper. Also noteworthy is this was apparently before the faction name “Maximal” was decided upon as the document states Megatron leads the Predacons while Optimus Prime leads the “Cyberbeasts”.In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”.

It's nearly the 25 year anniversary for Transformers Beast Wars the Kingdom line has brought the toys back to major retailer shelves the Masterpiece line slowly brings fantastically accurate robot and animal modes to collectors and the recent Japanese Beast Wars Generations book has provides wonderful background information about the development of the line. What better time to reveal previously unseen Beast Wars concepts courtesy of a McDonald's presentation binder! Did you know before they were Maximals lead by Optimus Primal they were known as the Cyberbeasts and Optimus Prime was their leader? Additionally two other alternative McDonald's promotions were being considered the Creature Autorollers and Vehicle Autorollers. Stay tuned for more posts showing off these unreleased concepts that will certainly contain surprises for even then biggest Beast Wars fans.

Also don't worry Littlest Pet Shop fans lots of reveals will be presented after this Beast Wars series.

Starting off this series from the McDonalds concept binder you'll be familiar with the alligator Megatron but might be surprised that no only is the bat Optimus known as Optimus Prime but there was a possible plan for a lion Optimus well before Lio Convoy from the Japanese Beast Wars II series existed. Also notice Scorponok was named Shockwave and Snapper was named Buzzsaw. Lastly the generically named ""Panther' toy at one time had a familiar Transformers name: Prowl.

Only Prowl/Panther' made it to Happy Meals in 1996 Scorponok in 1998 and Optimus & Megatron made appearances on the happy Meal boxes. The other concepts though give a peek at alternative ideas Hasbro/Kenner was considering strongly enough to relay to their licensees. Would ""Shockwave"" been fitting for Scorponok? Trukk not Liun???

The Beast Wars Creature Auto Rollers was an entire concept line that never made it off paper. Check out these cool illustrations of potential toys that would have completely changed the McDonald's Beast Wars Happy Meal promotion.

The last proposed Happy Meal Transformers were not the familiar Beast Wars animals and would have included Prowl Starscream Hound and Rumble as Vehicle Auto Rollers functionally similar to the Creature Auto Rollers. Sadly when I acquired the McDonald's concept binder it only included this description page. The moon buggy Prowl picture was eventually found online but I was unable to reach the owner to recover that page or find out if they have the others.

Here it is the last two pages of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars Happy Meal concept binder. The proposed but unreleased Under 3 toy was a very G1 looking Optimus Prime toy. Quite a bit different than the unnamed final product that better aligned with the Beast Wars theme.



... but wait there is more to come! I will have another series of posts from a subsequent iteration of concepts for the same Beast Wars promotion and it gets a lot more colorful too. Stay tuned!

In April 1996 one year after the previous Beast Wars Happy Meal concepts were presented Vehicle Auto Rollers were out and character decisions and toy colors were being refined. Take a look at these pictures of Megatron as a Sea Turtle and Optimus Prime as what would become Predacon Manta Ray. I have no information suggesting if these were original ideas by McDonald's or if Hasbro provided some input.

Who do you think would win in an aquatic robot battle?

Beast Wars Megatron concepts didn't stop with the Sea Turtle shown in my last post! A dragonfly Megatron was also being considered that had some interesting wasp-like coloring. Swipe to see the other pictures of a brilliantly colored Iguanus as well as Panther/Prowl in nearly final colors.

Next up I'll be posting what all these characters would have looked like as Creature Auto Rollers.

Next in this series of McDonald's Beast Wars concepts is the familiar characters from my last post but now as Creature Auto Rollers. Nothing too surprising except some color changes. Unfortunately this is the last that's seen of the Creature Auto Rollers as the fold out toy concept moved on into product. One more post remains in this series and it may be quite a surprise. Stay tuned!

Here it is the last post of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars concept series. If you remember way back to the second post of the series I showed line art of Optimus Prime/Primal as a fold out lion toy. Later I showed an alternate Under 3 toy concept of a G1 Optimus Head. Of course that means Under 3 was indeed supposed to Optimus Prime and here is the evidence of that. The robot head on the produced toy certainly resembles Optimus' masked face and crown but the lack an actual name for the toy and the early Optimus lion toy concept are two pieces of the production history that finally identity Under 3.

Instagram user Nathan of RoboticPlanetToys has posted scans of several never-before-seen documents from 1995 for the McDonalds Happy Meal toys of Beast Wars. User Vexwing of The Allspark has written a detailed article providing much information about these scans which reveal many early concepts from the Beast Wars toyline's initial development.I will let Vexwing's words speak for themselves since he has been planning this reveal with Nathan for quite some time:Here are the document scans complete with Nathan's own comments for each:To add my own two cents to all of this the Prowl/Panther concept brings new insight to this early Cheetor concept sketch:This artwork was scanned from the Beast Wars Reborn Golden Disk CD-ROM and when it recently appeared in the Beast Generations book the book's text accompanying it referred to its beast mode as a cougar.Evidently this Prowl concept is the origin of both the Cheetor toy and the McDonalds Panther toy explaining why they both have a very Prowl-like robot head.And now that we know that McDonalds Panther and Manta Ray were originally supposed to have been Prowl and Optimus Prime respectively it is likely that Beetle was supposed to have been Megatron and Rhino was Rhinox."

To top it off the performance (a collaboration with Moment House and VenewLive) was to be held at a secret location and feature a visual spectacle powered by T-Mobile’s 5G technology.

The night didn’t entirely go off without a hitch. Logging into the streaming platform VenewLive proved problematic for scores of Beliebers who took to social media to complain about trouble accessing the concert (sample tweet: “We don’t even need a NYC ball drop because Venewlive did it early”). Although the company had in the past hosted virtual concerts by BTS (“Map of the Soul ON:E” which brought in 993000 ticketed viewers) Blackpink and AJR among others the confusing registration process required of every user delayed the show from starting by at least 30 minutes. In fact as the clock inched closer to 8:30pm PT it seemed the production might miss east coast New Year’s altogether.

Getty Images for T-Mobile Jeff Kravitz for T-Mobile

Ever the resourceful bunch Bieber devotees found unauthorized streams on YouTube and Twitch but the second-generation screen share was a far cry from the multi-camera 1080-definition webcast on the official platform. Thankfully VenewLive sorted out its issues — the site crashed due to “too many people trying to validate their tickets last minute” it posted on Twitter (where it started the night with fewer than 400 followers) at 8:10pm PT.

In a statement released on Jan. 1 VenewLive said “The start time of Justin’s performance was delayed to accommodate the unprecedented demand. The extraordinary number of last-minute tickets that were issued and sold were at an overall volume and rate that far exceeded any pay-per-view concert we have ever seen.” That demand equalled more than 1.2 million T-Mobile customers according to the company.

At 8:45pm once “inside” the virtual show it was at long last possible to see the high-quality production that went into Bieber’s performance. Most impressive: the multi-camera control which allowed viewers to see additional angles from the back of the stage and above with a crane (see screen-grab below).

Getting “inside” meant being outside for those friends and family invited to view the concert in person at the Beverly Hilton hotel. The iconic building opened in 1955 and home to the Golden Globes since 1961 was designed in a V shape by architect Welton Becket allowing nearly all of its 500-plus rooms to have a balcony and a view. The “stage” was in fact the roof of the ballroom which also hosts the annual Clive Davis pre-Grammy party (it goes virtual this year Variety recently reported) and onto which half of the rooms face.

Concertgoers were checked into individual rooms with maximum occupancy strictly enforced (two or four depending on the room size). No one was allowed to interact with other guests in public spaces and the hotel’s services were mostly closed but T-Mobile generously footed the bill for all in attendance to receive a generous spread that included dinner dessert wine and champagne. Social media posts suggest that the balconies facing west really were the best seats in the house as they allowed a view from which to take in the full scale of lights lasers pyrotechnics fireworks and the 150-drone displays (Bieber’s initials a cross) used throughout Bieber’s 85-minute set as well as the intricate choreography of his eight dancers.

The idea to use the Beverly Hilton as a location for the New Year’s show came from Bieber’s management team at SB Projects in particular Jules Ferree the company’s head of brand partnerships. Speaking to Variety ahead of the main event she pointed to a longtime relationship with T-Mobile Bieber’s tour partner for his upcoming 2021 trek (AEG is Bieber’s tour promoter and CAA his agent) that made the show possible. “They have a great commitment to Justin and to us and have helped bring some crazy ideas to fruition” she says. The NYE plan first came together in late fall with support from SBP’s Scooter Braun and Allison Kaye. Their goal says Ferree: “To create an innovative exciting way for fans to experience a Justin livestream that was anchored and differentiated by the look of the location and where we could do it at scale to reach as many people globally as possible.”

While thinking global however they acted local. Los Angeles is currently ground zero for coronavirus infections and safety was of paramount importance. Says Ferree: “We followed all of the local and industry COVID-19 protocols making sure that everyone had been tested” in addition to the strict regulations related to accommodations.

By all accounts Bieber had a personal stake in how the evening would look and sound. “Justin worked so hard on this show” adds Ferree. “He’s been extremely involved every single day since he went into rehearsals which was back in November. He’s been wanting to to perform and this is a huge production.”

150 drones spell out “JB”

Indeed the 21-song set tested Bieber’s energy and vocal cords — after starting the song “Lonely” Bieber asked to stop so he could drink some water (“I’m literally gonna die” he said from the stage) — and pulled on many a heartstring. The song “Holy” was one such moment as Bieber declared his love for wife Hailey wherever she may roam (Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas who co-wrote “Lonely” were also in attendance). For his final number Bieber debuted a new song “Anyone” which dropped officially at midnight.

From ideation to execution Bieber’s New Year’s bow really couldn’t be pulled off at any other time other than COVID. Consider: when is the high-turnover Beverly Hilton completely vacant on New Year’s Eve? “It’s the silver lining I guess” adds Ferree. “It felt like the right time to do it. And to be honest we all needed something to bookend the year.”

The performing artist opened up in a new interview this week revealing that he was fed up with the fact that BEP is “not considered” a Black group. And he believes it’s in part due to their success all around the world.

The Los Angeles-born rapper singer and songwriter had a lot to say about that according to Source. For one he opened up about how he worries BEP isn’t fully considered a “Black group” saying (below)

“In 2004 Black Eyed Peas we were just trying to get on. I’m a Black dude but when you think of Black Eyed Peas we go so big that… and it hurts it still hurts a little bit that we’re not considered a Black group because we got that big. When you think of Black Eyed Peas…it’s no longer urban or Black culture which is… it’s not good for the black community that Black Eyed Peas is not looked at as a Black group because we had international success.”

Wow!

He went on from there too adding more about how it’s not just BEP that he’s worried about but how all Black musicians and musical genres are eventually colonized by white people.

He added”

“…That should be credited to the Black community more so than letting it be adopted. That’s just a thing that we suffer from all the time. When you think of Jazz you no longer think of Black anymore. When you think of Rock n’ Roll you don’t think of Black anymore… I don’t know why we have that. When you think of even country you don’t think of Black. A lot of the things that we create and we invent we dispose of or it gets stolen from us to the point where it’s not associated to its origins.”

Is that true for y’all?

When you think of jazz do you really not think of Black people any more? For what it’s worth will.i.am is at least definitely correct on the point regarding rock music and country… that part seems pretty cut and dry doesn’t it?

The comments here brought out quite a few responses too including this video from Kim Hill in which she tried to grapple with will.i.am’s claims (below):

The luxurious apartment at 93/1-9 Hughes Avenue is owned by international entrepreneur and former Gold Coast resident Wayne Sharpe the founder of trade dollar business Bartercard and more recently Carbon Trade Exchange.

Believed to be the largest penthouse on the Gold Coast it spans the entire two top floors of the Oscar on Main tower and has 360-degree ocean and hinterland views.

Bought new by Mr Sharpe for $2 million in 1998 when the The Oscar on Main building was built by Harry Triguboff the apartment has hosted a who’s who of corporate high-fliers and Hollywood starlets over the years including socialite Paris Hilton.

Marketed by Mark Stachura principal of Investment Real Estate Agency the huge 984 sqm penthouse is considered one of the city’s most extravagant and has been customised as the ultimate party pad by its well-heeled owner.

Speaking to media in 2020 Mr Sharpe said he pulled out all the stops for his birthday soiree where Ms Hilton was the most famous guest.

A Roman staircase with painted murals and overhead chandelier leads to a private rooftop terrace with a heated 2m-deep pool and eight-person spa as well as a barbecue area and multiple entertaining deck.

Inside soaring 3.2m ceilings and full-length windows maximise the breathtaking views with spacious living areas opening onto deep balconies.

There is a well-appointed bar billiard table and state-of-the-art Sonos sound system wired throughout the property worth more than $150000 while a three-tonne coral reef saltwater fish tank – thought to be the largest in the southern hemisphere – is an eye-opener.

“This is one of the largest and most extravagant penthouses on the Gold Coast due to all its features and with the 360-degree views and no neighbours it has been designed really well as a party penthouse” Mr Stachura said.

“The owner is a good guy who loves a party. He knows how to enjoy life and there have been numerous parties held here at the penthouse that will go down in Gold Coast history.

“The upper decks alone have hosted more than 150 people but the rooftop terrace with its own swimming pool is the piece de resistance” he said.

The sky home includes four double-sized bedrooms each with a balcony and ensuite and four security car parking spaces downstairs.

The master suite is equally swish with a mirrored bedhead private lounge and balcony his and hers walk-in robe and a marble ensuite bathroom with spa.

Privacy is assured by a lift arriving to the penthouse’s exclusive foyer with around-the-clock video monitoring and security alarm system for added peace of mind.

Ms Hilton’s international itinerary has included several visits to the Glitter Strip since 2005 when she stayed on the Coast for three months to film House of Wax.

She stayed at the five-star Palazzo Versace hotel in 2009 reportedly flying into the coast from Sydney on former world motorcycle champion Mick Doohan’s private jet.

The penthouse has been subject to a number of marketing campaigns since 2006 but to date has not changed hands.

In the 24 hours since lisiting on realestate.com.au Mr Stachura said he had fielded an “unbelievable amount of inquiry” with three prominent business people scheduled to inspect the trophy property this weekend."

(It has yet to fully recover.)

Here are 20 books I loved in the order I read them:

A Little History of the World

E.H. Gombrich

Gombrich is probably best known for his art history survey The Story of Art but he wrote this book before in pre-Nazi Germany. When a textbook publisher hired him to translate a history book for kids he thought it was so bad he could write a better one himself. So he read all day and wrote a chapter each night until the book was done. I love the way he starts and begins the book with visual metaphors to help kids picture history.

Boom Town

Sam Anderson

Sam is one of my favorite working writers but I didn’t really care much about Oklahoma City or basketball when I picked it up. And yet I loved this book. While reading it I was like “Is this as good as I think it is or is Sam nuts in the same way I am nuts or have I been driven nuts by reading it?” One thing I cannot get enough of is the sense when you’re reading a book that the author had a blast writing it — that they let themselves get carried away and went for the ride and wrangled the thing in just the right way so you could strap in too.

Normal People

Sally Rooney

Every year I try to read a bestseller that everybody’s talking about. Last year it was Educated this year it was Normal People. I got completely sucked into it much like I did the mini-series. The whole time I read this book I was thinking “Why am I so into this?” (Because it’s a good love story dummy.) By the way: the thing that unites bestsellers? They are compulsively readable — you can’t not turn the pages.

Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead

Olga Tokarczuk

Combination detective story and fairy tale with a huge dose of astrology and William Blake thrown in. (It gets its title from Proverbs of Hell.)

A great winter’s tale.

A Love Letter To Texas Women

Sarah Bird

A lovely slim book about Texas and the women who live here. I love her scenes of day-dreaming while wandering the aisles of HEB and how she writes about “neighboring” the quality she most admires in Texas women the “bone-deep instinct to be friendly to anyone who might cross one’s path.” (Rooted in the loneliness and struggle to survive in an often hostile frontier.)

My Private Property & Dunce

Mary Ruefle

Ruefle has really been my patron saint of lockdown. I love her sense of wonder her way with images and her sense of humor. (And her erasures of course which she’s as crazy about as I am.) I’m a huge fan of her essay collection Madness Rack and Honey and I savored My Private Property slowly one or two pieces at a time early in the morning with a cup of coffee. It took me a while to fall in love with her poetry but Dunce did the trick. Her short brilliant books are perfect quarantine reading. Get any title of hers from Wave Books they’re all worth it.)

Growing Without Schooling Vol. One



John Holt started his newsletter in 1977 “about ways in which people young or old can learn and do things acquire skills and find interesting and useful work without having to go through the process of schooling.” I read an issue every day tweeting out my favorite bit. A remarkable countercultural document of parents trying to figure out how to help their children learn from home at a time when homeschooling was in many states illegal. (Read my blog post about it.)

How To Be Idle: A Loafer’s Manifesto

Tom Hodgkinson

We’ve had Hodgkinson’s manifesto hanging on the fridge for years now but I’d never bothered to read this. Tons of references to some of my favorite books like Robert Louis Stevenson’s An Apology for Idlers and Lin Yutang’s The Importance of Living. I also enjoyed Hodgkinson’s book about parenting The Idle Parent.

Life Among The Savages

Shirley Jackson

I’d read both of Shirley Jackson’s most famous novels The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle but I was not ready for how much I loved her book about motherhood Life Among The Savages. It was so funny I would stop and read excerpts out loud to my wife until she read it too. The writers who gave me the most comfort in early quarantine were women grappling with art and domesticity — May Sarton’s Journal of a Solitude Eleanor Coppola’s Notes on a Life and Anne Truitt’s Daybook — but none of their books made me laugh.

The Annotated Alice

Lewis Carroll

This books collects Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through The Looking-Glass along with excised chapters alternate illustrations (thought Tenniel’s are in my opinion unbeatable) and other ephemera. The stories are worth reading on their own but the annotations give you a good context for what Carroll was doing.

How Buildings Learn

Stewart Brand

My wife read this in architecture school and we’ve had this on our bookshelf for over a decade now. I’ve gotten a lot of it through osmosis but I figured since I was working on these house collages now was the right time to read it. So good! Like Christopher Alexander’s A Pattern Language its lessons apply far beyond architecture. I think designers in particular would benefit greatly from reading it. Maybe my favorite book of the spring.

Tools for Conviviality

Ivan Illich

I picked this up so I could participate in the book discussion going on at The Convivial Society. (I read his book Deschooling Society years ago and it made a big impact.) Illich’s books are short but they’re so dense with ideas it can be slow going. Published in 1973 more relevant than ever. (Other great books I read that addressed art and social issues: Audre Lorde’s Sister Outsider Olivia Laing’s Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency Greil Marcus’s Mystery Train and John Berger’s Bento’s Sketchbook.)

Essays in Idleness and Hojoki

Kenko and Chomei

Two wonderful works of the Zuihitsu genre — “consisting of loosely connected personal essays and fragmented ideas that typically respond to the author’s surroundings“ — both read at my kitchen table. Somehow I haven’t yet been able to get into the other classic of the genre Sei Shonagon’s The Pillow Book but I can see revisiting these two every couple of years.

The World of Yesterday

Stefan Zweig

“The greatest curse brought down on us by technology is that it prevents us from escaping the present even for a brief time. Previous generations could retreat into solitude and seclusion when disaster struck; it was our fate to be aware of everything catastrophic happening everywhere in the world at the hour and the second when it happened.” Zweig wrote that in 1942 and he sent the manuscript off to his publisher before committing suicide shortly after. If you can get through this book you won’t forget it. I’m also a big fan of Zweig’s short biography of Montaigne. (For more reading on technology and disaster see Elisa Gabbert’s The Unreality of Memory.)

The Dyer’s Hand and Other Essays

W.H. Auden

I was brought to this book by two friends who also published great books this year: Alan Jacobs (Breaking Bread with the Dead) and Maria Konnikova (The Biggest Bluff). In his essay about Iago Auden makes this life-changing distinction: Instead of asking yourself “What can I know?” ask yourself “What at this moment am I meant to know?” I wore down my pencil underlining this book. Like many collections by poets the sentences sing and can be savored on their own. Here’s another: “Some writers confuse authenticity which they ought always to aim at with originality which they should never bother about.” A book I’ll be returning to often.

The Gardener and the Carpenter

Alison Gopnik

I’m in love with gardening as a metaphor for creative work and raising kids but I’m not in love with the second half of Gopnik’s metaphor. Based on my (admittedly limited) knowledge of carpentry it is a handcraft that requires selecting the right wood for the job and working with the grain not against it etc. I’m thinking for example of Pinocchio which literally starts out with a talking log and is about the perils of trying to “shape” materials into something they’re not. (For a great take on the parenting side of the Pinocchio story see Edward Carey’s The Swallowed Man.) A factory would seem to be more the opposite of a garden but that quibble aside I think this book is worth it just for Gopnik’s explanation of why she’s against parenting as a verb.

Other good books I read about education: Richard Feynman’s Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman Seymour Papert’s The Children’s Machine Murray Schafer’s Ear Cleaning: Notes for an Experimental Music Course Kenneth Koch’s Wishes Lies and Dreams: Teaching Children to Write Poetry and bell hook’s Teaching To Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom.

“One must never get tired of reiterating the obvious” Papert wrote and it’s true of so many great books about educating children: We know how it works best we just won’t or can’t do the things that really help children thrive.

Everything She Touched: The Life of Ruth Asawa

Marilyn Chase

I can’t remember the last time I was so inspired by an artist’s biography. “I hold no hostilities for what happened; I blame no one. Sometimes good comes through adversity. I would not be who I am today had it not been for the internment and I like who I am.” How does an artist go through so much and still work so hard and give so much without any hint of bitterness? How in the world did she make such great work and raise six kids? (Answer to that one: very little sleep.) Other good artist’s (auto)biographies I read: Esther Pearl Watson’s Galactic Halo and Andy Warhol’s The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again.

Caste: The Origins of our Discontents

Isabel Wilkerson

I picked this up after critic Dwight Garner called it “an instant American classic” and it gripped me immediately. Amazing read. (Her previous book The Warmth of Other Suns was recommended several times as a book with an unusual but brilliant structure.) I would expect this to be at the top of any 2020 reading list. I keep thinking about her metaphor of America as an old house — problems lurk everywhere and the work is never done. (Fixer-upper or a tear-down?)

The Illustrated Man

Ray Bradbury

This October I read a Ray Bradbury story every night before bed many of them from The October Country which is also excellent. I’d never read any of Bradbury’s short stories. It struck me how often manages to jam more ideas into a short story than most contemporary writers do in one novel.

A few years ago I had a reading-life-changing conversation with a good friend of mine a fiction writer who said “Everything’s good now but nothing’s that interesting.” He explained: Much of contemporary fiction is well-written on a craft level. The writers have been to MFA programs they’ve been through dozens of workshops etc. But how many actually have something to say? Bradbury had so much to say he seemed to be bursting. I shudder to think what a workshop would do with one his stories…

The Comedy of Survival

Joseph Meeker

One of the most intriguing and helpful books I’ve read in a decade. Put simply: Meeker advocates for a playful comic approach to dealing with our contemporary disasters. It’s interesting how well the comic vs. tragic mode maps to Gopnik’s gardener and carpenter. A memoir that embodies much of what Meeker talks about is Ernó Rubik Cubed: The Puzzle of Us All. (Rubik is the creator of my quarantine hobby.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxtdG9ubGluZS5jb20vdGV4YXMtc3BvcnRzLW5hdGlvbi90ZXhhbnMvYXJ0aWNsZS9BLUotTW9vcmUtd2FudHMtbG9uZy10ZXJtLWZ1dHVyZS13aXRoLVRleGFucy0xNTg0MDU5MS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A.J.

China’s C919 commercial jet aspirations are overblown and no threat to Boeing or Airbus Washington think tank finds

China’s C919 commercial jet aspirations are overblown and no threat to Boeing or Airbus Washington think tank finds

According to a report published in December 2020 by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington-based think tank American companies make up almost three-fifths of the C919’s primary suppliers.

However most of the parts are imported from foreign manufacturers including the engine avionics control systems communications and landing gear.

The Chinese government formed Comac in 2008 to design and build the single-aisle C919.

The C919 is a narrow-body jet being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) a state-owned company based in Shanghai to compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320.

Among the foreign suppliers the US’ General Electric and France’s Safran provide the engine; American firm Honeywell makes the flight-control system; and US-based Rockwell Collins produces the communication and navigation systems.

General Electric also formed a joint venture with the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) in 2012 to focus on avionics development for the C919.

Why is the C919 important to China?

China is among the world’s fastest-growing civil-aviation markets and the C919 is the nation’s ambitious attempt to manufacture its first commercial jetliner to meet its own rising demand.

The success of the project would be economically beneficial for China as it could break the country’s dependence on the duopoly currently enjoyed by Boeing and Airbus and has the potential to catapult Comac into the multibillion-dollar aviation industry.

The C919’s development also coincides with China’s objective of cutting its reliance on foreign technology and increasing investment to achieve indigenous innovation.

The plane’s development was an integral element of the “Made in China 2025” plan a road map from 2018 that Beijing hoped would help lift its hi-tech industries to international levels.

Made in China 2025 has since been officially downplayed by Beijing due to pressure from its key trading partners including the US and the European Union but China is still aiming to increase its reliance on domestic production for key components including computer chips and controlling systems.

The C919 was also mentioned by President Xi Jinping in his report at the 19th National Congress in 2017 along with the nation’s other scientific achievements as drivers of China’s “new model of development”.

How does the US-China relationship impact the development of the C919?

While China has been among the biggest buyers of US aviation products its state-driven investment in aviation which has included buying US aerospace companies has set off alarm bells in Washington.

Beijing’s national strategy of “military-civil fusion” a policy that aims to use civil technology to strengthen its military capacity and development is also a concern for the US.

commissioned a report to look into how the Chinese government was growing its aviation manufacturing business and the resulting military implications. In 2017 the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission – which advises the US Congress –

According to a report published in December 2020 by a Washington-based think tank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) American companies make up almost three-fifths of the C919’s primary suppliers. Photo: Twitter

The report compiled by the Rand Corporation found that China’s total investment in US aerospace companies over the past decade was relatively small and involved low-end technology.

There were some concerns over technology transfers through joint ventures connected with the C919 project but the report also cited experts saying that the risk was low because of US export-control restrictions.

Aerospace products are valuable exports for the US economy and integral to its national security. Many aviation products fall under US export-controls restrictions including the CFM International LEAP or Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion engine produced in a joint venture between General Electric and Safran that is used on the C919.

China’s investment in US aviation companies is also subject to review and approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is an inter-agency group of the US government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in US companies or operations.

But as relations between Beijing and Washington have soured the US government has tightened its regulations over the sales of aviation products to China potentially adding hurdles to the development of the C919.

In December 2020 the US Department of Commerce released a list of “military end users”  covering aerospace companies from China and Russia that had military ties meaning they will be restricted from buying a wide range of US components and technology.

While Comac is not on the list seven entities related to AVIC which holds a minority share of Comac were included.

On January 14 2021 the US Department of Defence added nine Chinese companies including Comac to its list of ""Communist Chinese military companies"".

Under an earlier executive order signed last year by then president Donald Trump American investors were prohibited from certain transactions in securities related to certain listed companies. Comac is not a publicly traded company but it has sold bonds in the Chinese securities market.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it is “determined to highlight and counter the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Military-Civil Fusion development strategy which supports the modernisation goals of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies universities and research programs that appear to be civilian entities”.

Earlier in 2020 the US government was weighing whether to deny General Electric’s request to provide the LEAP engines for the C919. It eventually approved the licence for the jet-engine sales after President Donald Trump said the US should not prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China.

What is the outlook for the C919?

The C919 made its maiden test flight in 2017 but has yet to be certified.

Its chief designer Wu Guanghui told Chinese media in November 2020 that the narrow-body jetliner was aiming to receive a type certification by the end of 2021 after the airline regulator the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) authorised the C919 to begin the testing process.

The C919 began undergoing cold-weather test flights in December 2020 in the far northern city of Hulunbuir Inner Mongolia. The plane was also reportedly being tested in other parts of China and mainland media outlets have reported that deliveries of the jet will begin in late 2021 as scheduled.

Comac said airlines and aircraft-leasing firms have placed orders for 1065 C919s with the vast majority of demand coming from Chinese carriers.

Comac has consistently over-promised on its ability to get through each of these stages and hence it is not worth speculating how many more years remain before the first paying customers find their seat for a regular commercial flight Scott Kennedy

However some analysts believe it will take some time before the C919 receives certification from the CAAC and even longer to receive certification by US and European aviation regulators before China is able to sell the C919 in these large foreign markets.

“Comac has consistently over-promised on its ability to get through each of these stages and hence it is not worth speculating how many more years remain before the first paying customers find their seat for a regular commercial flight” said Scott Kennedy a senior CSIS adviser who is responsible for research into Comac.

Kennedy estimated in December 2020 that Comac had already received between US$49 billion and US$72.1 billion from the Chinese government for the C919.

And it appears unlikely that China will stop channelling state money into the C919.

In 2016 Beijing set up the Aero Engine Corporation of China to build an indigenous engine for the C919 the CJ-1000AX in the hope that it could eventually replace the LEAP engine produced by General Electric and Safran.

Under Xi’s so-called dual-circulation strategy which focuses on home-grown innovation to counter external hostility China is accelerating its technology development and investment.

Liu Daxiang deputy director of the science and technology committee at AVIC said in December 2020 that producing a jet engine was an urgent political task but conceded that its production would take a long time because China lacks research experience and data.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the property will generate outsize growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders"" he said.

Together the two hotels have a combined key count of 721 rooms with average size of approximately 500 square feet with a 75% suite mix.

HST has acquired a fee simple interest in The Alida Savannah for approximately $103 million in cash. The 173-room boutique hotel was opened in October 2018 and continues to benefit from soft branding in Marriott’s Tribute Portfolio.

Host Hotels expects stabilization for The Alida in 2024-2025 with roughly 11-12x earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and expects it to deliver roughly $240 of revenue per available room (RevPAR). The stabilized EBITDA for the property is in line with Host Hotels’ estimate of normalized 2019 operations and adjusts for construction disruption to the surrounding Plant Riverside District and the initial ramp-up of the hotel operations.

The property is situated in Savannah’s historic district and is adjacent to a newly developed entertainment district which includes the Plant Riverside District. Savannah is a drive-to leisure destination for fast-growing markets in the Southeast and enjoys increasing number of travelers through the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. Hence with the resumption of travel and recovery in leisure demand the acquired hotel is likely to attract leisure travelers.

The hotel offers 11570 square feet of meeting space four F&B outlets with a rooftop bar an outdoor pool and a street-front retail space. Besides the property will provide a $271-million convention center expansion to be completed in 2024. This will enable the property to attract in-house and out-of-house group demand and offers scope for higher group and business bookings.

In addition Host Hotels is making efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through dispositions of non-strategic properties. It sold leasehold interest in the 305-room W Hollywood for a total sales price of roughly $197 million which includes $3 million for the furniture fixtures & equipment replacement funds. The sale price reflects a 25.0x EBITDA multiple on 2019 EBITDA consisting nearly $33 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures over the next five years.

Per management “We continue to be very active on the capital allocation front as we target new markets. Year to date we have invested $1.3 billion in early-cycle acquisitions. The blended EBITDA multiple on our six hotel acquisitions in 2021 is 12.9X which compares favorably to the nearly $750 million generated from our six hotel dispositions at a 16.0X EBITDA multiple including foregone capital expenditures.”

I open with that because frankly it's among the most important features.

Sure this thing is powerful. It has Intel's Comet Lake S processors and in the one that HP sent me it has a Core i9-10900K. It also comes with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3080 GPU so there's a ton of power here. However those are off the shelf parts that you can get in any new gaming PC. The things that are actually going to get you better performance over the competition are things like thermals faster memory and faster storage.

Specifically this is the HP OMEN 30L GT13-0093. You can find out more here.

Design

When it comes to design there's a lot to unpack here at least for something that's a big box. It's not just style but we have to look at RGB lighting thermals cabling ports upgradability and more.

Style is important too of course. You'll want a PC that matches who you are. The OMEN 30L has a very clean minimal design and it shows through the glass front panel. Behind that is the new diamond OMEN logo which is lit up with RGB lighting and also behind glass is a big RGB fan. That fan is actually utilizing a grille on the sides as it's located in a larger chamber behind the glass.

There are two other RGB lighting areas inside of the desktop. One is inside of the chassis on top. The other is the four sticks of HyperX memory that's included. While you can control all of the lighting through the OMEN Gaming Hub you won't be able to get the HyperX memory to sync up with the rest of the desktop.

All of that can be seen through the glass panel on the side. What's even better about that glass panel is that just like on the OMEN Obelisk that I reviewed last year there's a button on the back that lets you pop it off without any tool. In fact this PC is meant to make it nice and easy for you to do as much as possible without having to use a screwdriver. After all if you buy a desktop you'll want to add and remove parts over time.

One thing that you'll also notice when you look at the internals is that the cabling seems a bit messy. I wonder if this is done on purpose just to make it easier on people that want to do a DIY upgrade of the PSU or something but it just feels like it could be a bit cleaner.

And then there are the ports. Let's start with the front. The front ports include two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports a 3.5mm headset jack and a 3.5mm microphone jack. Honestly I'd really like to start seeing companies go all in on USB 3.2 Gen 2 by now but HP definitely has not.

That's where the rear ports come in. This machine actually has six USB Type-A ports on the back and it's the first PC I've ever seen use three different USB standards. Two of the ports are USB 3.2 Gen 2 two are USB 3.2 Gen 1 and two are USB 2.0. Frankly I'm still surprised to see USB 2.0 in any modern premium PC and it's upsetting.

But in general I'm not a fan of different USB standards in a device at all. Sure it saves the OEM money but it makes the experience so much more confusing for the user. There are plenty of peripherals - modern webcams are a great example - that will have extremely limited functionality if any in a USB 2.0 port. If you're not familiar with the different USB standards you'll probably try a range of troubleshooting steps before trying a different port.

There's also a single USB Type-C port which is USB 3.2 Gen 2. Note that Gen 1 will get you 5Gbps speeds while Gen 2 gets you 10Gbps. HP sent over its whole ecosystem of peripherals so that port was taken up with the USB Type-C port from the OMEN Outpost mousepad. One thing that I'd love to see from tower PCs in general is more USB Type-C. The laptop market is really pushing us toward the newer USB standard but desktops aren't.

Of course you'll also find three DisplayPort ports and one HDMI port on the back. This is part of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU and it's no surprise.

One last thing I wanted to point out is that I've noticed that there's less red. The tubes from the liquid cooling were red on the OMEN Obelisk as were the memory slots. Red was a signature color for HP OMEN and HP is moving away from that. The company is moving toward a cleaner look something first introduced in the OMEN 15 laptop. It's also when OMEN got its new diamond logo.

Cleaner minimal designs on gaming PCs are something that I'm happy to see becoming a thing across more brands. Gaming PCs have a tradition of being very flamboyant and there's no actual reason that it has to be that way.

HP used to break up gamers into three categories: casual (Pavilion) performance (OMEN) and enthusiast (OMEN X) and this PC would fall into the enthusiast category. Now there are five groups apparently. The first two are 'frugal and obsessed' and 'escapists' but this one is aimed at the second two: 'proud gamers' and 'customizers'. The top tier is still enthusiast.

Performance

The HP OMEN 30L includes an Intel Core i9-10900K CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. It includes 32GB DDR4-3200 memory a 2TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD and a 2TB HDD. This is my third year in a row reviewing HP's gaming desktop although it was called the OMEN Obelisk previously. Last year's model had a Core i9-9900K an RTX 2080 Ti 64GB DDR4-2666 memory two 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 RAID 0 SSDs and a 2TB HDD. Finally the previous year's model has a Core i7-8700 a RTX 2080 32GB DDR4-2666 RAM a 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD and a 1TB HDD.

I laid out all of those specs because each of those areas are seeing a meaningful improvement. The Core i9-10900K is a 125W 10-core CPU up from the 95W eight-core CPU in last year's model and from the 65W six-core CPU from the year before. While I called the RTX 2080 game-changing two years ago now we have Nvidia's brand-new generation of graphics cards with the RTX 3080. One thing that might be a bit overlooked is the faster memory which was something of a bottleneck in last year's model.

This unit also came with a 2TB SSD and a 2TB HDD. I did not use the HDD at all. Frankly with this much storage there's no reason to. I synced my entire OneDrive installed all of my apps and still had plenty of room to load it up with games like Cuphead Forza Horizon 4 Halo: The Master Chief Collection Microsoft Floght Simulator Ori and the Will of the Wisps Tetris Effect: Connected and Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The SSD is ridiculously faster than the HDD so if you can get what you need done with 2TB which is plenty there's no reason to touch the HDD.

Playing those games on the OMEN 30L is like a dream. Between the powerful CPU the next-gen GPU the fast SSD and the faster memory things are as fast as they can get and loading times are virtually non-existent. 4K gaming is a breeze and of course you get things like real-time ray tracing.

Notice that I called the GeForce RTX 3080 a next-gen GPU even though it's now the current generation. That's because nothing is really made for this thing yet so it's not really going to do anything that my old RTX 2080 Ti can't do; it's just going to do it better and faster and it absolutely does that. If you want more frames per second you'll get that.

Of course you're not going to be upgrading from a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. That would be silly. You're probably thinking more along the lines of upgrading from the GTX 1000 series or even something older. At that point it's totally worth it because even coming from a GTX 1080 your games will look and feel better.

For benchmark I used things like PCMark 8 PCMark 10 3DMark VRMark and Geekbench 5.

None of the benchmarking results are really a surprise and the results kind of speak fpor themselves. One thing I'll point out is that this is actually the first test I've seen meet the 109fps target frame rate in the VRMark: Blue Room test.

Also the 'K' suffix on the CPU model indicates that it's unlocked for overclocking and that's one of the many functions of the OMEN Gaming Hub app. you can run a benchmark in the app and then it can give you some easy ways to overclock the CPU. None of the benchmarks above were run while the CPU was being overclocked.

Peripherals

As I mentioned HP sent me the whole OMEN ecosystem including the Mindframe Prime Headset the OMEN Outpost Mousepad the OMEN Photon Mouse the OMEN Sequencer Keyboard and the OMEN 27i monitor.

But let's start by assuming that you don't have hundreds upon hundreds of dollars extra to spend after buying your very expensive PC out of the gate. It does come with a keyboard and a mouse and like most keyboard and mouse combos that ship in the box with a PC they're pretty basic.

They're both wired and they get the job done for typing. Neither are particularly good at gaming of course. The mouse is so light that it feels like there's nothing inside and the chiclet-style keys on the keyboard don't have that instant response feel that gaming keyboards have.

The point is that these exist because they have to. For some reason companies still ship a mouse and keyboard with new desktop PCs and it's usually the cheapest ones that they can make. It's just enough to make the PC usable out of the box and nothing more.

Now if you get a bit extra money to spend you may start looking for more than what's in the box. Let's start with the OMEN 27i monitor as a screen is something you definitely do need. This is a 27-inch monitor that offers a 165Hz refresh rate and 2560x1440 resolution. Personally I love it along with its minimal style.

I also just think that QHD is just the right resolution for almost everything and it's not nearly as popular as it should be. On a laptop it's the right balance between a high resolution and battery life. For a gaming display it's the right balance between a high resolution and a high frame rate. I was super-pleased using this screen for everything from work to play.

Another product that I enjoy is the OMEN Outpost Mousepad. It's nice and big and it has a wireless charging pad at the top. As I mentioned earlier you do have to plug it into the PC's one USB Type-C port but it also comes with its own USB Type-A port which is great for plugging in peripherals.

I'm a big fan of the OMEN Mindframe Prime Headset. It's a gaming headset and the focus is to keep your ears cool and comfortable. And if you're wondering where to put it while you're not using it you can just hang it on the stand that's built into the OMEN 27i monitor.

Then we have the OMEN Photon Mouse which is actually a Bluetooth mouse that's designed for gaming. I know I was skeptical too. It's pretty great though and you can charge it wirelessly right on the OMEN Outpost Mousepad. If you don't like a wireless mouse though you can also just plug it in with a wired connection in the USB Type-A port on the Outpost.

Finally we've got the OMEN Sequencer Keyboard which has RGB lighting in user-customized zones five macro keys and more. It even has a wheel in the top-right for adjusting the volume.

Conclusion

I thoroughly enjoyed the OMEN 30L Desktop just like I've enjoyed its last two predecessors. I also really appreciate just how much effort HP has put into improving it over the years. The thing that really catches my eye this year is the refined design and that's something that I appreciate across the whole lineup. It's a nice touch.

While I love the OMEN 30L it's not perfect. It's particularly offensive that there are USB 2.0 ports especially when the OMEN Obelisk didn't have them (it still had six USB Type-A ports but they were all USB 3.x). I'd also have liked to see a bit tidier cabling but to be honest that's probably something that you wouldn't even notice if I didn't say anything. Also I'd have liked to have seen this come with 16GB sticks of RAM instead of 8GB as it's just more expensive to upgrade to 64GB this way.

The performance is great with Intel's top-end K-series CPU and Nvidia's latest GPU. HP improved thermals too increasing the height of the PC for better airflow and more. Indeed thermals affect performance as much as anything else. It also comes with faster memory and a larger SSD.

This is an awesome PC and it's a really pleasant one to keep on your desk. It's nice and easy to access the internals HP has a great OMEN ecosystem and most importantly games play great.

As it turned out nothing in 2020 was going to be easy. So for its tenth “World’s Greatest Drag Race” Motor Trend is changing the format a bit.

Instead of featuring 12 cars racing side-by-side this year there are only eight cars and they’ll be facing off one at a time in an elimination-style bracket.

The cars are the Ram 1500 TRX Porsche Cayenne Turbo Coupe Lamborghini Huracan EVO AWD Porsche 911 Turbo S Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Z51 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Acura NSX and Ferrari F8 Tributo.

In the first heat the Motor Trend crew tries to keep like with like as much as possible. There are still a few surprises along the way though. We won’t spoil any results but horsepower figures don’t tell you as much about performance as you might think.

In fact one of the most evenly matched races horsepower-wise is the Porsche 911 Turbo S vs the Lamborghini Huracan EVO AWD. With just 10 hp separating the two cars you’d have expected this one to be one of the most hotly contested in the field.

It turns out to very much not be though with the drivers estimating a 10-car gap by the end of the race. All of which goes to show you that although power is good weight and more specifically how that weight is distributed matter a whole lot too."

Police cordoned off streets starting at the intersection of South Fifth Street and West Main Street near the Humana building and stretching down to the Galt House per MetroSafe. A 300 foot radius of the 100 block of South Fifth Street was being evacuated due to a suspicious vehicle according to EMS.

Officials announced just after 4 p.m. that the evacuation is no longer in effect.

The report on the RV came in after 2 p.m.

Louisville Metro Police spokesman Dwight Mitchell later said officers headed over to that part of downtown at about 2:30 p.m. after they got a call about a suspicious RV that was parked close to the Humana Building.

LMPD's Bomb Squad and K-9 units also came to help and nearby streets were closed while the police investigated.

""Upon further investigation the vehicle was declared safe by the LMPD Bomb Squad about 4:00 p.m."" Mitchell said in an emailed statement.

A week ago early on Christmas morning in downtown Nashville an RV exploded in a deliberate bombing. Authorities have said the man responsible for it died in the blast. Three people also were injured.

This year saw the Coast Guard conducting numerous counter-drug operations as the Trump administration increased its focus on anti-drug missions in U.S. Southern Command.

As each service grappled with how to handle the coronavirus pandemic the Coast Guard continued its narcotics seizures in U.S. Southern Command.

Meanwhile the White House called for a reassessment of one of the Coast Guard’s most important acquisition programs as the Trump administration continues adjusting to the Pentagon’s new National Defense Strategy.

As the Navy continues to work its way out of its own maintenance backlog the service’s use of smaller yards has made it more difficult for the Coast Guard to contract repair work for its ships.

Operations

Throughout 2020 the Coast Guard worked with the U.S. Navy to perform numerous counter-narcotic missions in U.S. Southern Command and U.S. 4th Fleet with the U.S. seizing more than a billion dollars of drugs at sea USNI News reported in July.

As part of the emphasis on anti-drug missions the U.S. Navy ramped up its warship presence in the region a move that helped the Coast Guard operate the assets needed for anti-drug missions.

Vice Adm. Steven Poulin Coast Guard Atlantic Area commander cited the platforms available to operate the Coast Guard law enforcement detachments (LEDETs) as crucial to the increase in drug seizures.

“It starts with a ship and then it starts with a law enforcement detachment on board. The more law enforcement detachment you get out there the better able you are to do the actual end game of interdiction” Poulin told USNI News in an interview earlier this year.

“It also includes getting helicopters more helicopters on the flight decks of the assets that are now in there including precision marksman on those helicopters. And that’s what we’re doing.”

The Coast Guard also continued performing various operations in other regions around the globe from Africa to the Arctic.

Just this month the service’s newest national security cutter left for its first patrol – a mission in the Southern Atlantic to tackle illegal fishing one of the Coast Guard’s main operational mission sets.

Just off the production line from Huntington Ingalls Industries the Legend-class Stone (WMSL-758) recently left for its inaugural deployment that is expected to last several months.

The Coast Guard’s operations also extended to the Arctic – a region the Pentagon is placing a new emphasis on as it works to counter both Russian and Chinese presence in the waters.

In August the service participated in a Canadian maritime exercise called Operation Nanook and sent a medium-endurance cutter to sail in the Atlantic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle for the first time in years.

One Coast Guard ship had to end an Arctic mission earlier this year after experiencing a fire that forced the ship back to its homeport for repairs. The vessel – icebreaker USCGC Healy (WABG-20) – encountered an electrical fire on Aug. 18 that damaged the propulsion motor on the ship’s starboard side.

Heavy Icebreaker Program

While the Coast Guard issued an award in 2019 for the first ship in its new Polar Security Cutter program the White House in a June memo called for the service and other government agencies to reassess plans for the fleet.

“To help protect our national interests in the Arctic and Antarctic regions and to retain a strong Arctic security presence alongside our allies and partners the United States requires a ready capable and available fleet of polar security icebreakers that is operationally tested and fully deployable by Fiscal Year 2029” the memo reads.

VT Shipbuilder Halter Marine Inc. which in 2019 won the $745 million award to build the first icebreaker is slated to start construction on the first icebreaker in 2021.

It’s unclear how the report the Trump administration ordered will affect the heavy icebreaker program.

Maintenance

The Navy’s maintenance backlogs which have caught the ire of lawmakers over the years have also affected the Coast Guard’s ability to issue maintenance contracts for its own ships USNI News reported this year.

Speaking at the WEST 2020 conference cohosted by U.S. Naval Institute and AFCEA Rear Adm. Nathan Moore the Coast Guard’s assistant commandant for engineering and logistics described how the Navy’s use of smaller yards for repairs is making it more difficult for the Coast Guard to receive bids on its work.

“As the Navy has pushed out into the commercial shipyard industry now in the last couple years they really have sort of blocked out the sun in terms of our availability of using those commercial yards that we relied on” Moore said at the time.

“So if you run a ship repair business and the Navy wants to roll into dry dock and do a $40 million dry dock (availability) for an LHA and we say hey how about our Coast Guard ship for $2 million? We just don’t see really any responses – almost no responses today to a lot of our dry dock and dock-side repair packages which means we pay for the ones that do respond. So I think we need more coordination on that.”

Because the Coast Guard receives fewer bids on its work the contract costs increase according to Moore. Industry the Navy and Coast Guard have tried to include Coast Guard ships as “filler work between Navy projects” and are working toward a more synchronized initiative to continue that workflow Moore said at the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2VuLm1lcmNvcHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEvc291dGgtYXRsYW50aWMtYXJlYS1vZi1nbG9iYWwtY29udGVudGlvbi11cy1jb2FzdC1ndWFyZC1vZmYtdG8tc291dGgtYW1lcmljYS10by1wYXRyb2wtZm9yLWl1dS1maXNoaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Atlantic area of global contention? US Coast Guard off to South America to patrol for IUU fishing,"South Atlantic area of global contention? US Coast Guard off to South America to patrol for IUU fishing

1st Friday January 2021 - 22:41 UTC Full article

“This the service’s first patrol to South America in recent memory engaging partners including Guyana Brazil Uruguay Argentina and Portugal.”

Vice Adm. Steven Poulin the Coast Guard Atlantic Area commander

The following piece by Gidget Fuentes in USNI News offers an account of the mission of USCGC (WMSL/758) Stone fresh from Shipyard and Quarantine and which departed Mississippi on 22 December for Southern Atlantic Patrol:

The Coast Guard’s newest national security cutter is setting out on its first operational patrol to the Southern Atlantic to counter illegal unregulated and unreported fishing off South America.

The Legend-class USCGC Stone (WMSL-758) and its crew of 120 men and women last week turned what’s typically a “shakedown” cruise into short-notice preparations to conduct maritime security operations off South America after departing Pascagoula Miss. The Coast Guard had received Stone from the shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries on Nov. 10 and planned for its commissioning at its future homeport of Charleston S.C. now slated for after its return from the deployment.

The departure came after a two-week restriction aboard where crew members remained in their berthing when not eating meals or exercising. After leaving Pascagoula just before Christmas the crew was busy with drills and training including small-boat operations abandon-ship drills and helicopter operations.

The inaugural deployment is “a multi-month deployment to the South Atlantic countering illegal unregulated and unreported fishing while strengthening relationships for maritime sovereignty and security throughout the region” according to a Coast Guard news release. “This the service’s first patrol to South America in recent memory engaging partners including Guyana Brazil Uruguay Argentina and Portugal.” An observer from the Portuguese navy embarked the cutter for the duration of Operation Southern Cross in the U.S. Southern Command region.

“Stone’s patrol demonstrates our commitment to the established rules-based order while addressing IUU fishing wherever a Coast Guard cutter is deployed” Vice Adm. Steven Poulin the Coast Guard Atlantic Area commander said in a statement.

The Coast Guard has counted IIU as the top maritime security threat and its enforcement as an important mission. Cutters support enforcement of international law tracking illicit activities and patrol established fisheries usually in concert with regional partners and allies. The largest effort has been in the Pacific where in 2020 the United States Canada China Japan Russia and South Korea deployed vessels aircraft and other assets during Operation Northern Pacific Guard.

In September Adm. Karl Schultz the Coast Guard commandant issued the “IUU Fishing Strategic Outlook” which he described as its “commitment to leading a global effort to combat illegal exploitation of the ocean’s fish stocks and protect our national interests.” The Coast Guard’s contribution would be threefold: Targeted intelligence-driven enforcement operations counter-predatory and irresponsible State behavior and expanded multilateral fisheries enforcement cooperation.

“Not all maritime nations have the capability to survey their sovereign waters or the moral conscience to police their fleets; this lack of shared responsibility creates opportunities for exploitation in the form of Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing” Schultz wrote. “This exploitation erodes both regional and national security undermines maritime rules-based order jeopardizes food access and availability and destroys legitimate economies.

“IUU fishing has replaced piracy as the leading global maritime security threat. If IUU fishing continues unchecked we can expect deterioration of fragile coastal States and increased tension among foreign-fishing Nations threatening geopolitical stability around the world.”

While much attention has been on the Pacific where U.S. officials say China’s expanding fishing and patrol fleets have flaunted international law and threaten nations’ economic security and sovereignty similar concerns exist across the Southern Atlantic’s natural resources. Growing concerns over illicit activities in fisheries off South America including sightings of more Chinese and Asian fishing vessels has prompted Argentina to purchase new offshore patrol craft for its coast guard.

Stone’s deployment to the southern Atlantic comes as its crew was preparing for the shakedown cruise even as they remained aboard the cutter for a mandatory pre-sail quarantine.

“It is no easy feat to assemble a crew and ready a cutter for sea – but this crew has had to perform this difficult task while observing protective measures associated with the Coronavirus-19 pandemic” Capt. Adam Morrison Stone’s commanding officer said in a statement. “The crew and I look forward to this historic first voyage as Stone begins a storied career of service to this nation. While balancing training and qualification requirements Stone’s crew will engage with partner nations in South America in a like-minded pursuit to curb illegal fishing tactics.”

“I cannot think of a better ending to 2020 than seeing the look of pride on the faces of our shipbuilders as Stone sails away from our shipyard to join the Coast Guard’s cutter fleet” Ingalls Shipbuilding President Brian Cuccias said in a news release. “Our workforce has provided the Coast Guard with another state-of-the-art highly capable national security cutter that will work for decades to come to ensure our nation’s maritime safety and security.”

Stone will be commissioned in Charleston homeport to two other national security cutters USCGC Hamilton (WMSL-753) and USCGC James (WMSL-754).

The cutter is named for the late Cmdr. Elmer “Archie” Fowler Stone who in 1917 becane the Coast Guard’s first aviator and two years later was one of two pilots who successfully made a transatlantic flight in a Navy seaplane. The 418-foot 4500-ton cutter can operate up to 60 days without support.",,,,,,,,,
IBM,IBM,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS90eC9hdXN0aW4vbmV3cy8yMDIwLzEyLzMwL3R5cGV3cml0ZXJzLW1ha2luZy1jb21lYmFjay1hbW9uZy1jcmVhdGl2ZXMtLXRob3NlLXdhbnRpbmctdG8ta2VlcC10aGluZ3MtY29uZmlkZW50aWFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Typewriters Making Comeback Among Creatives Those Wanting to Keep Things Confidential,"AUSTIN Texas — One might assume all of the advances made with modern technology would have rendered the typewriter useless. But typewriter repairman Steve Munoz says the typewriter is making a comeback.

“They’re finding them in the attic in their garage their grandmothers’ their grandfathers’ and they refurbish them. They like the sound” said Munoz as he punches keys on an old Remington manual typewriter.

Munoz is the owner of Duncan Munoz Office Machines in Austin. He was just 20 when he started as a typewriter “delivery boy” a job he got through his brother.

“Back in the day if a technician couldn’t fix a machine at the location they’d say 'we’re going to have somebody come pick it up'. That was me” recalled Munoz.

Forty-three years later Munoz is still repairing typewriters. He’s the only one left in the game in Central Texas after two other competitors got out of the business. One had health problems that forced him to retire and the other worked for a company that switched its focus solely to computers.

He’s also the only one who still carries typewriter ink and correction ribbons after big-box office supply stores stopped offering them. It’s brought an onslaught of business which he says is good but sometimes daunting.

“I’ve been able to manage but I could always use a hand” said Munoz. “But there’s nobody out there.”

There is nobody out there to learn the intricacies of each machine according to Munoz. He says he’s reached out to local high schools in the hopes of recruiting an apprentice but he admits there’s a lot involved. He holds several training certificates from companies like Brother IBM Adler and Royal.

Munoz specializes in the IBM Selectric an electric typewriter that was manufactured in Austin. The heavy piece of equipment was a mainstay in offices across the country.

“I think it was the ‘80s they informed us that the typewriters particularly these IBM Selectrics will be obsolete in 10 years” chuckled Munoz.

The typewriter never went away though. Many of Munoz’s customers are older regulars some who never transitioned to the computer. Even as many of the older customers retire those that have taken their place only know how to do their work on the typewriter.

Professionals like lawyers doctors certified public accountants make up a lot of Munoz’s clientele. Munoz says many have held onto the IBM Selectric and are starting to reinvest in the old technology in order to make sure their confidential documents stay confidential.

“You can’t hack anything that’s on a typewriter” said Munoz. “You type it make copies and then shred it and that’s it.”

Munoz has drawers full of hundreds of parts for the Selectric some of which he can still get from a supplier in Dallas. But Munoz says it’s the manual typewriter that’s truly gaining popularity as of recent especially with more creative types.

“The writer just loves the sound and the feel” said Munoz. “He gets more out of it than just on a computer.”

Never mind a typewriter can’t crash and lose your work; it also doesn’t have the distractions of the internet. But parts for manual typewriters are obsolete.

“You can’t get parts for them they may not even work” said Munoz.

Munoz says the ones that don’t work just end up as conversation pieces on display in a home or office.

He has a “graveyard” of junked typewriters he uses for common spare parts in an attempt to save the manual typewriters he can. At one point he had accumulated over 500 typewriters taking up the space next to his unassuming repair shop but Munoz said it wasn’t worth it to pay rent just for storage. He stripped the majority of them maintaining a collection of about 40-50 machines.

There was never a point where Munoz thought his business would end up in the “grave yard” though; Munoz diversified his services. He repairs cash registers printers and copying machines. He says up until a few years ago 75% of his business was focused on the printers and cash registers. Now Munoz says his focus is back on the typewriter making up nearly 65% of service calls and repairs he’s making today.

“You know that ‘what goes around comes around’ cliché - if you will?

﻿﻿

Automated File Submission

CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence is designed to automatically provide detailed malware analysis that is integrated as part of the alert to help analysts save time and make effective security decisions.

Below we see a Falcon prevention event that also resulted in a quarantined file.

As we scroll down in the details pane we see that the quarantined file was also sent to the sandbox for analysis. That happened automatically with no intervention from the administrator.

Malware Analysis

We immediately see useful context from the CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence analysis directly in the UI. In addition to the summary risk assessment you have the option to download both strict and broad Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). You can also open the complete sandbox report. It provides additional analysis details including the threat level and score. There are three options to drill further into the report: Report Summary Network Activity and Advanced Analysis.

Under “Report Summary” you can view the risk assessment and get information on related malware from the “Malquery” section. This information comes from CrowdStrike’s extensive malware database and can help organizations understand if this attack is part of a larger initiative or if they have been the target of similar attacks in the past. If not the information can be used to get proactive in protecting against the related files in the future.

Actionable Intelligence

From the sandbox report there is also an option to download IOC’s related to the analyzed malware. Those could include things like known bad domains or IP addresses. That information can be used with other security tools to block access to known bad sites via firewalls web content filters or IPS devices.

For malware with actor attribution there is a pivot to open the complete actor profile and better understand who is attacking your organization. The actor profile contains additional IOC’s for the actor including known Command and Control servers and IPs. In many cases you will also see a list of commonly exploited vulnerabilities. This information can help you ensure your environment is patched and protected from a targeted bad actor attack.

Conclusion

CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence fully automates the analysis process incorporates threat intelligence and yields actionable intelligence information. It provides greater context so that security analysts can be faster and more effective as they learn from attacks and strive to protect the larger organization.

Intel reveals new chipset logos

Intel is set to launch its 500-series motherboard chipsets at CES which starts in just 11 days from today. For certain board partners’ marketing departments will have a tough time advertising their new motherboards with PCI Express 4.0 hardware support knowing that Intel’s first Gen4-capable Rocket Lake-S series will not be available till at least March. History repeats itself the same problem arose last year when select board makers decided to officially claim PCIe Gen4 hardware support knowing that no CPUs at the time could take full advantage of the new interface standard.

The details on the new 500-series chipsets are not yet known. It appears that the first wave will feature Z590 B560 and H510 chipsets. The new motherboards are expected to feature DDR4-3200 memory support on Z590 and B560 chipsets and XMP profile support. Z590 will also have CPU overclocking support which has not yet been confirmed on H570 and B560.

The new Rocket Lake-S CPUs will have 4 additional PCIe lanes which can be used for direct NVMe PCIe 4.0 storage. More importantly Z590 and B560 chipsets will both support PCIe 4.0 x16 for discrete GPU finally achieving what AMD did more than 2 years ago.

500-series motherboards will have a short life considering that Intel already confirmed its successor Alder Lake which features a different LGA1700 socket coming in 2021. This is contrary to AMD’s decision who decided not to release 600-series chipsets for its Zen3 CPUs. Both companies are expected to transition to PCIe 5.0/DDR5 platforms with new CPUs and their AM5/LGA1700 sockets in a year or so. This is certainly not a good time to buy a new motherboard if longevity is the main concern.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzg4MTM4LWFtZC1wYXRlbnRzLWNoaXBsZXQtZ3B1LWRlc2lnbi11bmxpa2UtbnZpZGlhLWludGVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD patents a chiplet GPU design quite unlike Nvidia and Intel's,"Something to look forward to: AMD has published its first patent on chiplet GPU designs. In typical AMD fashion they're trying to not rock the boat. Chiplet GPUs are just beginning to emerge. Intel has been forthright about their development process and confirmed the employment of chiplets in their first-generation discrete GPUs. Nvidia while coy about specifics have published numerous research papers on the topic. AMD was the last holdout - which only adds to the intrigue.

Chiplets as the name suggests are smaller less complex chips that meant to work together into more powerful processors. They're arguably the inevitable future for all high-performance components and in some cases the successful present; AMD's use of chiplet CPU designs has been brilliant.

In the new patent dated December 31 AMD outlines a chiplet design fashioned to mimic a monolithic design as closely as possible. Their hypothetical model uses two chiplets connected by a high-speed inactive interposer called a crosslink.

A crosslink connection sits between the L2 cache and L3 cache on the memory hierarchy. Everything beneath it such as the cores and L1 cache and L2 cache are aware of their separation from the other chiplet. Everything above including the L3 cache and GDDR memory are shared between the chiplets.

This design is beneficial because it is conventional. AMD claims that compute units can access low-level cache on other chiplets almost as fast as they can access local low-level cache. Should that prove true software won't need updating.

The same cannot be said of Intel and Nvidia's designs. Intel intends on using two new technologies EMIB (embedded multi-die interconnect bridge) and Foveros. The latter is an active interposer that uses through-silicon-vias something AMD explicitly states they will not use. Intel's design lets the GPU house a system-accessible cache that powers a new memory fabric.

Nvidia has not disclosed everything but have indicated a few directions they might pursue. A research paper from 2017 describes a four-chiplet design and a NUMA (non-uniform memory access) aware and locality aware architecture. It also experiments with a new L1.5 cache which exclusively holds remote data accesses and is bypassed during local memory accesses.

AMD's approach might sound the least imaginative but it also sounds practical. And if history has proven anything it's that developer-friendliness is a huge advantage.

Below are additional diagrams from the patent.

Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view that descends from two chiplets to the circuit board. The two chiplets (106-1 and 106-2) are stacked vertically on the passive crosslink (118) and use dedicated conductor structures to access the crosslink's traces (206) and subsequently communicate with each other. Conductor structures not attached to the crosslink (204) connect to the circuit board for power and other signaling.

Figure 3 depicts the cache hierarchy. WGPs (work group processors) (302) which are collections of shader cores and GFXs (fixed function units) (304) which are dedicated processors for singular purposes connect directly to a channel's L1 cache (306). Each chiplet contains multiple L2 cache (308) banks that are individually addressable and also coherent within a single chiplet. Each chiplet also contains multiple L3 cache (310) cache banks that are coherent across the whole GPU.

The GDF (graphics data fabric) (314) connects the L1 cache banks to the L2 cache banks. The SDF (scalable data fabric) (316) combines the L2 cache banks and connects them to the crosslink (118). The crosslink connects to the SDFs on all the chiplets as well as the L3 cache banks on all the chiplets. The GDDR memory lanes (written as Memory PHY) (312) connect to L3 cache banks.

As an example if a WGP on one chiplet required data from a GDDR bank on another chiplet that data would be sent through to an L3 cache bank then over the crosslink to an SDF then to an L2 bank and finally through a GDF to an L1 bank.

Figure 4 is a bird's eye view of one chiplet. It shows more accurately the potential locations and scales of various components. The HBX Controller (404) manages the crosslink which the chiplet is connected to by HBX PHY (406) conductors. The small square in the bottom-left corner (408) is a potential additional connection to the crosslink to connect more chiplets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9yb2NrZXQtbGFrZS1lbmdpbmVlcmluZy1zYW1wbGVzLWJlbmNobWFya2Vk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rocket Lake Engineering Samples Benchmarked Against Zen 3,"As outlined in a recent post on Chip Hell one of its users reportedly grabbed an early B560 motherboard and engineering samples of three of Intel's new Rocket Lake CPUs including the Core i7-11700 Core i9-11900 and Core i9-11900K.

The tested pitched each processor against AMD's Zen 3-powered Ryzen 7 5800X to see just how they compare to AMD's best eight-core chip. Since these are engineering samples the Intel chips' clocks speeds are significantly lower than we would likely see with retail models. The poster also threw in Intel's previous-gen Core i9-9900K and Core i7-10700K as well to compare gen-on-gen performance gains.

The testbed used the same B560 board discussed above a B550 Taichi Razer Edition for the AMD tests ASRock Radeon RX 6800 Taichi 2x8GB kit of ZADAK Spark DDR4-3600 RAM 1000W Antec HCG-X1000 power supply and a 360mm AIO liquid cooler.

Here are the Rocket Lake engineering samples tested:

QV1J Core i7-11700 ES -- 1.8GHz base frequency 4.4GHz boost frequency.

QVTE Core i9-11900 ES -- 1.8GHz base frequency 4.5GHz boost frequency.

QV1K Core i9-11900K ES -- 3.4GHz base frequency 4.8GHz boost frequency.

Even though there is a wide selection of benchmarks posted at Chip Hell we're only covering the locked 4GHz benchmark results. We chose to focus on this test because the engineering samples for Rocket Lake are clocked so low that any performance benchmarks from these samples are specific to these samples alone and will not represent actual Rocket Lake performance when the retail SKUs hit shelves this year.

The ""Locked at 4GHz"" Benchmark

Chip Hell ran the Core i9-9900K Core i7-10700K Core i9-11900K ES and Ryzen 7 5800X in Cinebench but with all the chips locked at 4GHz allowing us to see how much of an IPC gain Rocket Lake-S has purely from an architectural standpoint as clock speed is no longer the deciding factor to performance.

We can see the gains from Comet Lake to Rocket Lake are quite decent; Rocket Lake commands a 13% lead over its predecessor. Compare this to the generational leap from Coffee Lake to Comet Lake at just 4%.

However despite the architectural gains it's not enough for Intel to beat AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X which wins by 8%.

It appears that Intel will use clock speed rather heavily to try to gain an advantage over AMD's Zen 3 architecture as AMD still appears to win on clock-for-clock performance. But at least the architectural changes were significant enough to give Rocket Lake a decent IPC increase over Comet Lake. The overall performance gap should also widen rather significantly if clock speeds are higher on shipping Rocket Lake models.

However Intel will continue to struggle against AMD's Zen 3 platform whether or not Intel manages to beat AMD in the single-threaded battle as Rocket Lake will be severely behind in core count and that won't change until Intel's 12th-Gen Alder Lake architecture arrives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiyAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9PdmVyY2xvY2tlZC1JbnRlbC1Db3JlLWk5LTExOTAwSy01LTItR0h6LW9uLWFsbC1jb3Jlcy1jYW4tYmVhdC10aGUtQU1ELVJ5emVuLTctNTgwMFgtaW4tc2luZ2xlLXRocmVhZC1hbmQtbXVsdGl0aHJlYWQtYmVuY2htYXJrcy1idXQtYXQtYS1tYXNzaXZlLXBvd2VyLWNvc3QuNTEyNzM0LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Overclocked Intel Core i9-11900K @5.2 GHz on all cores can beat the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X in single-thread and ...,"The Rocket Lake Intel Core i9-11900K processor has turned up another astonishing CPU-Z benchmark score with an overclocked sample with all cores at 5.2 GHz managing higher single-thread and multithread test results than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X. But the power cost for a slight improvement might be too high for many.

4 Reviews

The Intel Core i9-11900K is back on CPU-Z offering another incredible performance. We just reported about a benchmark run that yielded strong single-core results although the 8-core Rocket Lake chip lagged far behind the 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 5950X in the multithread test. This time we will compare an overclocked 8-core i9-11900K hitting 5.2 GHz on all cores (normal all-core boost is 4.80 GHz; base is 3.50 GHz) against what should be an 8-core rival at least in terms of price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X.

So the beefed-up (and hopefully super-cooled) i9-11900K churned out 706.3 points in the single-thread test and 7199 points in the multithread test. This puts it +1.57% (single) and more impressively +10.38% (multi) over the same part's results that we reported about earlier. Considering the circumstances you would expect a better multithread score this time around and this result even puts it past the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X which managed 650-663 points and 6593-6766 points respectively in separate tests. Here the Rocket Lake-S chip is +6.53% and +6.40% ahead of the high-end Vermeer CPU scores – so big win for Intel?

Not quite. Typically there are always a few caveats to be thrown in CPU benchmark comparisons and arguably the main one here is going to be power draw. The Vermeer Zen 3 processor from AMD relies on a 105 W TDP whereas the i9-11900K has a PL1 TDP of 125 W – not a huge difference. But this overclocked Intel sample must have been at the PL2 limit of 250 W which is a whopping +138% power advantage over the Ryzen 7 5800X. Reverting back to regular sample testing (see table below) leaves the AMD part 3.74% ahead of the Rocket Lake chip in multithread while Intel typically leads in single-thread testing by 4.83% here.

In plain terms if you want multithread power plump for the AMD Zen 3 CPU and if you want single-thread might then select the Intel Rocket Lake-S chip. Prices are rumored to be similar with the Ryzen 7 5800X going at US$449 and a supposed engineering sample of the i9-11900K being purchased at US$450. Power draw is as always a major issue with Intel and its current reliance on 14 nm manufacturing although at least Rocket Lake is compatible with the Z490 chipset (LGA 1200 socket) that was introduced with Comet Lake.

Johnny Isakson a third-term Georgia Republican announced his surprise retirement following a kidney cancer diagnosis Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared the head table at a 4H fundraiser gala with two titans of Atlanta's finance scene: Jeffrey Sprecher whose company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) owns the New York Stock Exchange; and Sprecher's wife Kelly Loeffler at the time the CEO of a cryptocurrency joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

The fundraiser pulled in $200000 and Kemp himself scored $18100 from Loeffler. A few months later Kemp would appoint Loeffler a lifelong executive with no previous political experience to fill Isakson's seat passing over numerous other Republicans incluidng insiders from his own administration former national officials and President Trump's personal favorite Rep. Doug Collins. The decision raised eyebrows at the time and still does today: In bypassing Collins who went on to challenge Loeffler in November's Georgia ""jungle primary"" Kemp not only alienated Trump but created a tight special-election race that may well determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. That showdown — in which Loeffler faces Democratic opponent Rev. Raphael Warnock — culminates next Tuesday.

Even the most innocuous explanation for Loeffler's appointment hinges on the advantages of her tremendous wealth: She promised Kemp she would pour $20 million into her own 2020 campaign and would not require outside fundraising efforts. Kemp was also apparently attracted by a perceived appeal to suburban white women in his rapidly changing state. Even so the appointment is difficult to understand taken on Loeffler's merits biography talents and expertise: She's a onetime Mitt Romney Republican who faced with the era of Trump and its hyper-partisan division was forced to run so far to the right that she hit the road with a QAnon candidate and more recently posed for a campaign selfie with a former Klansman.

Even Loeffler appears to have believed she was a long shot: A month after Isakson announced his retirement last August she was elected to the board of directors at Georgia Power the premier electricity provider for the state and largest subsidiary of the Southern Company — a position her Senate appointment would force her to abandon only two months later.

That brief chapter of Loeffler's pre-government life however opens the door to a deeper history and a new and complex set of unexplored ethical questions for a senator whose sprawling corporate ties overlap with an industry she is charged with overseeing making it impossible to avoid conflicts of interest and accusations (fair or otherwise) of insider dealings.

While Sprecher's involvement with the New York Stock Exchange grabs headlines as a familiar reference his company is mainly grounded in the energy sector which also provides much of the weight behind Loeffler's résumé. Despite this background — or perhaps because of it — she has never articulated exactly where she stands on energy policy.

Intercontinental Exchange underpins an astounding array of energy futures exchanges both in the United States and globally. Well before Sprecher started the company he was developing power plants. After the fall of Enron ICE took its place a position Sprecher leveraged cannily gradually making his company one of the most influential financial firms in the world.

ICE's subsidy the NYSE is itself home to more than 90% of all publicly traded utilities and pipeline companies in the U.S. and many of those use ICE markets to trade and hedge against their energy investments. To that point ICE's website claims that ""more electric power is traded on ICE than any other electronic marketplace in the world.""

The southeastern U.S. — the second-largest energy market in the country and coincidentally home to ICE and Loeffler — is one of the few regions that does not have a unified power exchange and thus no derivatives.

Around the time Loeffler was elected to the board of Georgia Power the major utility companies in the Southeast secretly began engaging in talks about uniting the region into a single exchange. The exchange would include Southern Company (the parent of Georgia Power) as well as major players Duke Energy Dominion and the government-run Tennessee Valley Authority.

The move according to the larger companies involved would benefit renewables and wholesale power sellers through a trading mechanism that more readily distributes excess energy capacity across a wider market which they say will boost renewables and nuclear power. Detractors are skeptical — especially clean energy advocates. Jeff Dennis general counsel at Advanced Energy Economy told Salon that the new exchange called the Southeastern Energy Market (SEEM) would mainly benefit the larger utilities eclipsing the concerns of smaller companies renewables and consumers.

""In general while the SEEM mechanism might help the sponsoring utilities capture additional revenues for their own largely fossil-fuel-generating plants and squeeze some marginal savings for customers out of the existing system it accomplishes little else"" Dennis said. While SEEM's sponsor companies claim that the exchange will save customers $40 million to $50 million annually he said that amount is small when spread across the entire region and the 50 million people it serves.

""Compare that to the benefits customers would get from a more integrated and competitive wholesale power market in the region which one recent study showed could generate $19.2 billion in annual regional savings reducing customer bills by 23% and lowering carbon emissions by 37% all while creating at least 285000 new jobs by 2040"" Dennis said.

""Customers and clean energy developers are concerned that SEEM will not be a stepping stone to a true regional competitive wholesale market and integrated transmission grid in the region"" he added ""and could lock in the region's reliance on existing natural gas and coal-fired power plants instead of serving to help the region transition to lower cost and cleaner renewable and advanced energy resources.""

Because SEEM's first iteration will not be as consolidated as other independent energy networks in different parts of the U.S. which trade on ICE's exchanges the system will not support futures trading. An ICE spokesperson told Salon that the company has not been involved.

""The utilities did this among themselves — no consumer advocates and no regulators"" the lawyer continued. ""There is no effective independent oversight. It's governed by a board run by the utilities. We need public interest stakeholders and government structure so that companies aren't the only ones making decisions.""

But the proposal is far from a done deal. The companies which want to open the exchange sometime next year must first get the go-ahead from federal and state regulators. Last week North Carolina authorities put a hold on their goal of filing with the federal government by Dec. 28. A Biden administration will likely prove a harder sell.

That might help explain why Thomas Farrell CEO of Dominion Power made a maximum donation to the Loeffler campaign last week. Thomas Fanning CEO of Southern Company contributed to Loeffler last February and along with his wife made a maximum donation at the end of November according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. While Loeffler might not have direct oversight over this issue she can act as an ambassador for their industry and a GOP-controlled Senate would be able to check the Biden administration.

The Georgia Power board found Loeffler's background attractive as an ambassador and inside eye for the financial side of the business. Paul Bowers company president and CEO said the board had picked Loeffler not only because of her knowledge about energy markets and European carbon trading markets in which Georgia Power deals heavily but her knowledge of cryptocurrency — Loeffler was at the time CEO of Bakkt the aforementioned joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

""This insight into the global energy market and her unique digital experience will provide an extremely valuable perspective as we evolve as an energy industry and as a business to build a sustainable energy future for our customers and state"" Bowers said in a press release at the time.

Cryptocurrency is also tied into energy markets in more than one way. First blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency is based has several actual or potential applications in energy and power exchanges particularly for new and renewable technologies. But it's also true that the industry itself uses a lot of energy: Bitcoin in which Bakkt deals consumes more energy annually than the entire country of Switzerland.

Loeffler's project with Bakkt was to develop what the company called a ""regulated global ecosystem"" designed to enable payments markets and ""new use cases"" for cryptocurrency — including launching a Bitcoin futures exchange with ICE.

When Loeffler joined the Senate she was named to the subcommittee that oversaw that very industry: Futures trading. She only stepped down from that post after widespread backlash to her remarkably well-timed stock trades ahead of the coronavirus pandemic — including in shares of her own company. She still sits on the broader Agriculture Committee however which has overall oversight of the industry. And she still holds shares of Bakkt which has performed increasingly and surprisingly well this year.

Tim Echols a Republican member of the Georgia Public Service Commission which regulates electricity in the state and sets statewide energy policies told Inside Climate News earlier this year that Loeffler's experience as CEO of Bakkt would be a political asset specifically when it comes to energy regulation and market design.

""For me as a conservative Republican Kelly has the full package"" Echols said. ""She is right on the social issues she knows business and she understands energy minutiae."" He predicted she would favor tax credits for electric vehicles and solar investments while supporting nuclear energy but to this point Loeffler appears only to have made one limited public statement about electric vehicles.

Georgia Power's mix includes coal natural gas renewables and nuclear power. Recent reporting from ProPublica revealed that following the enactment of a new rule mandating environmental disclosures for coal ash Georgia Power paid millions of dollars to buy land near its coal ash ponds often paying above market values before later disclosing evidence of groundwater contamination around those sites.

""In the nearly six years since the coal ash rule was finalized Georgia Power bought about 75 properties for an average price of $8800 per acre — outpacing the growth of average real estate values in rural areas of the state. The company purchased a third of those properties for over $30000 an acre — and a handful for over $100000 an acre"" ProPublica reported.

Loeffler does not sit on the Senate Energy Committee but as mentioned above she sits on the Agriculture Committee whose oversight includes issues regarding rural energy development.

Georgia Power has also been trying for years to finish construction on the Vogtle nuclear plant near Atlanta. The construction project has been a money pit to this point however running billions of dollars over budget.

In February Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar bought between $100000 and $250000 in futures for the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia a nonprofit municipal energy company with a significant stake in Plant Vogtle according to his mandatory federal financial disclosures. In that same period of time Azar had briefed Loeffler among other senators on the looming coronavirus pandemic.

The exchange says China Telecom Corp. Limited China Mobile Limited and China Unicom Hong Kong Limited will be delisted from the exchange. Trump issued an order Nov. 12 barring investment in publicly traded companies that the U.S. government says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.

The statement issued late Thursday says the exchange will suspend trading of the companies as early as Jan. 7 or as late as Jan. 11. It says the stock issuers can appeal to a committee of the NYSE’s board.

The Chinese government has accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and has warned that Trump’s order would hurt U.S. and other investors worldwide.

Political analysts expect little change in policy under President-elect Joe Biden due to widespread frustration with China’s trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.

SAVANNAH Ga. — Two months after the November elections Georgia voters have unfinished business. The outcome will determine partisan control of the U.S. Senate and how lawmakers deal with a new White House.

Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are both on the ballot Tuesday in runoff elections because neither got enough votes Nov. 3 to win outright.

Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have raised staggering sums as they try to capitalize on President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia over GOP President Donald Trump.

Here's a look at how two key Georgia elections pushed into 2021 who's running and what's at stake.

Who’s running?

Both of Georgia's Senate seats weren't supposed to be up for grabs in 2020.

Perdue is wrapping up a six-year term. The Republican was first elected in 2014 after running as a political outsider and former CEO of Reebok and Dollar General. In his first term Perdue became known as one of Trump's chief defenders in the Senate.

The race got shaken up in August 2019 when fellow GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson announced he was resigning because of failing health. Georgia's governor appointed Loeffler to fill the seat but she would have to run in the November election to fill the last two years of Isakson's term.

Like Perdue Loeffler's background was in business rather than politics. Before joining the Senate she worked at Intercontinental Exchange a company founded by her husband that operates the New York Stock Exchange. One of the Senate's wealthiest members Loeffler has spent more than $20 million of her own cash running and traveled the state in her private jet.

As for the challengers Ossoff and Warnock are seeking to become the first Democrats to win a U.S. Senate election in Georgia since 2000.

If he defeats Perdue Ossoff would be the Senate’s youngest member at age 33. His introduction to politics came as a college students when he interned for Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis the Democrat and civil rights hero who died in July. Ossoff runs a company that produces documentary films and ran for a House seat in 2017 which he lost but proved a formidable fund-raiser.

In the wide-open race for Loeffler's seat Democratic leaders united early to endorse Warnock pastor of the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached and one of Georgia's best-known Black ministers. Warnock's activism from the pulpit on issues such as bail reform and expanded voting rights have become centerpieces of his campaign — just as his sometimes fiery sermons have provided ammunition for attacks by Republicans.

Why is Georgia still voting?

Georgia law requires candidates for Congress and state offices to win by getting more than 50% of the vote. Otherwise races get forced into a runoff between the top two finishers.

In November Perdue finished 88000 votes ahead of Ossoff but fell just short of a majority with 49.7% of the vote in a three-way race that included Libertarian Shane Hazel.

A runoff was virtually assured in the special election for Loeffler's seat. Because she was running to complete her predecessor's unfinished term state law requires a political free-for-all with multiple Republicans and Democrats sharing the ballot. Loeffler and Warnock were the top finishers out of 20 candidates with neither getting more than one-third of the vote.

Why wait until 2021 to resolve those races?

Georgia amended its election laws in 2014 to require nine weeks between general elections and runoffs. The runoff period had been just four weeks. But that changed after the U.S. Justice Department sued Georgia arguing military members stationed overseas didn't have enough time to receive and mail back absentee ballots.

What’s at stake?

If Perdue and Loeffler both lose their seats Republicans lose control of the U.S. Senate after six years holding a majority in the chamber.

The November elections resulted in Republicans holding 50 Senate seats and Democrats controlling 48. Only the two seats in Georgia remain undecided.

A win by either Perdue or Loeffler would keep the Senate in Republican hands.

But victories by both Ossoff and Warnock would leave both parties with 50 seats each — and therefore tilt control to Democrats. That's because Democratic Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the Senate's presiding officer and will vote as needed to break any ties.

It would be a big win for Biden as Democrats would control both houses of Congress.

Where do things stand?

Perdue and Loeffler have cast themselves as the last line of defense against Democratic control of Washington. But their closing arguments have been complicated by Trump siding with Democrats in calling for one-time cash payments of $2000 for pandemic relief an amount most congressional Republicans oppose.

Both GOP senators have said they support Trump's demand for the extra money after months of caricaturing Democrats as socialists who favor wasteful spending. Ossoff and Warnock insist their rivals haven't done enough to try to force a vote on the higher relief payments in the Senate.

The two Democrats reported staggering fund-raising of more than $100 million each during the past two months. Their hauls far outpaced the Republican incumbents with Perdue reporting $68 million and Loeffler just under $64 million.

Georgia voters meanwhile have already been turning out in huge numbers despite the holidays and the pandemic. More than 2.8 million have voted early either in person or by mail — more than half of the 5 million total votes cast in Georgia in November.

Both sides are calling on their heaviest hitters to help turn out supporters. Trump has scheduled a Monday rally with Perdue and Loeffler in conservative northwest Georgia. Harris plans to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock on Sunday in Savannah followed by Biden in Atlanta on Monday.

Heading into the final days Perdue’s campaign said Thursday that he and his wife learned they had been in close contact with a staffer who tested positive for COVID-19 and the senator was in quarantine despite having tested negative."

Check out our latest analysis for International Flavors & Fragrances

International Flavors & Fragrances' Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage

While it is great to have a strong dividend yield we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. The company is paying out a large amount of its cash flows even though it isn't generating any profit. This is quite a strong warning sign that the dividend may not be sustainable.

According to analysts EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends we think the payout ratio will be 13% which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.

International Flavors & Fragrances Has A Solid Track Record

The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013 the annual payment back then was $1.36 compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.24. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.1% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.

The Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential

Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Earnings per share has been sinking by 59% over the last five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. On the bright side earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.

The Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable

Overall we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We don't think International Flavors & Fragrances is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.

It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still investors need to consider a host of other factors apart from dividend payments when analysing a company. For instance we've picked out 2 warning signs for International Flavors & Fragrances that investors should take into consideration.

(NYSE:IFF),"With a median price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of close to 1.5x in the Chemicals industry in the United States you could be forgiven for feeling indifferent about International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.'s ( ) P/S ratio of 1.9x. However investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/S.

How International Flavors & Fragrances Has Been Performing

With revenue that's retreating more than the industry's average of late International Flavors & Fragrances has been very sluggish. It might be that many expect the dismal revenue performance to revert back to industry averages soon which has kept the P/S from falling. If you still like the company you'd want its revenue trajectory to turn around before making any decisions. Or at the very least you'd be hoping it doesn't keep underperforming if your plan is to pick up some stock while it's not in favour.

How Is International Flavors & Fragrances' Revenue Growth Trending?

Keen to find out how analysts think International Flavors & Fragrances' future stacks up against the industry? In that case our .

There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like International Flavors & Fragrances' to be considered reasonable.

Retrospectively the last year delivered a frustrating 7.7% decrease to the company's top line. Still the latest three year period has seen an excellent 126% overall rise in revenue in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Although it's been a bumpy ride it's still fair to say the revenue growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.

Turning to the outlook the next three years should bring diminished returns with revenue decreasing 0.07% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's not great when the rest of the industry is expected to grow by 8.2% per annum.

With this in consideration we think it doesn't make sense that International Flavors & Fragrances' P/S is closely matching its industry peers. Apparently many investors in the company reject the analyst cohort's pessimism and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as these declining revenues are likely to weigh on the share price eventually.

The Key Takeaway

Typically we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

While International Flavors & Fragrances' P/S isn't anything out of the ordinary for companies in the industry we didn't expect it given forecasts of revenue decline. With this in mind we don't feel the current P/S is justified as declining revenues are unlikely to support a more positive sentiment for long. If we consider the revenue outlook the P/S seems to indicate that potential investors may be paying a premium for the stock.

You should always think about risks. Case in point we've spotted you should be aware of and 1 of them is potentially serious.

“Currently Russia and the world have several standard methodologies to determine light and heavy components of petroleum such as saturated hydrocarbons tars and asphaltenes” says co-author Associate Professor Mikhail Varfolomeev.

The proposed express test doesn’t involve any supplements and can eliminate the majority of human errors according to the authors. “That is to say we measure our specimens without any external influence. It’s a monumental time saver because of the elimination of errors and labor needed for manual analysis” explains Varfolomeev.

Initial tests were conducted in cooperation with Transneft Russia’s designated oil pipeline operator. So far the researchers have learned how to determine four fractions: asphaltenes tars saturated hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons.

«Asphaltenes are found in oil as solid parts and this plays into our approach. With relaxometry we don’t observe spectra but rather detect relaxation time and relaxation lines. Then we analyze them with regards to decrease speed. The speed depends on molecule mobility as is well-known petroleum is one of the most complicated compounds when it comes to the variety of molecules found in it. They all have differing relaxations speeds» describes Associate Professor Boris Sakharov.

The team plans to expand its research to test core samples.

Floyd Little the franchise’s star during years of struggles in the 1960s and ‘70s died Friday night following a battle with a rare form of cell cancer.

He was 78.

Universally beloved by his alma mater Syracuse by Broncos Country and by contemporaries in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Little’s passion for football energy for helping others and overall enthusiasm for life created unforgettable memories.

“Floyd Little was a true hero of the game” Pro Football Hall of Fame president David Baker said. “He was a man of great integrity passion and courage. His contributions off the field were even greater than his amazing accomplishments he did on it. Floyd’s smile heart and character epitomized what it meant to have a Hall of Fame life.”

Little who resided in the Las Vegas area began chemotherapy treatments last May and his former Syracuse teammate and long-time friend Pat Killorin started a GoFundMe to help cover the medical expenses. On Nov. 21 Killorin announced Little had been placed in hospice.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Little “was not only a Hall of Fame running back he was a Hall of Fame person. Faith family and football were the pillars of his life. I was so fortunate to know Floyd and witnessed first-hand the impact he had on others.”

Little is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame (1983) the Broncos’ inaugural Ring of Fame class (1984) and the Pro Football Hall of Fame (2010).

Little joined the Broncos in their eighth year of existence (1967) and was their bright light as the team struggled to become competitive. A five-time Pro Bowl selection and one-time All Pro Little played all of his 117 games for the Broncos retiring in 1975 with 6323 yards rushing and a combined 53 rushing/receiving/return touchdowns.

“Without question Floyd was one of the greatest Broncos of all-time and an unforgettable part of our history” Broncos president/CEO Joe Ellis said in a statement Saturday. “He rightfully earned the nickname ‘The Franchise’ for his profound impact on this organization helping put the Broncos on the pro football map in the early days.”

Little’s No. 44 is one of only three jerseys retired by the Broncos joining quarterback John Elway (No. 7) and quarterbacks Frank Tripucka/Peyton Manning (No. 18).

Little is survived by his wife DeBorah three children (Marc Christy and Kyra) and five grandchildren.

Connection with Ernie Davis

Floyd Little was born July 4 1942 in New Haven Conn. and attended Hillhouse High School in New Haven and Bordentown Military Institute in New Jersey. He was six when his father died of cancer.

Little was recruited by the United States Military Academy (led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur) Notre Dame and Syracuse. Little’s meeting with MacArthur was at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and included meeting baseball stars Roy Campanella and Elston Howard.

“General MacArthur pretty much guaranteed that I’d become the first African-American general” Little said in 2010. “When you think about that I could’ve been Colin Powell’s boss. I could’ve been General (Norman) Schwarzkopf’s boss. I could’ve been General (David) Petraeus’ boss. Just think about that.”

According to reports Little chose Syracuse on the advice of former Orange running back Ernie Davis who visited Little in Connecticut. At Syracuse Little continued the tradition of star running backs who wore No. 44 following Jim Brown and Davis.

A three-time All-America selection from 1964-66 (freshmen were ineligible to play) Little rushed for 2704 yards and 46 touchdowns. He finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy balloting in ’65 and ’66. Little played in the same Orange backfield as future Hall of Fame running back Larry Csonka and two-time Super Bowl-winning coach Tom Coughlin.

In 2010 decades after his college career Little returned to Syracuse to be a special assistant to the athletic director aiding with fundraising recruiting and mentoring.

“No one loves Syracuse University as Floyd Little loves Syracuse University — he truly is Mr. Syracuse University” Coughlin said.

As Little was starring for the football team Jim Boeheim was playing for the Syracuse basketball team and has been the program’s coach since 1976.

“Floyd was one of a kind on and off the field” Boeheim said in comments distributed by Syracuse on Saturday. “He could make anybody smile. He could get along with everybody. He had everybody feel good about themselves and everything else. … It’s hard to explain how great of a person Floyd Little was. There is nobody better than Floyd Little in any way shape or form on the field or off the field.

“It was a privilege just to know Floyd Little.”

Upon his return to Syracuse Little said Davis who died at age 24 in 1963 due to leukemia was the motivating factor.

“My life has been tied to Ernie’s life because I wanted to be the Ernie Davis that he couldn’t be” Little said. “That’s how I lived my life because of Ernie Davis not having a chance to live his.”

Little worked at Syracuse until 2016 when he and his wife relocated to Las Vegas.

“Floyd Little embodied what it means to be Orange” Syracuse Chancellor Kent Syverud said in a statement. “He was an all-American student-athlete. He set records in the NFL. He achieved success in the business world. Floyd mentored countless student-athletes and dedicated his time energy and resources to improving the lives of others. He was a great friend to me and to his beloved Syracuse University. … Floyd Little No. 44 will forever be our Orange MVP.”

President-elect Joe Biden was a Syracuse Law School student when Little played for the Orange and the two remained in contact for the ensuing decades.

“He was full of character decency and integrity” Biden said in a statement released Saturday night. “I remember our call when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the joy in his voice. And I remember the more recent call when he shared his cancer diagnosis and how fearless he was in his conviction to fight it.

“As with everything else he did in life Floyd lived to the very end with grit and heart and love for his family and faith in God. I will miss my friend. He was a good man.”

Great player on bad team

Still looking for their first winning season the Broncos chose Little sixth overall in the 1967 AFL/NFL draft. Four players from the first round would become Hall of Fame members — Purdue quarterback Bob Griese (fourth to Miami) Notre Dame defensive tackle Alan Page (15th to Minnesota) and Texas A&M guard Gene Upshaw (17th to Oakland).

Griese and Upshaw became Super Bowl champions and Page played in four title games. Team success though eluded Little for his entire Broncos career.

Playing on struggling teams and with mix-and-match quarterbacks Little was long the Broncos’ shining light. He was the NFL rushing champion in 1971 (1133 yards) and currently ranks second in team history in rushing attempts (1641) yards (6323) and touchdowns (43) behind fellow Hall of Famer Terrell Davis in all three categories.

Little never appeared in a playoff game and was a part of only two winning teams (7-5-2 in ’73 and 7-6-1 in ’74) but his contributions to making pro football in this region a hit will never be forgotten.

Little led the Broncos in rushing seven times and the season-ticket base rose from 24650 to 49000 during his career.

“Without Floyd Little there would be no Denver Broncos” said Tom Mackie who co-authored Little’s 2006 autobiography in a 2010 interview with the Post’s Mark Kiszla. “Either they don’t get picked up by the NFL in the merger or they move to Alabama and become the Birmingham Broncos.”

Think about this: In the first 23 years of Broncos history Little was the only eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee to play for the franchise. From 1983-2002 six eventual Hall of Famers starred for Denver.

Translation: For many years Little was It for the Broncos.

Little’s first six Broncos teams never won more than five games. The AFL West in those days was ruled by Kansas City and Oakland. But he led the AFL in 1969 in yards per rush (5.0) and yards per game (81.0) and earned All-Pro honors.

In Little’s final home game against Philadelphia in December 1975 he scored on a 66-yard catch and a two-yard rush.

At the time of his retirement he ranked seventh all-time in rushing and he had nearly 5000 more yards rushing than the next-closest Broncos player.

Little was universally beloved by fans and teammates and widely respected by opponents.

Two days after he played his 117th and final pro football game and one day after he announced his retirement Floyd Little was honored in a letter to the editor that appeared in the Dec. 22 1975 Miami Herald.

“I always dreaded seeing him come out of the backfield on a pass pattern or get the handoff from the quarterback always wondering how I would ever stop him. No matter how bruised and battered he was after the game he always managed to find me in the middle of the field to say hello and ask about my health. … He is a person which all children can look up to and the parents can honestly say ‘I hope my child grows up to be like him.’”

The letter was signed “Nicholas A. Buoniconti” Dolphins linebacker.

Long wait to enter Canton

Little’s wait for pro football immortality was frustrating. He had the support of his contemporaries like former Baltimore Colts tight end/NFL Players Association president John Mackey who wrote to the selection committee: “If there’s no room for Floyd Little in the Hall of Fame please take me out and put him in.”

Thirty-five years after his retirement Little was selected for induction. Shortly after he received a call from former Pittsburgh defensive lineman “Mean” Joe Greene.

“He said ‘Floyd you’re the best football player I’ve ever played against in my 16 years’” Little said in a February 2019 interview. “I said ‘Joe are you serious?’ And he said ‘You’re the best football player. Not running back. Best football player I played against.’”

What did Buoniconti and “Mean Joe” see? The first great Broncos player. Period.

“If I were a (New York) Jet and had the same career I had I would have been in a long time ago” Little said in 2010.

Maybe so but Little never let his long wait dampen his enthusiasm for having a bust in Canton Ohio.

In February 2019 the Hall of Famers gathered in a second-floor ballroom at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis for the annual Merlin Olsen Luncheon. Little walked over to the Denver media contingent on hand to cover the next night’s selection of owner Pat Bowlen and cornerback Champ Bailey.

If there is somebody who enjoyed being a Hall of Famer more than Floyd Little they need to step forward. He loved the jacket. He loved going back to Canton. He loved all of the events with his colleagues. He loved it all.

As the interview was breaking up Little was asked “What’s it really like to be a Hall of Famer?”

“I tell the guys if you’re not feeling well you’re sick you have a little cold just can’t get started — go to your closet and put this baby on” he said of his gold jacket. “You will feel so much better. Wearing one of these is one of the great experiences in my life.

“I love wearing it. It makes me feel different.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vZXRmZm9jdXMvbWFya2V0LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS81LXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1zZWN0b3JzLXRvLXdhdGNoLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Stock Market Sectors To Watch In 2021 - ETF Focus on TheStreet: ETF research and Trade Ideas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/market-intelligence/5-stock-market-sectors-to-watch-2021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vZXRmZm9jdXMvbWFya2V0LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS81LXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1zZWN0b3JzLXRvLXdhdGNoLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Locomotives pulled into the Iron Mountain Depot at that site from around 1903 until 1913 when fire destroyed the building. They soon pulled in again when the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MoPac) in 1917 erected the depot that still stands today. The Missouri Pacific used an Italianate style of architecture for its depots to establish a corporate identity so the depot has arched windows a hipped tower and elaborate decorative brackets that surround the building which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

Who came here on the Missouri Pacific? Movie stars politicians gangsters athletes tourists race fans invalids seeking the thermal waters and many more. In the heyday of railroad travel up to four trains a day rolled into Hot Springs. During the height of the tourist season some of the trains consisted of a dozen or more coaches and sleeping cars and a single train would bring several hundred visitors mostly from the North and the East. But eventually the Missouri Pacific was running into Hot Springs at a loss and the company ended the Hot Springs to Little Rock service.

On Jan. 21 1964 Train No. 37 was the last MoPac into Hot Springs. Mayor Dan Wolf over a dozen retired railroad men and a host of other passengers made a final sentimental rail journey into Hot Springs on the crowded train. Twenty-two first-graders from Ramble School rode the return train to Little Rock making their first (and possibly last) train trip in the era of planes and cars and buses. (They in fact had to return to Hot Springs by bus.)

But the depot lived on — for a while as a Greyhound Bus Depot. Then in 1973 Peter Joers turned the structure into the Sawmill Depot restaurant. It quickly became a favorite of locals especially the city’s legal and business communities. Once a week you could spot Virginia Kelley President Clinton’s mother among the diners and musician Paul Simon had lunch there more than once. Many locals still recall the Sawmill’s French onion soup with longing.

In 1994 Joers sold the building to the city which assigned the restoration of the depot and the planning of its plaza to Taylor/Kempkes Architects. Their work on the project won an “Outstanding Contemporary Architecture in an Historic Setting” award from the Historic Preservation Alliance of Arkansas. The depot housed the city’s transportation facility and headquarters and for a while it also housed the Hot Springs Area Metropolitan Planning Organization and a real estate firm.

Today the depot is occupied by Hot Springs Intracity Transit (IT) and the city’s Stormwater Management Department. Outside the building you can enjoy Transportation Plaza which is beautifully landscaped with park benches historic lighting and an outdoor sculpture garden. You can follow Transportation Plaza Trail which leads to the rest of Hot Springs Creek Greenway Trail.

The city has not forgotten the building’s history. From railroad spikes to MoPac brochures conductors’ hats train lanterns even a hand-push luggage cart — the depot lobby is full of fascinating exhibits and the walls are lined with historic photos and posters of passenger railroad days. So visit the depot (when the pandemic is over) — and listen for a ghostly whistle.

With the arrival of 2021 will come new and continuing construction for businesses and government agencies in Henderson County especially in Hendersonville as well as new jobs.

The construction of three hotels in downtown Hendersonville could ramp up this year. The Courthouse Inn a five-story boutique hotel with a restaurant and meeting space was approved by City Council in December and will be built on a vacant lot at 101 N. Church St. behind the Historic Courthouse.

The Cedars Lodge and Spa at 211 Seventh Ave. W. is proposed to include two buildings of at least six stories in height to house 132 hotel suites/condos as well as underground parking decks for condo owners. The proposal was approved by the Planning Board in December and is on City Council’s Jan. 7 agenda for consideration.

A multi-story hotel off Church Street and Fourth Avenue is proposed for the current Dogwood public parking lot. A final decision hasn’t been made by the city yet on that project.

Other development in the city includes a new police station and a parking garage at the corner of Church Street and Fifth Avenue West. Construction of the station is well underway with anticipated completion in late summer 2021.

Construction of the garage is scheduled to begin in late April according to Communications Manager Allison Justus.

Kiosks for metered parking on Main Street will be installed in December and the meters will be turned on in January 2022.

In the Seventh Avenue District a water and sewer replacement project in the Ashe Street neighborhood should begin this summer followed by curb and gutter installation and the completion of housing rehabilitation projects. The Seventh Avenue Streetscape project will go out to bid in the fall with construction to begin shortly after.

A three-story medical office building is also on the table for Fleming Street. The proposed site is located behind Pardee Hospital.

A decision on where to relocate Boyd Park mini golf and tennis courts to make room for the construction of a new city fire station could move forward in 2021. Justus said City Council may receive a recommendation for an architect in February or March to design the station.

“At that time City Council will make a decision on the station but not necessarily on where the park amenities will be located” she said.

Downtown is planning to continue LoveHendo Saturdays also known as Open Streets in 2021 with anticipated changes to support downtown businesses during the new year. One weekend a month Main Street is closed to traffic to allow for social distancing and a more relaxed shopping and dining experience.

Despite budget planning for a 20% decrease in city sales tax revenues April through June and 10% July through September due to COVID-19 the only decrease was in seen was 5% in March and 7% in April according to data available through September.

“If this trend continues on the current trajectory we expect to end the year between $400000 to $800000 over budget” Justus said. “With COVID numbers escalating and the vaccine on the way there is no way to reliably predict how sales taxes will be impacted over the next few months.”

With coronavirus looming and vaccinations beginning many students and parents are likely wondering when in-person learning can begin full-time. School Board Chairman Blair Craven said an emergency meeting has been called for Monday Jan. 4 at noon to discuss just that.

“I think having a vaccine clearly will help make a decision on being able to basically return back to ‘normal’” Craven said. “I’m not sure how quickly that’s going to happen. … A vaccine will make decisions easier for us down the road.”

Another big topic in 2021 for the school district is the progress of renovations and new construction at Hendersonville High. Students not being in class because of COVID-19 last year sped up the construction timeline but that doesn’t mean it will be finished ahead of schedule due to other constraints. It’s still on track to be finished by the 2023-24 school year.

The county also has a lot of development on the horizon this year. Plans for a new industrial park in Flat Rock are expected to move forward following a $38 million investment with the addition of a manufacturing facility for Jabil Healthcare. A division of Jabil Inc. the largest global manufacturing solutions provider in the health care industry will be the first in the 41-acre park.

The 180000-square-foot facility is set to open in January 2022. The investment is projected to create 150 jobs.

The park is being developed due to ae three-party agreement with Henderson County the city of Hendersonville and the Economic Investment Fund of Henderson County.

The Board of Commissioners’ approval of incentives for a $5 million economic investment that could create 60 jobs to Fletcher is also on tap. The investment is known as “Project Helios.”

Another decision in late 2020 could prove fruitful this year. Land is under contract for purchase to create the 19-mile Ecusta Trail greenway in Henderson and Transylvania counties.

The grant for construction will be available in October which is when officials plan to start putting together construction drawings according to Director of Business and Community Development John Mitchell.

A Lowe's distribution center and a business center could open this year in Mills River. Construction of the distribution center off Banner Farm Road is expected to be complete in the late summer or early fall of 2021.

The Mills River Business Center is planned for 80 School House Road near Bold Rock Cidery and is expected to be complete during the fourth quarter of 2021.

Single-family houses duplexes quadplexes senior living developments villas and apartments are in the works around the county and will add more than 2630 housing units in the coming years if built as proposed. Among those are a handful of subdivisions.

Improvements to the Etowah area's water system is planned for this year as well. The project will include extending water lines construction of a pump station and installation of a water storage tank.

The Multi-area Streambank Restoration Project is on schedule and expected to finish by the end of February.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Shares have lost about 2% in that time frame outperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release or is Jack Henry due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

Jack Henry's Q4 Earnings Beat

Jack Henry & Associates reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings of $1.10 per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10%. Further the bottom line increased 6% year over year.



Revenues improved 7% year over year to $482.7 million which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $480.8 million.



The company’s non-GAAP revenues were $477.4 million up 8% from the year-ago quarter.



Top-line growth was driven by increased processing and services and support revenues. Additionally strength across the Core Payments Complementary and Corporate segments drove the results.

Top Line in Detail

Services & Support: The company generated revenues of $279.7 million from the category (58% of revenues). Notably the figure rose 7% from the year-ago quarter owing to growth in cloud processing revenues.



However declining deconversion fees were negatives.



Processing: The category yielded revenues of $202.9 million (42% of revenues) in the reported quarter up 8% year over year. This can be attributed to 31.3% growth in Jack Henry's digital revenues and growing card-processing fee revenues.

Segments in Detail

Core: The company generated revenues of $151.5 million from the segment (31.4% of the total revenues) increasing 8% year over year.



Payments: The segment yielded revenues of $177.3 million (36.7% of the total revenues) increasing 5% from the year-ago quarter.



Complementary: The segment generated $140.3 million in revenues (29.1% of the total revenues) increasing 9% year over year.



Corporate & Other: The company generated revenues of $13.6 million from the segment (2.8% of the total revenues) up 22% from the prior-year quarter.

Operating Details

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 total operating expenses were $378.9 million reflecting a year-over-year increase of 7%. This can primarily be attributed to higher personnel and travel costs and rising expenses related to the company’s card-processing platform.



As a percentage of revenues the figure contracted 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 78.5%.



Notably the operating margin was 22% in the reported quarter which expanded 100 bps on a year-over-year basis.

Balance Sheet

As of Jun 30 2022 cash and cash equivalents totaled $48.8 million which increased from $39.8 million as of Mar 31 2022.



Trade receivables were $348.1 million in the reported quarter up from $222.7 million in the previous quarter.



The current and long-term debt stood at $115.1 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter compared with $225.1 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter.

Guidance

For fiscal 2023 the company expects GAAP revenues of $2.080-$2.087 billion.



The company anticipates non-GAAP revenues of $2.045-$2.052 billion.



It expects earnings of $5.05-$5.09 per share.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.

The consensus estimate has shifted -8% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

At this time Jack Henry has a great Growth Score of A though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Following the exact same course the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.

Overall the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Jack Henry has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

On Monday the Kenosha City Council is expected to vote on a resolution put forward by Mayor John Antaramian that if approved would create an emergency declaration for the city “regarding potential civil unrest"" in the event DA Michael Graveley makes a decision within the first two full weeks of January.

Graveley has said he would make an announcement during that time frame but has not been more specific.

The resolution cites the violent protests that took place in late August after Blake was shot by Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey on Aug. 23. The shooting left Blake paralyzed.

Large protests broke out in Kenosha and caused millions of dollars in damage to public and private property. More than 250 people were arrested on various charges during the unrest.

Some Kenosha businesses already have started boarding up windows and doors according to a report from TMJ4.

While Graveley mulls whether to charge Sheskey a pretrial hearing is scheduled for Kyle Rittenhouse on Tuesday in Kenosha.

Rittenhouse is charged with homicide recklessly endangering safety possessing a dangerous weapon and failure to comply with curfew after he shot three people Aug. 25 killing two of them during one of the protests after the Blake shooting.

Both cases have been in the national spotlight.

In the Blake case protesters have called for charges against Sheskey as well as broad police reform while others believe there has been a rush to judgment.

In the Rittenhouse case some including his attorneys have claimed he acted in self-defense while others suggest he was an out-of-control self-appointed guard. Rittenhouse has said he was guarding a business on the night of the shooting.

Its possible armed protesters might show up in Kenosha on Tuesday for the Rittenhouse hearing as they did on Dec. 3 according to the Kenosha News to show their support. On Sunday Antaramian announced precautionary measures that will include a curfew reduced bus service road closures and designation of a space for demonstrations.

Four men in black tactical gear pinned him his face to the concrete to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

“I didn’t do anything” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders.

It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6 2019 in the Danville Correctional Center a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated but hardly unwatched.

He had entered in good health with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks Mr. Johnson who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had refused to eat or take his medication. Most dangerous of all he had stealthily stopped drinking water hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L2pvaG5zb25zLXRyZWF0bWVudC1ub3QtdHJhdW1hLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtcGxhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Optimism doubt ahead of Johnson's Treatment Not Trauma mental health plan,"Belmont Cragin residents were filing into the cafeteria at Prieto Math and Science Academy last month to weigh in on Mayor Brandon Johnson’s signature plan to overhaul Chicago’s mental health system when they got unexpected evidence that the bold still largely theoretical plan remains a focus at City Hall.

Into the school walked Johnson an unannounced guest at the community forum surrounded by a flock of leading administration officials.

“It’s one of our top priorities” he told attendees before talking about his older brother Leon who dealt with untreated mental illness and died addicted and unhoused. “Our ultimate goal our primary goal is that we provide mental health services without barriers. That when where and however individuals and families need these services the city of Chicago shows up.”

Despite the mayor’s words however the actual progress on his campaign promise to install the so-called Treatment Not Trauma plan remains difficult for Chicagoans to see. The City Council tasked a working group with answering many of the toughest implementation questions: where to open facilities what to ask for in the budget how many people to hire and more. Beyond that few changes have materialized.

But the path forward should soon become clearer: A year into Johnson’s first term the working group’s report outlining the plan’s future will be published later this month. For the coalition of activists who have spent a decade pushing for the policy and dogging mayors to enact it the city’s report should finally prove whether or not Johnson is truly offering a different path for mental health care in Chicago.

The people working to implement Treatment Not Trauma remain optimistic about the potentially sweeping policy’s future. But some of its proponents looking in from outside the bureaucratic process worry the long-awaited proposals are moving too slowly and will not live up to the bold vision championed by years of community organizing.

Johnson quickly passed an ordinance to launch the city’s working group once in office but to move forward the policy needs “active leadership” from City Hall not “infinite working groups infinite consensus buildings and no movement” said Eric Reinhart a public health law and psychiatry anthropologist and physician who co-drafted the “white paper” report published by the activist coalition that pushed for the policy.

“I think it’s quite disappointing to all of us that a year into this administration that even on the campaign stage held up Treatment Not Trauma as one of its core priorities we still haven’t made any steps forward” he said. “Everybody’s getting a working group but where are we seeing implementation?”

But Reinhart’s white paper co-author Arturo Carrillo expressed optimism after the Prieto Academy event. A member of the working group preparing the policy’s path forward Carrillo is also a social worker who directs violence prevention and health initiatives for the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council part of the broad Treatment Not Trauma coalition.

“It’s almost like we are playing catch up” Carrillo said. “This should have been started four years ago. Under the last administration. We were constantly being told no we were constantly seeing barriers put up. Complete resistance to any input. Now we absolutely see the wheels of government moving.”

The plan took its first steps toward concrete action in November when Johnson’s 2024 budget included $15.9 million to double non-police emergency response and another $5.2 million to reopen two of the 14 city-run mental health centers closed by past mayors. Nearly six months later the clinics have yet to reopen.

Johnson’s policy chief Umi Grigsby and Deputy Mayor of Community Safety Garien Gatewood defended the slow progress as proof the city is carefully gathering input across the city and “going at the pace of community.” So far the city has hosted 15 public feedbacks centered on the plan which remains on track to follow the timeline set by the City Council.

“This process has been very intentional” Gatewood said. “We are trying to do things that folks have never done before. Instead of coming in and prescribing to folks ‘This is what you need’ we are building together in real time.”

Grigsby and Gatewood declined to share specifics about the city’s Treatment Not Trauma plan in an interview last week citing the need to wait for the working group to first share its report with the City Council. But the two administration leaders helping to steer the fledgling policy hinted at its scope.

“Our goal is to expand mental health services. And so that means that we have to look at staffing we have to look at career pipelines we have to look at budgeting in the long term” Grigsby said.

Johnson’s administration plans to add the first two clinics by the end of the year and expects more clinics after this year Grigsby said.

The clinic reopenings are also a goal of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees a strong Johnson labor ally whose members lost jobs when Mayor Rahm Emanuel shuttered six city-run clinics in 2011.

The AFSCME International Union PAC contributed $100000 to Johnson’s mayoral campaign last year according to state campaign finance records. And AFSCME Illinois Council 31’s PAC contributed $56750 to Johnson in 2018 during his successful run for Cook County commissioner.

Many activists claim city-run centers are a better option than the private nonprofit clinics that serve many Chicagoans because the city clinics have more oversight focus on outcomes over cost and have a more substantial community connection.

It is so far unclear where the clinics will reopen though Johnson promised they will come “in neighborhoods with the highest unmet needs.” City leaders have also recently said they may expand mental health care by layering services into existing Chicago Department of Public Health clinics.

Johnson also intends to continue building out the Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement or CARE program piloted by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot Gatewood said.

The program sends non-police first responders to 911 calls regarding mental health crises substance use and homelessness issues currently using a handful of teams operating in selected neighborhoods. Gatewood declined to say how common CARE responses could become across the city but described expansion as a way to relieve pressure on overworked police.

“There are areas and spaces that police shouldn’t be responding to right? We know that they know that and a lot of community members know that too” he said.

The two leaders had little to say about a proposed third pillar of the Treatment Not Trauma plan: a new expansive network of nonprofessional “community care workers” employed by the city to work in neighborhood-based teams.

The so-called care corps would mark a dramatic shift away from clinic-based mental health services. Its workers would be tasked with finding ways to meet smaller needs through daily outreach in a bid to prevent mental health crises before they occur.

The positions were not specifically discussed as a series of city leaders spoke at the Prieto Academy gathering though speakers did reference a need for “extensive community outreach.”

And Gatewood and Grigsby shared few thoughts when asked about the role care workers would play in the policy’s implementation but flagged the need to build mental health outreach worker training pipelines alongside city colleges and schools.

“It’s about growing and expanding not only the services but the people who are able to provide those services” Grigsby said.

If the city does not implement a large-scale care corps as a part of Treatment Not Trauma it will fall short of the standards set forth by activists who started to push for the policy after Emanuel closed the clinics Reinhart said.

The policy’s original vision was not “just creating a bunch of city-run mental health centers where people can see psychiatrists and therapists” Reinhart said. Instead it was to have a whole new model — one that uses traditional clinic-based care and the alternative emergency response aspect but also relies heavily on care workers.

“Simply expanding the existing model that’s not TNT. That’s something else and it’s already failed” he said. “My biggest concern is that pieces of the vision will be closed off and touted as TNT without the whole vision. But you need the whole thing for it to work.”

Ald. Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez 33rd the policy’s chief City Council proponent tried unsuccessfully for years to move it forward under Lightfoot’s administration. The gradual process to “make it a reality” now allows for it to be “rooted in community” she said.

“There is a lot of work to do” Rodriguez Sanchez said. “What we are trying to do does not exist anywhere in the country.”

Johnson & Johnson’s ""Middle East"" section lists ""Palestine"" among 20 markets including Iran Iraq Jordan and Lebanon. When Fox News Digital checked the site on Sunday morning there was no option for Israel.

When asked about why Israel was omitted from the site a company spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the tool isn't used for all markets and those customers in markets not listed including Israel use a different method to order products from Johnson & Johnson.

""The J&J Customer Connect portal is an order management tool for many but not all markets – it is not a list of all markets or regions where the Company operates or where products are sold"" a company spokesperson said.

There will be disruption as a result of the increased bureaucracy between the UK and its largest trading partner but there was little sign of the chaos some had feared on January 1.

And the Prime Minister said the UK has “taken back control of our money our laws and our waters” after the Brexit transition period with the European Union came to an end at 11pm on December 31.

Mr Johnson said the decision to leave the single market and customs union ended a “47-year experiment” of European Union membership.

He said the EU had provided the UK with a “safe European home” during the 1970s but the country has now “changed out of all recognition” with global perspectives.

The UK is “free to do things differently and if necessary better than our friends in the EU” in 2021 he said in a video message to mark New Year.

As well as the Christmas Eve deal with Brussels the UK has reached several agreements with non-EU countries – such as Japan – to ensure continuity of trading arrangements for British companies from January 1.

Mr Johnson writing in the Daily Telegraph said the “great new deal” with the EU honours the “most basic promises” of the 2016 referendum and added that the UK has “taken back control of our money our laws and our waters”.

“And yet it is also the essence of this treaty that it provides certainty for UK business and industry because it means that we can continue to trade freely – with zero tariffs and zero quotas – with the EU.”

In a sign that the UK will break away from the EU rules it inherited Mr Johnson said: “We need the Brexit-given chance to turbocharge those sectors in which we excel to do things differently and to do them better.”

Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney said the change in trading arrangements with the UK will inevitably cause disruption.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re now going to see the 80 billion euro (£71.2 billion) worth of trade across the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland disrupted by an awful lot more checks and declarations and bureaucracy and paperwork and cost and delay.”

Ferry operator Stena Line said six freight loads destined for Ireland had been turned away at Holyhead due to incorrect paperwork.

Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the EU should be ready to welcome an independent Scotland back into the bloc.

“Scotland will be back soon Europe. Keep the light on” she said.

Scottish voters did not back Brexit and the First Minister views it as a major issue in her campaign to break away from the UK.

Under the new arrangements freedom of movement rights end and while UK citizens can still travel for work or pleasure there are different rules.

Passports must be valid for more than six months visas or permits may be needed for long stays pets need a health certificate and drivers need extra documents.

Hauliers face new rules and lorry drivers heading for the Continent must have a Kent Access Permit before entering the county in an effort to curb tailbacks on cross-Channel routes.

Travel to Ireland does not change but the Northern Ireland Protocol means Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods and will apply EU customs rules at its ports even though the region is still part of the UK customs territory.

The protocol will also see Northern Ireland follow certain EU rules on state aid and VAT.

This fall two Longhorns will enter the McCombs School of Business with a unique support system. Todd Maclin BBA ’78 Life Member a retired executive with a storied career at JPMorgan Chase along with his wife and children has created a Texas Exes scholarship designed to give Black students from the Dallas/Fort Worth area access to the personal and professional network the family has built together.

Motivated by the distressing news cycle and national conversation about race the Maclins started talking last summer about what they could do to help. The result was an endowment large enough to cover tuition and fees annually for two students and a commitment to be there for them however they could—phone calls setting up lunch dates with influential family friends and introductions to industry leaders who could offer advice. The family agreed that their shared network had been a major factor in getting them to and through competitive colleges. Beyond just writing a check those connections could be the most life-changing gift. The Alcalde spoke with Todd and Diana Maclin their daughter Brinkley and their daughter-in-law Jessica about the scholarship.

Take us back to this summer when you had the idea for this scholarship. How did it come together?

TODD MACLIN: I was aware of all this social conflict and agitation for change that was going on. I started thinking about the benefits we’ve all had. We were all fortunate to have someone able to fund our college education. That’s a huge burden that sits on the shoulders of so many students. We really didn’t have to worry about it so we wanted to pay it forward.

DIANA MACLIN: And the more we started talking to people and getting feedback from folks in Austin and some good friends in the Black community here in Dallas we thought: The more local it is the better. The whole family lives in Dallas and the need in this area is so great.

TM: And the business school—that’s an area where I could actually be a resource and a mentor.

Did the events of this summer affect the way you see the world?

JESSICA MACLIN: This scholarship is absolutely influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement that we’ve seen this year but it’s also just another avenue through which the Maclins can support the Black community in our hometown.

What do you all value most as a family? Which causes do you gravitate toward?

DM: Our family has all been really involved with equity and supporting first-generation college-bound children and their families. I think it’s a natural progression for us to establish this at The University of Texas.

BRINKLEY MACLIN SCHNEIDER: When I was in high school my mother was a reader in Dallas ISD for a little boy who had been badly burned in an accident and had been ostracized because of it. They identified her to help get him to be accepted by his peers. She worked very hard on that. There were moments when I was a teenager when she would say “I know you’ve got this thing today but I promised that I would be there to read.” That was always a priority.

TM: In my experience there is no greater game-changer than a good education. I’ve seen it in my own kids—even though their situation is different from someone who can’t afford to go to college. I think about their graduate degrees and how they have shaped them. But it’s not just education for us; it’s education for those who are less privileged.

The word “privilege” has become a lightning rod lately. How do you all feel about it?

TM: Let me go first because I suspect you’ll get four answers. On a political spectrum we are not all shoulder-to-shoulder. I recognize the privileges I’ve received and I value them. I also recognize other people haven’t had the same. But I’ve also had to overcome obstacles just like everyone else. Sometimes the rhetoric out there is just too black and white. Your definition of the phrase “Black lives matter” may be different than mine. What I say is: Yeah they do matter—so let’s do something about it. I prefer to focus on making a meaningful difference.

JM: I would say I’m a white female so I’m privileged. And to not recognize that would be a huge misstep on my part. I’m grateful to Todd and Diana for including me in this because it will change lives and hopefully be a model for others who can give this generously.

BMS: I was most confronted with it in my first few years of teaching at Bishop Dunne Catholic School in Dallas. It’s a very diverse school across every category and I saw that even when my students were accepted to Stanford and Cornell and Brown there was a lot that kept them from getting there. I would get so frustrated with the way things work in the world. When we started talking about this issue as a family I wanted to scream from the mountaintops—yes this is what I’ve seen!

Why was creating a network for these students part of the vision?

TM: Well I think that is the ultimate evidence of privilege. When it’s time to go find a job your advantages are significant if you have access to senior people at companies. It might not get you the job but it helps you know how to interview feel like you belong and a whole host of things. If you have relationships that can help you throughout your life it makes a big difference.

Looking ahead five years from now what kind of relationship do you all hope to have with these students?

DM: Hopefully we can have a kind of rapport where they are comfortable enough to ask

us anything.

TM: We are open to whatever works. If they need help or advice if we get to meet their families over the years … we just want them to know we are here. But it has to be natural and we can’t force it on them.

So they won’t be required to wear the Maclin family Christmas sweater right away?

[Laughter.]

JM: The most important mentors will be Longhorns who are people of color themselves or who come from the same background and are leaders in their field. Our scholarship advisers in Dallas the professors on campus and the Texas Exes staff. And if other alumni want to help we would love to have them involved.

You all are giving a gift. But is there anything you hope to gain from this as a family?

BMS: I truly believe that when there is a diverse representation of human beings making decisions—it only helps. So being able to contribute these McCombs School graduates to the business world is just a positive thing. Selfishly it’s going to be rewarding for our family. But also I’m looking at the country my children will inherit.

JM: I feel so lucky that we can offer this. There are many people who want to help but who don’t have the same medium. I’m proud of this family for taking what we have and putting it to proper use.

TM: Jessica is going to have a baby in four weeks; we are going to make her cry.

[Laughter all around.]

TM: You know this is a multi-generational thing going on here and we’re all coming to the table with different perspectives. Instead of having a conversation that’s highly speculative or opinionated I hope we can have an enriching experience together and really learn something from it. We did this. We met this person. Here’s what we learned about their lives. There’s no arguing with that. It’s their reality.

In 2013 Live Oak Bank got interested in chickens. The bank which formed five years earlier had grown fast by making Small Business Administration loans nationally to veterinarians medical practices funeral homes and other businesses that it understood well. CEO Chip Mahan wanted to add poultry farmers to the bank’s collection of specialty industries.

He called an El Dorado Ark. banker who was the nation’s most successful lender to chicken farmers recalls Lee Williams Live Oak’s co-founder and vice chairman. “The guy said ‘I’m perfectly happy down here.’”

That didn’t discourage Mahan says Williams who met him in the 1970s when both worked for Wachovia Bank in Winston-Salem.

“Just like he’s always done he called him in June and he called him in September” Williams says.

On the latter call the El Dorado banker revealed that he had developed cancer and that his employer was “‘treating me really really bad related to me being really really sick. And I’m ready to talk to you about taking my chicken-lending team and coming to work for Live Oak’” Williams says.

Live Oak started poultry lending in January 2014 and has since issued $1.2 billion in loans. It’s part of the reason the Wilmington-based bank with no branches tellers or ATMs has made more Small Business Administration 7(a) loans than any financial institution over the last three years.

Larger than life

Live Oak and its technology offshoot nCino which have a combined stock market value of nearly $10 billion are built in large part on the 69-year-old Mahan’s ability to recruit talent. So is Canapi Ventures the Washington D.C.-based investment firm that has raised $545 million for financial-technology investments and Apiture another affiliated tech company.

Mahan certainly has some technology credibility. In the 1990s he started the country’s first online-only bank in Atlanta. The Wilmington campus housing Live Oak nCino and Apiture has a design that has drawn architectural industry raves. But he takes issue with being portrayed as a Silicon Valley-style entrepreneur.

“We’ve got to get one thing straight” he says. “I am not a technical guy and I am not a visionary. I hang around guys that are really really smart. And then you give them a little capital and it’s amazing what they do.”

Those people say there is something amazing about Mahan. They’ve watched as he’s grown Live Oak from an idea to a bank with $8 billion in assets and $1.8 billion market value while developing other enterprises with potentially even greater prospects.

“He had the self-confidence of a successful entrepreneur” says Joseph Smith Jr. the N.C. banking commissioner when Live Oak was chartered. “He was a tough son of a bitch. He had a good idea. And he was willing to put his own money up and make a go of it.”

Mahan lured Huntley Garriott from Goldman Sachs Group to Wilmington to run Live Oak Bank in 2018. He calls his boss “a larger-than-life persona. … This company in a lot of ways is Chip’s persona.”

But Mahan’s entrepreneurial instincts haven’t always been so sharp.

Owning something

In the 1970s and early ’80s the Washington and Lee University graduate traveled across Tennessee and Kentucky for Wachovia selling cash management and other services to distilleries and other businesses. But he wasn’t happy working for someone else or with his $9000 annual salary. An early attempt to buy an equipment-rental franchise fizzled. In the early ’80s he spotted an opportunity: Farmers Bank & Capital Trust Co. in Frankfort Ky. the capital city where he spent his teenage years.

The stock was trading at just 25% of book value. “I got to thinking if I could get somebody to lend me the money — lend me three times what the stock’s trading for but still under book value — then we could basically buy the bank for free” he says.

Auto dealership owner Bill Gatton overheard Mahan talking about his idea on a flight between Lexington Ky. and Bristol Tenn. “I got off the plane and I went to his house and we talked until 3 a.m.” Mahan recalls. “He said ‘I’ll back you.’”

Before Mahan left his job in late 1982 to pursue the deal Wachovia CEO John Medlin gave him a warning: “‘You can’t do a hostile takeover of a community bank’” Mahan recalls Medlin saying. “‘It’s just not going to work.’”

Mahan was undeterred. “I thought I knew where the largest shareholders were because this was a small community where I grew up” Mahan says. He rented an office and started calling people. “I’m offering three times what the stock’s trading for. You know how much stock I got? Not one share.”

With a 3-year-old and 6-year-old at home Mahan had to “crawl on his belly” to get his job at Wachovia back. “But it was over after that. You just can’t go back” Mahan says. “It was exhilarating to think that you could actually own something.”

The internet beckons

Within a few months connections made during the Farmers Bank venture led to a chance to run another small community bank in Kentucky and then buy it with some other investors.

In 1985 that bank was acquired by Columbus Ohio-based Bank One which later became part of today’s JPMorgan Chase. Two years later Mahan raised $16 million and started Lexington Ky.-based Cardinal Bancshares which went public in 1992.

In 1993 over dinner with his brother-in-law Atlanta software company owner Michael McChesney Mahan heard about the internet for the first time. “I said ‘Well if people are going to go look at this stuff nationwide why don’t I advertise CDs [certificates of deposit] on the internet?’” Mahan says. “He said ‘You’re a dumbass’ — he’s way smarter than me — ‘What we need to do is put [budgeting software] Quicken on the web.’”

Mahan and McChesney flew to San Francisco and met with Marc Andreessen who helped create the first widely used web browser NCSA Mosaic and co-founded Netscape. Andreessen offered to write its software for $1 million.

McChesney nixed the deal insisting the company couldn’t let someone else own the source code. He would hire the programmers himself.

In 1995 they launched Security First Network Bank in Atlanta as the nation’s first FDIC-insured branchless online bank. It attracted just a few thousand customers who had to mail checks to the bank to deposit funds. In 1998 Mahan sold the banking operations to Royal Bank of Canada. (He’d sold Cardinal Bancshares a year earlier to another Kentucky-based community bank.)

While Security First had little success Mahan and McChesney knew they were on to something big. They spun off the technology created to develop Security First calling it S1. In the next few years it became one of the key early providers of online-banking technology for thousands of companies including JPMorgan Chase.

Team building

Chip Mahan has surrounded himself with these executives to lead Live Oak nCino Apiture and Canapi Ventures. Some are former colleagues at S1 or Wachovia.

Stepping away

In 2000 Mahan’s wife Peggy whom he’d met in Kentucky at age 11 developed cancer. Mahan quit his job as S1’s CEO but remained chairman and the couple moved to Wilmington to be closer to Duke University Hospital where she was being treated.

By 2005 Peggy’s cancer was in remission but S1 was struggling financially amid increased competition and management turmoil. Mahan returned as CEO just as activist investor Jeffrey Smith of the Starboard Value hedge fund was circling the company. Rather than wage a proxy battle S1 gave Smith a board seat where he exerted pressure successfully to put the company up for sale.

S1 directors met with 28 potential investors but attracted just one bid — from Mahan with backing from a San Francisco billionaire — for about $4 per share. The board turned it down. Mahan quit and sold all his stock the next day; it was trading at about $1.

The next week he was sitting around with Williams who had gained expertise in SBA lending while working with Mahan at Cardinal Bancshares. “We ought to start an SBA-only bank” Mahan suggested. And so Live Oak was born opening in 2008 as a state-chartered bank with a national online-lending platform.

Live Oak’s business model was to make SBA loans which are partially guaranteed by the government in industry sectors that have low default rates. It would hire lenders with deep expertise and connections in what is now 33 industry sectors.

Smith the banking commissioner says Live Oak showed a way to diversify business lending across the nation. “It wasn’t ‘bank everybody locally’ it was ‘bank everybody in an industry we understand deeply.’”

Aligning interests

An initial Live Oak investor was Neil Underwood who had met Mahan when he joined S1 in 2001 to head that company’s enterprise sales unit. Mahan told him about the new bank as the pair were sitting in a duck blind.

When Underwood expressed interest in investing Mahan inquired about his liquid net worth. After his hunting pal gave a number Mahan said “‘OK that will do’” Underwood says. “[I said] ‘You want all my liquid net worth that I’ve earned over the years in this bank?’

[Mahan replied] ‘Yep! Our interests have got to be aligned son.’”

Underwood joined Live Oak full time in 2010 and is president of the holding company. He didn’t give Mahan all his liquid net worth “but I gave him a large portion.” Government filings show Underwood now holds about 1.3 million shares or about 3.2% of the company with a mid-December valuation of about $60 million. Mahan owns nearly 16% worth about $300 million.

David Lucht who had worked with Mahan at Cardinal left the $10.5 billion Ohio-based FirstMerit Bank where he had been chief credit officer to join the new company.

“Although it was a startup I had kind of an inside knowledge that Chip usually had really good ideas” Lucht says. “I jumped at the chance.”

Leading lender

The idea has worked. Loan volume surged from $162 million in 2008 to $848 million in 2014 a year before the IPO. Three industries made up about 60% of the lending back then. Now the three biggest sectors — agriculture health care and veterinary — account for 30% with total loans topping $4.5 billion as of Sept. 30.

The lending is largely fueled by consumer deposits that grew by 60% to $4 billion over the previous 18 months. Live Oak sells online certificates of deposit that pay higher interest rates than most peers typically earning a wider profit margin because it doesn’t have the expense of branches.

The rapid growth hasn’t produced steady profit because of fluctuations in the sales of loans to other institutions. Net income peaked at $100 million in 2017 then slumped to $18 million in 2019. Shares that sold for $19 at the IPO reached $30 in mid-2018 before selling off over the next 20 months. Last March amid the stock market’s pandemic panic shares traded under $10. Since then they’ve quadrupled to more than $46 in mid-December.

In October Raymond James analyst Ammar M. Samma upgraded Live Oak from “outperform” to “strong buy” calling the third quarter the strongest in the company’s history. Live Oak “blew away our expectations this quarter” for its net interest margin and loan growth he wrote.

A few days later the SBA named Live Oak the agency’s largest lender by dollar volume processing more than 1000 loans worth nearly $1.5 billion in the 2020 fiscal year. It also ranked first in the two previous years.

Fintech future

While loans and deposits are Live Oak’s core what sets Mahan apart is his growing collection of financial-technology companies. The bank spun out nCino as a separate company in 2011 to focus on cloud software developed by the bank to manage its lending. Mahan and Pierre Naudé another former S1 colleague hired to run the business figured other companies would pay for the technology.

Revenue is expected to top $170 million this year and nCino (a play on encino the Spanish word for oak) calls itself the “worldwide leader in cloud banking.” It went public in July at $71 and traded for about $75 in mid-December. Though it has never reported a profit nCino’s market cap of $6.9 billion dwarfs Live Oak’s. Mahan owns more than 2 million shares or more than $150 million.

In 2018 Mahan partnered with Gene Ludwig founder and CEO of Promontory Financial Group (which is now owned by IBM) to found Canapi Ventures. The group raised $545 million from about 35 investors including banks and trade associations and lists seven fintech portfolio investments on its website.

Then there’s Apiture which has signed more than 400 financial institution clients for services to improve digital-banking offerings since Mahan’s team started the business nearly three years ago. The business is led by Chris Babcock another former S1 executive. In July it raised $20 million from investors affiliated with Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates and Nashville-based Pinnacle Bank. Mahan says Apiture has nCino-type potential.

Mahan’s success is having a big impact on Wilmington where the network of companies has become an important economic force. Live Oak’s three-building campus near a man-made lake seems more Silicon Valley than southern. Employees enjoy a 25000-square-foot fitness center fully paid health care with no copays or deductibles and an on-site cafeteria.

Because it profited from issuing Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020 Live Oak paid $10000 bonuses to each of its 600 employees including cafeteria workers. A few senior executives were excluded.

“The people that he hires the way that he invests in them is unique and it has landed them at the top of the list of the best banks to work for” says Peter Gwaltney president and CEO of the N.C. Bankers Association. “Part of their secret sauce is hiring smart people and letting them work in a casual relaxed environment with high expectations and the ability to make a really good living.”

Mahan sees his role as bringing people and money together and pointing them at problems.

Garriott says that he and Mahan talk frequently usually starting with a 5 a.m. exchange of emails but the elder banker almost never tells him what to do.

“He always has the veto since he’s the CEO and chairman” Garriott says. “But he hasn’t exercised it — maybe once in two years. … He’s really let me do my job which is probably hard for someone who actually made every decision for this company for so long.”

Mahan knows that managing senior executives isn’t so much about managing as it is about aiming and aligning.

The first decentralised cryptocurrency surpassed $30823.30 at 1313 GMT according to data compiled by the Bloomberg news agency having broken $20000 on December 16.

Analyst Timo Emden noted that “the appetite for risk” which is reflected in buying of bitcoin “remains unshakeable”.

“More historic highs could follow” the Germany-based analyst added.

Just 12 years old bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise since March when it stood at $5000 spurred by online payments giant PayPal saying it would enable account holders to use cryptocurrency.

After PayPal’s announcement in October analysts at investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase compared the cryptocurrency to gold.

“Bitcoin could compete more intensely with gold as an ‘alternative’ currency over the coming years given that millennials will become over time a more important component of investors’ universe” they said.

A number of central banks have meanwhile responded to the rise of cryptocurrencies and the dwindling global use of cash by announcing plans for bank-backed digital units.

Several central banks including those of China and Sweden — but also the US Federal Reserve — are also testing digital applications in response to Facebook’s recent moves to produce its own digital unit Libra.

Unregulated by any central bank bitcoin emerged as an attractive option for investors with an appetite for the exotic — although criminals have also picked up on its under-the-radar appeal.

Debate has meanwhile raged over the status of the digital asset launched in late 2008 as to whether it should be seen as a form of money an asset or a commodity.

After the unit surpassed $1000 for the first time in 2013 it increasingly began to attract the attention of financial institutions and has experienced wild price swings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyeXB0b3BvbGl0YW4uY29tL2pwLW1vcmdhbi1jaGFzZS1iZWxpZXZlcy1iaXRjb2luLWlzLW92ZXJib3VnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JP Morgan Chase believes Bitcoin is overbought,"TL;DR Breakdown

JP Morgan Chase strategists say Bitcoin is overbought

The bank also says the crypto asset would make gold suffer

JP Morgan Chase strategists in a recent report by Bloomberg has been quoted to be describing Bitcoin as being “overbought.”

According to these bank analysts Bitcoin must continue to have a large scale inflow like it had seen in recent times in order for the coin not to have a price correction.

The strategists also noted that Grayscale who currently hold over $13 billion as assets under management have a monthly inflow of $1 billion. They further added that due to this size of their inflow they wouldn’t be welcoming to any new position that would lead to a sustained negative price.

The JP Morgan Strategists were also of the opinion that interest in the coin by institutional investors is also playing a pivotal role in the rise of the digital asset.

Cointelegraph also reported that institutional investors mostly got their crypto assets over the counter supply that sucks up all available supply.

However despite all of this Bitcoin is said to have been “overbought” around the $24k Mark.

Bitcoin would make Gold suffer – JP Morgan

JP Morgan Chase in a recent Bloomberg post has said that the current rise of crypto assets is coming at the expense of gold.

According to the bank’s quantitative strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou Bitcoin funds have grown massively while there has been a drop in the gold funds. This run can be expected to continue as more institutions would look to continue to invest in cryptocurrency.

The bank’s view is one of the minority who believes that the crypto industry is becoming a viable investment asset class.

Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Against Gold as Haven Battles Rage

Bitcoin price was high on Friday against gold which gives another confirmation that demand for digital assets is on the rise. Gold also posted impressive gains for the year when compared to Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. Bitcoin’s biggest proponents believe the digital currency is eating away at gold’s market cap as investors opt for the efficiency portability and proven scarcity of the asset. Surprisingly that view is also shared by JPMorgan Chase analysts who believe in Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative as a haven.

Nonetheless Bitcoin has risen to a new high of $33210. The Fibonacci tool has indicated a further upward of the coin. On January 2 uptrend; a retraced candle body has tested the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. The retracement indicates that Bitcoin will rise and reach level 2.0 Fibonacci extension or the high $37592.30 high."

First is his Jamaican side. His parents immigrated to America when he was 3 and his life has been full of Caribbean flavor and stories of his home country. But then comes his upbringing which was wholly American — Jarrett was raised in Milton attended University of Massachusetts at Amherst and worked in finance for most of his adult life.

It's when the two sides collide that you get Jarrett and his ""baby"" — a two-year-old hot sauce company called Hillside Harvest.

""The idea is that this product is the combination of my two influences – my Caribbean culture and my Milton experience"" he said. ""The overarching goal will always be to stay true to a multicultural view. We’re either providing a new twist on a Caribbean recipe or bringing a new and unique product to our American customers.""

Jarrett officially launched Hillside Harvest in January of 2019 and takes his mission of combining Caribbean flavors with American influence seriously. The company's logo — a purple mountain range — is symbolic of where he was born near the red hills outside of Kingston and where he was raised near the Blue Hills Reservation in Milton.

Growing up Jarrett said food was always a part of his life. His spent time in a bakery his aunt owned and his parents cooked nothing but Caribbean food at home. But he'd also watch cooking shows and eat American foods at friends' houses.

""I'd share family dishes and recipes with friends and I'd share the recipes my friends' parents made or I saw on TV with my own family"" he said. ""So throughout my life the option or potential of going to cooking school or doing an apprenticeship was always there. It's always been nagging at me.""

It was after years working in product development for the Keurig Dr. Pepper company that he realized he could make the jump to an artisan company of his own. Jarrett said it was hard to leave the job he loved but that he'd always wanted his own space in the food world.

""I enjoy cooking so much"" he said. ""You can really brighten someone’s day or change their perspective. It’s selfish in a way – I'm able to make myself happy by providing things to other people.""

When Jarrett started Hillside he launched the company with two signature hot sauces — Original Hot Pepper and Pineapple Fresno. The original came from more than a year of experimenting and working backwards from Jamaican jerk flavors he said and is made with traditional ingredients like ginger scotch bonnet peppers honey lemon and garlic.

""You get this unique flavor and only people who really love jerk would even be able to get that’s where it came from"" he said. ""It was a hit people loved it. It has that sweetness and the growing heat that is the trademark of a scotch bonnet. People reacted really well to it.""

Pineapple Fresno is a mild sweet sauce that Jarrett calls a ""light entry-level sauce."" Last year Hillside released its third hot sauce a savory option called Sun Kissed Tomato and will soon release its first marinade - a Jamaican jerk.

All of the sauces are made by Jarrett and his volunteer team of family and friends at a commercial kitchen in Boston. At the start Jarrett said they would churn out about 120 bottles per five or six-hour ""shift"" once per month. Now they're in the kitchen twice per month and make 600 or 700 bottles on each go.

The popularity of small batch hot sauces has been on the rise for years and Jarrett knows his company exists in a competitive space. He says it's the underlying flavor not heat for the sake of it that makes his sauces stand out.

""We build our brand on flavor before everything"" he said. ""I'm OK with not being the spiciest hot sauce on the market. I'm OK if someone tells me they eat ghost peppers and my sauce isn’t spicy enough. But I want them to tell me it tastes awesome. If the flavor is right we can add spice. and from there we want to make sure we are blending those Caribbean and American flavors and influences. We’re trying to provide something new.""

Hillside sauces are sold in specialty shops across New England as well as several Whole Foods grocery stores. Jarrett has dreams of his sauces ending up on tables in restaurants in hotels but says artisan shops and specialty stores are the backbone of his businesses.

On the South Shore Hillside Harvest sauces can be found in Whole Foods Market in Weymouth and Hingham Holmstead Harvest in East Bridgewater Holly Hill Farm in Cohasset and Good Health Natural Foods in Quincy and J Shields Fine Wine in Canton. Jarrett is also a regular at a number of South Shore farmers markets.

Each hot sauce costs $9 and a variety pack of all three is available at hillsidesauce.com.

Photo provided by Kwistunlwut Michelle Robinson.

The day before the Klahoose First Nation went into a COVID-related lockdown Kwistunlwut Michelle Robinson and her family went hunting at Toba River off the coast of B.C.

“We arrived at Toba and started setting up. When we went up on the little Toba River all of a sudden this herd of elk just stepped out” Robinson says. “They stepped out into a small clearing right on the river’s edge.”

Robinson says her parents and their six children were the last family to live in Toba Inlet before they were forced to relocate.

The original village for Klahoose whose main community is now on Cortes Island was located at Toba Inlet on the Toba River she explains.

It’s a special place.

“And so my dad moved us further up” Robinson says. “We cleared land we lived off the land. We had to pick out every rock it had to be immaculate. We hunted lived in tents and we had a little shelter we used for cooking under and for processing food.”

Eating off of the land has always been a part of her life and it’s a connection she has passed on to her own children.

It’s a connection that has become increasingly important to her during this year as the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the importance of her family’s traditions and teachings she says.

‘We know the heart of our territory’

When Robinson was growing up she heard stories from her dad who was raised by his grandmother and great grandmother about when they were told they weren’t allowed to fish or hunt “without a license” she says.

“My grandmothers said ‘Why should we have to pay for a license for a place that the Creator gave to us? We’ve been living here since time immemorial since before we can remember for thousands of years and all of a sudden somebody comes and says you’re not allowed to fish and you have to pay us a licensing fee to be able to feed your people.’”

Her great great grandmother Annie Hill was fined and had to row all the way to Vancouver to pay that fine and turn around and row back home Robinson says.

Robinson has had to make similar trips to Vancouver six hours by road as well to defend her community’s right to hunt and fish and to work with Canada’s conservation officers and government officials fighting for the right to do what her family and people have always known how to do.

“They were trying to dictate to us what we could and couldn’t do with our elk like we would go up there and wipe them out or something” she says.

“We understand what our territory lines are. We know we overlap with our sister tribes but we know the heart of our territory. We know there are animals on it and sea life. We never over fished or over hunted because we knew we had to keep providing for future generations.”

It has been a struggle working with outsiders but she says her and the Klahoose First Nation council continue to build their relationship with all levels of government.

When Robinson helped organize a firearms certification program in her community 15 members showed up including her son daughter and son-in-law.

‘It’s a huge honour’

Right before the Klahoose had to go into lockdown after news of the first positive COVID-19 case Robinson and her family were out hunting in their valley.

“We slept got up and hunted again” she says. “We were on a time limit we all had to squeak the hunt in as I had to get back as soon as possible to do my part.”

They had tags for two of the elk one for the community and a second for Robinson’s sister who was Emergency Manager for the COVID-19 cluster response and would be busy organizing the closure.

Robinson’s youngest son would hunt on behalf of his aunt.

“He had a coming of age and he’s had to learn how to hunt. He had to learn how to clean his own deer” she explains. “My kids have always known how to skin and process animals.”

Her oldest son Brion taught Royce who just turned 13 years-old how to respect his gun and how to use it she says. When they found out Royce’s aunt couldn’t go out on the hunt they knew it was “kind of an initiation for him” she says.

“We had only two days to get these two elk.”

And it was all they needed.

“The moment I see those elk step out” says Royce. “I just thought I’d definitely be grateful to have one of those elk and be able to get this animal to provide for my family and my community.”

“Just being in my traditional territory and being able to do all that it’s a gift” he says.

They weren’t just working within their own three-day window of opportunity but they were also well aware of nature’s limitations.

“There’s only so long before a grizzly a cougar or a wolf picks up on that scent because they have a great sense of smell” Royce says. “They could pick up the scent of blood I think around two miles. And a grizzly or even a black bear is a huge animal.”

Robinson’s older son Brion demonstrated how to skin cut and pack up the elk leaving just its spine and guts to compost into the earth. Moving quickly while field dressing is a lot of work Robinson says and hauling out hundreds of pounds of meat even harder.

“It was up on a huge hill 450 yards in and up a slope” she says. “We had to hike in do all the field dressing quarter it and pack it out.”

A hind quarter can weigh around 150 pounds and Royce carried one out on his own.

“It takes lots of work to do all that especially in these clear cuts there’s lots of stumps shrubs and roots that get caught on everything and that just makes it so much more work to get it all over those” Robinson explains.

The family helped in packing the meat out and while they were excited they also stayed focused.

“You’ve got to pay attention to the surroundings because cougars and bears and all the predator animals out there could stalk you super easy and you just got to be ready for that” Royce says. “You got to make sure you know what you’re doing or things can obviously go wrong if you don’t.”

Royce acknowledges the hard work it takes to provide for his community and says he has a deeper understanding beyond just the activity itself.

“It’s a huge honour to put your hands into doing all that stuff. Like one second you see this huge beautiful animal and then being able to take it home and feed your family it’s just a great honor” he says. “I’m glad I have my family to show me how to do all that.”

Land as flesh

Robinson shot her first deer during the same trip to give to her community. They brought home two elk and five deer.

There was good medicine on this trip says Robisnon. Returning to the valley she grew up in to hunt with her own family during this very particular moment in time.

“It was like walking over my own ghost because I’m walking in areas where I grew up. We used to walk those roads as kids and just to be so quiet and feel the ancestors and take steps I hadn’t taken since I was eight” she says.

In later years whenever Robinson missed the land and wanted to go home to Toba her grandmother Rose would tell her to pinch herself.

“Pinch yourself. You ate off the land and that land is now part of your flesh. Take of your own land and make it become the flesh of your child and that land will forever call to your child” Robinson remembers the teaching of her grandmother.

This hunting trip included a visit to the graveyard and to her father who asked for his ashes to be brought home to Toba when he passed 6 years ago.

“I was raised to burn for my ancestors and for the ones that have passed” says Robinson.

“I burned with a thankfulness for the strength that we are able to be alive today for everything they went through good and bad — that they survived that we could survive and that they shared those teachings with us and the ability to hunt.”

It was a powerful moment for Robinson.

“Not everything was robbed from us and know that if you teach with love and you’re able to carry those things forward our youth will do it” she says. “It was really healing just a really powerful moment for my whole family.”

She thanks the ancestors and the Creator and she gives thanks for the teachings that were carried on.

“I knew my ancestors were watching over us and making sure nothing went wrong” says Royce. “Bringing the animal to us and I think they were they were definitely happy too we were burning them a plate of food and that’s when the rainbow went over the cemetery.”

Masks will still be required for a while and senior shopping hours Clorox disinfecting wipe shortages and even social distancing are here to stay.

There are some intriguing supermarket changes to look forward to though says the Supermarket Guru Phil Lempert. For over 25 years he has been an author speaker and analyst on grocery store consumer behavior marketing trends new products and more. We spoke with him and gathered other data to prepare you for what grocery stores will look like in 2021. (And before your next trip check out the 100 Easiest Recipes You Can Make so you can add the ingredients to your list.)

Less delivery options

Grocery delivery saw a huge increase in popularity this year because it is safer than shopping in-store. Chains updated their websites apps and click and collect services (like pickup lockers!). Some grocers even added pickup for the very first time.

Lempert believes this trend is temporary because some people simply prefer picking their own items even if going inside the grocery store is considered to be more dangerous. With that said the various types of grocery delivery options may be reduced.

For more on how to stay safe should you decide to go to your local supermarket here are 10 Grocery Store Safety Tips From a Health Expert.

More robots

Meatpacking plants saw the number of coronavirus cases among workers skyrocket in 2020. Over 10000 Tyson employees tested positive between March and July. Smithfield was fined thousands of dollars for outbreaks at its meatpacking plants and other companies like Hormel Cargill National Beef and more also saw employees get sick. Lempert believes this will pave the way for robots to have larger jobs in these types of facilities. But you may also potentially see more robots working inside your local grocery store.

Reservation slots for shopping times

Expect to approach grocery shopping like going to a restaurant: You'll go to a reservation making website then pick your preferred time to shop. Next Lempert predicts that you'll be asked to select any non-produce grocery store items (""the stove-top stuffing the Heinz ketchup"" Lempert says) that you'll need during your trip so that those can be retrieved bagged and ready for you once you arrive for your reservation. At that point you can peruse the produce aisles then checkout.

All of this of course will be in an effort to reduce crowding and encourage social distancing. (Related: The Worst Grocery Stores of 2020.)

New grocery store sites

Because of the previous prediction Lempert says grocery store websites are going to be significantly more detailed than they are now. ""The data that's on most retailer's websites is horrible and outdated"" he says. ""The ingredients are typically wrong. The nutritional information is wrong. The product gets updated probably about once every nine months. That's not right.""

One way some grocery chains are already using their platforms to help inspire change is by highlighting minority-owned food brands inside their stores.

Less space

Another huge change you can expect? A new layout! ""The size of your grocery store will likely be cut in half Lempert says. ""The back half of the store will be fully robotic and those robots will now be picking the items that you ordered online.""

The front of the store will be all the fresh items you can shop for yourself as well as the baker butcher and produce sales associates whom you can still ask for help. But this way ""You're going to be able to pick all those fresh foods that you want and you're going to have a much better shopping experience"" Lempert says.

Less time in-store

Because of his new prediction about the way we will shop customers will spend a lot less time inside shopping Lempert says. One trip will consist of about 10 minutes picking out fresh produce and deli items grabbing the bags of items from the center of the store that the robots packed up for you and simply checking out.

Before 2020 Lempert thought it would take about three to five years for this change to happen but because of the coronavirus pandemic he says it will only take six or seven months.

In the meantime know that More Grocery Shoppers are Making These Dangerous Mistakes Survey Finds.

More comfort foods

Kroger also released its predictions for what's in store for 2021 and one trend is the continued rise of comfort foods. Things like quick-cook risotto white cheddar macaroni and cheese and even brown butter truffle ice cream will be on shelves for you and your family. This trend dominated 2020 too. But as you shop keep in mind The Shocking Side Effect of Eating Comfort Food.

More fresh and prepared foods

Convenience is key especially during—and after—a pandemic. ""We're buying frozen foods and more convenient offerings"" Lempert says. ""And if you look at the prepared foods offerings in the supermarket—the freshly prepared ones—they're going through the roof because people just want to microwave or put food in the oven.""

That said here are 12 Frozen Dinners to Always Leave on Grocery Store Shelves.

Fewer items to choose from

Some of your favorite companies have downsized this year. Coca-Cola announced it's discontinuing 200 drink brands Kraft-Heinz is cutting 20% of its products and quite a few more are cutting down. Even if products return ever so slightly to normal production the way factories are built now doesn't quite allow for safety measures to be implemented (that Lempert believes are here to stay).

For more here are All of the Beloved Grocery Items That Are Secretly Being Discontinued.

More sustainable products and transparency

For the products that do make it to grocery store shelves in 2021 transparency about their ingredients and where they were grown or made will be important. Lempert says companies want to keep sustainability in mind with their products and that will be reflected because now ""we really don't have a choice"" about whether or not to care about the environment. For more on this prediction here are 20 Ways to Be More Sustainable When It Comes to Food.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

More Immune-supporting foods

Thanks to the influx of safety rules and regulations COVID-19 gave us the experts at Kroger believe foods that help keep us healthy and support the immune and digestive system will see more popularity in 2021. On your next trip to one of the grocery store chain's almost 3000 stores look out for products like almond butter organic sparkling kefir water caffeinated water and even elderberry gummies. (Related: The 7 Healthiest Foods to Eat Right Now.)

More self-driving trucks

Walmart started to test driverless trucks in Arkansas in 2019 and so far those vehicles have driven more than 70000 miles on their own (but with a safety driver inside) the grocery store chain says. Now the initiative is moving to Louisiana.

Lempert believes this trend will expand next year because of the increased importance of sustainability the cost and much more. But it's not just driverless grocery chain trucks you may see out and about: Walmart is also testing drone delivery.

Fewer CBD food products

All the CBD items you saw sprouting up in your local supermarket this year may not have the same luck in 2021 Lempert says. This is because these products aren't regulated so the amount of CBD in them ranges based on the manufacturer. Lempert does believe they will come back though once the government gets involved and forces companies to show the total CBD percentage and other information on labels. (Related: What Happens to Your Body on CBD.)

Cleaner ingredients in alternative meats

The number of meat alternative products that entered the market in 2020 has given shoppers tons of options. But new options will contain a few other things besides just plant-based protein. ""What we're really seeing is flexitarianism will be much more important"" Lempert says. ""It's not about extremes; being all-vegan or an omnivore.""

This means you may see blended meat options featuring both mushrooms and beef or cauliflower and pork. Until then here are 33 Easy Plant-Based Recipes Even Carnivores Will Love.

More items from restaurant chains

""I think we're going to see a lot more restaurant-supermarket partnerships"" Lempert says of grocery stores in 2021. ""Prepackaged foods made fresh from the restaurant and delivered to the supermarket on a daily basis.""

This is a win-win for both—especially as the restaurant industry continues to struggle because of the pandemic.

A bigger emphasis on health

Right now the most super of supermarkets aka Walmart is starting to distribute one of the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines to healthcare workers in New Mexico with plans to supply it at over 5000 stores and pharmacies across the country. The Supermarket Guru says Walmart will continue to promote and grow the health clinics in their stores. (Related: 8 Ways to Shop Safely at Walmart Right Now.)

More indoor and verticle farming

You may not see these in your local grocery store but they may be popping up just down the street thanks to now-empty office buildings that can be converted into indoor farms. ""That's the perfect place to put in vertical farms because you can serve the population closer"" says Lempert. ""Produce also grows three times faster because it's in a controlled environment. Right now most indoor farming is either tomatoes or leafy greens. But that's about to change.""

They mark the Beanz brand’s first ever chilled product and are being made for Heinz by third party manufacturer Nature’s Way Foods.

The NPD was “perfect for consumers that are short on time but still want to enjoy a delicious and high in protein breakfast or lunchtime option” said Heinz Beanz junior brand manager Emily Wright.

The protein pots will roll into fridges in Tesco and Asda from 4 January. Heinz said it hoped they could “drive 70% incremental value across the chilled on-the-go channel”.

“Comprehensive” consumer testing “delivered extremely highly against consumer expectations” it added with 98% of shoppers surveyed by Heinz agreeing it was “a new and different concept compared to other breakfast products currently on the market”.

Heinz plans to extend the range with new flavours in the spring.

The launch will be backed by a social and digital campaign.

It comes as the Beanz brand added £25.9m in extra sales over 2020 growing to £229.2m as shoppers stocked up on canned goods throughout the pandemic.

This month also saw Heinz unveil a slew of launches for Veganuary debuting a new range called Plant Pantry.

The range adds vegan-friendly SKUs to some of its highest-profile lines such as a new range of Texan and Original flavour Beanz Burgers a new Vegan Salad Cream and Seriously Good Vegan Mayo which rolled out a core mayo alongside two flavours: chilli and aioli.",,,,,,,,,

Kroger’s media advertising business teamed up with Meredith one of the largest media publishers in the country to make shoppable advertising and media campaigns more targeted and customized using the retailer’s first-party data. Major retailers are sending a message to the industry: they’re investing heavily in targeted digital shopper marketing

However as grocery ecommerce reaches new heights this year and both CPG brands and retailers race their competition to build out ecommerce capabilities and offerings both will come head to head with the dilemma of limited inventory on online channels.

Thinking about brick-and-mortar there are nearly 40000 grocery stores in the U.S. all of which can offer advertising inventory to eager CPG brands that want to reach consumers in the retailer environment. But thinking about ecommerce sites where consumers can buy groceries well each retailer banner can only have one. So the advertising options slim down significantly.

While a retailer’s website is a no-brainer for a brand to advertise to consumers who are actually motivated to purchase products there are only so many search placements sidebar ads promotions and sales that each retailer can run weekly. Unlike Amazon which has become a one-stop shop for many Americans and pulls in 200 million unique visitors per month grocery retailers like Kroger and Ahold Delhaize draw in fractions of that to their ecommerce sites (even post-COVID-19). Compared to the millions of brands currently on the market ad inventory will quickly become a big problem for grocery retailers brands and third-party media services alike.

Additionally with razor-thin margins on grocery products retailers make the most on CPG brands’ shopper marketing and ecommerce spend. As Americans move online for their everyday purchases retail media on ecommerce channels becomes so much more important now than it ever was before. It’s clear that retailers are beginning to realize the importance of building out their own media capabilities.

But as inventory runs out on their owned platforms the grocery industry is seeing a trend of retail media companies exploring off-platform opportunities. Kroger in particular has been a leader in building these capabilities with partnerships with Meredith expanding Kroger’s own ad inventory and Roku expanding to TV advertising.

Primarily retail media companies are exploring off-platform with data segments for display and social. The expansion to off-platform implies that retailers admit that their own ecommerce sites aren’t enough to handle demand and that it’s essential to find new ad inventory opportunities.

In today’s digital world consumers are omnichannel shoppers and are starting their paths to purchase from nearly infinite channels. For grocery that can mean recipes and social media recipe videos. We’re seeing a major trend of grocers moving to off-platform to commerce-enable these channels where consumers are starting their shopping journeys getting inspiration and actually making that purchase.

Grocery retailers are rapidly expanding media offerings as demand greatly exceeds supply for on-platform inventory and more opportunities than ever before arise to reach consumers when they’re in shopping mode. Significant for shopper marketers off-platform retailer environments will become the standard method to complement on-platform media.

Beyoncé just shared never-before-seen footage of her family on Instagram.

Beyoncé's New Year's Day video includes her twins Rumi and Sir.

The New Year is already off to a great start thanks to Beyoncé. Queen Bey released a surprise drop on Jan 1. And no it wasn't music. She shared never-before-seen footage of her kids including twins Rumi and Sir. There may or may not be footage of Rumi singing ""Savage Remix"" and it may or may not have made my day life.

""Cheers to a New Year Beyhive!! 🎆🎊 2020 divided us and united us. Most could not see loved ones and we felt too many losses but we were united by our humanity"" she captioned the video. ""This year for me has been about celebrating joy chasing happiness and living in love.""

She continued ""As we all look forward and pray for new beginnings my wish for you is that you honor yourself and those you love. Celebrate that you are an important individual who contributes to our beautiful collective. Here’s to a better and brighter 2021! Love B.""

The video is exactly four minutes long because of course it is. Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a huge thing for the number four. See Jay's 4:44 album Blue's name (four letters) and Bey and Jay's birthdays on Sept. 4 and Dec. 4 respectively. Her fans have flocked to the video's Instagram comments to express their gratitude. One user wrote ""Thank you so soo much for what you've done this year to uplift our spirit during these horrible moments in human history. I'm very proud of you!! Wishing you a prosperous life and a wonderful new year honey B!! 💓💓💓🐝🐝."" Another added ""SAVAGE REMIX PERFORMANCE IS COMING.""

OK now that really would be the best way to start 2021!

Posted on: January 2 2021 10:46h.

Last updated on: January 2 2021 03:47h.

Billionaire casino tycoons Sheldon Adelson and James Packer were spotted together during a New Year’s Eve bash in the French Caribbean. And that’s prompted speculation that Packer could be in discussions to sell his more than 36 percent stake in Crown Resorts to the Las Vegas Sands founder and CEO.

The UK’s Daily Telegraph broke the news that Adelson 87 and Packer 53 were celebrating the end of the most difficult year for their gaming businesses. The media outlet says Packer’s $200 million superyacht was docked next to Adelson’s $70 million Queen Miri. Tender boats were seen going back and forth from the yachts.

According to Forbes Adelson and Packer are respectively worth $36.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Adelson’s Sands owns casinos in Las Vegas Singapore and Macau. Packer’s Crown operates in his native Australia as well as Crown London Aspinalls.

Adelson Acquisition?

Packer’s Crown Resorts is amid an investigation in Sydney officials in New South Wales determining if the casino group is suitable to hold a gaming license in the Australian state. Crown Sydney a AUD$2.4 billion (USD$1.8 billion) integrated resort opened last week but with its casino on hold.

The New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) is set to issue its verdict on Crown’s suitability sometime this month. Lawyers assisting in the ILGA Inquiry suggested that Packer isn’t suitable to be a close associate of Crown Resorts.

Though Packer no longer sits on the Crown board nor has any executive role he maintains a 36.8 percent stake in the company. During his ILGA testimony Packer conceded that he would sell his position in the casino group if that would allow Crown Sydney to maintain its gaming license.

Adelson is bullish on casinos located outside the United States. Sands sold the company’s only US casino not in Las Vegas — Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania – in 2018 for $1.3 billion. It’s also been reported that Sands is looking to sell its Las Vegas Strip properties — The Venetian and Palazzo.

Adelson has at least for the moment called off his company’s interest in investing in Japan. Gaming analysts believe the casino tycoon prefers acquisitions more than new construction. A Crown purchase would fall in line with that thinking and give Adelson two casinos in Australia — Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth — and possibly a third with Crown Sydney.

Crown Affair

As it awaits the NSW Inquiry verdict Crown Resorts is doing all it can to help prop up its public image. The company which has been accused of failing to prevent its casinos from being used to launder money recently changed its deposit rules for gamblers.

Crown also announced in November that it would only work with VIP junket groups that are fully licensed in the jurisdiction where its casinos are located. Crown appointed its first financial crimes officer too.

Critics say Crown’s efforts come too late.

“Crown has acted with impunity and arrogance for years” opined Tim Costello a reverend and CEO of World Vision Australia a nonprofit that advocates for the poor. “Now they are desperate to prove that they are a fit and proper organization.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred ninety-one residential units will be produced all to be sold as affordable housing for older citizens. Lennar Corporation is responsible for the development.

Sixteen of the buildings are planned for residential use while one will be a 3350 square foot community building offering amenities and space for social gatherings. Permits also describe open space provided drive-aisles uncovered parking and other site improvements. The senior housing will take up a vacant 8-acre portion of the sprawling Northlake development.

The massive master-development was previously known as the Greenbriar site managed by Integral Communities. But both the project name and developers have changed with Lennar now responsible for much of the construction. Reporting from the Sacramento Business Journal’s Emily Hamann tells that the senior housing is being proposed by Sacramento-based St. Anton Capital in collaboration with the project developers. SFYIMBY is not able to confirm that information at the time of publication.

The area is north of the city center by the Sacramento International Airport. Construction will cost $18.6 million and an estimated completion date has not been announced.

The historic Sherwin warehouse along Horton was the only building persevered when the former Sherwin-Williams paint factory was demolished in 2006. The building once supported the iconic “Cover The Earth” neon sign whose history we spotlighted last year.

The 3-story building consisting of 72000 square feet and is part of a larger 7.9 acre FDP that will include 500 housing units over two acres of park space ground floor commercial space the continuation of the Greenway and the city-funded bike/ped bridge to Bay Street.

DES Architects presented their plans to renovate and modernize the building to attract Life Science startups and office tenants.

The most dramatic update for the building will be the creation of a pass through “Alley” at 45th street allowing bicycle & pedestrian thoroughfare and breaking up the super-block the long structure created. The feature was a concession to neighbors of the 45th Street Artists’ Cooperative giving them more convenient access to the forthcoming park space.

The pass through will also include recessed linear downlighting and illuminated bollards. Renovations will also include street and landscaping improvements accessibility updates and roof screens to obscure the unsightly ventilation and mechanical equipment.

Shortly after the plans were approved a sale of the building was announced between Lennar Multifamily and Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. The deal was facilitated by New York-based Commercial Real Estate broker the The Newmark Group.

“1450 Sherwin represents a rare opportunity for an investor to acquire a fully-entitled large block vacancy with the ideal foundation for life science repositioning in one of the region’s hottest life science markets” Newmark’s Head of Northern California Capital Markets Steven Golubchik stated in a press release.

According to Newmark Walton Street Capital is actively acquiring and seeking acquisition of other Life Science opportunities located within the primary bay area clusters.

Emeryville appears to be in a strong position to build on its place as a hub for the flourishing Life Sciences sector. In addition to this project the city has seen the recent completion of the EmeryStation West tower approved plans for the Public Market’s Parcel B as well as the sale of the nearby Novartis property to BioMed Realty with plans to build another 561K square feet of office space.

When completed these projects will extend the Berkeley-Emeryville Biotech Corridor that already contains more than 150 life science companies.

According to Newmark research the Northern East Bay life sciences “footprint” totals over four million square feet and represents 15% of the total Bay Area market. They collectively boast an availability rate of just 5.6% with a current tenant demand of 630000 square feet.

Below the official video St Francis of Assisi’s poetry is quoted: “How sweet it is to know I’m no longer alone / but part of an immense life / that shines resplendent and generous around me / a gift from Him from His immense love.” An accompanying statement by Bocelli reads: “This sung prayer of Franciscan inspiration is a small masterpiece set to a tune by my dear departed friend Riz Ortolani. “A piece that is intense and moving in its melodic simplicity that speaks to the wonder of creation referencing the Canticle of the Sun created eight centuries ago by the Holy poet of Assisi. “And from Assisi to the notes of Dolce Sentire I hope that this music may be a balm for all your hearts as well as offering the revolutionary force of the Christian message.” READ MORE: Andrea Bocelli interview EXCLUSIVE about 'emotional' concert with daughter

Freddie Mercury died 30 years ago this year and just a few months later Queen members Brian May Roger Taylor and John Deacon put on a charity gig in his honour. The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness featured a whole host of rock stars performing with Queen from George Michael and David Bowie to Elton John and Robert Plant. The filmed version was on Sky Arts over Christmas and May was rewatching the memorable occasion.

May posted clips on Instagram commenting: “I‘m watching our Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert - so strange for so many reasons. “Already so long ago now - we look so young - and all those lovely performers with us…many of them now gone to the place where Freddie went before. “And of course we were only just beginning to get used to the fact that Freddie would no longer be able to do this wonderful thing with us any more. Of course it felt like he was with us on this amazing night.” But there was one particular performance that the 73-year-old said he would take to his grave.

Evans took a leave of absence that began Dec. 1 “to address health issues unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic” according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by the company. She previously took medical leave in September 2019 due to a cancer diagnosis according to Reuters.

Greg Ulmer who leads the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has filled in as head of Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics unit in the interim.

“Throughout her career Michele led some of the most important programs that ensure the security of our nation and its allies and help make our world a safer place” Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said. “She embodied our company’s values in spirit and action every day — to do what’s right respect others and perform with excellence. Her example was an inspiration to those of us fortunate enough to have worked with her closely and her leadership in the aerospace and defense industry will have a lasting impact for years to come.”

Evans spent 34 years working at Lockheed and before her medical issues was seen as a top contender to replace Marillyn Hewson as the company’s chief executive.

Before becoming vice president of the Aeronautics division Evans held multiple executive positions in the company’s Rotary and Mission Systems business area serving as vice president and general manager of integrated warfare systems and sensors as well as vice president for C4ISR (command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance).

Michele A. Evans Lockheed Martin’s executive vice president for aeronautics died Jan. 1 the company announced Jan. 2. Evans went on medical leave Nov. 17 due to an unnamed illness which the company said was a “non-COVID related medical issue.” Gregory M. Ulmer Lockheed F-35 vice president and program manager had been adding Evans’ duties to his own since Dec. 1 and will continue in that capacity until a permanent successor is named.

Evans 54 succeeded Orlando P. Carvalho as VP of aeronautics in 2018 having been his deputy. The Aero business is a $20 billion enterprise with about 25000 employees and includes the C-5 C-130 F-16 F-22 F-35 and U-2 product lines as well as unmanned aerial systems and other intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems. She also oversaw the company’s Skunk Works advanced development company.

On her watch the company successfully transitioned its F-16 production work from Fort Worth Texas to Greenville S.C.; negotiated lower unit costs with the government for the F-35 fighter and oversaw additional F-35 foreign sales. She also presided over Lockheed’s offer of an F-35 performance-based logistics contract with the government—which so far has not been accepted—and led Aero to winning several hypersonics contracts. Evans also built stronger ties with Airbus to offer that company’s Multi-Role Tanker Transport for U.S Air Force service.

Evans had a 34-year career in the aerospace and defense industry. At Lockheed she was VP and general manager of integrated warfare systems and sensors as well as VP for C4ISR and undersea systems businesses and VP for business development in mission systems and training. She had been responsible for Lockheed’s A-10 business and for avionics on the C-130 and F-35 programs and the Littoral Combat Ship. The company said she was the executive manager “on multiple domestic and international campaign wins.” She also served as the Chairman of the Board of a Lockheed-Sikorsky joint venture providing logistics support for maritime H-60 helicopters.

Former Lockheed CEO Marillyn A. Hewson upon Evans’ appointment to the Aero job in 2018 noted Evans’ record of leadership and said her appointment “demonstrates the importance of our talent development and succession planning.”

Evans held a Bachelors of Science in mechanical engineering cum laude from Clarkson University and served on the board of the Smithsonian’s National Air & Space Museum. She was also “actively involved in Lockheed Martin’s diversity and inclusion initiatives serving as the executive sponsor for the Women’s Impact Network and Leadership Forum” the company said in a press release.

It's unclear what sparked the melee but CBSSports.com reports both teams were jawing at each other before kickoff and there were some chippy moments during the game.

True freshman Will Rogers scored his first rushing touchdown of the season and had a 13-yard TD pass to lead Mississippi State past Tulsa 28-26 in a game that was tense from the start.

Minutes after it ended the teams became involved in a large brawl on the field with players punching and kicking one another. Tulsa coach Greg Montgomery said sophomore safety Kendarin Ray who was helped off the field after being at the bottom of a dogpile during a scrum was treated for ""some sort of concussion.""

""I'm not sure what exactly caused that"" said Mississippi State coach Mike Leach who referred to the altercation as a ""mosh pit."" ""It was something before the game too. We've never had any problem with that the entire season so I can only guess without seeing the film.""

In a video posted from Mississippi State's locker room Malik Heath joked about kicking a Tulsa player in the facemask.

""The one thing I'll say is our program our guys we're a team that are going to stand up for each other and we're going to battle"" Montgomery said. ""We talk about faith family football and family's going to take care of family. We're a team that has battled all year long. We battled again today. From that standpoint our guys are going to continue to protect each other and go from there.""

American Athletic Conference Commissioner Mike Aresco said in a statement that the league will work with Tulsa to ""conduct a thorough review of the altercation pursuant to our Conference Code of Sportsmanship process and expect that the university will respond accordingly.""

ESPN reports that Tulsa said in a statement: ""We take this incident very seriously and will respond appropriately after the review is complete.""

Jo'quavious Marks scored a rushing touchdown on the game's first possession and Emmanuel Forbes returned an interception 90 yards for a touchdown for the Bulldogs (4-7) who finished the season with a second straight win in a game played at TCU's Amon G. Carter Stadium in cold rainy conditions.

Mississippi State's 148 passing yards were its fewest of the season. Marks' 72 rushing yards and his 28-yard run for the touchdown were the most in each category this season for the Bulldogs whose 36-yard rushing average going into bowl play was the lowest in the FBS.

Forbes' third-quarter touchdown was initially called back on an illegal blocking penalty but the Big Ten Conference officiating crew reversed its ruling to a penalty on Tulsa.

Deneric Prince and Corey Taylor II scored rushing touchdowns Zach Smith had a 15-yard TD pass to Keylon Stokes and Zack Long kicked field goals of 27 and 33 yards for Tulsa (6-3 No. 24 CFP) which erased four double-digit deficits this season.

Smith was 26 for 46 passing for 347 yards with two interceptions. Tulsa outgained Mississippi State in total offense 484 yards to 271 but the Bulldogs got 138 valuable kickoff return yards from Lideatrick ""Tulu"" Griffin.

Tulsa pulled to within 21-19 with 12:30 left on Taylor's 5-yard run but Smith's two-point conversion pass intended for Stokes was broken up in the end zone. Mississippi State answered with Rogers' 13-yard throw to Griffin to go ahead 28-19.

Smith's 15-yard scoring pass to Stokes came with 1:23 to play and Tulsa failed to recover the ensuing onside kick. On the play Mississippi State's Erroll Thompson leveled Tulsa's Ryan Nixon and was penalized 15 yards for taunting.

""It's just dumb"" Leach said. ""There was some stuff going back and forth during the course of the game. With any of it on our side I don't want to see it because I feel like I got shorted what 15 yards 30 yards on deals where if we could keep our mouth shut you know.""

During the brawl Mississippi State's De'Monte Russell in street clothes beneath his jersey ripped the helmet off Tulsa's TieNeal Martin and appeared to land a punch to Martin's head.

""Coach Leach addressed us as a team after the game and we will handle that in-house"" Kobe Jones said. ""It was emotional and a mishap. We have to be better and more disciplined."""

Stanford Athletics brought in trees provided by Lowe’s to stand in as spectators during Stanford football games this past fall. Courtesy city of Menlo Park.

Several hundred trees that were staged at Stanford University’s football stadium in lieu of live spectators will be planted in local communities in the region.

Since sports fans were not allowed at Stanford Stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic Stanford Athletics partnered with Lowe’s to bring in approximately 470 trees as part of its Tree House program.

The arboreal spectators kept in 15-gallon containers were drought-resistant locally sourced and placed throughout the lower level of the stadium.

The trees were meant to cheer on the university’s football team but the season was ultimately cut short when Santa Clara County banned team sports as COVID-19 cases surged.

Stanford Athletics worked with local city departments and nonprofits to distribute the trees who will replant them in order to “grow urban forest canopy address climate change and create healthier communities that are greener and more resilient” according to Stanford Athletics.

Together the 470 trees sequester over 1000 metric tons of carbon dioxide about the amount produced from driving 2.5 million miles.

Paul Lowe Ceramics Palm Springs

One vacation in Palm Springs and Paul Lowe was hooked. “It can’t get any more exotic you know what I mean?” he says. “Palm trees and the desert and the colors and the cactus — it’s magical.”

So three years ago despite plans to be snowbirds Lowe and his husband moved here and became full-time residents.

Lowe discovered ceramics about five years ago in much the same fortuitous way.

Originally from Oslo Norway the food stylist turned independent magazine publisher had been living in New York for a decade. While developing a story for his magazine Sweet Paul he envisioned a plate with a particular shape that he wanted to use for the photo shoot. But he couldn’t find one. Committed to the idea he signed up for a ceramics course and decided to make it himself. “It was that moment when you’re like ‘Oh my God! I think I’m supposed to do this’” Lowe says. “I absolutely fell in love with it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvZW1pbmVtLWFwcGxlLW11c2ljLXphbmUtbG93ZS1oaXAtaG9wLXJhcC1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLWludGVydmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eminem Deconstruct Hip-Hop Apple Music Interview,"In a recent interview with Apple Music‘s Zane Lowe Eminem breaks down his many years in the music industry taking fans through what started his hip-hop foundation.

Sitting in front of an entire wall of rap cassettes “the real Slim Shady” takes Lowe back to the time when he started collecting these tapes as a child. He reminisces about how difficult it was to purchase these tapes then and thinking to himself “If I ever make it one day as a rapper I’m going to get every tape that I always wanted.” His collection is now larger than ever and Eminem has even met many of the names that appear on his cassette wall. Eminem talks about his encounters with famous rap legends including the first and extremely memorable moment he met LL Cool J and having his own rap lyrics quoted back to him.

Eminem answers the age old question of whether or not the newcomers of the rap genre have lived up to the hype of the legends from decades past. The Detroit MC speaks about bridging the gap between these young rappers and the rap icons and joins the worlds together in his Billboard 200 No. 1 album Music to be Murdered By. Earlier this month fans saw Eminem unite Dr. Dre with Don Toliver and the late Juice WRLD on Side B.

The bulk of the conversation involved Lowe speaking to the MC about which era he felt is most influential in the rap world. Eminem pinpoints the golden age of hip-hop from the ’80s and ’90s to be the best era of the genre noting pioneers such as LL Cool J Public Enemy Run-D.M.C. Beastie Boys and Eric B. & Rakim. He goes on to explain that “I feel like a lot of these kids won’t understand the experience of hip-hop in its infancy stages… Everyone’s going to think their era is the best era but this really was to me… The golden era of hip-hop was the best era to me just because it was so new.” He discusses the longevity of that era reminding Lowe “Here we are what 40 50 years later? It’s crazy. And it’s the biggest music if I’m not mistaken it’s the biggest genre.”

Despite hip-hop’s legendary past Eminem gives credit where credit is due and lists Lil Wayne J.Cole Kendrick Lamar and Joyner Lucas as his favourite MCs in the current era. He notes their work ethic and states “I feel like when you push yourself like that that’s what I feel like inspires greatness.”

Universal’s The Fall Guy the Ryan Gosling starrer inspired by the 1980s TV show kicked off the summer movie season at No. 1 with $28.5 million while Disney’s re-release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace surprised by coming in at No. 2 with $8.1 million.

Despite The Fall Guy’s No. 1 finish its haul came in behind initial expectations of $30 million to $35 million and overall the box office is down dramatically from the same frame a year ago when Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 bowed to $118.4 million domestically. The weekend is down 53 percent from last year and off more than 66 percent from 2022 when Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness opened to $187.4 million domestically.

The Fall Guy is said to have a net budget of $130 million after tax incentives for shooting in Australia. Universal will now hope that Fall Guy’s A- CinemaScore from audiences will help it make up ground in the coming weeks with word of mouth. It also boasts strong reviews out of South by Southwest.

The feature hails from stuntman-turned director David Leitch and has been marketed as a love letter to the stunt community. Gosling at the height of his star power thanks to his Oscar-nominated turn as Ken in Barbie fronts the picture as a beaten down stuntman who comes out of retirement to try to find a missing A-list star and save a film (which happens to be directed by his ex played by Emily Blunt). The feature has a global cume of $65.4 globally.

Phantom Menace‘s weekend is a nice turn of events for the film. It kicked off George Lucas’ Star Wars prequel trilogy in 1999 and for years after was a punchline for audiences and Star Wars fans but has grown in appreciation in the decades since with younger fans who grew up on the film coming into adulthood and star Ewan McGregor reprising his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his own Disney+ series in 2022 helping further build nostalgia for the film. It returned to theaters as part of the film’s 25th anniversary as well as for May the 4th the unofficial Star Wars holiday.

The Phantom Menace edged out Amazon MGM Studios’ sexy tennis drama Challengers for No. 2. The Luca Guadagnino feature had a solid hold in weekend two dropping just 49 percent for a weekend gross of $7.6 million and a cume of $29.4 million. Zendaya Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist star.

Sony and Screen Gem’s Tarot bowed in its first weekend to $6.5 million a solid start considering the feature cost $8 million and did not have a traditional marketing campaign. Sony embarked on its first digital-only campaign for Tarot meaning no TV spots or billboards for the feature which seven friends who accidentally unleash an evil entity trapped in a deck of cursed Tarot cards. Neither critics nor audiences embraced this one. It has an 8 percent on Rotten Tomatoes while audiences gave it a low C- CinemaScore. It ends the weekend with a global haul of $10.2 million to date.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

The Universal Pictures release opened on a weekend that Marvel has regularly dominated with $100 million-plus launches. (In 2023 that was “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” with a $118 million debut. ) But last year’s strikes jumbled this year’s movie calendar; “Deadpool & Wolverine” originally slated to open this weekend is instead debuting in July.

So in place of a superhero kickoff the summer launch went to a movie about the stunt performers who anonymously sacrifice their bodies for the kind of action sequences blockbusters are built on. Going into the weekend forecasts had the film opening $30 million to $40 million.

“The Fall Guy” directed by former stuntman and “Deadpool 2” helmer David Leitch rode into the weekend with the momentum of glowing reviews and the buzz of a SXSW premiere. But it will need sustained interest to merit its $130 million production budget. It added $25.4 million in overseas markets.

Working in its favor for a long run: strong audience scores (an “A-” CinemaScore) and good reviews (83% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). Jim Orr distribution chief for Universal believes things line up well for “The Fall Guy” in the coming weeks.

“We had a very solid opening” said Orr. “We’re looking forward to a very long very robust very successful run throughout the domestic box office for literally weeks if not months to come.”

But the modest start for “The Fall Guy” hints at larger concerns for the film industry. Superhero films haven’t been quite the box-office behemoth they once were leading studios to search for fresher alternative. “The Fall Guy” seemed to check all the boxes with extravagant action sequences one of the hottest stars in the business a director with a track-record for crowd pleasers and very good reviews.

But instead the opening for “The Fall Guy” loosely based on the 1980s TV series only emphasized that the movie business is likely to struggle to rekindle the fervor of last year’s “Barbenheimer” summer. “The Fall Guy” stars one from each: Gosling in his first post-Ken role and Emily Blunt of “Oppenheimer.” Both were Oscar nominated.

“It’s going to be a very interesting nontraditional summer this year” said Paul Dergarabedian senior media analyst for Comscore.

In part due to the effects of last year’s work stoppages there are fewer big movies hitting theaters. Expectations are that the total summer box office will be closer to $3 billion than the $4 billion that’s historically been generated.

“The summer season is just getting started so let’s give ‘The Fall Guy’ a chance to build that momentum over time. It’s a different type of summer kickoff film” said Dergarabedian. “There’s always huge expectations placed on any film that kicks off the summer movie season but this isn’t your typical summer movie season.”

In a surprise No. 2 at the box office went to the Walt Disney Co. rerelease of “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.” The first episode to George Lucas’ little-loved prequels collected $8.1 million over the weekend 25 years after “Phantom Menace” grossed $1 billion.

Last week’s top film the Zendaya tennis drama “Challengers” slid to third place with $7.6 million in its second week. That was a sold hold for the Amazon MGM release directed by Luca Guadagnino dipping 49% from its first weekend.

The Sony Screen Gems supernatural horror film “Tarot” also opened nationwide. It debuted with $6.5 million a decent enough start for a low-budget release but another example of horror not quite performing this year as it has the last few years.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

1. “The Fall Guy” $28.5 million.

2. “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace” $8.1 million.

3. “Challengers” $7.6 million.

4. “Tarot” $6.5 million.

5. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” $4.5 million.

6. “Civil War” $3.6 million.

7. “Unsung Hero” $3 million.

8. “Kung Fu Panda 4” $2.4 million.

9. “Abigail” $2.3 million.

10. “Ghostbuster: Frozen Empire” $1.8 million."

By Megan Gates 1 January 2021 Print issue: January 2021

It was a deal that made Marriott International the owner of the largest hotel chain in the world. In 2015 the company announced that it would buy Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. for $12.2 billion—combining the two companies’ 5500 hotels with 1.1 million rooms worldwide.

But unbeknownst to Marriott the deal would open up a massive area of liability just a few years down the road when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would fine Marriott for a breach of Starwood’s guest reservation database—which exposed the personal information of up to 500 million people.

“The hotel chain says the breach began in 2014 and anyone who made a reservation at a Starwood property on or before September 10 2018 could be affected” according to the FTC’s announcement.

Marriot later clarified in an update in 2019 that approximately 383 million guest records were compromised in the breach—including 20.3 million encrypted passport numbers and 5.25 million unencrypted passport numbers.

Along with the fine from the FTC the hotel owner was also fined more than £99 million ($130 million) by the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office for the breach; the commissioner’s office has since reduced the fine to £18.4 million ($25 million) because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally Marriott has faced a slew of legal complaints related to its handling of the breach. One of the largest is a class action lawsuit brought by two members of Starwood’s—and now Marriott’s—customer loyalty program on behalf of all victims of the breach.

“It is particularly egregious that Marriott did not discover this serious data breach during the course of its due diligence efforts in conjunction with its 2016 Starwood acquisition” said Amy Keller partner at DiCello Levitt and co-lead counsel on the suit. “Marriott seems to forget that part of being in the customer service business includes actually taking care of its customers. Through this lawsuit we intend to ensure that it never forgets that again.”

And while those efforts are focused on ensuring that Marriott learns from previous mistakes recent findings from a Deloitte survey suggest that organizations are taking cybersecurity more seriously during the merger and acquisition (M&A) process—especially when those deals are being made virtually.

In the Future of M&A Trends Survey of 1000 U.S. corporate merger and acquisition executives and private equity firm professionals Deloitte found that deal activity in the United States plunged after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. But in April 2020 the situation changed with 60 percent of respondents saying their organizations were more focused on pursuing new deals. Six in 10 survey respondents also said they expected U.S. merger and acquisition activity to return to pre-COVID-19 levels within the next 12 months.

“When it comes to cyber in an M&A world—it’s important to develop cyber threat profiles of prospective targets and portfolio companies to determine the risks” said Deborah Golden cyber and strategic risk leader Deloitte. “CISOs understand how a data breach can negatively impact the valuation and the underlying deal structure itself. Leaving cyber out of that risk picture may lead to not only brand and reputational risk but also significant and unaccounted remediation costs.”

In practice this means that organizations are increasingly giving CISOs a seat at the table and making them part of the due diligence process says Jaime Fox partner and principal at Deloitte Cyber Risk Services. Fox leads Deloitte’s work on cyber due diligence in strategic acquisitions.

Previously security representatives were only brought into the deal-making process during the closing aspects so they could focus on integrating the organizations involved she says. Taking that approach however means that organizations might not discover a cyber risk—like the Starwood data breach—before finalizing the deal opening themselves up to potential liability higher remediation costs and more consequences down the line.

Initially organizations began to transition their approach to cyber due diligence by doing a high-level cybersecurity assessment. This included aspects like looking at a broad threat landscape and overall network security Fox explains. Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020 clients were requesting that cyber be more fully addressed in due diligence.

“Now in a COVID world we’re seeing deeper dives into what clients are looking at” she adds. “We see acquirers doing things in terms of threat intelligence and research on the Dark Web to gain a greater understanding around things like leaked user credentials for sale. It’s very encouraging to see…and helps the CISO frame the mind-set: ‘This is the house I’m about to buy. These are the things I’ve uncovered. This is what my remediation costs are going to be.’”

These deep dives include creating a cyber playbook that defines the areas the parties want to cover in their due diligence process including threat intelligence Dark Web research cyber reconnaissance and assessments of network flows to identify potentially suspicious traffic. Some also choose to engage in penetration testing.

“Oftentimes the target will approve doing something like that—sometimes they won’t” Fox says. “It’s very encouraging to see clients and acquirers push to get this type of information. It really helps to home in on their top 10 questions—after they’ve gathered this intelligence they can go to the target and gain a better understanding of what they’ve found.”

This was on display for instance when Verizon reduced its offer to acquire Yahoo! by $350 million after Yahoo! disclosed two major breaches. And the portion of Yahoo! that was not part of the Verizon deal agreed to assume 50 percent of the liability related to any future lawsuits stemming from the breaches according to analysis from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) When Cyber Threatens M&A.

“This isn’t an issue for only tech companies. Cyber threats have spread to industries that weren’t targeted earlier in the digital age; restaurant chains for example can be attacked for the customer information—either credit card numbers or information from their loyalty programs” PwC said. “Furthermore the goal of a cyberattack can be more than a simple data grab. Consider a pharmaceutical company’s formula for a drug a manufacturer’s product design or a distribution company’s transportation model. All of that is intellectual property that can be a crucial part of a deal’s value.”

These threats raise the risks for acquirers looking to make a deal—and make their potential acquisitions a more lucrative target during the integration process—but do not tend to push them away from the table.

“While cyber threats are more prevalent it’s still rare for a breach or other issue to harm a transaction to the point that an acquirer completely walks away; delaying the transaction is a more common result” according to PwC. “Yet delays added costs and questions about a target’s value all have consequences for the deal process. To avoid such damage acquirers need to understand the cyber risks of the target so they can limit surprises model appropriately and ensure a reasonable transaction.”

This is key Fox adds because discovering this information sooner in the process will allow acquirers to negotiate better terms.

“Right off the bat we tell our clients that going through this process sooner is only going to help you in the end” she says. “Understanding the impact of security breaches controls around customer data and arming them with information around how it’s important to understand the entity you’re about to buy…when you present it from a risk perspective you show that these are things we should be able to quantify.”

Mastercard is best known to consumers as the symbol on their credit and debit cards and for processing card transactions globally. But it's spent the past few decades working on becoming much more than a card-payment processor.

To that end it's just joined its engineering and product teams under the leadership of a new chief product officer Craig Vosburg. He'll oversee thousands of employees who work on user-focused design and will be tasked with driving growth in new areas for Mastercard including non-card payments open banking initiatives and Mastercard Labs the company's R&D arm.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""If you think about the company from its earliest beginnings more than 50 years ago we appeared on the scene as effectively a card company that was enabling consumer credit transactions"" Vosburg told Insider.

But the company has added new use cases including business and commercial payments. And it's also expanded the payment types it supports to include real-time payments peer-to-peer and blockchain-enabled transactions.

On top of these various payments ""rails"" Mastercard has added things like data-sharing services and fraud monitoring leveraging the wealth of data it already has from its business and consumer end users.

""We've evolved who we think of as our customer to be not just the bank and their consumer but merchants governments digital players fintechs and companies large and small"" Vosburg said.

It's all a part of Mastercard's strategy to be involved in any and every payment flow globally which has meant a full evolution of its bread-and-butter business. Rival processor Visa too is vocal about its ambitions beyond cards looking to become what it calls a ""network of networks.""

Mastercard's goals in combining engineering and product are twofold. One is to get closer to its customers and understand where it should invest in its platform. The second is to help Mastercard meet evolving customer needs more nimbly and more efficiently Vosburg said.

""The closer we bring the technology and the product capabilities to the market and to our partners and customers the more effectively we think we'll be able to serve them with the kinds of speed and adaptability that the market today requires"" Vosburg said.

Vosburg formerly head of North America at Mastercard is CPO effective January. He'll be succeeded by Linda Kirkpatrick a long-time exec at Mastercard who currently oversees Mastercard's US issuer business.

Vosburg is laser-focused on uniting Mastercard's entire payments stack

In a year where consumers and merchants by necessity moved online the long-standing trend toward digital payments and cash displacement accelerated. Shifts that experts expected to happen over the next several years have happened in a matter of months. And keeping up with the growth in new digital payments has informed much of Mastercard and other payments players' product strategies.

""The events of 2020 have served to both validate the path we were on as far as our strategic priorities and accelerate the need for us to execute against that path"" Vosburg said.

As consumers increasingly pay using more than just cards and cash players like Mastercard have no choice but to build out their processing capabilities to support things like account-to-account payments and buy now pay later transactions.

To be sure many consumer use cases still default to card-based payments which includes contactless options like digital wallets. But Mastercard sees a big opportunity to use its non-card payment capabilities to grow its business customer base especially when it comes to companies paying each other quickly and keeping tabs on their accounts.

""A lot of the early opportunities that we're targeting with those capabilities focus on the B2B space which is one we're particularly excited about"" Vosburg said. ""Non-card rails we think bring a lot of value to B2B payments particularly accounts payables for corporates.""

For businesses speed and accuracy of money movement through automation is crucial to keeping costs low. To that end Mastercard is building out more tools for businesses in addition to processing payments.

""These are all things where real-time payments fast ACH blockchain and account-to-account can all play a role"" Vosburg said. ""That's an area that we're targeting for development of applications to go after those use cases.""

And Vosburg envisions growth in this area over a period of decades.

""It'll be a decades-long journey as the consumer cards journey has been a decades-long one starting more than 50 years ago"" Vosburg said.

With its Finicity deal closed data is now a big focus for Mastercard

As consumers' financial lives are increasingly fragmented across various banks and apps financial data has become top-of-mind for all players. Fintechs need access to financial data which is usually stored in banks. Sitting between fintechs and banks are data aggregators like Finicity Plaid and Yodlee which provide the data pipes.

With the proliferation of digital finance open banking and open finance have become top-of-mind for all players in the market Mastercard included. Open banking refers to access to bank data like account numbers and balances. Open finance is broader including more pieces of consumers' financial lives such as payroll insurance credit cards and investments.

In November Mastercard closed its $825 million acquisition Finicity. Visa announced plans to acquire Plaid in January but the deal has since been halted by the DOJ which says Visa's deal was an attempt to squash a competitor.

""I see open banking as something that is certainly taking on greater importance"" Vosburg said.

In Europe it's largely been regulators driving open banking standards whereas in the US data sharing standards are being set more so in the private sector.

""Interestingly because I think it's been driven by market dynamics you see a variation in approaches"" Vosburg said. ""It's early stage. It's a very competitive and dynamic field.""

Currently aggregators like Plaid and Yodlee are standing up separate data-sharing agreements with the country's largest banks and the terms of each agreement vary. Then there's Akoya a newer aggregator in the space backed by the banks themselves that's looking to offer a single data connection across the banks it signs on to its platform. US Bank was the first to sign on to Akoya's platform in November.

Industry-wide groups like FDX for example are setting technical standards for data management via APIs. The CFPB announced plans to issue rules on data sharing agreements requesting input from all players in the industry through the beginning of next year.

Now with Finicity Mastercard will have a larger part to play in those discussions.

""We see great promise and value for Mastercard in playing a role in that space in part because it's a space that would benefit from having a trusted intermediary in helping to facilitate flows of data in the right way"" Vosburg said.

Fintechs also need partnerships with processors like Mastercard if they want to offer card products. And Mastercard has doubled down on its fintech outreach creating a new team earlier this year to manage the relationships with up-and-coming digital players. In 2020 Mastercard won over fintechs like Brex Dave and SoFi from Visa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3MvdGVjaC9leHBsYWluZWQteW91ci1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1ub3ctYmVjb21lcy1ldmVuLW1vcmUtcG93ZXJmdWwtZm9yLWNvbnRhY3RsZXNzLXBheW1lbnRzLTMyMjkzNjEuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3RlY2gvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXlvdXItY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtbm93LWJlY29tZXMtZXZlbi1tb3JlLXBvd2VyZnVsLWZvci1jb250YWN0bGVzcy1wYXltZW50cy0zMjI5MzYxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: Your Credit Card Now Becomes Even More Powerful For Contactless Payments,"Starting 1 January 2021 your credit card can be used for contactless tap and pay transactions for an even higher amount than before. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies released on December 2020 further relaxed the requirement of additional authentication requirement for credit card transactions. Users now utilize the contactless payment method and not have to enter a transaction PIN for transactions up to Rs 5000 at physical stores. Earlier the limit for non-PIN required contactless transactions was Rs 2000. At this time cards issued by all banks in India offer the contactless payments feature and this is applicable for all types of credit cards including Mastercard Visa and American Express credit cards.

What you need to look for is the contactless network symbol on your card something very similar to the Wi-Fi icon in the notification bar on your smartphone. If you see that anywhere on the front of your credit card that means it is enabled for contactless payments at physical retail outlets and stores. If you don’t chances are your credit card is very old and you can contact the issuing bank for a new one. In addition to your credit card the payment terminal at the store you are making the payment needs to be enabled for contactless transactions. Chances are most shops and stores now have that functionality integrated in their payment machines. At least the bigger stores do and expect this functionality to be available at even more stores in the coming months. This contactless payment technology works on Radio Frequency or RF and the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. This is very similar to the RFID tags but are more secure because the financial transaction and the information needs to be secure. There are microprocessors doing cryptographic processing to scramble and protect your credit card details as well as the transactions specifics.

For the contactless credit card transactions to happen the card and the payment terminal or machine need to be less than 4 centimeters apart from each other. That negates any chances of ghost transactions happening in case you are standing a short distance away from a payment terminal. Also a payment amount for a transaction needs to be entered into the machine by the vendor and the transaction as well as the unique transaction code needs to be authenticated by your contactless credit card with the embedded unique chip. The biggest advantage is—you do not need to enter a transaction pin in this case and that negates the need to hand the card to a human at a payment counter in a store or touch the payment machine to punch in a four-or six-digit transaction code for your credit card to complete the purchase. And neither do you have to dip your hands in potentially germ laden cash notes. Simply tap the card on the payment terminal when the system is ready to complete the billing and you are done.

“These are also well-suited to make payments in a safe and secure manner especially during the current pandemic. The recent instructions on disablement of contactless feature on cards and empowering customers to control the limits on their cards have also brought in added safety for users” says RBI. This rule will be applicable from January 1 2020. It comes as part of the Reserve Bank of India (Digital Payment Security Controls) Directions 2020 for regulated entities to set up a robust governance structure for such systems and implement common minimum standards of security controls for channels like internet banking mobile banking card payments among others.

You do need to be careful about how you make the transaction with contactless payments. If you have more than one credit card with contactless payments option in your wallet it is recommended you don’t touch the wallet on the payment terminal or machine—instead take the specific card that you want to use out of the wallet and make the contactless payment. Banks also insist that you cannot be charged twice for the same transaction even of you tap the card on the payment terminal twice by mistake. For payments above Rs 5000 at physical stores you will still have to use the chip authentication plus punching in the transaction PIN for your credit card to complete the payment.

Andrea Babbs  UK general manager of VIPRE SafeSend believes it is time for them to step up their security infrastructure.

With over 20 years of experience in the IT industry she has worked for security vendors and resellers dealing with email endpoint and web security watching the threat landscape change from simple viruses and spam to the sophisticated polymorphic threats of today.

With humans the last line of defence education and effective tools are needed to help them prevent making small mistakes with big consequences. In this article Andrea explains why financial organisations are a prime target for cyberattacks and ransomware threats and what they can do going forward to mitigate the risks.

The financial services industry deals with highly sensitive information including monetary transactions personal information and financial data all of which are the Holy Grail for cybercriminals. The consequences of this information falling into the wrong hands could mean the loss of significant sums of money including financial penalties costs for audits to understand why the incident happened and what additional protocols need to be implemented going forward.

Accenture’s 2019 Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime report found that financial services incurred the highest cybercrime costs of all industries. Additionally the fallout from data breaches goes far beyond financial costs. Financial services businesses have reputations to uphold in order to maintain a loyal customer base. If they fail to protect their customers’ sensitive information they will have to manage the negative press and mistrust from existing and potential customers.

In such a highly competitive market it doesn’t take much for customers to take their money elsewhere. While examples of external threats make the headlines such as the Capital One cyber incident unintentional breaches don’t always gain as much attention.

The Importance of Email and Unintentional Breaches

Despite this human errors including misdeliveries via email are almost twice as likely to result in confirmed data disclosure. One of the biggest threats to an organisation’s security infrastructure is over-reliance on email. With remote working becoming the norm for many businesses in 2020 it is arguably more important than ever as a communication tool.

Humans are only ever a click away from sending an email with the wrong attachment or to the wrong contact. But this can be more than just an embarrassing mistake – the ramifications could in fact be catastrophic.

Cyber attacks especially against banks and those working in finance have increased dramatically since the start of the coronavirus pandemic with a 238% surge in financially-motivated attacks according to the third edition of VMware’s Modern Bank Heists report. Many of these attacks are COVID-related in nature linking to accessing loans to help businesses or fake government emails as highlighted by UK Finance. In turn 96% of UK executives said they will shift their cybersecurity strategy due to COVID-19 according to a recent study by PwC.

2020 may have been the catalyst for businesses to improve their understanding of cyber threats and the vulnerabilities they exploit as they plan for the new normal but how can they do this successfully?

Within the financial services sector the stakes are high so an effective layered cybersecurity strategy is essential to reduce risk and keep sensitive information secure. Security protocols are designed to prevent most instances of unauthorised interception and email spoofing. Adding a dedicated email-to-email encryption service to your email security arsenal also increases your protection in this area.

Data Loss Prevention Solutions

Financial organisations can deploy innovative technology solutions to educate their workforce in real-time. This includes Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions which enable the firm to implement security measures for the detection control and prevention of risky email sending behaviours. Rather than impeding the working practices of users these tools instead give the employee a critical second chance to double-check their email is going to the right person.

It is this double-check that can be the critical factor in an organisation’s cybersecurity efforts.

Security guidelines and rules regarding the circulation and storage of sensitive financial information are essential as well as clear steps to follow when a security incident happens.

Training the Workforce

Cybersecurity awareness training should be implemented as soon as an employee joins a company and should be an ongoing programme with quarterly or monthly short informative sessions. This training should also incorporate phishing simulations and attacks to demonstrate to users how these incidents can appear and educate them on how to spot and flag them accordingly.

This reinforcement of security messaging working in tandem with simulated phishing attacks ensures that everyone is capable of spotting a phishing scam and knows how to handle sensitive information.

Moving forward cybersecurity should be at the forefront of all businesses’ agendas. The increasing sophistication of cybercriminals coupled with the rapid shift of digital technologies brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the importance of a strong security infrastructure.

As a prime target for cybercriminals financial service organisations must prioritise their cybersecurity. This includes regularly assessing risks deploying innovative human-led solutions and educating workforces to provide the best defence possible. With a layered security strategy in place and a proactive approach to their cyber defences the risks can be minimised.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZW4udmlldG5hbXBsdXMudm4vYmFua3MtdG8tc3RvcC1pc3N1aW5nLW1hZ25ldGljLXN0cmlwLWNhcmRzLWluLXRocmVlLW1vbnRocy1wb3N0MTk0MTUxLnZucNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks to stop issuing magnetic strip cards in three months,"Illustrative photo. (Source: VNA)



Vietnamese banks will only be allowed to issue chip cards from March 31 2021 according to a State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) draft circular.Currently local banks issue both chip and magnetic strip cards.The draft regulation aims to help meet the country’s approved roadmap of replacing all current magnetic strip cards with chip cards by December 31 2021. The chip cards are compatible with EMV standards as well as the standards of international card organisations such as Visa MasterCard JCB and UnionPay.International card-issuing organisations have asked Vietnamese banks to switch to chip cards that meet EMV standards to increase safety amidst a growing number of information thefts. Security experts have also warned Vietnam’s delayed transition to chip technology could put the country at risk of becoming a haven for card criminals from around the world as it is among the dwindling number of countries where magnetic swipe cards are still prevalent.Commercial banks are in the process of switching over to the new cards because of their stronger security features. However some banks say the switch faces multiple barriers. They will have to upgrade their technology and replace ATMs and POS terminals with newer ones compatible with chip cards.Another major challenge is that many users have been reluctant to have their cards replaced by chip-based ones though many notices have been issued by the bank regarding this issue.As of the end of the third quarter of 2020 Vietnam had about 93.78 million bank cards in circulation with the majority magnetic strip cards with weak security features and easily hacked.According to the SBV’s roadmap 100 percent of bank cards will be chip-based and 100 percent of ATMs and POS terminals will be altered to accept chip cards by the end of 2021.Besides ensuring greater payment security the replacement is also among the central bank’s plans to promote non-cash payment methods. Under the Government’s strategy by the end of 2025 at least 80 percent of adults in Vietnam are hoped to have bank accounts and the number of non-cash transactions will expand by 20-25 percent annually./."

• Hungary's three-match unbeaten run away to Germany was ended on their last visit five years ago although there is a considerable difference in EURO pedigree between the teams. While nine of Germany's 12 previous appearances have extended into the knockout rounds Hungary's achievement in reaching the last 16 at UEFA EURO 2016 was their most successful campaign in the competition for 44 years.

• Both sides come into this match in buoyant mood Hungary having held on for a 1-1 draw against world champions France while Germany beat holders Portugal 4-2. Each side had lost their opening game three late Portugal goals condemning Hungary to a 3-0 loss in Budapest while a Mats Hummels own goal gave France a 1-0 victory in Munich.

• Germany will go through if they avoid defeat. They will finish first if they win and France do not beat Portugal. Germany will finish third if they draw and France lose or if both Germany and Portugal lose.



• Hungary will go through if they win. If they win and France lose second place will be decided on overall goal difference. Hungary will finish third if they win and the other game is drawn.

Previous meetings

• The most recent of the sides' meetings came in June 2016 an Ádám Lang own goal and Thomas Müller's strike giving Germany a 2-0 friendly victory in Gelsenkirchen.

• That made it three wins in their last four matches against Hungary for Germany who went down 2-0 at home to the Hungarians in a Kaiserslautern friendly in June 2004.

• Before a 5-2 friendly victory in Budapest in August 2001 Germany/West Germany were without a win in five matches against Hungary (D4 L1).

• This is the teams' first competitive meeting since the 1954 World Cup final won 3-2 by West Germany in Berne with Helmut Rahn scoring twice including the decisive goal in the 84th minute as his side came back from two goals down to claim their first world title.

• Hungary had beaten West Germany 8-3 earlier in the same tournament Sándor Kocsis scoring four times in what is the only other competitive fixture between the sides.

• Germany have won 13 of their 34 matches against Hungary with seven of their ten defeats coming in the first 14 games between the countries.

• This is only the sides' second match in Munich; the first a friendly in December 1911 ended in a 4-1 Hungary victory.

EURO facts: Germany

• The Mannschaft are participating in their 13th successive EURO since missing out on the final tournament as West Germany in 1968 their first attempt.

• EURO winners in 1972 1980 and 1996 – and three-time runners-up – Germany last missed out on the semi-finals in 2004 when as in 2000 they did not make it through the group stage. With three European titles they are the competition's joint record winners alongside Spain.

Watch great Germany goals

• Germany were again semi-finalists at UEFA EURO 2016 losing 2-0 to hosts France in the last four. The then-world champions had finished first in their section before beating Slovakia (3-0) and Italy (1-1 6-5 pens) in the knockout rounds.

• Joachim Löw's side won seven of their eight qualifiers (L1) to book their place at UEFA EURO 2020. Having suffered their sole defeat 4-2 at home to the Netherlands on 6 September 2019 Germany scored 15 goals in winning their last four matches.

• This is Germany's 26th successive appearance in a World Cup or EURO final tournament.

• The Matchday 1 defeat by France was Germany's first game in Munich since a goalless UEFA Nations League draw against the same opponents in September 2018; their overall record in the city after beating Portugal is W14 D5 L8. They have now won five of their nine matches at the Football Arena Munich (D1 L3) although their joint heaviest UEFA European Championship loss came at the stadium a 3-0 reverse against the Czech Republic in UEFA EURO 2008 qualifying.

Germany's three EURO wins

• Germany won both games at the Football Arena Munich at the 2006 World Cup beating Costa Rica 4-2 in the group stage and Sweden 2-0 in the round of 16. They also lifted the World Cup in the city in 1974 after a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in the final; it was the hosts' only fixture in Munich during that tournament.

EURO facts: Hungary

• This is Hungary's second consecutive EURO finals. Their 2016 appearance was their first since 1972 and their first major tournament since the 1986 World Cup. Only four countries competed at the first two EURO final rounds the Magyars reached – in 1964 and 1972.

• In 2016 a team coached by Bernd Storck finished first in Group F on five points level with Iceland but above them on head-to-head record and two points ahead of eventual champions Portugal with eliminated Austria on one point. Hungary opened with a 2-0 win against Austria in Bordeaux Ádám Szalai opening the scoring before draws against Iceland (1-1) and Portugal (3-3).

EURO 2016 highlights: Hungary 3-3 Portugal

• Belgium proved too strong in the round of 16 however running out 4-0 winners in Toulouse – although three of those goals came in the final 12 minutes.

• Hungary have now won two of their ten games at EURO final tournaments (D3 L5).

• Hungary were fourth in their UEFA EURO 2020 qualifying group picking up 12 points from their eight games to finish behind Croatia Wales and Slovakia – who are all also in the final tournament.

• Marco Rossi's side qualified for the play-offs having finished second in their group in the 2018/19 UEFA Nations League picking up ten points to end two behind Finland and one ahead of Greece.

• The Hungarians then won 3-1 in Bulgaria in their play-off semi-final but looked to be heading out as they trailed to Iceland in their final in Budapest only for late goals from Loïc Négo (88) and Dominik Szoboszlai (90+2) to snatch a dramatic 2-1 victory and a place in the final tournament.

Highlights: Hungary 2-1 Iceland

• The Matchday 1 defeat by Portugal is Hungary's only competitiive defeat in 11 matches (W6 D4) since a 3-2 loss at home to Russia in the UEFA Nations League on 6 September 2020.

• Hungary got to the final of the 1938 and 1954 World Cups losing to Italy (in France) and West Germany (in Switzerland) respectively.

• Hungary have played only four previous matches in Munich. Aside from their 1911 win against Germany at the 1972 Olympic Games they faced Brazil (2-2) hosts West Germany (4-1) and in the final Poland (1-2) at the Olympiastadion. Those were all classed as full internationals.

• Hungary's record in Germany overall is W10 D8 L11. At the 1972 Olympics they beat Iran 5-0 in Nuremberg Denmark in Augsburg East Germany in Passau and Mexico in Regensburg (all 2-0) aside from their three games in Munich.

Germany

• After going two EURO finals matches without scoring – both against France – Germany struck four goals in a group game at the tournament for the first time as Joachim Löw's side came from behind to beat Fernando Santos's Portugal 4-2 in Munich on Matchday 2. They had also won by that scoreline in the quarter-finals of UEFA EURO 2012 against a Greece side led by the same coach.

• The defeat by France on Matchday 1 was Germany's third in four tournament matches having lost two of their three games at the 2018 World Cup – both of those also without scoring. It was the second successive major finals in which Germany had lost their opening match and the first time they had done so at the UEFA European Championship. In Russia three years ago they lost their first game (vs Mexico) and won the second (vs Sweden) but then also lost their third (vs South Korea) to go out at the group stage.

• Germany's two pre-UEFA EURO 2020 friendlies brought a 1-1 draw with Denmark in Innsbruck and a 7-1 romp against Latvia in Düsseldorf in which there were seven different goalscorers the first of them Robin Gosens opening his account for the Mannschaft. The Atalanta player was also on target against Portugal in which he won the Star of the Match award.

Star of the Match: Gosens on Germany win

• Those two warm-up games were notable for the return of erstwhile stalwarts Mats Hummels and Thomas Müller neither of whom had played for Germany since November 2018. Christian Günter had an even longer wait for a return to national colours his second cap as a substitute in the draw against Denmark coming seven years after his first while Kevin Volland's appearance in Innsbruck was his first since November 2016.

• The game against Latvia was also a significant one for goalkeeper and captain Manuel Neuer as it was his 100th international appearance for Germany making him the third centurion in the UEFA EURO 2020 squad alongside Müller and Toni Kroos (now both 104 caps) and the first German goalkeeper ever to reach that landmark.

• Twelve players survived that early exit from the 2018 World Cup to retain their places in Joachim Löw's selection this time around though only eight remain from UEFA EURO 2016 – Neuer Hummels Müller Kroos Joshua Kimmich and non-World Cup participants Bernd Leno Emre Can and Leroy Sané.

Löw: 'We have winning spirit'

• Until Kai Havertz scored Germany's third goal against Portugal no player in Löw's UEFA EURO 2020 squad had ever found the net at the EURO finals. Müller has now competed in 13 final tournament matches without a goal Kroos in 12 and Hummels – an own goal scorer against France – in 11. Müller who in contrast has scored ten World Cup final tournament goals even missed his penalty in the 2016 quarter-final shoot-out against Italy.

• Eight members of Bayern München's 2020/21 Bundesliga-winning side have been selected for this squad – Neuer Kimmich Sané Müller Serge Gnabry Leon Goretzka Niklas Süle and Jamal Musiala the youngest player in the party at 18.

• Other 2020/21 trophy winners in the squad are Dortmund pair Hummels and Can who won the DFB-Pokal Manchester City's Premier League champion İlkay Gündoğan and UEFA Champions League winners Antonio Rüdiger Timo Werner and final goalscorer Havertz of Chelsea.

• There were 21 members of Löw's EURO squad in UEFA Champions League action during the 2020/21 season plus Leno in the UEFA Europa League with only Freiburg's Günter Monaco's Volland Eintracht Frankfurt's Kevin Trapp and Leeds United's Robin Koch not involved in continental club competition.

Hungary

• Attila Fiola's goal against France was only his second for Hungary in 37 internationals his first having come on his 34th appearance in a 4-1 World Cup qualifying win against San Marino earlier this year.

• Hungary's defeat by Portugal on Matchday 1 ended the team's long unbeaten run that had stretched to 11 matches when they defeated Cyprus 1-0 and drew 0-0 with the Republic of Ireland in their two pre-UEFA EURO 2020 friendlies both played at the Ferenc Szusza Stadion in Budapest. Marco Rossi's side remain undefeated outside the Hungarian capital however in six matches winning five since their final UEFA EURO 2020 group qualifier a 0-2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff.

• András Schäfer's first international goal settled the contest against Cyprus a game in which János Hahn and Bendegúz Bolla both made their Hungary debuts. Those two players were again involved against Ireland when another player Szabolcs Schön earned his first cap and recalled goalkeeper Ádám Bogdán came off the bench to make his first international appearance for over five years.

• Hahn was the top scorer in the 2020/21 Hungarian top flight with 22 goals for Paks the two players just behind him – Fehérvár's Nemanja Nikolić (15) and Honvéd's Dániel Gazdag (13) – having also both made the UEFA EURO 2020 squad along with five members of the title-winning Ferencváros side – Dénes Dibusz Gergő Lovrencsics Dávid Sigér Endre Botka and Bogdán.

It actually disgusts me.”

Yet it plays a vital part in teams’ preparations — arguably even more so during a congested season in which fans remain largely absent from stadiums.

Some managers leave things to their assistant and fitness coaches while others take part themselves watch avidly or like Jurgen Klopp use the time to observe the opposition. Here The Athletic looks at how each Premier League side warms up and analyses what it says about that particular team…

Arsenal

Goalkeepers Bernd Leno and Runar Alex Runarsson are usually first out facing shots from goalkeeper coach Inaki Cana.

The rest of the squad emerge 40 minutes before kick-off splitting into pairs to share passes across the width of the pitch. Here we usually see friends pair off with each other: Hector Bellerin and Dani Ceballos tend to work together for instance.

After a few minutes the squad split between starters and substitutes (goalkeepers excluded). The starters begin their fitness drills with Shad Forsythe as the benched players whose drilled were completed before the starters work with Sam Wilson.

Starters then break off into three groups passing between themselves before a larger more intense group rondo. There are three neutral players (grey bibs) four in green bibs and another four without bibs and Kieran Tierney tends to be the only player in short sleeves in the winter months.

Some 25 minutes before kick-off the starters split into two groups. A defensive group of four and an attacking six. This isn’t indicative of how they’ll line up however as there have been multiple occasions when one of the two wing-backs (usually left-sided) is included in the attacking six working on combinations to get into the box.

After five minutes the attacking group head over to the corner of the pitch to do their shooting drills (a one-two with a coach before shooting at goal). Centre-backs and full-backs can often be seen pinging the ball between each other cross-field.

Then come the quick sprints before the starters disappear down the tunnel shortly followed by the substitutes who aim speculative efforts at goal with 15 minutes until kick-off.

Aston Villa

Villa’s warm-up drills have varied since football has been largely played behind closed doors. There’s a distinct lack of fancy flicks sublime take-ons and those seemingly-casual volleyed passes between two players that bring a twinkle to the eyes of young supporters watching on from the sidelines.

Some things haven’t changed though: boss Dean Smith watches on from the tunnel to check out the opposition during shooting practice Tyrone Mings always asks assistant manager John Terry to throw up some balls that he can head away just before he starts and Jack Grealish tends to sprint off the pitch first after completing his warm-up. Make of that what you will.

In short though Villa tend to follow a basic schedule. The goalkeepers emerge first usually 45 minutes before kick-off. Their warm-up consists of basic catching drills followed by some shot-stopping.

The outfield players follow five minutes later. Routine running drills get the process started and then it’s on to a few group stretches.

A five-a-side one-touch game is then set up for the starting players and is overseen by the assistant coaches Craig Shakespeare Terry and Richard O’Kelly. In the closing period O’Kelly takes the attacking players into one of the goals to start a shooting practice session while Terry gives a few words of encouragement to the defenders.

To finish there’s always a group huddle. Terry and Shakespeare often offer up some motivational messages during a brief 30-second chat which are typically always positive and about the team rather than anything tactical.

Gregg Evans

Brighton

If only Brighton had two nets to aim at when it counts.

A temporary net next to the proper one is used during their warm-up routine. Attackers and midfielders exchange passes with Graham Potter’s assistant Billy Reid or coach Bruno Saltor before trying to fire past one of the goalkeepers.

Brighton might seem reluctant to shoot when the real action begins but they are always well prepared beforehand.

The goalkeepers work as much with their feet as their hands with Ben Roberts. The goalkeeping coach plays the role of an opposing attacker in passing drills closing them down in the penalty box.

In another area of the pitch defenders work in pairs on short and long-range passing and headers.

The players are brought back together as one group for a final burst of quick steps and short-distance sprints before heading back to the dressing room.

Unfortunately that other net disappears with them.

Andy Naylor

Burnley

The Burnley warm-up has slightly changed in the last few weeks since the final game before the November international break.

It starts with some loosening up in groups of four beginning with some light running and stretching before moving on to ball work with a short passing drill which then progresses into two rondos. As you would expect with Burnley the tempo is high.

Previously the starting XI would then be involved in a keep-ball session with the substitutes moving to the corner of the pitch to take part in another rondo drill. The change from Dyche and his coaching staff means that now all outfield players are involved in the keep-ball session separated into two teams with the central midfielders operating on whichever team has the ball. Led by first-team coach Tony Loughlan it is loud it is intense. It is Burnley and all of their values.

There is another running exercise which is short sharp and intense before the defensive players and attacking players split off into two different drills. The attacking players will go through their attacking patterns with Ian Woan instructing while the defensive four work with Loughlan defending a range of passes — low high long and short — played by the substitutes with plenty of communication.

The warm-up is finished up with your typical shooting drill while the defenders knock long passes to each other before a final intense sprint.

Chelsea

Approximately an hour before the start of a home game at Stamford Bridge the reserve goalkeepers will be first out onto the pitch accompanied by goalkeeping coach Hilario. After some light stretches they get to work in a temporary goal positioned near the touchline going through exercises designed to test their reactions to low saves and comfort level with the ball at their feet.

Edouard Mendy joins them around 15 minutes later setting his towel and bottle down by the real goal before quickly getting involved in a one-touch passing drill with the other two led by Hilario.

Chelsea’s outfield players then make their entrance and are swiftly divided into two groups: the starters and the substitutes. It’s quite free-form for the first few minutes with some players kicking around one of the many loose balls on the pitch and others doing light stretches but the starters are soon whisked off to one side by a fitness coach. They gather in a circle slip black elasticated bands around their knees and do squats then lower them to their ankles and repeatedly move their feet apart.

Next up it’s short shuttle runs featuring sidesteps leg and knee raises as well as jumps and miming headers. Then they re-form the circle bending over with legs apart raising up and swinging arms swinging legs shifting from one knee to the other and hopping on one leg. After another round of jumps and mimed headers they finish with another round of shuttle sprints.

The substitutes are then brought over separately to go through the same routine while the starters begin a one-touch pass-and-move drill with low and high passes followed by a rondo with a difference: one teammate is positioned in the middle of the circle between the bib-wearing chasers and the task is to bounce passes off him without being dispossessed.

Chelsea save the best exercise for last: a shooting drill where every player initiates a one-two and then tries to beat the goalkeeper with a first-time finish – with highly varied results.

Liam Twomey

Crystal Palace

Palace’s warm-up suits a team that plays on the counter-attack and needs to clear its lines both short and long likely to be under pressure.

First out are the goalkeepers who form a triangle with goalkeeping coach Dean Kiely to play short passes to each other before he then takes shots at them incrementally increasing the distance as he goes along and finally testing them with crosses and corners.

The starting XI arrive on the pitch to some freestyle jogging and passing generally playing with the ball and then they join the head of sports science Scott Guyett to jog across the pitch in a horizontal line and back again..

Substitutes participate in a game of piggy in the middle with one player trying to intercept passes in a small circle and then they stretch.

The starters then do some sprints various stretches and then go over to the Lower Holmesdale Stand at Selhurst Park to do shuttle runs. They take part in a pass-and-move routine with first-team coach Dave Reddington observing. Pass control and replace in a clockwise movement who they pass it to. Afterwards they play a small-sided game trying to keep the ball. The forwards participate in a shooting drill in which they pass to Reddington who lays it off for them to take one touch and shoot at Vicente Guaita.

The midfielders pass the ball between themselves over a medium distance while the defenders are with Guyett who throws the ball down hard and bounces it just in front of them prioritising close control before throwing it up in the air for them to head back to him. Then they play long balls to each other pass short then play it long.

In the final act they do a small series of shuttle runs in front of the Lower Holmesdale before heading inside 15 minutes before kick-off.

Matt Woosnam

Everton

The players come out and dribble balls around individually while the goalkeepers work separately with Alan Kelly starting with long-range kicking in opposite halves of the pitch.

There are 11 cones set out for the starting XI who do a series of short shuttle runs stretches and short sprints with Francesco Mauri the fitness coach. Then two small rondos with a difference: the player in the middle takes and distributes the ball then it is passed around the circle. Then two teams do another rondo with the aim of keeping and winning back the ball. The substitutes warm up separately.

After there is shooting for the midfielders and attackers while the central defenders practice heading with assistant manager Duncan Ferguson then passing. Some players opt to work individually at this point.

As has been the way since Carlo Ancelotti arrived the squad finish with some shuttle runs one against one and then head for the tunnel.

Patrick Boyland

Fulham

Whether home or away Scott Parker always finds a way to watch his troops before battle.

Away from home this will be anywhere with a decent view. At Leicester for instance he watched on from the mouth of the tunnel. At Craven Cottage though the Fulham head coach will sit flanked sometimes by an analyst on the balcony of the Cottage itself watching on as his coaching staff put his starters through their paces.

The goalkeepers work together alongside coach Rob Burch moving through shot-stopping wide deliveries and distribution drills. The substitutes will normally do rondos in their own circle while those who are set to start outfield begin with dynamic movements and stretches. They split between two lines before forming a circle and undertaking their static stretches — led by head of performance Alastair Harris.

There is opportunity for important instructions to be delivered at this point with assistant Matt Wells one to convey key information. These drills are then concluded with sprints that increase in tempo. From there they split into pairs under the watch of assistants Wells and Stuart Gray getting a feel of the ball for the first time with one and two-touch passing.

The group then moves into more technical preparation. A square normally around 15 metres by 15 metres is laid out for retention-based drills (keep-ball). The first drill for example sees the team split into three colours; comprised of four four and three players. A four vs four takes place in the middle and the other three split with one at each end and one free within the square. Frequently the split pair will be the central defenders but this rotates.

After different variations the starting XI break off with the back-four working together alongside Gray dealing with aerial balls and other direct passes aiming to maintain their line. The forwards go for shooting practice while the midfielders work on a range of passing short and long. The defenders’ drill concludes with some longer passing between them.

After that it’s back to the dressing room and the last few words from Parker before showtime.

Peter Rutzler

Leeds United

Leeds’ outfield players warm up about 40 minutes before kick-off starting with players pairing off and passing back and forward to each other over 10 to 20 yards for five minutes. This is very relaxed; looseners more than anything. The goalkeepers are always out 15-20 minutes earlier.

The 16 outfield players then go into a group with fitness coach Benoit Delaval. He hands out orange bibs to half of the players and they then do some short shuttle runs on one touchline with arm rotations and leg muscle stretches as they go. They then get in a huddle for a few words of encouragement.

Advertisement

After that most of the substitutes peel off and the remaining group intensifies their shuttle runs. A quick drink next. After that they form four lines (two facing each other 30 yards apart). The lines pass balls back and forward between each other — one touch and then pass never two touches.

Next they move into a square of cones and do keep-ball with the bibs against non-bibs. There’s one floating player (in a green bid as opposed to orange) who helps whichever group is in possession. After about five mins they move onto shots against the second-choice keeper.

Lastly the 10 outfield starters move to the byline and do short sharp bursts of running over five to 10 yards. That’s them done 15 minutes before kick-off.

Phil Hay

Leicester City

This hasn’t altered much during Brendan Rodgers’ time as manager. It starts an hour before kick-off when Kasper Schmeichel and the other goalkeepers come out and begin by practising their distribution before some close-range saving drills.

The rest of the players usually come out 40 minutes before kick-off and split into three groups. They begin with small-sided passing drills before the starting XI are involved in more dynamic warm-up exercises under the guidance of the club’s fitness and conditioning coach Matt Reeves.

The substitutes continue with keepy-up drills in a circle while goalkeeping coach Mike Stowell continues to work with Schmeichel and substitute goalkeeper Danny Ward plus third choice keeper Eldin Jakupovic firing balls into them out of his hands from the penalty spot.

Reeves then moves to work with the substitutes utilising similar dynamic stretching exercises. The players are always moving. The starters return to short close-range ball work before switching to a short-sided game in a square where one team hunts the ball in the middle and the other side must protect it.

Coach Kolo Toure will then work with the back five especially the back three who work on their shape practising dropping as a unit as they take it in turns to attack high balls and balls bounced into them while the attacking players will join the keepers for shooting drills.

Rob Tanner

Liverpool

Jurgen Klopp is standing in the centre circle at Anfield his arms folded across his chest as he stares intently at the opposition warming up. Behind him coaches Pep Lijnders and Vitor Matos watch on as their players divide themselves into pairs and knock 10-to-15-yard passes to each other across the turf.

It’s the first drill in a 22-minute warm-up for the outfield players who emerge from the tunnel some seven minutes after John Achterberg has started putting the goalkeepers through their paces.

After five minutes head of fitness and conditioning Andreas Kornmayer calls the 10 outfield starters into a circle in the centre of the pitch while the substitutes embark on a series of rondos together in front of the Main Stand. The “drill sergeant” as he’s affectionately known by Klopp oversees a range of stretches before again they are paired off for some short sharp running exercises.

Then Lijnders steps in handing out white and yellow bibs as they head towards the Kenny Dalglish Stand. A small pitch is already marked out using cones. It’s five vs five. The two centre-backs stand at each end wearing yellow while in front of them it’s the four in white against the four in the training jackets. It’s one touch and it’s frenetic as Lijnders barks orders.

It’s all about ensuring Liverpool are ready to perform with the kind of tempo and intensity Klopp demands.

For most the final five minutes of the warm-up means shooting practice. However the two centre-backs are exempt as they take it in turns to throw balls into the air for the other to head before spreading out to exchange 40-yard cross-field passes.

Advertisement

There are three elements to the shooting drill for midfielders and attackers which involves the full-backs darting down the wing. There’s a cross from the left and then one from the right to dispatch. Thirdly there’s a lay-off from a team-mate close to the edge of the penalty box and you turn before hammering goalwards.

The players stop for a brief drink before Kornmayer brings them together again in front of the Main Stand. There are a series of jumps and sprints in twos before they dart off down the tunnel.

James Pearce

Manchester City

Pep Guardiola’s two assistants Rodolfo Borrell and Juanma Lillo make an interesting double act because the former is a big bear of a man and the latter is pretty diminutive. They set the drills up on the far side of the pitch at the Etihad (which happens to be furthest from where the media are) and the players soon follow them out some of them bursting out of the tunnel with a ball at their feet. Riyad Mahrez is usually among the very first out.

For a few minutes they do their own thing but then partner off into twos to pass between them and these tend to be quite telling partnerships: Ferran Torres and Eric Garcia the two young Spaniards; Mahrez and Mendy the French speakers; Jesus and Cancelo two Portuguese speakers and then Rodri and Gundogan who are very important at the heart of the City midfield.

Borrell hands out bibs of different colours and then it’s the usual warm-up routine for the starters led by Lorenzo Buenaventura Guardiola’s trusted fitness coach. They’re seen squatting down low to warm up the quads and hamstrings shuttling from side to side swaying their arms about lifting their legs over imaginary gates.

The subs do this too with lesser intensity on the near side of the pitch. Their warm-up is a lot more laidback and indeed half the subs don’t always come out for a few minutes and then their ball work will mostly be keeping the ball up in the air in a little circle. Whoever loses gets their ear flicked.

The starting XI then break off into little groups of three or four. They pass it around between themselves quite casually and then it turns into a four-vs-one rondo not especially intense. They then all return to the far side for a bigger rondo with eight around the outside and two in the middle.

The goalkeepers have been working on crosses and kicking but then everybody is back to the near side of the pitch for a shooting drill where the players line up behind each other pass it into feet get it back and shoot. Mikel Arteta used to lay the ball off but it rotates around some of the players now with Phil Foden doing it quite often. Zack Steffen goes in goal while Ederson continues working on his kicking and the other subs keep the ball in the air again.

The starters do little short bursts of sprinting along the near touchline and then they’re off down the tunnel again. Some of the subs depending on who they are can stay out for a little longer playing around. On one occasion Foden stayed out the longest dribbling a ball all the way up to the goal and booting it in long after everyone else had gone in.

That tells us a lot about Foden and his desire to kick a ball around no matter what. As for the team there’s a lot of focus on short sharp passes although this can change depending on the type of game: against Newcastle away at the end of last season the centre-backs worked on heading the ball which was partly to get them acclimatised to tracking the ball against a backdrop of empty black and white seats.

With City it can be a case of different warm-ups for different needs but the focus on passing predictably is always there.

Sam Lee

Manchester United

As discussed here United do a lot of rondos during their warm-up.

The United warm-ups in Louis Van Gaal’s era were characterised by attacking outfield players lining up in formation and going through a series of near-identical passing moves that finished with the winger or full-back squaring and the forward putting the ball into an empty net. Frequently when opponents were involved however things didn’t flow quite so smoothly.

Ryan Giggs liked to conserve energy too during his 24-year career. In our interview in May Giggs told how he realised his approach differed to Louis van Gaal’s when he became assistant to the Dutchman at United. “Louis used to always say ‘What was the warm-up like?’” explained Giggs. Often the players were “poor” and Van Gaal would be aghast. But Giggs added: “As a player I used to simply warm up for the game so I would take it easy. I would have been a nightmare under Louis I didn’t want to peak in the warm-up.”

For last season’s visit to Old Trafford by Liverpool it was possible to detect Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had selected a surprise back three as Harry Maguire Victor Lindelof and Axel Tuanzebe warmed up together. Tuanzebe then suffered an injury and jogged down the tunnel early with Marcos Rojo stepping up from the reserve group.

Kieran McKenna is the coach who leads this section of the warm-up at United tossing the ball high for aerial clearances or firing it along the ground to sharpen control. For other positions groups of two or four might break out for passing drills. Each player has a different way of striking the ball — Bruno Fernandes tends to apply topspin — so a reminder of that before kick-off is somewhat useful.

Midfielders and strikers will inevitably finish the pre-match routine with some shots from the edge of the box at the reserve goalkeeper. The No 1 catches crosses and passes out from his box to various distances. There are of course stretches and running sequences. The simple requirement is to get blood circulating and muscles flexed.

Sheffield United

United’s warm-ups have been pretty uniform under Chris Wilder with one big exception at West Bromwich Albion this season.

First-team coach Matt Prestridge will usually lead the players through their stretching exercises as Alan Knill wanders around passing on advice and words of encouragement but Wilder got much more involved at The Hawthorns. He was there throughout either watching from a distance during the exercises or cajoling his players in the shuttle runs. This increased hands-on approach extended to lobbing the ball to his strikers during shooting practice.

It didn’t work United having 22 efforts and an expected goals (xG) of 3.12 but still failed to find the net in a 1-0 defeat. Since then United have returned to the norm with Knill and Prestridge overseeing things on the pitch and Wilder taking a back seat.

United’s routine starts with stretching then the squad breaks so the 11 starting take part in small-sided game where priority is keeping the ball. As this happens the subs work together on passing. Then the strikers break away for shooting drills as the rest work on passing skills in another part of the pitch before everyone returns to the dressing room about 10-15 minutes before kick-off.

Newcastle

What must Newcastle United improve most?

Many would argue their passing and so it is encouraging to see that a large section of their warm-up is dedicated to the art — or at least it was ahead of the goalless draw with Liverpool.

Their match preparations begin with Jamie Harley the club’s head of sports science leading dynamic stretches. Two lines of cones are placed on the ground and players copy his techniques.

Next the players are split into two teams half with yellow bibs and half without for a passing drill overseen by Stephen Clemence and Steve Agnew the first-team coaches. Both sides must simultaneously attempt one-touch passes to navigate their way up the small cordoned area. This then evolves into a two-touch passing game where two “neutral” players with orange bibs are placed at either end. Rather than goalkeepers they are additional team-mates for both sides with the aim to keep possession rather than score.

Finally the players split off by position with Matt Ritchie practising receiving possession and crossing with Agnew while Clemence leads the majority of the rest of the players in a shooting drill. The coach receives a pass from an attacker just outside the area and lays it back for them to shoot at a goalkeeper.

Whatever the preparations they were successful against Liverpool — but passing remains a “work in progress” as Steve Bruce might say.

Chris Waugh

Southampton

Southampton’s pre-match warm-up doesn’t particularly reflect the intensity with which the team play.

Alek Gross the club’s head of sports science and first-team fitness coach leads the squad through several exercises although the first few minutes sees the players pass the ball around between themselves. Gross will then without fail guide the team through multiple exercises between a set of cones. These include movements such as high knees and are designed to loosen the muscles.

Next on the agenda is stretching.

The first-team fitness coach gathers the squad into a large circle before the players stretch in unison. Once this is over they head back to the cones and do several sprints.

This though is where Gross’ involvement ends and Ralph Hasenhuttl’s management team take over. Hasenhuttl who often remains inside during the warm-up leaves Dave Watson Kelvin Davis and Craig Fleming in charge. Fellow assistant Richard Kitzbichler observes proceedings from the technical area.

The squad are split into three teams and play a small-sided passing game together and then finish the warm-up with a shooting drill.

Tellingly though defenders Jan Bednarek and Jannik Vestergaard don’t take shots on goal. Instead they go to the other side of the pitch and practice headers with each other.

Tottenham Hotspur

During a Tottenham warm-up there tends to be one player that your eyes are instinctively drawn to. Tanguy Ndombele can normally be found practising his tricks and flicks whenever there is an idle moment. It is as mesmerising to watch as the drops of the shoulder and perfectly-weighted passes he produces in matches.

Generally though the Tottenham warm-ups are pretty businesslike affairs. After going through dynamic stretches the players join together for a rondo but instead of standing around in a circle the players are constantly moving as they receive the ball and after they’ve passed it.

The group will then split with Ledley King looking after the defenders and giving them exercises like lobbing balls up in the air for them to head. Then they will do a series of quick repetitions of volleying the ball back to him before he will test their acceleration by rolling balls in front of them to run and sprint onto.

The attackers meanwhile will do exercises like practising their shooting — passing receiving a lay-off passing again and then smashing a shot normally past the goalkeeper. The other keeper will be practising getting up and down quickly as the goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos throws balls in different directions for him to save.

After more stretching and a few sprints the players return to the dressing room for their final instructions. Then it’s game time.

Charlie Eccleshare

West Brom

The goalkeepers emerge ahead of the rest of the squad and started with some long-range kicking before moving on to claiming crosses and finally some close-up shot-stopping.

The outfield players split into two groups with the 10 starters doing a more intensive warm-up than those on the bench. The majority of the drill is a high-tempo keep-ball session when most of the hard work is done by the two players charged with winning the ball back.

Under new boss Sam Allardyce that lasts for around 10 minutes and seems a little more intense than it had been under Slaven Bilic. Sammy Lee leads it and gees up individual players whereas Bilic’s coaches generally observed while the fitness coaches led the drills.

The starting players then split into two groups with Lee leading the back four in a final few minutes on shape and positioning while the remaining six do shooting practice. The subs didn’t see the ball and did some much less intensive stretching which seemed to be just designed to stay loose.

Against Leeds United there was a moment of drama in the warm-up when Kieran Gibbs was hit by a ball and ruled out of the game with Lee Peltier moved from the subs to the starters having missed most of the warm-up session.

Steve Madeley

West Ham

When the players have inspected the pitch and returned to the dressing room quite often it is Darren Randolph David Martin and Lukasz Fabianski who are out first for the warm-up.

Goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero runs a number of drills noticeably crossing the ball into the box where Fabianski Randolph and Martin will leap into the air to catch it. Before the session finishes the players will attempt shots against the second and third-choice goalkeepers.

The starting XI will jog onto the field and begin to do stretches jumping on the spot and doing pass and movement drills. Shortly after the substitutes will appear and it is very common for them to do passing drills with different players taking turns being in the middle. Kevin Nolan the first-team coach will often join in while David Moyes tends to watch the opposition team during their warm-up.

Roshane Thomas

Wolves

For a team that prides itself on an enviable injury record it’s no surprise that loosening up muscles plays a key part of Wolves’ warm-up.

The fact Wolves currently have four players out injured is deemed a crisis by their incredibly high standards (they only suffered five short-term injuries during the whole of 2018-19 for example) shows how seriously they take injury prevention.

A 30-minute warm-up against Aston Villa starts with some light jogging overseen by fitness and sport science gurus Antonio Dias and Joao Lapa. It’s a sedentary start which continues when the players then stand 20 yards apart in pairs passing the ball to each other stopping occasionally to stretch their calves under instruction.

The passing drill then evolves into players turning on the spot shadowed by Dias or Lapa who grapple with them before the player breaks free and passes the ball on.

Next there are some kneeling lunges a 50-yard long passing routine and then a running drill bleep-test style sprinting 20 yards before turning back again.

There’s a quick break as first-team sports rehabilitator Danny Fishwick dishes out energy drinks before the intensity is lifted by some high impact running knees up over a ladder laid out on the side on the pitch.

Quick short sprints in pairs is followed by lunging over hurdles to stretch the inside of their legs then keepy-ups 10 yards apart.

Finally it’s on to some football in the form of crossing and shooting practice. The ball is played to both sides of the penalty area where wing-backs Nelson Semedo or Marcal cross low into the box for either Pedro Neto Daniel Podence Adama Traore Leander Dendoncker Fabio Silva or Joao Moutinho to run onto and shoot.

The warm-up concludes with 20-yard shots versus John Ruddy in goal. A player takes a pass with their back to goal spins and shoots. Podence rolls one in off the post Neto lashes one in the corner and Ruddy makes a sprawling save from Moutinho before the players head down the tunnel.

What Is Staphylococcus Aureus?

The FDA explains that Staph is a bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning. Food contaminated with Staph may not smell or taste bad or look spoiled. Though the bacteria can be killed by cooking the toxins may still be able to cause illness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) symptoms develop within 30 minutes to eight hours after consuming the contaminated food. Though severe illness is rare Staph food poisoning may cause nausea vomiting and stomach cramps.

What To Do If You Have the Recalled Products at Home

Check your pantry for the recalled products many of which have a long shelf-life. Do not eat any of the recalled products. You should discard them.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea? — Iain.lawson27 (@ILawson27) May 5 2024

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktZmlyc3QtbWluaXN0ZXItc2NvdGxhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to thwart John Swinney's bid to be first minister with own leadership run,"Mr Swinney has pitched himself as a unity candidate following Mr Yousaf’s disastrous tenure in charge of the SNP.

Last week he persuaded his only viable challenger Ms Forbes not to stand in exchange for a “significant” role in government.

“My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP” Mr Swinney said. “So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had.

“Every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding. And I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.”

Should Mr McCormick win enough support to force a contest a programme of hustings would take place.

While the former deputy first minister would not be obliged to attend sources close to him said they expected that he would “respect the process” and debate Mr McCormick.

However a leadership contest could be expensive for the cash-strapped party with last year’s election to replace Nicola Sturgeon costing the party £160000.

‘SNP must build more support for independence’

SNP headquarters will check signatures on physical forms on Monday. Anyone who has submitted nominations will be checked to ensure their membership is still in date with the result expected in the afternoon.

If there is no contest Mr Swinney would be elected as SNP leader unopposed and likely be voted in as first minister on Tuesday.

In a speech at the SNP party conference last year Mr McCormick described the SNP-run Scottish Government as “flatulence in a trance”.

Mr Swinney said on Sunday that his party had to build more support for independence and admitted that it was not currently a “compelling proposition” for most Scots.

He said: “So what I think our priority has got to be is to spend less time discussing the mechanics and the thresholds of independence but to start winning the arguments about why independence is an absolute necessity for people in Scotland.”

Craig Hoy the Scottish Tory chairman said Scots would be “dismayed but not surprised” to hear that “independence remains John Swinney’s overriding priority”.

He added: “Scotland needs a first minister focused on the public’s real priorities – fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy – not one fixated on dividing the nation just to pacify the warring SNP.

“It’s laughable of John Swinney to say he wants to take the ‘conflict’ out of the push for independence. The only way to do that is to drop it and concentrate on the issues that matter to Scots.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vZmFudGFzeS9iYXNlYmFsbC9uZXdzL2FzdHJvcy1jaGFzLW1jY29ybWljay1yZXN1bWVzLXJ1bm5pbmcv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9mYW50YXN5L2Jhc2ViYWxsL25ld3MvYXN0cm9zLWNoYXMtbWNjb3JtaWNrLXJlc3VtZXMtcnVubmluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astros' Chas McCormick: Resumes running,"McCormick (hamstring) began running Saturday and could participate in batting practice within the next few days Brian McTaggart of MLB.com reports.

McDonald's struck gold when the fast-food giant teamed up with Travis Scott earlier this year.

The ""Travis Scott Meal"" was so successful that some locations ran out of Quarter Pounder ingredients something that had not happened when meatpacking plants shuttered earlier in the pandemic. Scott's line of merchandise swiftly sold out. Analysts applauded the deal which helped McDonald's reach Gen Z customers.

Perhaps the most impressive part of the plan was that it didn't require McDonald's to add a single item to the menu. The so-called ""Travis Scott Meal"" was a Quarter Pounder with cheese bacon and lettuce medium fries with BBQ Sauce and a Sprite — all well-known existing menu items. Yet Scott's name was enough to make the chain start running out of burgers.

""His ability to kind of see where culture is going and have a hand in where culture is going is really unique"" McDonald's Chief Marketing Officer Morgan Flatley told Business Insider in September. ""Then you couple that with his huge followership and his fans social-media footprint and ... 3 billion streams. He just has an incredible audience.""

McDonald's partnership with Scott paved the way for a new type of celebrity-inspired menu item both at McDonald's and other chains including Chipotle and Dunkin'.

Why the new celebrity menu item makes sense in 2020

McDonald's continued its run of celebrity partnerships with J Balvin. McDonald's

Many restaurants pared down their menus in 2020 with McDonald's among the chains that cut less popular items like salads and grilled chicken from the menu. During the pandemic chains' drive-thru business was more important than ever. Having fewer menu items available helps speed up service and makes operations easier for workers.

At the same time new and limited-time offerings create buzz and a sense of urgency among potential customers. When a new item hits menus it helps make the chain feel more relevant. And if the menu item is only going to be there for a few months it helps convince people that now is the time to visit.

The new era of celebrity menu items such as the Travis Scott Meal allows chains to harness the buzz of a new menu item without actually adding anything to menu.

McDonald's followed up its partnership with Scott with a collaboration with reggaeton star J Balvin. According to Flatley McDonald's wanted to work with stars like Scott to win over younger customers. According to Flatley people under the age of 34 are ""becoming more and more challenging for brands to reach.""

""How they engage with media is different"" Flatley said. ""They look to recommendations much more than any other generation has. They're very reliant on social media. They're very reliant on their friends.""

McDonald's isn't alone in rolling out celebrity menu items in 2020.

In December Chipotle rolled out its own celebrity menu item inspired by singer Miley Cyrus. The dish was called the ""Guac is extra but so is Miley burrito"" — and of course only used ingredients already found at Chipotle. Chipotle previously launched a challenge on TikTok in November in which three winners had their orders added to the app as official menu items.

Dunkin' debuted The Charli named after TikTok star Charli D'Amelio in September. The cold brew beverage only used ingredients that were already available at the chain. However it still drove a 57% increase in app downloads compared to the previous 90 days and significantly boosted cold brew sales according to UBS.

""Certainly the drink had a lot of popularity with Gen Z which obviously is super important"" Drayton Martin Dunkin's vice president of brand stewardship recently told Business Insider. ""You need to continue to bring younger people into the brand family if you want to stay healthy.""

""Also the younger generations are actually bellwethers that then cascade to the loser Gen Xers who are still desperately clinging onto coolness — not that I'm describing myself or anything"" Martin added.

Martin said that Dunkin' is always scheming and playing around with different options as it considers future partnerships. Like Flatley at McDonald's she said that Dunkin' only wants to team up with celebrities that are genuinely fans of the brand — though that is only the first of many considerations.

""Will this help with that aspiration of: 'Wow I didn't expect this from Dunkin'?"" Martin said. ""Obviously [we consider if we] can we punch above our weight in terms of earned media? Is it interesting? Is there a story here? All of those are factors that go into it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZWliZXJ0cm9uLmNvbS90cmFuc2Zvcm1lcnMvbmV3cy8xOTk1LW1jZG9uYWxkcy10b3ktZG9jdW1lbnRzLXJldmVhbC1lYXJseS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1jb25jZXB0cy1mb3ItYmVhc3Qtd2Fycy80NTU1NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1995 McDonalds Toy Documents Reveal Early Development Concepts for Beast Wars,"Saturday January 2nd 2021 1:54AM CST

Beast Wars! 1995 McDonald’s Toy Document Gives Us a Previously Unseen Look at Early Franchise Development and Several Unused Toy Concepts!



Warm up your transwarp drive and grab some drive-through because we’re heading to the bygone era of 1995 to catch a glimpse at Transformers history! To a time before it was even called…BEAST WARS!



Thanks to Nathan at



In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”. However the most interesting thing in this section is the design that would become Cheetor being referred to as “Prowl” while utilizing the color scheme reminiscent of the McDonald’s toy that would ultimately see release as “Panther”. It’s often been suspected that the decision to deco the deluxe toy that became Cheetor as a cheetah may have been a decision that occurred after the sculpting phase was complete; it seems it may have originally been intended to be a panther version of G1 Prowl which would explain Cheetor’s very Prowl-like head sculpt.



Also mentioned in the document is the pitch for “Auto-Rollers” as the potential auto-transformation gimmick (another carry-over from G2) including four vehicle mode ones which unfortunately were not included in the document; though Nathan managed to grab an image of the moon buggy Prowl from another auction listing.



Check out the images mirrored below which include concept sketches of toys that saw release some that didn’t like sea turtle and dragonfly versions of Megatron and some that were originally conceived as different characters—like the Predacon Manta Ray who was originally intended to be Optimus Prime! Oh and a concept sketch for a lion Optimus Prime that pre-dates Lio Convoy as well as the evolution of the Under-3 toy from a G1-themed Optimus to the lion head that ultimately saw release! Warm up your transwarp drive and grab some drive-through because we’re heading to the bygone era of 1995 to catch a glimpse at Transformers history! To a time before it was even called…BEAST WARS!Thanks to Nathan at RoboticPlanetToys on Instagram who acquired a McDonald’s Happy Meal toy presentation binder at auction and has given us scans of the Transformers content within. I say “Transformers” because not only do these concept pages use the Generation 2 logo the name “Beast Wars” was seemingly not decided upon yet as it appears nowhere in the document. While we know Hasbro/Kenner initially intended Optimus Primal and Megatron to be the original G1 characters before the show opted to make them new individuals this document reinforces that as this predates the change from “Prime” to “Primal” in the toyline proper. Also noteworthy is this was apparently before the faction name “Maximal” was decided upon as the document states Megatron leads the Predacons while Optimus Prime leads the “Cyberbeasts”.In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”.

It's nearly the 25 year anniversary for Transformers Beast Wars the Kingdom line has brought the toys back to major retailer shelves the Masterpiece line slowly brings fantastically accurate robot and animal modes to collectors and the recent Japanese Beast Wars Generations book has provides wonderful background information about the development of the line. What better time to reveal previously unseen Beast Wars concepts courtesy of a McDonald's presentation binder! Did you know before they were Maximals lead by Optimus Primal they were known as the Cyberbeasts and Optimus Prime was their leader? Additionally two other alternative McDonald's promotions were being considered the Creature Autorollers and Vehicle Autorollers. Stay tuned for more posts showing off these unreleased concepts that will certainly contain surprises for even then biggest Beast Wars fans.

Also don't worry Littlest Pet Shop fans lots of reveals will be presented after this Beast Wars series.

Starting off this series from the McDonalds concept binder you'll be familiar with the alligator Megatron but might be surprised that no only is the bat Optimus known as Optimus Prime but there was a possible plan for a lion Optimus well before Lio Convoy from the Japanese Beast Wars II series existed. Also notice Scorponok was named Shockwave and Snapper was named Buzzsaw. Lastly the generically named ""Panther' toy at one time had a familiar Transformers name: Prowl.

Only Prowl/Panther' made it to Happy Meals in 1996 Scorponok in 1998 and Optimus & Megatron made appearances on the happy Meal boxes. The other concepts though give a peek at alternative ideas Hasbro/Kenner was considering strongly enough to relay to their licensees. Would ""Shockwave"" been fitting for Scorponok? Trukk not Liun???

The Beast Wars Creature Auto Rollers was an entire concept line that never made it off paper. Check out these cool illustrations of potential toys that would have completely changed the McDonald's Beast Wars Happy Meal promotion.

The last proposed Happy Meal Transformers were not the familiar Beast Wars animals and would have included Prowl Starscream Hound and Rumble as Vehicle Auto Rollers functionally similar to the Creature Auto Rollers. Sadly when I acquired the McDonald's concept binder it only included this description page. The moon buggy Prowl picture was eventually found online but I was unable to reach the owner to recover that page or find out if they have the others.

Here it is the last two pages of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars Happy Meal concept binder. The proposed but unreleased Under 3 toy was a very G1 looking Optimus Prime toy. Quite a bit different than the unnamed final product that better aligned with the Beast Wars theme.



... but wait there is more to come! I will have another series of posts from a subsequent iteration of concepts for the same Beast Wars promotion and it gets a lot more colorful too. Stay tuned!

In April 1996 one year after the previous Beast Wars Happy Meal concepts were presented Vehicle Auto Rollers were out and character decisions and toy colors were being refined. Take a look at these pictures of Megatron as a Sea Turtle and Optimus Prime as what would become Predacon Manta Ray. I have no information suggesting if these were original ideas by McDonald's or if Hasbro provided some input.

Who do you think would win in an aquatic robot battle?

Beast Wars Megatron concepts didn't stop with the Sea Turtle shown in my last post! A dragonfly Megatron was also being considered that had some interesting wasp-like coloring. Swipe to see the other pictures of a brilliantly colored Iguanus as well as Panther/Prowl in nearly final colors.

Next up I'll be posting what all these characters would have looked like as Creature Auto Rollers.

Next in this series of McDonald's Beast Wars concepts is the familiar characters from my last post but now as Creature Auto Rollers. Nothing too surprising except some color changes. Unfortunately this is the last that's seen of the Creature Auto Rollers as the fold out toy concept moved on into product. One more post remains in this series and it may be quite a surprise. Stay tuned!

Here it is the last post of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars concept series. If you remember way back to the second post of the series I showed line art of Optimus Prime/Primal as a fold out lion toy. Later I showed an alternate Under 3 toy concept of a G1 Optimus Head. Of course that means Under 3 was indeed supposed to Optimus Prime and here is the evidence of that. The robot head on the produced toy certainly resembles Optimus' masked face and crown but the lack an actual name for the toy and the early Optimus lion toy concept are two pieces of the production history that finally identity Under 3.

Instagram user Nathan of RoboticPlanetToys has posted scans of several never-before-seen documents from 1995 for the McDonalds Happy Meal toys of Beast Wars. User Vexwing of The Allspark has written a detailed article providing much information about these scans which reveal many early concepts from the Beast Wars toyline's initial development.I will let Vexwing's words speak for themselves since he has been planning this reveal with Nathan for quite some time:Here are the document scans complete with Nathan's own comments for each:To add my own two cents to all of this the Prowl/Panther concept brings new insight to this early Cheetor concept sketch:This artwork was scanned from the Beast Wars Reborn Golden Disk CD-ROM and when it recently appeared in the Beast Generations book the book's text accompanying it referred to its beast mode as a cougar.Evidently this Prowl concept is the origin of both the Cheetor toy and the McDonalds Panther toy explaining why they both have a very Prowl-like robot head.And now that we know that McDonalds Panther and Manta Ray were originally supposed to have been Prowl and Optimus Prime respectively it is likely that Beetle was supposed to have been Megatron and Rhino was Rhinox.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGhheW9tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzAxL21jZG9uYWxkcy1icmF6aWwtZ29lcy1ncmVlbmVyLXdpdGgtaXNyYWVsaS1jbGVhbnRlY2gtc3RhcnR1cC11YnEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Brazil goes greener with Israeli cleantech startup UBQ,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.israelhayom.com/2021/02/01/mcdonalds-brazil-goes-greener-with-israeli-cleantech-startup-ubq/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGhheW9tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzAxL21jZG9uYWxkcy1icmF6aWwtZ29lcy1ncmVlbmVyLXdpdGgtaXNyYWVsaS1jbGVhbnRlY2gtc3RhcnR1cC11YnEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAxL21peWEtcG9uc2V0dG8tc2Vlbi1hdC1jYS1tY2RvbmFsZHMtYWZ0ZXIta2V5b24taGFycm9sZC1hdHRhY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Soho Karen' Miya Ponsetto seen at CA McDonald's after allegedly attacking Keyon Harrold,"Here’s “Soho Karen!”

Miya Ponsetto the woman the NYPD is seeking for allegedly falsely accusing the teen son of jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold of stealing her missing iPhone has been found by the Post — and she’s not only defensive but apparently hungry too.

“I don’t know what the problem is here” the 22-year-old tells our lensman during a fast-food run near her mother’s home in Piru California on Friday.

Exclusive video shows the 22-year-old walking out of a McDonald’s and into the parking lot dressed in all black and wearing a face shield while carrying a drink and a bag of food.

Asked if she had any regrets about the incident she replies on camera “I’m good thank you. Have a very good day. Take care of yourself.”

The photographer then asks Ponsetto if she had any concerns about the NYPD’s warrant for her arrest. She brushes off the question instead declaring her age and ethnicity.

“I’m actually 22 so I don’t know what the problem is here” she says. “And I’m also Puerto Rican so thank you. Take care of yourself.”

She has previously described herself as a mix of Italian Puerto Rican Greek and Vietnamese.

Ponsetto was identified by NYPD sources as the woman who allegedly lunged at 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. accusing him of swiping her iPhone at the Arlo Hotel in Soho.

The shocking encounter was caught on video and posted on social media by the teen’s father on Sunday.

“I am furious!!! We see this crap happening all the time but it hits different when it hits home!!!” Harrold who is black wrote in the caption.

Faith Booker works at McDonald’s and Burger King in Lakeland Florida making $9.70 an hour at McDonald’s and $8.56 an hour at Burger King.

She worked full time at both chains for about nine months. Then McDonald’s cut her hours.

“I’m just pretty much struggling right now just trying to make ends meet” Booker said. “So it’s like paycheck to paycheck pretty much.”

Booker is now choosing between paying bills and buying clothes for her kids. Florida voters approved a ballot measure in November raising the state’s minimum wage to $8.65 an hour now and $10 an hour next September. Booker said right now “making minimum wage isn’t enough to survive on.”

This year especially voters are sympathetic to minimum wage workers on the front lines during a pandemic according to University of Oklahoma economist Gary Hoover.

Like “the people who work at your local grocery store the people who work at your local gas station where you get gas” Hoover said.

Hoover said states where minimum wage workers still earn the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour insist that’s enough because the cost of living is lower there."

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

The joint effort between Merck and A&T supports the increasing need for biotech training and education in North Carolina and highlights the importance of business and historically Black college and university (HBCU) cooperation in growing diverse talent in the biotech sector.

“The Merck Biotechnology Learning Center will provide opportunities for N.C. A&T students to understand what a career in biotech looks like” said Amanda Taylor vice president and plant manager at the Merck Manufacturing Division site in Durham North Carolina. “We have several wonderful N.C. A&T graduates working at our Durham site already and there is so much growth in manufacturing across North Carolina. Through our collaboration with N.C. A&T we’re developing new and innovative ways to build a pipeline of talent in the Triad and beyond.”

The opening of the Merck Biotechnology Learning Center is the launch of a long-term collaboration between Merck and A&T. The two organizations will partner on several initiatives to support student enrichment including curricula development a speaker series and STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) community outreach.

“I am thrilled to announce our groundbreaking collaboration with Merck which heralds a new era of innovation in biotechnology education"" said Tonya Smith-Jackson Ph.D. provost and executive vice chancellor of Academic Affairs. “This partnership signifies a union between academia and industry and a commitment to excellence innovation and the advancement of scientific knowledge as it not only provides our students with unparalleled access to state-of-the-art labs but also invaluable mentorship from Merck professionals ensuring they emerge as industry-ready leaders poised to shape the future of biotechnology. The Merck Biotechnology Learning Center will serve as a hub of learning and discovery and it is also the start of a collaboration where we are going to jointly advance the mission of both Merck and N.C. A&T.”

Merck has been a member of the North Carolina community for more than 40 years. Today nearly 1500 Merck colleagues work at North Carolina facilities in Durham and Wilson including numerous A&T alumni. A&T's College of Engineering is the No. 1 producer of African American graduates in engineering in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyNC8wNS8wMS9pcy1tZXJjay1zdG9jay1mdWxseS12YWx1ZWQtYXQtMTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Merck Stock Fully Valued At $130?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/05/01/is-merck-stock-fully-valued-at-130/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyNC8wNS8wMS9pcy1tZXJjay1zdG9jay1mdWxseS12YWx1ZWQtYXQtMTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tZXJjay1yZXBvcnRzLXByb2dyZXNzLWNhbmNlci1mcm9udC0xODUzNTQyNjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck Reports Progress On The Cancer Front As It Prepares For Keytruda Patent Expiration,"Merck Reports Progress On The Cancer Front As It Prepares For Keytruda Patent Expiration

Merck reported improvement in cancer patients receiving its Keytruda regimen.

Enrolling 698 subjects the trial evaluated the effect of a treatment that combines Merck’s immunotherapy blockbuster Keytruda along with trastuzumab and chemotherapy on patients suffering from gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The final also confirmed that Merck’s Keytruda combination regimen led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement meeting the dual primary endpoint of overall survival.

Merck reported strong first quarter results.

With strong sales of its blockbuster immune-based cancer drug Keytruda along with vaccine products Merck reported revenue rose 9% YoY to $15.78 billion surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $15.20 billion. Net income for the first three months of the year amounted to $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share. Excluding acquisitions and restructuring costs adjusted earnings amounted to $2.07 per share surpassing $1.88 per share that LSEG expected.

The pharmaceutical unit reported revenue grew 10% YoY to $14.01 billion with Keytruda alone bringing in $6.95 billion of those sales as its revenue grew as much as 20% YoY surpassing even FactSet’s estimate of $6.71 billion. The rise is owed to increased uptake from cancer patients at earliest stages of cancer along with continued demand for treating metastatic cancers. HPV prevention vaccine Gardasil also reported a 14% YoY rise in sales as it brought $2.25 billion to the revenue table. Pneumococcal disease prevention vaccine Vaxneuvance also posted remarkable growth of 106% YoY as sales amounted to $219 million.

On the other hand Covid antiviral pill Lagevrio and Type 2 diabetes treatment Januvia reported sales dropped. Lagevrio reported sales dropped 11% to $350 million joining the same trend posted by Pfizer and Moderna as COVID-19 now seems to be history. Januvia posted a 24% YoY drop in sales as revenue amounted to $670 million due to falling demand in the U.S. lower prices and generic competition.

New deals and drug launches to offset Keytruda’s patent expiration.

Story continues

All in all Merck showed it is making substantial progress in preparing for 2028’s patent expiration of its blockbuster drug which will likely dent sales. Besides Winrevair that has been approved in the U.S. last month for treating progressive and life-threatening lung condition. In December Merck and Moderna presented positive results from the combination of Keytruda and their experimential mRNA vaccine for melanoma halving relapse risk. Although it was mid-term data from the 3-year follow-up Merck and Moderna provided hope that mRNA could revolutionize cancer treatment. Moderna director Stéphane Bancel hinted that the mRNA vaccine for melanoma could be available as early as 2025. Moreover after these promising results Moderna and Merck expanded their research scope to evaluate the effect of the treatment against non-small lung cancer.

mRNA already saved the world during the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and now it promises to do the same with what seems to be pharma’s never-ending health-battle. Keytruda’s patent will expire but Merck did all it can to make sure it continues to contribute to a healthier society. Along with cutting costs under a restructuring program it kicked off in February Merck is securing its financial existance and future with new deals and promising drug launches.

Richard James 61 tested positive for the virus on December 10. He was an inmate at Springfield’s Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Missouri at the time.

According to KY3 medical staff transported him to a Springfield hospital days later. He died on December 27. James the report said suffered from long-term pre-existing medical conditions.

He had been at the Springfield prison since 2013.

On October 2nd 2007 life sentences were handed down by a Brooklyn New York jury to former postal worker Ronald Mallay and former insurance agent James who were convicted in July of that year of taking out life insurance policies on four unsuspecting victims then having them shot or poisoned.

The defence had argued that Mallay and James were framed by Guyanese immigrants who testified with promises of U.S. residency. Two persons were killed in Guyana and two in Queens New York.

In July last year the federal jury had deliberated for three days before finding the two guilty of committing murder in the aid of racketeering conspiracy and multiple other charges.

James 46 and Mallay 61 were charged with orchestrating the poisoning and shooting deaths of four victims two in a close-knit Guyanese community in Queens and two in Guyana since the early 1990s. The defendants treated their victims “like meat” Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Capers had told the jury during the trial. “They put prices on their heads.”

Prosecutors had said that Mallay took out a US$400000 insurance policy on his own brother-in-law before hiring a `hit-man’ to gun down his relative in Queens in 1993. Mallay’s nephew a witness for the government testified that his uncle later said he was happy the victim was left “dying in the street like a dog.”

Among the murdered according to prosecutors was 42-year-old Basdeo Somaipersaud who was found dead in 1998. Subsequent autopsy results showed that the man died from lethal doses of chlorpromazine injected into his system.

In another case $300000 was collected from the death of Mallay’s own nephew in Guyana Hardeo Sewnanan. Sewnanan was poisoned in June 1999. He died after drinking what investigators believe was alcohol and ammonia during a dinner with Mallay at a restaurant in Berbice. The other two victims were Vern `Dilly’ Peter the husband of an accused co-conspirator and Alfred Gobin.

The evidence included a secretly recorded audiotape of James offering a bribe in a failed bid to kill another down-and-out victim in Harlem.

“Complete bum if you look at him you will laugh” James had said on tape. “I will give you 25 grand.”

The government had stated that MetLife Inc. discovered the scheme after noticing that 21 death claims had been filed on policies written by James within a few years.

The rate “was approximately 318 percent higher than expected (and) … a large number of deaths were violent or under unusual circumstances” court papers had stated. The insurance company fired James in July 2000 and notified authorities. The defendants were arrested in 2002.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvbmV3LXlvcmstZ2lhbnRzL2RhdmUtZGVndWdsaWVsbW8tY292aWQtY293Ym95cy_SAVBodHRwczovL2hlYXZ5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbmZsL25ldy15b3JrLWdpYW50cy9kYXZlLWRlZ3VnbGllbG1vLWNvdmlkLWNvd2JveXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giants & Cowboys Both Test Positive for COVID Ahead of Matchup,"A positive COVID-19 test stripped the New York Giants of offensive coordinator Jason Garrett two weeks ago.

Dave DeGuglielmo Tests Positive OUT vs. Dallas

The team announced on Friday that offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo tested positive for COVID-19 and was immediately isolated. DeGuglielmo will not be available to coach against Dallas this Sunday. According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan assistant offensive line coach Ben Wilkerson will fill the void left behind by DeGuglielmo “barring any change.”

Alongside DeGuglielmo’s positive test the Giants revealed that “two potential close contacts” have also been isolated from the team. New York has yet to disclose whether those close contacts were players or coaches. Per Raanan the understanding as of now is that the offensive line unit is believed to be in the clear although he cautioned to see how contract tracing and future tests unfold.

Here is the team’s official statement on the matter:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmFhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaG93LXdpbGwtdGhlLWNvd2JveXMta2VlcC11cC13aXRoLXRoZS13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXZzLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1nYW1lLzI4Ny0zYjRjYTc2Ny04NDgzLTQ0NjAtOGJkMi1hMTRmMWZkNDY5MjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dallas Cowboys will be scoreboard watching if they win in Week 17,"The Dallas Cowboys won’t be sticking around in New York to watch Washington and Philadelphia on Sunday night with the NFC East on the line should they win.

DALLAS — The second-most consequential game for the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday could be one that they may not see at all.

The Philadelphia Eagles host Washington on Sunday Night Football at Lincoln Financial Field.

If Dallas beats the New York Giants on Sunday at 12:00 p.m. CT at MetLife Stadium an Eagles win over Washington punches the Cowboys’ ticket to the postseason for the first time since 2018.

The Cowboys vs. Giants game will conclude at about 3:30 p.m. CT. Going with a conservative estimate of one hour to shower and conduct postgame interviews and then 30 minutes to travel from East Rutherford N.J. to Newark International Airport the Cowboys wouldn’t be ready to depart until 5:00 p.m. CT.

Factor in another 30 minutes to ensure all cargo is stowed and seats and tray tables are in upright positions it could be 5:30 p.m. CT when the Cowboys take flight.

Fun fact: the last time an opponent won the NFC East at Lincoln Financial Field was Dec. 26 2015 when #Washington beat the #Eagles 38-24. Chip Kelly who Doug Pederson would replace was fired on Dec. 29. https://t.co/ZJxhv70BHn — Mark Lane (@therealmarklane) December 29 2020

Kickoff for Philadelphia at Washington is at 7:20 p.m. CT.

Going with a round figure of two hours 30 minutes the Cowboys would land at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport about 8:00 p.m. CT early in the second quarter. Coach Mike McCarthy is going with a later estimate.

“The game will start while we are in flight” McCarthy said. “We will get back somewhere at halftime or in the third quarter. I am sure everyone has their individual plan. I am sure I will get home in time to watch the end of the game.”

For the first quarter of the NFC East showdown in Game 256 the last of the regular season running back Ezekiel Elliott doesn’t believe they will be able to see any footage from the game.

“We’ll have to wait and see when we land getting back from New York if we made the playoffs” Elliott said. “I think we do have Wi-Fi on the plane so we’ll probably be able to watch the little Scorecard or whatever but I don’t think we’re going to be able to watch the game so we’re just going to have to wait and see.”

According to quarterback Andy Dalton the Wi-Fi on the team charter “works pretty well.”

“We’ll try to follow as much as we can on the plane ride” Dalton said. “Then we’ll be able to catch the end of it once we get home.”

For owner Jerry Jones the concept of taking care of business first and then seeing if there is help along the way is reminiscent of 1995. In Week 17 the Cowboys played the Arizona Cardinals on Monday Night Football.

It wasn’t until they left on the team charter in Arizona that they learned the San Francisco 49ers who had the tiebreaker over Dallas lost to the Atlanta Falcons. A win over the Cardinals would capture home-field advantage for the Cowboys which Dallas parlayed into their last Super Bowl victory of the storied decade.

“That was we were just totally dependent on the other team winning” Jones told 105.3 “The Fan'' Tuesday. “That's just part of it. And somebody's gotta win those games. Boy I'll take it any way you can give it. And if somebody has to do some of the heavy lifting for you there at the end that's why we've got it set up the way we've got it set up.”

#Cowboys' Jerry Jones tells @1053thefan that the #Eagles are like everybody else: they want to win and they want to beat #Washington. ""My town against your town."" — Mark Lane (@therealmarklane) December 31 2020

Dallas knows they have to first beat the Giants who also can win the division with a victory and a Washington loss themselves.

Center Joe Looney knows that a victory is the first priority and then the waiting game between Philadelphia and Washington begins on the flight home.

“If we get that win the first thing I’m thinking is get in that locker room celebrate with my guys high-fiving getting on the plane enjoying the plane ride home and then we’ll see where those chips fall when they land” Looney said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL25mYy1zb3V0aC90YW1wYS1iYXktYnVjY2FuZWVycy9idWNzLXN0YXItZGVmZW5kZXItd2lsbC1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LW1pc3MtMS1wbGF5b2ZmLWdhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bucs Star Defender Will Reportedly Miss 1 Playoff Game,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/nfl/nfc-south/tampa-bay-buccaneers/bucs-star-defender-will-reportedly-miss-1-playoff-game on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL25mYy1zb3V0aC90YW1wYS1iYXktYnVjY2FuZWVycy9idWNzLXN0YXItZGVmZW5kZXItd2lsbC1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LW1pc3MtMS1wbGF5b2ZmLWdhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Posted on: January 2 2021 10:46h.

Last updated on: January 2 2021 03:47h.

Billionaire casino tycoons Sheldon Adelson and James Packer were spotted together during a New Year’s Eve bash in the French Caribbean. And that’s prompted speculation that Packer could be in discussions to sell his more than 36 percent stake in Crown Resorts to the Las Vegas Sands founder and CEO.

Sheldon Adelson’s yacht (above) and James Packer’s (below) were seen together over the New Year’s holiday. (Image: Getty/Benetti)

The UK’s Daily Telegraph broke the news that Adelson 87 and Packer 53 were celebrating the end of the most difficult year for their gaming businesses. The media outlet says Packer’s $200 million superyacht was docked next to Adelson’s $70 million Queen Miri. Tender boats were seen going back and forth from the yachts.

According to Forbes Adelson and Packer are respectively worth $36.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Adelson’s Sands owns casinos in Las Vegas Singapore and Macau. Packer’s Crown operates in his native Australia as well as Crown London Aspinalls.

Adelson Acquisition?

Packer’s Crown Resorts is amid an investigation in Sydney officials in New South Wales determining if the casino group is suitable to hold a gaming license in the Australian state. Crown Sydney a AUD$2.4 billion (USD$1.8 billion) integrated resort opened last week but with its casino on hold.

The New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) is set to issue its verdict on Crown’s suitability sometime this month. Lawyers assisting in the ILGA Inquiry suggested that Packer isn’t suitable to be a close associate of Crown Resorts.

Though Packer no longer sits on the Crown board nor has any executive role he maintains a 36.8 percent stake in the company. During his ILGA testimony Packer conceded that he would sell his position in the casino group if that would allow Crown Sydney to maintain its gaming license.

Adelson is bullish on casinos located outside the United States. Sands sold the company’s only US casino not in Las Vegas — Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania – in 2018 for $1.3 billion. It’s also been reported that Sands is looking to sell its Las Vegas Strip properties — The Venetian and Palazzo.

Adelson has at least for the moment called off his company’s interest in investing in Japan. Gaming analysts believe the casino tycoon prefers acquisitions more than new construction. A Crown purchase would fall in line with that thinking and give Adelson two casinos in Australia — Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth — and possibly a third with Crown Sydney.

Crown Affair

As it awaits the NSW Inquiry verdict Crown Resorts is doing all it can to help prop up its public image. The company which has been accused of failing to prevent its casinos from being used to launder money recently changed its deposit rules for gamblers.

Crown also announced in November that it would only work with VIP junket groups that are fully licensed in the jurisdiction where its casinos are located. Crown appointed its first financial crimes officer too.

Critics say Crown’s efforts come too late.

“Crown has acted with impunity and arrogance for years” opined Tim Costello a reverend and CEO of World Vision Australia a nonprofit that advocates for the poor. “Now they are desperate to prove that they are a fit and proper organization.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdG9uZWRlYWYudGhlYnJhZy5jb20vcG9zdC1tYWxvbmUtY2hhZC1zbWl0aC1hbmQtc2xhc2gtcGVyZm9ybS10b2dldGhlci1kdXJpbmctbnllLWxpdmVzdHJlYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Post Malone casually recruited Chad Smith and Slash for NYE livestream,"Post Malone hooked up with Slash and Chad Smith for special performances in his New Year’s Eve Facebook livestream.

The drummer for Red Hot Chili Peppers and one of the greatest guitarists of all time? That’s quite the impressive NYE guest list. Smith and Slash appeared during Malone’s ‘Bud Light Seltzer Sessions Presents: New Year’s Eve 2021’ Facebook livestream on December 31st (is there a more American drink than Bud Light?).

They weren’t afraid to take on some absolutely massive tracks either: the rapper performed Alice in Chain’s ‘Rooster’ alongside Smith guitarist and producer and former comical nemesis Andrew Watt and bassist Chris Chaney before performing ‘War Pigs’ by Black Sabbath with Slash then added to the mix.

The star-studded show was hosted by Lilly Singh and also featured the likes of Steve Aoki and took place under the bright lights of Las Vegas at MGM Resorts. Where else would Malone and Slash be found hanging out on NYE really?

It was fitting that Malone sung a Sabbath classic considering he’s previously worked with Ozzy Osbourne. The pair collaborated on Malone’s song ‘Take What You Want’ taken from his latest album Hollywood’s Bleeding. Malone also helped Ozzy out on the latter’s album Ordinary Man.

According to Blabbermouth Malone enthused massively about his experience with Osbourne to Zane Lowe of Beats 1: “Ozzy Osbourne baby. I was in Utah because I had just got off tour. It’s good right? Ozzy went over to Watt’s house. You’ve talked a lot before. He’s a maniac. I said ‘Hey you know what? Ozzy Osbourne’s coming down.

We’re going to cut it and I’ll FaceTime you. And you let me know what’s going on.’ We talked and it was like a big deal. Yeah. Ozzy Osbourne. I think he crushed it. I mean he was talking to Watt and Watt was telling me he was like this ‘Yo this is my favorite that I’ve done since you know SABBATH and since I started my own own way.’ I was like ‘That’s huge.’ I’m like honored. Thank you very much.”

Mumbai: Diversify – whether at home or Stateside: That’s the prescription to make money in US stocks where valuations have reached stratospheric heights - as they have in Mumbai The Nasdaq 100 fund yielded 52% over the last one year. It was one of the most popular funds amongst Indian investors many of whom started investing overseas only recently.“While there is a bubble in stocks like Tesla and Netflix there are a lot of individual stock opportunities available and investors can build a portfolio of companies with good fundamentals and fair valuations” says Vikas Gupta Chief Investment Strategist Omniscience Capital.Vikas believes investors could build a portfolio of 8-10 stocks and some of the stocks where there is value are the likes of Qualcomm IBM Micron Technologies and Cirrus Logic. Among the non-technology stocks he prefers Gamestop Bed Bath and Beyond Gap and Skechers.Financial planners point out that there are growth opportunities in niche areas that can be accessed by investors.“There are innovative companies in themes like biotech clean energy artificial intelligence and technology which Indian investors should access” says Vikas Nanda Chairman Globalise a digital wealth management platform to build global portfolios. Vikas recommends ETFs like Invesco Wilderhill Clean Energy ETF First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy ETF ARK Genomic Revolution ETF GlobalX Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF.Investors also continue to pour money in global giants that have earnings not just in the US but across the globe.“We have seen Indian investors put money in stocks like Apple Amazon Facebook and ETFs such as Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund” says Swastik Nigam CEO Winvesta a platform that allows Indian investors to trade overseas.Investors who cannot understand individual stocks can still continue to invest for the long term in the Nasdaq 100.“Even though earnings are strong valuations are high and hence investors should use a staggered approach” says Pratik Oswal Head (Passive Funds) Motilal Oswal AMC.Indian investors can invest up to $250000 under the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) every year. Several bank brokers such as HDFC Bank Kotak Mahindra ICICI Bank and several others allow Indians to invest in overseas stocks or ETFs. In addition there are platforms such as Stockal Globalise Winvesta and Vested through which investors can buy stocks or seek advisory and build a portfolio of companies.",,,,,,,,,

While the hackers suspected to be working for Russia’s S.V.R. intelligence agency did not appear to use Microsoft’s systems to attack other victims they were able to view Microsoft source code through an employee account the company said.

Microsoft said that the hackers were unable to get into emails or its products and services and that they were not able to modify the source code they viewed. It did not say how long hackers were inside its networks or which products’ source code had been viewed. Microsoft had initially said it was not breached in the attack.

“Our investigation into our own environment has found no evidence of access to production services or customer data” the company said in a blog post. “The investigation which is ongoing has also found no indications that our systems were used to attack others.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEvc29sYXJ3aW5kcy1oYWNrZXJzLWFjY2Vzc2VkLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1zb3VyY2UtY29kZS10aGUtY29tcGFueS1zYXlzLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wMS8wMS9zb2xhcndpbmRzLWhhY2tlcnMtYWNjZXNzZWQtbWljcm9zb2Z0LXNvdXJjZS1jb2RlLXRoZS1jb21wYW55LXNheXMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SolarWinds hackers accessed Microsoft source code the company says,"The hacking group behind the SolarWinds compromise was able to break into Microsoft and access some of its source code Microsoft said on Thursday something experts said sent a worrying signal about the spies' ambition.

Source code — the underlying set of instructions that run a piece of software or operating system— is typically among a technology company's most closely guarded secrets and Microsoft has historically been particularly careful about protecting it.

It is not clear how much or what parts of Microsoft's source code repositories the hackers were able to access but the disclosure suggests that the hackers who used software company SolarWinds as a springboard to break into sensitive U.S. government networks also had an interest in discovering the inner workings of Microsoft products as well.

Microsoft had already disclosed that like other firms it found malicious versions of SolarWinds' software inside its network but the source code disclosure — made in a blog post — is new. After Reuters reported it was breached two weeks ago Microsoft said it had not ""found any evidence of access to production services.""

Three people briefed on the matter said Microsoft had known for days that the source code had been accessed. A Microsoft spokesman said security employees had been working ""around the clock"" and that ""when there is actionable information to share they have published and shared it.""

The SolarWinds hack is among the most ambitious cyber operations ever disclosed compromising at least half-a-dozen federal agencies and potentially thousands of companies and other institutions. U.S. and private sector investigators have spent the holidays combing through logs to try to understand whether their data has been stolen or modified.

Modifying source code — which Microsoft said the hackers did not do — could have potentially disastrous consequences given the ubiquity of Microsoft products which include the Office productivity suite and the Windows operating system. But experts said that even just being able to review the code could offer hackers insight that might help them subvert Microsoft products or services.

""The source code is the architectural blueprint of how the software is built"" said Andrew Fife of Israel-based Cycode a source code protection company.

""If you have the blueprint it's far easier to engineer attacks.""

Matt Tait an independent cybersecurity researcher agreed that the source code could be used as a roadmap to help hack Microsoft products but he also cautioned that elements of the company's source code were already widely shared - for example with foreign governments. He said he doubted that Microsoft had made the common mistake of leaving cryptographic keys or passwords in the code.

""It's not going to affect the security of their customers at least not substantially"" Tait said.

Microsoft noted that it allows broad internal access to its code and former employees agreed that it is more open than other companies.

In its blog post Microsoft said it had found no evidence of access ""to production services or customer data.""

""The investigation which is ongoing has also found no indications that our systems were used to attack others"" it said.

Reuters reported a week ago that Microsoft-authorized resellers were hacked and their access to productivity programs inside targets leveraged in attempts to read email. Microsoft acknowledged some vendor access was misused but has not said how many resellers or customers may have been breached.

There was no response to requests for comment from the FBI which is investigating the hacking campaign or from the Department of Homeland Security's Cybsersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

U.S. officials have attributed the SolarWinds hacking campaign to Russia an allegation the Kremlin denies.

Both Tait and Ronen Slavin Cycode's chief technology officer said a key unanswered question was which source code repositories were accessed. Microsoft has a huge range of products from widely used Windows to lesser known software such as social networking app Yammer and the design app Sway.

Slavin said he was worried by the possibility that the SolarWinds hackers were poring over Microsoft's source code as prelude to a much more ambitious offensive.

""To me the biggest question is 'Was this recon for the next big operation?'"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bWVycmVwb3J0cy5vcmcvZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MtY29tcHV0ZXJzL2xhcHRvcHMtY2hyb21lYm9va3MvYmVzdC1taWNyb3NvZnQtc3VyZmFjZS1sYXB0b3AtZm9yLXlvdS1hOTMwMzU4OTE5MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's the Best Microsoft Surface Laptop for You?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics-computers/laptops-chromebooks/best-microsoft-surface-laptop-for-you-a9303589191/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bWVycmVwb3J0cy5vcmcvZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MtY29tcHV0ZXJzL2xhcHRvcHMtY2hyb21lYm9va3MvYmVzdC1taWNyb3NvZnQtc3VyZmFjZS1sYXB0b3AtZm9yLXlvdS1hOTMwMzU4OTE5MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L2hvdy10by1kb3dubG9hZC10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LXdpbmRvd3MtMTAtaXNvLWZyb20tbWljcm9zb2Z0L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L2hvdy10by1kb3dubG9hZC10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LXdpbmRvd3MtMTAtaXNvLWZyb20tbWljcm9zb2Z0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to download the latest Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft,"When a new version of Windows 10 is released Microsoft also releases new ISO disk images of the operating system to perform clean installs or create a bootable recovery environment. This article provides two ways you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO images from Microsoft.

An ISO image is a sector-by-sector copy of the Windows DVD stored as a single '.iso' file on your computer. You can then burn this ISO file onto another DVD create a bootable USB drive mount it as a drive letter in Windows or extract its files using 7-Zip.

ISO images are handy as they allow you to create bootable media that can be used as a recovery environment for troubleshooting or performing clean installs of the latest Windows 10. You can also use them to make Windows 10 virtual machines using Hyper-V VirtualBox or VMware.

Microsoft recommends using their Windows 10 Media Creation Tool (MCT) to download the latest ISO image or create a bootable USB drive.

This article will show you how to use the MCT to download the latest ISO or trick Microsoft's site into letting you download the ISO images directly instead.

Method 1: Use the Media Creation Tool to create an ISO

Microsoft offers a tool called the Media Creation Tool that lets you download the latest Windows 10 ISO to a file or burn it to a USB drive.

To use the Media Creation Tool to get the latest ISO please follow these steps:

Visit the Windows 10 download page using your web browser. Under 'Create Windows 10 installation media' click on the 'Download tool now' link and save the executable. At the time of this writing the MCT executable is named MediaCreationTool20H2.exe. Once downloaded run the program and Windows will prompt you for permission to allow it to run. At this prompt click Yes and the MCT will load and prepare a few things before it can proceed. When done you will be shown a license agreement. To continue click on the Accept button. The tool will now state it is 'Getting a few things ready' and when done display a prompt asking if you would like to upgrade the computer or 'Create installation media (USB flash drive DVD or ISO file) for another PC. At this prompt select the Create installation media option and then press the Next button. The Media Creation Tool will now download and verify the necessary files to create an ISO or a bootable USB drive. This process can take some time so please be patient. When done the MCT will ask what language architecture and Windows edition you want for your ISO image. By default the MCT will use your local language and architecture but you can uncheck Use the recommended options for this PC checkbox to select other options.



When done click on the Next button. You will now be asked if you wish to create a bootable USB drive or a Windows 10 ISO. As we are creating an ISO file select the ISO file option and press Next. You will now be prompted to select a location to save your ISO file. Select a folder to save the ISO file to and then click on the Save button. The Media Creation Tool will now create the ISO file in the specified location. Please be patient while the file is created. When the Media Creation Tool has finished creating the ISO you can close the program by clicking on the Finish button.

You will now have the latest Windows 10 ISO image file saved to your folder which can be used for virtual machines or to create bootable media at a later date.

Method 2: Download the latest Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft

When you go to Microsoft's ""Download Windows 10"" page you are only given the option to update to a new version using Windows Update or to using the Microsoft Windows 10 Media Creation Tool.

However it is possible to trick Microsoft's Windows 10 download page into offering an ISO image instead by changing your browser's user agent to a non-Windows operating system.

To download the latest Windows 10 ISO image please follow these steps:

Go to the Windows 10 download page in any Chromium-based browser such as Chrome or the new Microsoft Edge. Click on the Chrome menu then More Tools and then click on Developer tools as shown below. Now press the Ctrl + Shift + M keyboard combination to open the Device toolbar. This toolbar lets you impersonate another device such as a mobile phone or a tablet. When switching to another device it also changes the browser's user agent which the website uses to identify a visitor's operating system.



Click on the menu that shows Responsive and select iPad or iPad Pro so that you can view the page better. When you first select one of these devices the screen size will be set to 50%. Please change it to 100% as shown below so that you can see the web page better. Now press the F5 key on your keyboard to refresh the page and Microsoft's site will now offer you the Windows 10 ISO instead of the Media Creation Tool.



Now click on the drop-down arrow under 'Select edition' and select the 'Windows 10' option under the name of the latest feature update. At the time of this article's writing the latest version is Windows 10 20H2 otherwise known as the Windows 10 October 2020 Update.



Once selected click on the Confirm button. After a few seconds Microsoft's site will now ask you to select your ISO's product language. Select your language and press the Confirm button again. Finally you will be asked whether you want to download a 32-bit or 64-bit version of the Windows 10 ISO. Most people want to download the 64-bit version of Windows 10. When you click on the download button you will be asked what folder you wish to save the ISO file as shown below. After selecting the folder to save the ISO click on the Save button to download it. The current ISO image is 5.8 GB so it may take some time to download depending on your Internet connection speed.

The ISO download link generated by Microsoft's site will remain valid for 24 hours and be shared with other people during that time frame. After 24 hours the link will no longer work and you will need to create a new one again using the above steps.

What should you do with the ISO?

Now that you have a copy of the latest Windows 10 ISO image you may be wondering what you should do with it.

This ISO image can now be mounted in virtual machines to upgrade a Windows installation or install a new one. You can also extract the ISO file to find a particular Windows system file.

Finally you can use the ISO image and a free utility like Rufus or Universal USB Installer to create a bootable Windows 10 USB drive.

However if the goal was to create bootable media it would have been easier to have the Media Creation Tool make it for you as explained in the steps above.

Once you create a bootable Windows 10 USB drive or Windows 10 DVD you can use it to perform a clean install of Windows 10. A clean install is when you completely reformat a PC and reinstall Windows 10 so you have a clean installation of the operating system without any additional software or drivers.

Another common use for bootable Windows 10 USB drives is that they can be used as a recovery environment to remove malware and troubleshoot Windows 10 crashes bugs and freezes.

Windows 10 Recovery Environment

For either purpose you need a spare USB drive that can be used to create the bootable Windows 10 USB media.

If you do not have a spare USB drive you can purchase a 32GB Sandisk drive for about $8.99 or a 5-pack of 64GB USB drives for $24 on Amazon.

BleepingComputer strongly recommends that every Windows user creates bootable Windows 10 USB media that can be used for troubleshooting.

We have used the Windows 10 Recovery Environment many times in the past to troubleshoot problems in Windows. Having the bootable USB Windows media available can save a lot of frustration when your PC is not working correctly.

Update 1/2/2021: Added info on using the MCT as well."

On December 18 2020 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) vaccine (ModernaTX Inc; Cambridge Massachusetts) a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). This vaccine is the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized under an EUA for the prevention of COVID-19 in the United States (2). Vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine consists of 2 doses (100 μg 0.5 mL each) administered intramuscularly 1 month (4 weeks) apart. On December 19 2020 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation* for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥18 years for the prevention of COVID-19. To guide its deliberations regarding the vaccine ACIP employed the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework† using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.§ Use of all COVID-19 vaccines authorized under an EUA including the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should be implemented in conjunction with ACIP’s interim recommendations for allocating initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccines (3). The ACIP recommendation for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine under EUA is interim and will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Since June 2020 ACIP has convened 10 public meetings to review data on the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the potential use of COVID-19 vaccines including the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (4). Within the EtR Framework ACIP considered the importance of the public health problem of COVID-19 as well as resource use benefits and harms patients’ values and preferences acceptability feasibility and equity for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. To inform the EtR Framework the COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group comprising experts in infectious diseases vaccinology vaccine safety public health and ethics held 28 meetings to review COVID-19 surveillance data evidence for vaccine efficacy and safety and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines including the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. After a systematic review of available data the Work Group used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to the vaccine rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty) (5). Work Group conclusions regarding certainty of evidence for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were presented to ACIP at public meetings.

The body of evidence for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was primarily informed by one large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial that enrolled approximately 30000 participants aged 18–95 years (median = 52 years) (6–9). Interim findings from this clinical trial using data from participants with a median of 2 months of follow-up indicate that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine efficacy after 2 doses was 94.1% (95% confidence interval = 89.3%–96.8%) in preventing symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among persons without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection which was the primary study endpoint. High efficacy (≥86%) was observed across age sex race and ethnicity categories and among persons with underlying medical conditions. Ten hospitalizations due to COVID-19 were documented; nine in the placebo group and one in the vaccine group (9). Preliminary data suggest that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine might also provide some protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (7). Among vaccine recipients reactogenicity symptoms defined as solicited local injection site or systemic adverse reactions during the 7 days after vaccination were frequent but mostly mild to moderate. Systemic adverse reactions were more commonly reported after the second dose than after the first dose and were more frequent and severe in persons aged 18–64 years than in those aged ≥65 years. Most local and systemic adverse reactions occurred within the first 1–2 days after vaccine receipt and resolved in a median of 2–3 days. Severe local or systemic adverse reactions (grade ≥3 reactions¶) occurred more commonly in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients (21.6% versus 4.4%). Among vaccine recipients 9.1% reported a grade ≥3 local injection site reaction and 16.5% reported a grade ≥3 systemic adverse reaction. The frequency of serious adverse events** observed was low in both the vaccine (1.0%) and placebo (1.0%) recipients and without meaningful imbalances for specific serious adverse events between the two groups (8). No specific safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age race ethnicity underlying medical conditions or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. A detailed summary of safety data including information on reactogenicity is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html.

From the GRADE evidence assessment the level of certainty for the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was type 1 (high certainty) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19. Evidence was type 2 (moderate certainty) for the estimate of prevention of COVID-19–associated hospitalization and type 4 (very low certainty) for the estimates of prevention of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and all-cause death. Data on COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths are limited at this time; however a vaccine that effectively prevents symptomatic infection is expected to also prevent associated hospitalizations and deaths. Regarding certainty of evidence related to possible harms after vaccination evidence was type 2 (moderate certainty) for the estimate of serious adverse events and type 1 (high certainty) for the estimate of reactogenicity. Data reviewed within the EtR Framework supported the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. ACIP determined that COVID-19 is a major public health problem and that use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is a reasonable and efficient allocation of resources. Whereas there might be uncertainty about how all populations value the vaccine it was determined that for most populations the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects making the vaccine acceptable to implementation stakeholders. In addition implementation of administration of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is feasible. Although the vaccine requires a freezer (–20oC [–4oF]) for long-term storage it is stable at refrigerator temperatures (2–8oC [35–46oF]) for up to 30 days after thawing. This characteristic will facilitate feasibility of administration of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in most community settings once supply allows. Advancing health equity however will require efforts to identify and reduce access-related barriers to vaccination as well as engagement with community organizations and leaders among groups who experience disproportionate COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality and to expand access to clear and accurate information on COVID-19 vaccines (10). The GRADE evidence profile and supporting evidence for the EtR Framework are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-moderna-vaccine.html and https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-moderna-etr.html.

Before vaccination the EUA Fact Sheet (11) should be provided to recipients and caregivers. Providers should counsel Moderna COVID-19 vaccine recipients about expected local and systemic reactogenicity. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is not interchangeable with other COVID-19 vaccine products; the safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series have not been evaluated. ACIP does not state a product preference; a person may receive any recommended COVID-19 vaccine series. However persons should complete the series with the same COVID-19 product they received for the first dose.

Channel 12 News cited a senior official in contact with medical firms as saying a deal had not yet been reached to get new doses to Israel early.

The report said a battle is being waged within pharma companies between professionals and board members: While scientists want to speed up deliveries to Israel hoping to use its advanced and efficient healthcare system as a proving ground for the vaccines management is concerned about complaints from other countries that the Jewish state is getting unfair preferential treatment. They reportedly fear this will hurt them later down the road in larger more lucrative markets.

Channel 12 and Channel 13 both said Israeli officials were engaged in a pressure campaign to convince the companies to prioritize Israel.

Unless there is a breakthrough the country is expected to hold back on administering further first doses for several days while focusing on providing second doses to those who’ve already received their first shot.

The network said Health Ministry officials believe the delay will at any rate be short and that by the end of the month at-risk populations will be taken care of and the entire public will be able to begin vaccinating.

On Thursday Channel 12 reported that one million vaccines from Moderna will arrive in Israel next week rather than in March as had previously been agreed boosting dwindling supplies.

The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the report. “We would like to clarify that as of now we don’t have information about Moderna’s intention to move up the delivery of millions of vaccines to Israel” the ministry said in a statement.

Later the network cited sources in Moderna as insisting the shipment was ready and that its departure was only a matter of final approval. The report said Moderna officials were “surprised” at the ministry’s apparent denial.

The Moderna vaccine has not yet been used in Israel as part of its immunization program. The Health Ministry has not officially announced its approval for use in the country but is expected to do so after the FDA okayed it for emergency use in the US.

Israel has reached a pace of 150000 vaccine injections every day for the past several days and on Friday officially passed one million vaccinations or some 11 percent of its population — far and away the world leader in vaccinations per capita.

The mass vaccination drive started at the beginning of last week and has so far focused mainly on healthcare workers those aged over 60 and at-risk groups.

Its globe-leading vaccination drive has been attributed to various factors including its relatively small but densely packed population and highly professional community-integrated health services.

Israel is also currently in its third nationwide lockdown to contain the outbreak. It has reported more than 428000 cases and 3356 deaths since the pandemic began.

The drive currently uses the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination which requires two shots spread three weeks apart. The Moderna vaccine is also a two-shot inoculation.

Though not yet available to the general public some vaccination centers have been opening their doors to anyone who comes at the end of each day in an effort to make sure vaccine units available for immediate use do not go to waste. So far some 41% of over 60-year-olds have had their first shot according to Health Ministry figures released Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmluc3VsYWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9zZXF1aW0tZmlyc3QtcmVzcG9uZGVycy1yZWNlaXZlLW1vZGVybmEtdmFjY2luZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sequim first responders receive Moderna vaccine,"Nurse Kelly Bower with the Jamestown Family Health Clinic gives a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to Capt.

SEQUIM — Some Sequim-area first responders received their first of two vaccinations for COVID-19 this week.

Staff with Jamestown Family Health Clinic provided the Moderna vaccine at the Clallam County Fire District 3 headquarters for fire district staff and volunteers Olympic Ambulance employees and Sequim Police Department staff.

Blaine Zechenelly a volunteer EMT and disaster planner and volunteer EMT Sandy Boudrou were the first to receive the vaccine.

Zechenelly said he’s not in the high-risk category for the virus and is relatively healthy but with a grand-baby on the way he said he wants to be safe and also able to help the Sequim community if needed.

“If I want to take care of the community I want to get it” he said. “If (the virus spreads quickly) then I’ll be one of the people who can help.”

Capt. Derrell Sharp the fire district’s medical safety officer said Brent Simcosky director of health services at the clinic reached out to him about two weeks ago about potential vaccinations availability and on Christmas Eve asked to set up dates this week.

Sharp sent out information about the vaccinations in recent weeks; vaccinations are voluntary for staff he noted.

Of 110 volunteer career and non-emergency staffers 39 signed up for a vaccine he said.

“I think the numbers will increase” Sharp said.

“I’m getting it because I’m going into homes of the most vulnerable people and I don’t want to contribute to the spread.”

Second doses are scheduled 28 days apart from the first medical officials said.

Sharp said the district tried to schedule vaccinations so the second doses are on the different shifts’ last working days in case they experienced side effects from the second dose such as headaches and/or fevers.

When asked for comment about why they opted not to take the vaccine some fire officials chose not to comment or were unavailable.

Sharp said many fire staff weren’t against it outright but they’d like to wait.

Fire district staff can change their mind to receive or not to receive the vaccine he said and personnel also can schedule with Jamestown for one.

Dr. Molly Martin deputy medical director for the Jamestown Family Health Clinic said the clinic received the Moderna vaccination because it doesn’t require strict storage temperatures.

Last week health and eye clinic staffers were given the option to take the vaccination she said.

“I understand the fear of unknowns” Martin said. “The vaccine has been developed under sound medical research.”

She said the theory behind mRNA (Messenger RNA) vaccines — some of the first COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States — has been around for more than 20 years.

Simcosky said Jamestown Family Health Clinic will tentatively begin community vaccinations at two locations the week of Jan. 11 for residents ages 75 and older with more details to come.

Sharp said he believes after reading the vaccines’ studies he feels “no corners were cut” and that getting a vaccine “seems like the right thing to do.”

Zechenelly said people should consult a primary care physician first to see if there are any issues with taking the vaccine.

Medical officials said clinic trials have the Moderna vaccine at about 94 percent effective.

Mondelēz International’s commitment to sustainability is one of the reasons why Marcelo now a Senior Business Development Manager has stayed with the company for more than a decade. Starting out as a process engineer he has taken advantage of opportunities to move into more strategic management roles and to gain international experience as he explains here…

Why Did You Decide to Switch from Engineering to Management?

I studied mechanical engineering in my home country of Brazil and during my studies I did an internship at Bosch. I also have a post-graduation degree in strategic management.

I joined Mondelēz International in 2008 as a trainee on a one-year rotational program so I saw all the areas of the company and the different functions. My first job was process engineering. I met a lot of people inside the Curitiba plant in Brazil and realized that I could also have a management career.

I thought I could have more impact on people's families and lives so I changed from pure engineering to people management. I was promoted to manufacturing section manager with a team of people reporting to me. That combined projects and technical work with contact with people.

I stayed in the role for four more years. My responsibility was to guarantee that all the Easter and Variety Box products inside the chocolate plant were being produced properly with respect to specifications quality and safety. There were more than 1000 people in my team with 20 reporting directly to me and the rest reporting into them.

What Happened Next?

I was invited to go to our headquarters in Sao Paulo to take over a business development function. This was a good way for a person coming from the plant to adapt to the business. The role is to translate to the plant what the commercial teams want in terms of product future capacity and capabilities – to guarantee the necessary investment to fulfil the future. I was able to use my technical knowledge of the plant and the relationships I’d developed over the years. It was useful for my development too because I got in touch with marketing sales finance and so on.

That was four years ago in Sao Paulo and now with recent restructuring I was invited to come as an expat to Argentina where the business unit includes Uruguay and Paraguay. It's the same business development job but I'm gaining international experience. It's a country with a complex and different economic situation so I think it's a win-win for the company and for me. I’m enjoying it a lot.

In Brazil I was working mainly with chocolate. Now I'm responsible for all the categories that we sell in the region including chocolate biscuits gums candies powder beverages and meals.

We’re very successful in these countries and have number one brands in almost every category; you see our products everywhere. I have a team of 11 people divided into different categories along the lines of the brands.

So What Do You Do Day to Day?

My role is 70% strategic and 30% hands on because we are the brain of supply chain. We discuss the future with the commercial teams and talk to engineering and manufacturing about what we need to do in the plant. A good percentage of the work is a daily follow-up to make sure that everybody is doing what we planned.

What's the Culture Like at Mondelēz International?

""Mondelēz International is very dynamic. We try to adapt the company to what is happening in the market and in the world. If you are a person who doesn't like change and wants a stable job it is probably not the best place for you to be. But if you'd like to be challenged constantly and to involve yourself in a lot of things this is the right company for sure.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81Mjg2Ni1zbGlkZXNob3ctd2hhdHMtbmV3LWZyb20tbW9uZGVsZXota2VsbG9nZy1mcml0by1sYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slideshow: What's new from Mondelez Kellogg Frito-Lay,"KANSAS CITY — Food manufacturers are opting for familiarity adding new offerings under their mainstay brands.

Mondelez International Inc. is adding a new Oreo variety to the brand’s permanent lineup: Java Chip. The sandwich cookies feature coffee flavored crème with chocolate chips sandwiched between two chocolate wafers. Each two-cookie serving contains 140 calories less than 1 gram of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

Kellogg Co. expanded its Raisin Bran brand with new Kellogg’s Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey. The cereal features bran flakes and raisins paired with whole grain toasted oats and a touch of honey. Each 1-cup serving contains 190 calories 5 grams of fiber 4 grams of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

“As a classic cereal staple we're always looking to innovate and deliver new experiences to our dedicated Kellogg's Raisin Bran fans” said Erin Storm senior marketing director of Kellogg All Family Cereal. “Just like the original cereal Kellogg's Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey is a heart-healthy option and makes for an irresistible flavor combination — combining our signature bran flakes and juicy raisins with whole grain oats and a hint of honey.”

PepsiCo Inc.’s Frito-Lay business is debuting Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix which combines traditional Cheetos with Cheetos Popcorn. Each 1-cup serving contains 160 calories 1 grams of protein and 1 gram of sugar.

“2020 was a year unlike any other in that we saw the incredibly popular introduction of Cheetos Popcorn in January quickly followed by world-changing events that affected every industry differently” said Rachel Ferdinando senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Frito-Lay North America. “For our brands we saw trends like Cheetos recipe searches skyrocketing 190%. So now we’re thinking with that lens through everything we introduce to the world. Hopefully Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix can provide a small moment of joy and bring a few smiles this year.”

While Mondelēz International is keen to attract specialists we are also looking for people who have other interests and want to broaden their horizons through different activities. One such all-rounder is Seena a finance manager who writes a blog because she likes to do non-finance things outside of work. Here is her career story…

What is Your Background?

I achieved a bachelor's degree in Commerce and an MBA in Finance from Bombay University in my home country of India. Thereafter I started my professional career with Citi Group in Mumbai; then worked for a GCC based jewelry group in their Corporate office in Dubai before taking a break to pursue a Master’s in Accounting and Finance at London School of Economics.

I was approached by Mondelēz International and I found it very interesting because it offered international exposure in the exciting FMCG industry. I joined in their Dubai office in 2009 and have since then moved through various functions within Mondelez gaining rich experience along the way.

What Attracted You to Mondelēz International?

Mondelēz International has been amazing for a lot of reasons. I've had the opportunity to interact with people from different cultures and to make many friends. There is also a remarkable legacy of brands associated with the company – every brand has its own identity in the market. As it is a global company I've had the opportunity to work in local and regional roles which I've thoroughly enjoyed.

It’s a very friendly place to work. Regardless of your level you are treated with respect. I’ve had many mentors who have patiently coached me along my journey here. At every point I’ve always kept my managers informed about what I want to do next. I’ve been fortunate enough to move roles every two or three years and learn new things.

What Roles Have You Held?

I joined in the Growth Markets business based out of Dubai doing Financial Planning and Analysis.

Thereafter I moved into a regional category finance role covering Eastern Europe the Middle East and Africa (EEMEA). It was a significant challenge involving lots of new learnings and senior stakeholder management.

In 2015 I moved to supply chain finance to become a Procurement Finance Controller. I had very limited prior experience in this function so had to learn everything on the job. I business partnered with the Senior Procurement Director and was the one point of contact for EEMEA procurement also interacting with global procurement functions.

Mid 2016 I became the MEA sales controller for a newly formed cluster within the region. I did that for two years interacting with the sales controllers in all the countries coordinating the business plans analysis and reporting and presenting to top management.

Thereafter I wanted to gain experience in an operational market role so in January this year I started working as a commercial finance controller for the Gulf and Growth Markets business.

What Does Your Job Now Involve?

In commercial finance no two days are the same. A good chunk of my time is spent in discussions with my various stakeholders running simulations and feasibility analyses to help them plan the business. I am also involved in discussions with various functional teams to help them see things from a financial point of view. Presentations to senior management financial analysis and reporting and coaching/mentoring my team are other aspects of my role.

Have You Faced Challenges Because You are Female?

Quite often I’ve found myself as the only woman in a room full of men. But I think that empowers me.

I've had managers who have given me the power to take my own decisions about how I manage my work and my career. Mondelēz International has been very accommodating.

I have been impressed by the lack of ‘presenteeism’ because all my managers have given me flexibility as a working mum. In fact there are quite a few women around the company who are managing very well but it ultimately depends on the team you work with and your manager. I've been fortunate enough to work with people who have confidence in me who trust that the tasks assigned to me will be done.

We want to promote diversity and inclusion but you wouldn't be able to do that if you didn't offer flexibility towards working women. Flexibility is the key to diversity and inclusion.

What Do You Do Outside Work?

When I go home it's to my second full-time job with my boys aged 2.5 and 6.5 years and of course my husband! We also have a nanny who's been with us a long time and is very much part of the family.

I love travelling photography and eating out. So in my spare time I write a food & travel blog based on my experiences. I prefer doing non-finance things outside of work.",,,,,,

Source code — the underlying set of instructions that run a piece of software or operating system— is typically among a technology company's most closely guarded secrets and Microsoft has historically been particularly careful about protecting it.

It is not clear how much or what parts of Microsoft's source code repositories the hackers were able to access but the disclosure suggests that the hackers who used software company SolarWinds as a springboard to break into sensitive U.S. government networks also had an interest in discovering the inner workings of Microsoft products as well.

Microsoft had already disclosed that like other firms it found malicious versions of SolarWinds' software inside its network but the source code disclosure — made in a blog post — is new. After Reuters reported it was breached two weeks ago Microsoft said it had not ""found any evidence of access to production services.""

Three people briefed on the matter said Microsoft had known for days that the source code had been accessed. A Microsoft spokesman said security employees had been working ""around the clock"" and that ""when there is actionable information to share they have published and shared it.""

The SolarWinds hack is among the most ambitious cyber operations ever disclosed compromising at least half-a-dozen federal agencies and potentially thousands of companies and other institutions. U.S. and private sector investigators have spent the holidays combing through logs to try to understand whether their data has been stolen or modified.

Modifying source code — which Microsoft said the hackers did not do — could have potentially disastrous consequences given the ubiquity of Microsoft products which include the Office productivity suite and the Windows operating system. But experts said that even just being able to review the code could offer hackers insight that might help them subvert Microsoft products or services.

""The source code is the architectural blueprint of how the software is built"" said Andrew Fife of Israel-based Cycode a source code protection company.

""If you have the blueprint it's far easier to engineer attacks.""

Matt Tait an independent cybersecurity researcher agreed that the source code could be used as a roadmap to help hack Microsoft products but he also cautioned that elements of the company's source code were already widely shared - for example with foreign governments. He said he doubted that Microsoft had made the common mistake of leaving cryptographic keys or passwords in the code.

""It's not going to affect the security of their customers at least not substantially"" Tait said.

Microsoft noted that it allows broad internal access to its code and former employees agreed that it is more open than other companies.

In its blog post Microsoft said it had found no evidence of access ""to production services or customer data.""

""The investigation which is ongoing has also found no indications that our systems were used to attack others"" it said.

Reuters reported a week ago that Microsoft-authorized resellers were hacked and their access to productivity programs inside targets leveraged in attempts to read email. Microsoft acknowledged some vendor access was misused but has not said how many resellers or customers may have been breached.

There was no response to requests for comment from the FBI which is investigating the hacking campaign or from the Department of Homeland Security's Cybsersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

U.S. officials have attributed the SolarWinds hacking campaign to Russia an allegation the Kremlin denies.

Both Tait and Ronen Slavin Cycode's chief technology officer said a key unanswered question was which source code repositories were accessed. Microsoft has a huge range of products from widely used Windows to lesser known software such as social networking app Yammer and the design app Sway.

Slavin said he was worried by the possibility that the SolarWinds hackers were poring over Microsoft's source code as prelude to a much more ambitious offensive.

""To me the biggest question is 'Was this recon for the next big operation?'"" he said.",,,,,,,,,

It’s Time to Scale MT SAAS,"By Jeremy Schwartz CFA Global Head of Research; Kara Marciscano CFA Senior Research Analyst

Technology experts at Bessemer Venture Partners have released a new report detailing why the FAANG stocks (Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix and Google) that so aptly portrayed technology market leadership over the last decade are facing a potential trend change.

The FAANGs benefited from the dual macro trends of the last two decades relating to the Internet and mobile adoption.

FAANG stocks outperformed major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Indexes by a significant margin of at least 14% annualized since 2010.[1]

Byron Deeter and Mary D’Onofrio believe the FAANG stocks’ best growth years are behind them raising serious questions about the future of the group’s premier status.

Nearly constant evolution in the technology industry presents new opportunities for potential outperformance if you are looking in the right spots.

Cloud computing is the mega-trend of the next decade.

Deeter and D’Onofrio write[2]:

Technology is increasingly driving global GDP and software is the fastest growing segment of technology. Within software the growth of cloud is moving at an impressive clip; it’s becoming abundantly clear that cloud computing will become a majority of enterprise software by 2025 and the vast majority of all software by 2030. Simply put cloud computing is increasingly consuming software hardware and services and is therefore the most exciting mega-trend in technology making it one of the most compelling themes impacting global GDP over the coming years.

The Bessemer-Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index (EMCLOUD) serves as a benchmark for the public cloud software market…

Even within this high performing basket of market disruptors the companies leading the pack in this race of market performance are starting to emerge. We believe that more than a dozen companies within this elite public basket will become long term market leaders; however four are top contenders—Salesforce Adobe Shopify and Twilio.

Microsoft and Amazon are the two additional companies to follow within the broader tech industry considering both how quickly they’ve embraced cloud computing and how fundamental cloud is to their growth strategy.

Bessemer thinks it is time to supplement FAANG as the default tech leaders with a new group of technology stocks that is well positioned to outperform in the cloud-first world: MT SAAS which is Microsoft Twilio Salesforce Amazon Adobe and Shopify.

Bessemer writes “MT SAAS is a mix of application (CRM ADBE SHOP) and infrastructure (MSFT TWLO AMZN) companies incumbent giants (MSFT AMZN) and hypergrowth challengers (CRM ADBE SHOP TWLO) all sharing the same characteristics of cloud delivery models cloud business models high growth and compelling long-term margin potential.”

The pandemic of 2020 accelerated adoption of cloud computing and Bessemer believes we are amid a major technology dislocation. WisdomTree agrees with this conclusion: the most promising technology stocks are defined by the MT SAAS basket: Microsoft Twilio Salesforce Adobe Amazon and Shopify.

Netflix started as a DVD rental company… | by Erima Goyal,"Datafication and personalization

Netflix started as a DVD rental company more than 20 years back. With personalization at its core Netflix recommended and mailed DVDs to its customers. Back then its personalization algorithms had very few data points — the past rental history length of the time a DVD was held and maybe some additional demographics information.

Fast-forwarding to the time when Netflix launched a streaming service it plunged into datafication of user behavior capturing the customer browsing history the points where a customer pressed forward rewind or pause the titles added to wish list and so on. Netflix has divided its customers into a few thousand micro clusters that are essentially taste communities and each individual might be part of multiple taste communities. This datafication in the modern streaming and internet world helped Netflix better understand its customers to provide a more personalized experience - a customized homepage for each customer and a hyper-personalized “Recommended for you” and “Because you watched the ABC title”.

La Casa de Papel aka Money Heist

Image from Unsplash

La Casa de Papel a crime thriller was created and telecasted in Spain back in 2017 placing it for a strong start with a prime time slot. However the viewership declined consistently over its first two-season run with the show being summarized as a flop in Spain.

In Dec 2017 Netflix bought international streaming rights for La Casa de Papel dubbed it into English renamed it to Money Heist and placed it into its catalog of numerous other foreign-language shows. Money Heist was launched on Netflix without any promotion simply subject to the mercy of algorithms possibly with the right tags and classification. This is where folks like myself with an affinity for crime thrillers had Money Heist added to the Netflix recommendation list.

In parallel in early 2018 the show's actors started observing an unusual phenomenon on their Instagram profiles — their followers were just climbing and the actors were not anonymous anymore. Within four months of its global launch the show became the most-watched foreign-language series on Netflix and the show was renewed for another two seasons in April 2018 with a significantly higher budget. Needless to say the next two seasons were received with immense pleasure by fans with 34M watching it in the first week of its launch.

How it happened — the science of recommendation systems

What happened here is pure data science and machine learning. Netflix published this show with tags such as “TV thriller Suspense Exciting.” Some other shows with similar tags include Prison Break Narcos Breaking Bad. In its microclusters Netflix would have identified customers who like TV thrillers and Money Heist started showing up on their recommendation list. With more people watching the show and providing great reviews the show jumped up the recommendations. With all the datafication classification and clustering that Netflix had done on its customers the show was recommended to the right cluster of customers. I will be writing a detailed article on recommendation systems later.

The future — data integration across companies

If in a hypothetical situation Netflix and Instagram were to come together and leverage each other’s datafication outcomes both could create extra value for their respective customers. Instagram with the knowledge of Netflix’s clusters could propose new connections show similar advertisements to the customers in one cluster and so on.

Netflix can identify who are the actors its customers have liked/followed on Instagram and then use the pictures of these popular actors as thumbnails on different titles a customized picture for each customer to gain quick attention. If on my Instagram I have followed Álvaro Morte (the Professor in Money Heist) then his picture would show up on Mirage as a thumbnail in my Netflix recommendations.

Now if Netflix were to create a new thriller as it is creating its own content these days it would identify through Instagram the popular thriller genre actors amongst its targeted viewer base. Bingo! Netflix has the cast for its next production.

Summary

Data is the new oil! More data better algorithms and better products leading to more data creation — the flywheel continues to support business model innovation and value creation for the customers. Companies have to venture on a datafication journey which is systematically extracting data from activities and transactions that are naturally ongoing in the business establishing data pipelines that enable large volumes of data with high velocity while capturing enough variety. Companies like Google and Amazon have gotten to their current status not only through world-class products but through in-depth knowledge of their customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaGlkZGVuLWdlbS1uZXRmbGl4LW11c3Qtd2F0Y2gtMTcwMDAwMjM1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Hidden Gem on Netflix Is the Must-Watch Murder Mystery of the Month,"If you’ve already binge-watched all ten of Netflix’s top movies you may have stumbled upon the streaming service’s “Hidden Gem” category. That’s exactly where we found the 2018 movie Agatha and the Truth of Murder which is a cross between Death on the Nile and Enola Holmes.

The movie takes place in 1926 and follows famed crime writer Agatha Christie as she struggles to find inspiration for her writing. Everything changes when she meets a woman named Mabel Rogers who’s seeking answers about the mysterious death of her partner Florence Nightingale Shore (AKA Florence Nightingale’s goddaughter).

Though hesitant Christie agrees to investigate the case and launches an undercover operation. Meanwhile the nation is trying (and failing) to determine her whereabouts.

The trailer (see above) offers a glimpse of the cast which includes Ruth Bradley (Agatha Christie) Pippa Haywood (Mabel Rogers) Stacha Hicks (Florence Nightingale Shore) Ralph Ineson (Detective Inspector Dicks) Dean Andrews (Wade Miller) Bebe Cave (Daphne Miller) Amelia Rose Dell (Rosalind) Richard Doubleday (Postmaster Wilson) Derek Halligan (Mr. Todd) Blake Harrison (Travis Pickford) and Brian McCardie (Sir Hugh Persimmion).

Agatha and the Truth of Murder was directed by Terry Loane (Mickeybo and Me). Tom Dalton (Agatha and the Midnight Murders) wrote the script while Emily Dalton (Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar) Sebastian Cardwell (All Creatures Great and Small) and Chamoun Issa (Torvill & Dean) served as executive producers.

Here’s a recap of how the Netflix libraries look going into 2021 and how many titles are available on Netflix UK CA US and AU.

Before we begin please note that all data is based on the library as of the end of December 31st 2020. Huge thanks to Maft from NewonNetflix.info for help sourcing the article data.

Netflix Originals have grown to be an even bigger slice of the pie in 2020 and has ramped up significantly throughout the year but has tailed off towards the end given production woes due to COVID-19.

Netflix Originals are a growing majority of the Netflix Library

In February 2020 we reported that Netflix has surpassed (at least in the US) 1500 Netflix Originals and now fast forward 11 months there’s now over 2000 of them available. Back in February Netflix Originals made up 25% of the library total. Now that percentage is close to 35%. In March 2019 when there were just over 1000 Netflix Originals making up 20% of the library.

Which country has the most number of Netflix titles?

You can see here that while the Netflix US library has grown since January 2019 it’s not grown as quickly as other regions such as the UK Canada or Australia.

Netflix UK has had the biggest growth over the past two years with a net gain of 1065 titles. Netflix US had a net gain of 389 titles.

How many titles has Netflix lost in 2019 and 2020?

Although the net additions are up overall that doesn’t mean titles haven’t left the service. Here’s a breakdown of the gross additions and losses for each of the four English-speaking Netflix regions.

Netflix Australia an excellent 2020 though with a net gain of 832 titles.

Has the pandemic slowed additions?

One question you may have is whether or not the pandemic has been slowing additions to Netflix.

Here’s what the gross additions look like for 2019 and 2020 for Netflix USA. This includes both Netflix Original titles and licensed titles.

On just the Netflix Original side we haven’t seen a significant slowdown compared to 2019 yet. While Netflix hasn’t been immune to the effects of the pandemic on productions it has managed to plug the gaps by buying up “Originals” from elsewhere.

How the Netflix library numbers compare to competitors (in the US)

Let’s now compare how the Netflix US library currently stacks up against its competitors. We weren’t able to source an exact number for the Amazon Prime Video library but some sources put it at over 18000.

If you liked this breakdown of the Netflix library. We’ve done more in the past including working out that roughly 55% of Netflix’s library is comprised of English titles. We also tried earlier in the year to calculate how long it’d take to watch all of Netflix in March 2020. Both of these articles are slightly outdated but shouldn’t have changed too dramatically.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL2hpZ2hzY2hvb2wubGF0aW1lcy5jb20vZ3Jvc3Ntb250LW1pZGRsZS1jb2xsZWdlLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sL3Jldmlldy1uZXRmbGl4LWFuaW1hdGVkLXNlcmllcy10aGUtZHJhZ29uLXByaW5jZS1pcy1nZW5lcmljLWFuZC1kb2VzbnQtbGl2ZS11cC10by1pdHMtaHlwZS_SAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oaWdoc2Nob29sLmxhdGltZXMuY29tL2dyb3NzbW9udC1taWRkbGUtY29sbGVnZS1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9yZXZpZXctbmV0ZmxpeC1hbmltYXRlZC1zZXJpZXMtdGhlLWRyYWdvbi1wcmluY2UtaXMtZ2VuZXJpYy1hbmQtZG9lc250LWxpdmUtdXAtdG8taXRzLWh5cGUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Netflix animated series ‘The Dragon Prince’ is generic and doesn’t live up to its hype,"Author’s note: This review contains spoilers but I don’t recommend watching this show so I am not holding anything back.

I don’t write negative reviews very often so it’s a big deal that I’m reviewing something I didn’t like. After finishing “The Owl House I watched this show because I had heard a few ads for it on Spotify and thought it was worth a watch especially for the reported queer content. I quickly discovered “The Dragon Prince” was not “The Two Princes” the show that I had heard advertised and believed I was watching at first and was disappointed when I realized how straight the show was but I watched on. The plot was generic and the characters weren’t drawing me in but some of the jokes were good and I recognized the voice of “Avatar”’s Sokka so I felt like it had to be at least decent. And it was decent.

But then the Internet discovered I had seen the show as it always does and started recommending “Dragon Prince” content to me on YouTube. It was then that I discovered that people adore this show leaving me truly puzzled.

I then realized that the show was so popular that it has been renewed for four more seasons. Four! There are so many good Netflix shows that have been canceled like “Santa Clarita Diet” and “Tucca and Bertie” so I was genuinely angry to discover that this generic quest fic is getting seven seasons.

I have gotten over my anger (bring back “Santa Clarita Diet” Netflix I’m begging you) but am still confused about what fans see in this show. People are calling it the next “Avatar” and I cannot believe it. I’m not “Avatar”’s biggest fan (“The Legend of Korra” is better) but I can understand why people adore it so much.

“Avatar” has excellent writing phenomenal characters a unique premise grounded in Eastern culture and one of the best redemption arcs in fiction cartoon or otherwise. Although overhyped by some people it is a really great show that is genuinely deserving of its accolades.

This show is not “Avatar”. “Dragon Prince” will have seven seasons to surprise me and become excellent in the upcoming seasons but for right now it is just the same generic piece of quest fiction that I’ve been unimpressed by dozens of times.

“The Dragon Prince” is a Netflix original animated series that stars Ezran and Callum the young prince and older step-prince in the kingdom of Katolis. Many years before the story begins humans started using dark magic and were cast out of the kingdom of Xadia where the magical beings lived forming their own land in the magic-less section of the world. This is a decent backstory but it is very generic and portrays humans and elves as equally biased which I don’t mind because it is a little more realistic than the “humans evil magic good” we often see. However it taps into both-sides-ism which makes this backstory somewhat dated in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Despite the generic plot there are some things I liked. I like Rayla an assassin elf; she’s generic but fun and she definitely has the best lines in the show. I also liked many side-characters such as the 11-year-old queen most sun-elves the human baker the blind pirate and one illusion elf whose name is a pun. These are good characters not ruined by overexposure and writing quality. I’m especially fond of General Amaya the deaf sister of Katolis’s dead queen and her captor-turned-likely-girlfriend the sun-elf general and princess. Amaya being deaf is one of the only diverse aspects of the show which is unfortunate but it is really cool to see a deaf person in a cartoon without subtitles on her all the time and being a bad**s all at once.

However the main characters aren’t interesting or compelling. They have random plot arcs that spawn from nowhere and only are relevant for one or two episodes before fading like they never existed. One example is that Ezran suddenly can speak to animals a plot point seemingly added so he can talk to a wolf who is in two episodes. There’s also a very sudden and not-well-written romance between Callum and Rayla that sprung from nowhere and is so generic that I actively dislike it. Stop writing that any boy and girl who are friends must automatically date. It’s a tired premise that perpetuates unfair expectations on children.

The writing is also very uneven and took a very sudden dive in the middle of season 2. It was strange and largely unexplained and I had to pause the show and run it back to make sure I wasn’t missing a major plotline. With bad writing quality and in-story issues “The Dragon Prince” doesn’t have much to offer. It isn’t saved by its groundbreaking nature like “Steven Universe” or subversiveness like “Phineas and Ferb”. The show has very little diversity to offer viewers with three black characters (one of which is dead) and three out of four of their queer characters dying in the same episode they’re introduced. They took a big step back from “She-Ra” and “Kipo” here so I’m now disappointed in Netflix again.

There are so many good cartoons to watch right now and you don’t need to watch this one. Instead watch “Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts” or “She-Ra and the Princesses of Power” or “BoJack Horseman”.

“The Owl House” on network TV has my unprecedented support. It’s amazing and there’s a second season coming soon. “Infinity Train” is a good choice as well whose future is up in the air right now and it needs support. So even if you have more time than ever to watch TV right now use that time wisely and watch shows that are worth watching. “The Dragon Prince” should not be one of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9iZXN0LW5ldGZsaXgtbW92aWVzLWphbnVhcnktMjAyMS0xMjM0NjA3MTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 7 Best Movies New to Netflix in January 2021,"Netflix enters 2021 with a January slate that’s shaped by the lingering weirdness of 2020 as a month that’s typically full of (recently re-licensed) franchise movies and new seasons of “Sex Education” has mutated into a deep grab bag of second-tier Oscar contenders festival pick-ups and a handful of comfort food classics that could double as ideal New Year’s Day fare.

On the awards tip Vanessa Kirby vehicle “Pieces of a Woman” is probably the most anticipated new arrival and the actress makes the most of this unfathomably tough melodrama about a woman coping in the months after a stillbirth (she’s even better in next month’s “The World to Come”). Rahmin Bahrani’s “The White Tiger” is still under embargo but his adaptation Aravind Adiga’s whirlwind novel about an Indian driver scraping his way up the social ladder will almost certainly be worth a look when it drops on January 13.

“Penguin Bloom” might not be as much of an Oscar player but it is a tender family saga in which Naomi Watts is saved by an emotional support bird and that’s also important. Anthony Mackie sci-fi thriller “Outside the Wire” and Carey Mulligan/Ralph Fiennes archaeology drama “The Dig” won’t drop until the end of the month but “Enter the Dragon” and a pair of Martin Scorsese masterpieces should help pass the time until then.

Here are the seven best movies coming to Netflix this January.

7. “Pieces of a Woman” (2021)

If any Shia LaBeouf movie is difficult to recommend — or even to stomach — in light of recent allegations that’s especially true of Kornél Mundruczó and Kata Wéber’s “Pieces of a Woman” which was a tough watch from the moment it premiered on the festival circuit in September. Mundruczó’s virtuosic movies tend to open like a house on fire only to spend the last two acts finger-painting with the ashes (see: “White God” “Jupiter’s Moon”) and his latest is no exception. A strained and splintered melodrama that’s broken in a way that a series of clunky metaphors can’t hope to repair “Pieces” starts with a 30-minute long-take that follows an ill-fated home birth in real time as Mundruczó’s camera wends through a Boston townhouse on a gimbal supplanting the chaos of a handheld camera with a sense of awe and holy terror.

It’s a traumatizing sequence (borderline unwatchable for expecting parents) that might seem emotionally pornographic if not for how thick a pall it casts on the rest of the film which pits the devastated would-be mom (Vanessa Kirby) against the midwife who oversaw her botched delivery (Molly Parker). The sum may not have the same breathless power as its most indelible parts but Kirby’s shattering performance stays with you and the movie around her — for all of its clumsiness — shines a rare light into places that are usually considered too dark for mainstream entertainment.

6. “Penguin Bloom” (2021)

﻿

Netflix has such a monopoly on awards season this year that — to go by Kate Erbland’s TIFF review of “Penguin Bloom” — the streamer is now angling for Oscars that don’t even exist. Yet.

In 2011 former Movieline editor S.T. VanAirsdale suggested — not entirely facetiously — that the dog who played Uggie in the then-Oscar contender “The Artist” be considered for his own Academy Award. It wasn’t an ask without precedent (Rin Tin Tin was in the race for the very first Best Actor award and arguably won the accolade) but it was certainly the most public awards campaign for a non-human actor. Nearly a decade later it’s time for another: Give an Oscar for the bird(s) that star in Glendyn Ivin’s dramatic real-life story “Penguin Bloom.” That’s not to diminish the work of the human actors — including a stirring Naomi Watts and a breakout performance by young actor Griffin Murray-Johnston — but there’s a reason why this gentle Aussie drama about a family wracked by tragedy is named after its sole winged character. Based on the book of the same name by Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive Ivin’s latest feature tracks a familiar enough story about injury grief and resilience though one wonderfully fluffed up by the unlikely heroine at its heart.

Available to stream January 27.

5. “Superbad” (2007)

“Superbad” which MTV and Comedy Central have basically aired on a constant loop for the last decade is coming back to Netflix which means that you can finally watch this formative high-school comedy without having to sit through 45 minutes of commercials for “Ridiculousness” (or walk across the room to grab your Blu-ray off the shelf which is a lot harder than it sounds).

An enduringly funny modern classic that arrived at the peak of Judd Apatow’s power brought us Emma Stone’s breakout role and cemented Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as bonafide stars “Superbad” holds up so well that it’s hard to believe it came out almost 13 years ago; even the cop subplot still works if you squint and see it as a parody of white privilege. This is the rare coming-of-age movie that grows along with you.

4. “Enter the Dragon” (1973)

In addition to being the quintessential Bruce Lee film one of the most formative (and successful) martial arts movies ever made and an increasingly canonized flashpoint in the modern history of Asian-American representation “Enter the Dragon” is also the perfect New Year’s Day viewing for anyone who wants to start 2021 with an Important Masterpiece that features Bolo “The Chinese Hercules” Yeung getting kicked in the balls so hard that his soul leaves his body. And if the name Bolo Yeung doesn’t mean anything to you that only makes “Enter the Dragon” a more urgent watch.

As much as the film is obviously a showcase for Lee’s unique screen persona it also teems with one of the greatest supporting casts ever assembled for its genre and following any one of them down the rabbit hole of their IMDb page will lead to ample rewards. Jackie Chan’s cameo is just the tip of the iceberg: “Black Christmas” standout John Saxon rules as a Brooklynese Sean Connery Blaxploitation legend Jim Kelly bites the dust with unforgettable style Robert Wall is a big slab of bearded ’70s manhood Ahna Capri brings Barbarella down to Earth as the femme fatale and Shih Kien — even dubbed — manages to cut an iconic villain. None of them can hold a candle to Lee of course but it’s a blast to watch them all try and kick at his level.

3. “The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!” (1988)

﻿

Frank Drebin: “It’s the same old story. Boy finds girl boy loses girl girl finds boy boy forgets girl boy remembers girl girls dies in a tragic blimp accident over the Orange Bowl on New Year’s Day.”

Jane Spencer: “Goodyear?”

Frank Drebin: “No the worst.”

The last time “The Naked Gun” found its way onto Netflix was in January 2020 and it proved all too prescient. Now Netflix is playing with fire and bringing it back at the top of 2021. Good year? Time will tell but the fact is there won’t be many funnier ways to kick things off.

How brilliant is David Zucker’s brain-meltingly ridiculous police spoof? It will make you laugh with O.J. Simpson. A lot. Arguably the funniest movie ever made this hyper-zany parody did for procedurals what “Airplane!” did for uh… airplanes I guess. Leslie Nielsen is comedy perfection as the unflappably deadpan Detective Frank Drebin as he leans into the non-stop parade of silliness with such a stiff upper lip that every pun sight gag and wanton bit of stupidity (the bribery scene on the docks!) bounces off of him and deflects back at us. Simpson is perfect as Drebin’s resilient fall guy Ricardo Montalbán plays the villain with Khan-level bite and Priscilla Presley splits the difference between Michelle Pfeiffer and Marilyn Monroe as a romantic lead with a comic pulse all her own.

2. “The Departed” (2006)

﻿

It’s not “Goodfellas” but don’t let the rat the Oscar and the Wahlberg of it all fool you into thinking that Martin Scorsese’s 2006 crime epic is unworthy of being mentioned in the same breath. A virtuosic tale of cops and robbers that gives remakes a good name “The Departed” takes the skeleton of Andrew Lau and Alan Mak’s “Infernal Affairs” and pumps it so full of Dropkick Murphys Dunkin’ Donuts-addled testosterone that it becomes impossible to extricate this ultra-violent 151-month behemoth from its ultra-Boston setting.

Golden boy Matt Damon isn’t given enough credit for subverting his all-American charm into a career-long side hustle of playing sociopaths and/or shitheels (see: “School Ties” “The Talented Mr. Ripley” the last season of “Project Greenlight” etc.) but he’s spectacularly hate-able as a crooked cop in a country full of them and a perfect foil to the predatory hedonism of what appears to be Jack Nicholson’s last great performance.

Playing the undercover officer from the wrong side of the tracks Leonardo DiCaprio is as palpably stressed out as anyone would be when trying to fill in for Tony Leung and he bristles with the same basic anxiety he’s brought to the rest of his Scorsese collaborations even when the film buries him under a litany of killer supporting turns stacked higher than the Bunker Hill Monument (Alec Baldwin could probably use a nice Google Alert these days but it’s the Ray Winstones and James Badge Dales that really give the movie its special flavor). Also the rat is good. If you could stomach four hours of uncanny De Niro in “The Irishman” you can deal with four seconds of the rat. And that’s that on that.

Model: Air Force 1 Air Raid Blazer Mid and Kyrie 7 “Rayguns”

Release Date: January 15

Price: Ranging from $110 to $145

Buy: Nike

Editor’s Notes: Nike’s fictional basketball team the Roswell Rayguns are the subject of a four-sneaker pack that is set to be released on January 15 via Nike SNKRS. The pack comprises a similarly color-blocked Air Force 1 Air Raid Blazer Mid and Kyrie 7.

The Roswell Rayguns were a fictional team that was the focus of a Nike ad campaign during the 2002 NBA Playoffs. The team shared the same color scheme as the sneakers above which was originally used on a pair of Nike SB Dunks in 2005. Sandy Bodecker the veteran Nike employee and godfather of Nike SB who passed away last year was a big fan of the Rayguns opting to bring the colorway to Nike SB’s premier skate shoe.

This year saw the Rayguns colorway come back on two pairs of tie-dyed Nike Dunk Lows. This pack of four sneakers features the same ’70s flair with a throwback color palette embroidered accents and — as Nike puts it — “other hip details.”

They bring us bad news each day every day - but still hold a special place in the hearts of TV viewers everywhere. Northern Ireland's news readers have been with us through some of the darkest times in our history. The small group of people trusted to front the news on our screens each night have become household names almost as high profile as those they report on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2NyaWNrZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS9wZXJmZWN0aW9uLWFsbC10b28tZmxlZXRpbmctZm9yLWJlYXRlbi1qYW1lcy13YWRlLTM2eGhtY3pzdtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perfection all too fleeting for beaten James Wade,"Sid Waddell might have called it “pyrrhic darts”. After hitting seven treble-20s and a treble-19 on Tuesday James Wade took out double-12 to become only the 11th man to win a nine-dart leg at the World Championship yet he lost the match.

Perfection can be fleeting and does not always lead to victory. At the Crucible in August John Higgins the four-times world snooker champion made a 147 maximum break but lost to Kurt Maflin the world No 43.

And the Trust was one of the worst offenders according to the information released by HM Customs and Revenue.

It failed to pay a total of £11285.34 to 269 workers.

But the Southern Trust was not alone.

In fact all five of Northern Ireland’s Health and Social Care Trusts made the list of 139 companies from across the UK who collectively failed to pay £6.7 million to their workers in what HMRC said was a “completely unacceptable breach of employment law”.

The HMRC release describes those on it as “rogue employers named and shamed for failing to pay minimum wage”.

The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust covering Lisburn and Castlereagh Borough Council failed to pay £7564 to 193 members of staff.

The Belfast Trust failed to pay £7303 to 192 workers the Northern Health failed to pay £6900 to 146 workers while the Western Health Trust failed to pay £6171 to 170 workers.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health told the BBC the issues had been caused by “late payment of the increased rate in the National Living Wage effective from 1 April 2017”.

“All HSC staff are paid at rates which are above the minimum wage” the spokesperson said.

According to the BBC the Department had stressed that the correct rate was applied and paid to affected staff in August and September 2017 with arrears back to April 1 2017.

It said it had always been the “HSC intention to pay the correct rate” with the statement adding: “A unique combination of factors meant that there was a delay and this was entirely outside the HSC employers’ control.”

Business Minister Paul Scully said: “Paying the minimum wage is not optional it is the law. It is never acceptable for any employer to short-change their workers but it is especially disappointing to see huge household names who absolutely should know better on this list.

“This should serve as a wake-up call to named employers and a reminder to everyone of the importance of paying workers what they are legally entitled to.

“Make no mistake those who fail to follow minimum wage rules will be caught out and made to pay up.”

Other Northern Ireland companies to make the list were as follows:

– Doherty & Gray Limited Mid and East Antrim BT42 failed to pay £43470.16 to 128 workers

– Western Brand Poultry Products (NI) Ltd Fermanagh and Omagh BT92 failed to pay £9275 to 50 workers

– Manor House Country Hotel Limited Fermanagh and Omagh BT94 failed to pay £2837.04 to 139 workers

Tea selling stands popularly known as ‘mai shayi’ in local parlance are more than just tea hubs in northern Nigeria but a sort of parliament where men converge to discuss a variety of issues ranging from current affairs to politics and security in between sips of tea Daily Trust reports.

In most parts of northern Nigeria people patronize mai shayi spots mostly for their breakfast and dinner.

Tea spots could easily be found in strategic locations where residents could be served tea bread fried eggs and noodles.

But besides serving as fast food spots mai shayi joints in Northern Nigeria have become melting pots for people of different backgrounds to connect and discuss wide ranging issues.

Kaduna: It’s avenue to discuss politics national issues

In the Mogadishu area of Kaduna Tanja who makes tea and noodles is known to attract residents who squeeze themselves into his tiny shack to get refreshed mostly in the mornings and evenings.

Tanja who joined the business a little over two years ago said: “I feel happy when I see people converge here even though things are hard now because of coronavirus. We don’t make as much sales now.”

He said discussions at the tea shack range from current affairs to security issues and matters concerning COVID-19.

“Issues of poverty in the country are equally discussed and sometimes people come here to vent their problems which could be domestic issues” he said.

Adamu Hassan who frequents Tanja’s shayi shack says there are times one gets to drink tea on credit or get someone to buy him tea in the course of discussions.

“Sometime we make friends here based on the nature of discussion; we could meet as strangers but the nature of discussion could determine whether you will leave the tea shack as friends or not” he said.

On his part Salis Mohammed who also frequents a tea shack at Kurmin Mashi said the people who usually patronize mai shayi are usually very current on international happenings and national issues.

“You may take them for granted because they are members of the lower class in society but these are people who are always on their radio sets; they listen to BBC in the mornings as well as VOA and other stations then they analyse the issues with others.

“The mai shayi himself usually has a radio set which he uses to attract people to come together and listen.

“In the midst of listening to news you could order tea or noodles and so you sip eat listen to news and have good conversation” he said.

Mohammed explained that regulars at the shayi spot have nicknames adding that: “someone could be called chairman because he is a regular or because he is outspoken and has some knowledge about issues being discussed.”

Bauchi: It helps youths keep off social vices

In Bauchi mai shayi spots have become one of the platforms that bind people together to discuss socioeconomic and political issues on regular basis.

At one of the popular joints UK Green Tea along Adamu Jumba road in Bauchi metropolis the owner of spot Ukasha Mohammed told Daily Trust that people that usually meet to drink tea drive a lot of joy and fulfillment from doing so.

“The major benefits they drive from the tea joint include the bond of unity and strong fellowship.

“They engaged in in-depth discussions on pressing national issues.

“The tea joint has become a meeting point for interactions among the youth which is now restricting them from engaging in social vices and drugs spots as well as reducing their urge of flirting with young ladies.”

He said his observation from the discussions that usually go on amongst those that patronize the tea spot is that they also brainstorm on issues that affect their personal and collective development.

“The first issue of discussion affects their individual development especially their social wellbeing academic economic and political issues but every one of them focuses on what he is directly involved.

He said one exceptional thing about the shayi joints is the fact that people who just meet for the first time could become intimate friends in no time after their discussions at the joint.

“They become like a single family and if something happens to a member of a group they would meet to assist and help the person.

“In my tea shop I have three different groups of majalisa (assembly) who setup their meetings here and become a team of friends in my joint.

“When a member has an occasion like marriage or naming ceremony members of the group would contribute money to sponsor the event. If a member wants to do a business they would assist him with capital” he said.

He said some of them who work in public or private sectors sometimes secure job opportunities for other members of the group.

He however lamented some challenges and problems facing the shayi joints including unnecessary arguments especially when it has to do with football matches and politics.

“Some people visit the tea spots with ulterior motives either to spy on individuals or track down persons to rob but we are working with security agents to address the problems.

“Another challenge has to do with closing time; we usually close between 12 midnight and 1am but some of the customers especially members of a group would insist on staying beyond our closing time.

“In the same vein some heavyweight politicians use to come to the joint after 1am due to their privacy and other security concerns and we cannot ignore their services” he said.

A resident of Bauchi metropolis Alhaji Manasa Muhammed said that he is not a member of any of the groups at shayi joints but derive a lot of joy from the tea spot.

“For many years I have developed the habit of visiting the mai shayi spot to get rid of personal problems and stress because I get relief when I listen to strange or jovial stories from tea spots.

“Although some of the stories are not factual some are even fabricated but there are true life stories too.

“I have continued to patronize the tea spot because it’s a platform for peaceful debate on national issues.”

Another resident Garba Umar told Daily Trust that the tea spots serve as a unifying factor that brings people from diverse background together.

“I used to visit mai shayi joints both in the morning for breakfast and evening for my dinner for many years before I married.

“But despite having a family I still attend the tea spot in the evening to discuss with friends and know what’s happening in town.

“If not because of the insecurity in the country today we used to stay at tea joints until dawn” he said.

Borno: It fosters friendship sense of belonging

A tea vendor in Low Cost Bolori Maiduguri Simon Caleb said the joint promotes unity friendship and a sense of belonging among residents and visitors.

He said people especially youths usually frequent tea shops to drink tea with someone or eat cooked noodles and fried eggs.

“A lot of people have made new friends and learnt current affairs as well as listened to conversations about government and security issues” he said."

SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA) will headline an aggressive campaign of launches by their Falcon 9 Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy fleets in 2021 to deliver a multitude of scientific military and commercial payloads aloft for a range of customers. Up to three flights of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy and two missions by ULA’s Delta IV Heavy are manifested together with the inaugural test flight of the new Vulcan-Centaur heavylifter and NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) at some stage in the second half of the year.

Additionally other launch providers in the form of Rocket Lab’s Electron booster Northrop Grumman Corp.’s Antares and Minotaur vehicles Astra’s Rocket-3 and Virgin Orbit’s air-launched LauncherOne have an equally ambitious plate of missions scheduled for 2021.

Up to three Falcon Heavy missions are planned for 2021. Video Credit: Jeff Seibert/AmericaSpace

Having executed no fewer than 26 missions in the last dozen months—a personal-best-beating cadence which saw the venerable Falcon 9 establish itself as the United States’ most-flown active operational booster—SpaceX is looking ahead to a busy 2021 with at least an equivalent number of launches slated to take place including three flights by the colossal triple-barreled Falcon Heavy.

The first mission of the new year was originally due to fly from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Fla. as soon as Monday 4 January with a possibility that SpaceX may repeat its November achievement by flying as many as four times in a single calendar month. The Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS) “Just Read the Instructions” was towed out of Port Canaveral on Wednesday bound for a recovery location some 410 miles (670 km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean to prepare for its first Falcon 9 “catch” of the New Year. However JRTI and the “Finn Falgout” tug boat later returned to port indicative of a delay to this schedule.

Several powerful communications satellites are slated to be lifted towards Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) three cargo-laden Dragons and up to three astronaut-carrying Crew Dragons will visit the International Space Station (ISS) and a pair of Block III Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation and timing satellites will head for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO).

Added to that list two dedicated U.S. Space Force payloads and two clandestine National Reconnaissance Office payloads are also set to fly in 2021 plus three SmallSat Rideshare Missions several NASA and commercial science flights and the continued expansion of SpaceX’s already-hundreds-strong network of Starlink low-orbiting internet communications satellites. A total of 833 of the flat-packed Starlinks have been boosted aloft by no fewer than 16 Falcon 9 missions since May 2019.

The payload for what is expected to be the first orbital flight of the year is the 9900-pound (4500 kg) Türksat 5A the first of two new satellites developed and fabricated by Airbus Defence and Space and Turkish Aerospace Industries for Ku-band communications and direct-broadcast television services covering eastern England to western China on behalf of Ankara-based provider Türksat.

Based upon the all-electric version of Airbus’ EuroStar E3000 satellite “bus” Türksat-5A will eventually enter a geosynchronous “slot” at 31 degrees East longitude for 15 years of operational service. At some point in the second quarter of 2021 another Falcon 9 will loft the identical Türksat-5B towards a geostationary slot at 42 degrees East. SpaceX received contracts to launch both satellites in November 2017.

And following the successful launch of the SXM-7 high-powered broadcasting satellite for New York-based SiriusXM earlier this month another Falcon 9 is expected to deliver SXM-8 into orbit at some point in 2021. These heavyweight satellites—each weighing in the order of 15400 pounds (7000 kg)—were built by Maxar Technologies Inc. using the tried-and-true SSL-1300 “bus” and can provide more than 20 kilowatts of payload power and their large unfurlable S-band antenna reflectors can achieve radio broadcasting without the need for large ground-based dishes. The upcoming SXM-8 satellite will replace the aging XM-4 which has been in orbit since October 2006.

For the first time in almost two years three Falcon Heavy missions are slated to rise from historic Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. If all three fly as scheduled in 2021 they will bring the total number of missions by this triple-barreled behemoth—currently the most powerful rocket in active operational service anywhere in the world—to six. The Falcon Heavy carries the potential to lift up to 58900 pounds (26700 kg) to geostationary altitude affording a clear indicator of the size mass and energy requirements of its payloads.

One of those payloads for 2021 is a large ViaSat-3-class Ka-band communications satellite built by Boeing and provided by California-headquartered ViaSat Inc. for worldwide high-capacity broadband provision whilst the others are dedicated to the U.S. Space Force. One mission the geostationary-bound USSF-44 was part of a launch contract awarded by the Department of Defense to SpaceX back in February 2019. The other USSF-52 was awarded to SpaceX in June 2018.

A pair of Block III Global Positioning System (GPS) payloads also for the Space Force are expected to be launched next year bringing the total number of these Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) positioning navigation and timing satellites launched atop Falcon 9s since December 2018 to five.

And as part of the same Department of Defense contract which included USSF-44 a pair of highly secretive missions for the National Reconnaissance Office—NROL-85 and NROL-87—will launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Fla. and Vandenberg Air Force Base Calif. respectively at some point before December 2021. At least three “rideshare” missions are timetabled for next year as is Intuitive Machines’ Nova-C and Japan’s Hakuto lunar landers which represents not only the first launch under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program but is also expected to mark the first attempt by a U.S. private entity to land a spacecraft on the Moon.

And two major NASA science missions—the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) slated to visit Didymos and evaluate asteroid impact avoidance technologies and the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) whose two-year voyage will explore exotic astronomical phenomena including black holes supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei—will fly in July and October respectively. Added to the list are six ISS-bound missions with crew and cargo to be outlined in tomorrow’s AmericaSpace feature article.

For United Launch Alliance (ULA) which wrapped up 2020 with six successful missions by its highly reliable Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy fleet the New Year offers the potential for not only an expanded flight rate but also the long-awaited maiden voyage of its Vulcan-Centaur heavylifter. With a primary payload of Astrobotic Technology’s 2800-pound (1300 kg) Peregrine lunar lander the mission is due to fly at some point in the second half of 2021 with a healthy list of bookings for future flights including six ISS-bound missions by Sierra Nevada Corp.’s Dream Chaser cargo ship.

ULA has already trialed much of the tooling and many of the technologies for its new heavylifter on its existing Atlas V fleet including last November’s NROL-101 flight which was powered by Northrop Grumman Corp.’s uprated GEM-63 strap-on boosters and the recent delivery of the first Out-of-Autoclave (OoA) payload fairing. In early December a simulated countdown test at Cape Canaveral allowed teams to craft and perfect the timelines for the long-awaited maiden flight.

With ULA’s Delta product-line now in the process of gradual retirement—having already seen the swansong of the Delta II in September 2018 and the final voyage of the “single-stick” Delta IV Medium in August 2019—only the giant triple-barreled Delta IV Heavy remains with just four flights sitting on its manifest through the middle of the decade.

With NROL-44 having finally flown in December only four more Delta IV Heavy missions are planned. Two of them will fly in 2021. Photo Credit: Jeff Seibert/AmericaSpace

Two of those flights are tentatively targeted for 2021 both of which will originate from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-6 at Vandenberg and both of which are dedicated to NRO objectives. Known only as NROL-82 and NROL-91 their exact purposes are shrouded in secrecy although the Heavy’s lifting potential of 63470 pounds (28790 kg) to low-Earth orbit and 31350 pounds (14220 kg) to geostationary altitude offer an indicator of their size mass and energy requirements.

Conversely the Atlas V fleet retains a more robust launch schedule with possibly up to nine flights on its books for 2021. The fifth geostationary-orbiting element of the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS GEO-5)—whose fabrication and structural testing was officially completed last month—will ride an Atlas V in July with the Space Force’s USSF-8 and USSF-12 missions due to launch later in the year. Contracts worth $354.8 million between the Department of Defense and ULA to fly these two Space Force missions were signed in March 2018. Interestingly USSF-8 will mark the first outing of the “511” variant of the Atlas V equipped with a 17-foot-diameter (5-meter) payload fairing a single strap-on solid-fueled booster and a single-engine Centaur upper stage.

The former is believed to be a pair of Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites while the latter is thought to represent a Wide Field Of View (WFOV) experimental early-warning platform hosting an Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) sensor. Launch contracts for a third military mission STP-3 for the Department of Defense’s Space Test Program were awarded to ULA in June 2017 and it is scheduled to fly on the first Atlas V mission of 2021 in February. Primary payload is STPSat-6 laden with a range of NASA and Air Force investigations.

Other flights include NASA’s Lucy mission set to launch in October on a multi-year exploration of some of the most enigmatic objects in the known Solar System: the “Trojan” asteroids gravitationally trapped in alignment with Jupiter’s orbit and which are so ancient that may represent the primordial building-blocks of the planets themselves.

NASA’s Landsat-9 satellite—a follow-on program from the 2013-launched Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM)—will fly in September after having been delayed by the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to put its Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instruments to bear on Earth observations and geological survey. And the next Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-T) scheduled to launch in the December 2021 timeframe will offer a much-needed new sentinel for timely weather forecasting and meteorological research following problems experienced in 2018 by its immediate predecessor GOES-17.

As will be outlined in tomorrow’s AmericaSpace feature up to six SpaceX missions and potentially two ULA missions are destined to visit the ISS in support of commercial crew and cargo delivery services together with the maiden uncrewed voyage of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) and a pair of launches by Northrop Grumman Corp.’s Antares 230+ booster.

Launched from Pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island Va. the 133-foot-tall (40.3-meter) booster is scheduled to launch the NG-15 and NG-16 Cygnus cargo ships to the station in February and October. Each cargo ship will be laden with an estimated 8000 pounds (3600 kg) of equipment payloads and supplies for successive ISS crews. Northrop Grumman also plans to fly its Minuteman/Peacekeeper-derived Minotaur rocket fleet three times—once from SLC-8 at Vandenberg and twice from Pad 0B at MARS—with the two Wallops flights conducted in support of NRO objectives.

Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne which succumbed to a failure of its NewtonThree first-stage engine shortly after separation from the Boeing 747 “Cosmic Girl” carrier aircraft in May 2020 was scheduled to fly again just before Christmas although its mission from California’s Mojave Air and Spaceport to deliver ten CubeSats into orbit has met with additional delay. And Astra’s Rocket-3—one of which was destroyed by the Range Safety Officer (RSO) shortly after liftoff in September 2000 whilst a second in December successfully passed the Kármán Line but suffered upper-stage fuel-mixture problems which precluded the achievement of a stable orbit—may fly as many as three times in 2021.

The U.S. Navy's new Very Lightweight Torpedo (VLWT) will be both an offensive and defensive torpedo.

The torpedo can attack submarines or torpedoes.

Unlike previous lightweight torpedoes the VLWT will be used by aircraft surface ships and submarines.

The U.S. Navy plans to field its first new torpedo in decades and one candidate is Northrop Grumman's Very Lightweight Torpedo (VLWT).

Originally designed to protect aircraft carriers from incoming torpedoes VLWT could be used by aircraft surface ships and even submarines. The weapon can be used both as an offensive weapon against enemy submarines or a defensive one against inbound torpedoes.

➡ You love badass military vehicles. So do we. Let's nerd out over them together.

The VLWT according to National Defense was originally designed to defend the Navy’s aircraft carriers from submarines. Installed on carriers the mini-torpedoes would be launched at the first sign of enemy attack homing in on the incoming torpedoes.

The Navy killed the carrier defense system but Northrop Grumman decided to continue development. The company is now marketing the VLWT as a multi-mission torpedo capable of both attack or defense with specific mission software loaded into the weapon’s electronic brain just before firing.

The torpedo’s offensive mode known as compact rapid attack weapon (CRAW) is designed to give even the smallest platforms the capability to hunt submarines. The small torpedo could be carried by helicopters maritime patrol aircraft small crewed or uncrewed surface ships and even other subs.

Once the sub-hunter detects the presence of an enemy submarine it drops a CRAW in the vicinity. The tiny torpedo’s onboard sensors immediately start hunting the enemy submarine forcing it onto the defensive.

The Coolest Military Toys

The VLWT’s defense mode known as countermeasure anti-torpedo (CAT) turns the torpedo into a torpedo interceptor. A ship or helicopter protecting an aircraft carrier or other capital ship could position itself in the path of an enemy torpedo then launch a CAT. This is likely a better more flexible defensive scheme than the now-canceled carrier defense system allowing it to protect more ships.

Northrop Grumman believes the VLWT could be ready for production in as little as 4 years.

Evans took a leave of absence that began Dec. 1 “to address health issues unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic” according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by the company. She previously took medical leave in September 2019 due to a cancer diagnosis according to Reuters.

Greg Ulmer who leads the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has filled in as head of Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics unit in the interim.

“Throughout her career Michele led some of the most important programs that ensure the security of our nation and its allies and help make our world a safer place” Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said. “She embodied our company’s values in spirit and action every day — to do what’s right respect others and perform with excellence. Her example was an inspiration to those of us fortunate enough to have worked with her closely and her leadership in the aerospace and defense industry will have a lasting impact for years to come.”

Evans spent 34 years working at Lockheed and before her medical issues was seen as a top contender to replace Marillyn Hewson as the company’s chief executive.

Before becoming vice president of the Aeronautics division Evans held multiple executive positions in the company’s Rotary and Mission Systems business area serving as vice president and general manager of integrated warfare systems and sensors as well as vice president for C4ISR (command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance).

Earlier in her career she managed avionics programs for the C-130 and F-35 aircraft.

""We continue to do better and therefore meet the criteria to sit at the table when it comes to a possible consolidation of the European banks - and not just as a junior partner"" Sewing told Welt am Sonntag in an interview.

Sewing who is pursuing a long-term drive to boost earnings power at Deutsche after years of underperformance has consistently said that his priority was to complete a turnaround by 2022.

Talks on an all-German banking merger with Commerzbank failed in 2019 and with a stock market value of just 18 billion euros ($21.9 billion) Deutsche would be an affordable target for a more richly valued potential acquirer.

Sewing played up the bank's strategic importance for Europe's largest economy and top exporting nation however and said his restructuring drive was bearing fruit.

""It would be a mistake to rely on imports of financial services"" said Sewing. ""Every quarter in which we are successful makes us stronger.""

Earnings and costs in its private and corporate business were absolutely on track he added and Deutsche's investment bank has outperformed expectations. ($1 = 0.8239 euros)

Most U.S. investors had a lot of winners in their portfolios this year but some stocks certainly performed better than others.

Here’s a look at the 10 worst-performing stocks in the entire S&P 500 in 2019 as of the Dec. 29 closing price.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY)

Investors will notice a common theme among these worst-performing stocks. Travel restrictions and economic shutdowns crushed oil industry demand and oil stocks in 2020 and Occidental was the hardest-hit in the group. The stock dropped 57.7% in 2020 more than any other S&P 500 stock.

Carnival Corp (NYSE: CCL)

The travel and leisure industries have been hit nearly as hard as the oil industry in 2020. Carnival’s cruises have been shut down completely for most of 2020 and will likely remain shut down for at least a couple of months in 2021 as well. The stock dropped 57.2% in 2020.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NCLH)

Norwegian shares dropped a nearly identical 56.2% in 2020 for nearly identical reasons Carnival shares lagged.

10 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Of 2020

TechnipFMC PLC (NYSE: FTI)

The oil services group struggled in 2020 but offshore oil projects were hit especially hard due to their higher associated costs. Shares of offshore service provider TechnipFMC dropped 56.1% in 2020.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO)

It may seem redundant but no travel or industrial demand coupled with record-low oil prices is bad news for oil stocks like Marathon which is down 51.1% in 2020.

HollyFrontier Corp (NYSE: HFC)

Add refiner HollyFrontier to the growing list of battered energy stocks in 2020. The stock is down 50.2% year-to-date.

United Airlines Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL)

Airline stocks were crushed during the worst of the pandemic. Although shares have recovered throughout the year as bankruptcy fears eased United shares are still down 50.1% overall in 2020.

ONEOK Inc. (NYSE: OKE)

Same energy story different energy stock. Shares of natural gas transportation stock ONEOK are down 49.2% in 2020.

Diamondback Energy Inc (NYSE: FANG)

Permian oil producer Diamondback certainly wasn’t immune from the energy sector carnage in 2020 and its stock dropped 48.7% on the year.

Schlumberger NV (NYSE: SLB)

Rounding out the list of travel and energy casualties in 2020 is oil services giant Schlumberger. The stock lost 46.3% of its value this year.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest steel companies in the world. Without steel much of our infrastructure currently would not exist. It is by far the most important engineering and construction material and if you have any doubts as to its importance you can ask the 19 largest construction companies in the world. While the steel industry itself has enabled millions of jobs on a global scale it is actually its indirect contribution to the global economy which is even more important since it is a raw material in many industries around the world.

Steel is an alloy of carbon and iron where less than 2% of the total makeup is of carbon 1% is manganese and has trace amounts of oxygen silicon sulphur and phosphorous. Wherever you look you will find some sort of application of steel; from construction to cars to electronic products to refrigerators washing machines surgical instruments and even cargo ships which is why it is essential to the 15 biggest shipping companies in the world too. Of course this list is by no means exhaustive and there are tons more applications pertaining to steel in the world. It is said that for every $1 that the steel industry generates $2.5 are generated indirectly which is why it has a significant impact on the global economy.

15 largest steel companies in the world

Even though steel is required by more or less every single country in their construction sectors as well as other sectors the production isn't quite as evenly spread as you might have thought. In fact just 15 countries are responsible for more than 89% of the total steel production with China topping the list with absolute dominance. China produced approximately 1000 million metric tons while second placed Japan was only able to manage 100 million metric tons showing the strength of China in this sector.

Technology has impacted most industries and the steel industry is no exception. Recently the biggest iron ore producer in Europe LKAB< has announced that it will invest $46 billion over the next two decades to create an emissions free iron process which could is major news for the steel industry and will increase pressure on other companies to follow these steps in a world which is increasingly and rightfully so environmentally conscious. After all the steel industry is responsible for approximately 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions which are among the biggest contributors to climate change but response in the industry has been slow as convenient replacements have continued eluding the industry. In the last few years however solutions have been forthcoming and it looks like the steel industry is poised for a massive change in the coming years.

Story continues

The Covid-19 pandemic which is still currently raging across the world even after a year has tanked the global economy and it will take years to recover from the effect and that's when we don't even know when this pandemic will subside. As other industries such as construction shipping and manufacturing had to stop production due to lockdowns the demand for steel fell as well while inventories increased especially in China where the virus originated and which is also the biggest exporter of steel globally as well.

The biggest steel companies in the world are ranked based on their production of steel in 2019 since some of these companies engage in production of other products as well. There are only a few companies which are listed in the United States with companies such as Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) However we have also mentioned other information where relevant for these companies including their market cap revenues assets and profits.

It looks like NVIDIA is still deciding on what to do next with its Ampere lineup and as such there are new rumors emerging from Kopite7kimi (via Videocardz) according to who NVIDIA is preparing two brand new SKUs which might possibly by the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Reportedly Under Consideration Could These Feature 16 GB GDDR6(X) VRAM?

For starters the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER are not going to affect the upcoming card lineup which would include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti & the GeForce RTX 3060. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti could be a whole different story since we have heard about this SKU for a while now but nothing has been formulated aside from some rumored specifications. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti have also been canceled and relaunched with different specs a couple of times now.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is even going to be introduced earlier than the RTX 3070 Ti so the status of this particular SKU is not confirmed yet. At the same time one thing to note about the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 is how both of them feature much higher memory capacities than their predecessors. The RTX 3080 Ti replaces the RTX 2080 Ti with 9 GB higher VRAM (11 GB vs 20 GB) and the RTX 3060 replaces the RTX 2060 with twice the memory buffer (6 GB vs 12 GB). The same might just be the case with the SUPER series that NVIDIA has planned.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & RTX 3070 SUPER

We don't have any concrete specifications of these two chips but if we go back to earlier rumors then we can tell that NVIDIA had initially planned higher VRAM variants of both RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 graphics cards. The RTX 3080 was expected to feature 12-16 GB VRAM while the RTX 3070 also had been expected to feature similar VRAM amounts. However that plan was scrapped in favor of NVIDIA going literally bonkers with its RTX 3090 design and keeping the rest of the lineup capped to 10 GB VRAM due to limited availability of GDDR6(X) modules.

I know there are some new SKUs recently but I don't know their names yet maybe 3070 Super and 3080 Super. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

By the time the RTX 3080 Ti launches the memory supply will be far better. NVIDIA themselves have also confirmed that supply would get better by the end of the first quarter of 2021 so that is probably when NVIDIA can devise a better plan to re-release their GeForce RTX lineup in a SUPER fashion.

For this purpose the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER could be the first entrants in the lineup. Similar to the previous generation NVIDIA wouldn't want to touch the high-end models since they will be positioned right against the competition. It's the RTX 3080 and below lineups such as the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti which would require a SUPER refresh to tackle AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6700 series.

GA102 and GA103S — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

For that purpose alone NVIDIA could end up featuring 16 GB of GDDR6(X) memory on both the RTX 3080 SUPER (GDDR6X) & the GeForce 3070 SUPER (GDDR6). As for core configurations they might also change with the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER expected to utilize the GA103S GPU while the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER would retain its GA102 GPU.

However one critical thing to consider here would be the prices. Whether NVIDIA offers a price cut on existing variants and ends their production to make room for the new cards which is similar to what they did in the last generation or keep the existing cards and offer the SUPER variants with a slight premium that remains to be seen. Lastly don't expect the SUPER cards anytime soon as the green team has yet to be done with the original lineup.

NVIDIA is expected to launch two new high-end graphics cards sometime this year with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and now the newly-rumored GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER graphics card.

But joining the new rumor of the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER is the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER but why? Well the RTX 3080 has 10GB of VRAM and the RTX 3070 has 8GB of VRAM. Both of their competitors in the Radeon RX 6800 XT and Radeon RX 6800 have 16GB of VRAM and I'm sure NVIDIA wants to something about that.

The new rumors are coming from kopite7kimi on Twitter who says that there are ""some new SKUs"" coming and they might be the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER graphics cards. We could expect the RTX 3080 SUPER to be a tweaked RTX 3080 with 16GB of VRAM -- while the higher-end RTX 3080 Ti would pack 20GB of VRAM.

As for the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Kopite ponders if it'll feature a new GA103 GPU that hasn't been used yet -- both the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER could use this new GA103 -- slotting right between GA104 and GA102.

We'll know more as the weeks and months flip by.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzg4MTM4LWFtZC1wYXRlbnRzLWNoaXBsZXQtZ3B1LWRlc2lnbi11bmxpa2UtbnZpZGlhLWludGVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD patents a chiplet GPU design quite unlike Nvidia and Intel's,"Something to look forward to: AMD has published its first patent on chiplet GPU designs. In typical AMD fashion they're trying to not rock the boat. Chiplet GPUs are just beginning to emerge. Intel has been forthright about their development process and confirmed the employment of chiplets in their first-generation discrete GPUs. Nvidia while coy about specifics have published numerous research papers on the topic. AMD was the last holdout - which only adds to the intrigue.

Chiplets as the name suggests are smaller less complex chips that meant to work together into more powerful processors. They're arguably the inevitable future for all high-performance components and in some cases the successful present; AMD's use of chiplet CPU designs has been brilliant.

In the new patent dated December 31 AMD outlines a chiplet design fashioned to mimic a monolithic design as closely as possible. Their hypothetical model uses two chiplets connected by a high-speed inactive interposer called a crosslink.

A crosslink connection sits between the L2 cache and L3 cache on the memory hierarchy. Everything beneath it such as the cores and L1 cache and L2 cache are aware of their separation from the other chiplet. Everything above including the L3 cache and GDDR memory are shared between the chiplets.

This design is beneficial because it is conventional. AMD claims that compute units can access low-level cache on other chiplets almost as fast as they can access local low-level cache. Should that prove true software won't need updating.

The same cannot be said of Intel and Nvidia's designs. Intel intends on using two new technologies EMIB (embedded multi-die interconnect bridge) and Foveros. The latter is an active interposer that uses through-silicon-vias something AMD explicitly states they will not use. Intel's design lets the GPU house a system-accessible cache that powers a new memory fabric.

Nvidia has not disclosed everything but have indicated a few directions they might pursue. A research paper from 2017 describes a four-chiplet design and a NUMA (non-uniform memory access) aware and locality aware architecture. It also experiments with a new L1.5 cache which exclusively holds remote data accesses and is bypassed during local memory accesses.

AMD's approach might sound the least imaginative but it also sounds practical. And if history has proven anything it's that developer-friendliness is a huge advantage.

Below are additional diagrams from the patent.

Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view that descends from two chiplets to the circuit board. The two chiplets (106-1 and 106-2) are stacked vertically on the passive crosslink (118) and use dedicated conductor structures to access the crosslink's traces (206) and subsequently communicate with each other. Conductor structures not attached to the crosslink (204) connect to the circuit board for power and other signaling.

Figure 3 depicts the cache hierarchy. WGPs (work group processors) (302) which are collections of shader cores and GFXs (fixed function units) (304) which are dedicated processors for singular purposes connect directly to a channel's L1 cache (306). Each chiplet contains multiple L2 cache (308) banks that are individually addressable and also coherent within a single chiplet. Each chiplet also contains multiple L3 cache (310) cache banks that are coherent across the whole GPU.

The GDF (graphics data fabric) (314) connects the L1 cache banks to the L2 cache banks. The SDF (scalable data fabric) (316) combines the L2 cache banks and connects them to the crosslink (118). The crosslink connects to the SDFs on all the chiplets as well as the L3 cache banks on all the chiplets. The GDDR memory lanes (written as Memory PHY) (312) connect to L3 cache banks.

As an example if a WGP on one chiplet required data from a GDDR bank on another chiplet that data would be sent through to an L3 cache bank then over the crosslink to an SDF then to an L2 bank and finally through a GDF to an L1 bank.

Figure 4 is a bird's eye view of one chiplet. It shows more accurately the potential locations and scales of various components. The HBX Controller (404) manages the crosslink which the chiplet is connected to by HBX PHY (406) conductors. The small square in the bottom-left corner (408) is a potential additional connection to the crosslink to connect more chiplets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy83NzAzNC9hbWQtcGF0ZW50LXRlYXNlcy1ncHUtY2hpcGxldC10ZWNoLXRoZS1ncmVhdC1iaWctbGVhcC1vdmVyLW52aWRpYS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD patent teases GPU chiplet tech the great big leap over NVIDIA?!,"AMD is working on GPU chiplet technology for a future GPU release but on December 31 2020 as the world was about to ring in the New Year AMD submitted a new patent to the USPTO.

The new patent describes a GPU chiplet design that would be quite the advancement over NVIDIA right now with the GPU chiplet be direct 'communicably coupled' to the CPU with each of the GPU chiplets in the array would be coupled to the first GPU through a passive crosslink.

AMD sees a future where a passive crosslink is used for communication wires between GPU chiplets which are all on a single interposer. This means that the groups of GPU chiplets work work like a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) which is divided into separate functional chips.

Normally we have GPUs that use their own last-level cache (LLC) but in future GPU chiplet designs from AMD would have their own LLC -- but it would be used in a way that would see the cache being ""communicably coupled"" to other physical resources so that the cache stays ""unified and remains coherent across all GPU chiplets"".

NVIDIA and Intel will both have their own GPU chiplet-style architectures in the coming years but AMD already has plenty of experience using chiplets in its mega successful Ryzen CPU family of processors. Chiplet technology has allowed AMD to almost come out of nowhere with a magic CPU architecture using chiplets and dominate its Superman-like competitor within a matter of a few years.

LUKE CAMPBELL FINAL PRESS CONFERENCE QUOTES,"Advertisement

DALLAS TEXAS (Dec. 31 2020): Ryan Garcia (20-0 17 KOs) and Luke Campbell (20-3 16 KOs) hosted their final press conference today in Dallas Texas ahead of their 12-round showdown for the interim WBC Lightweight Championship. They were joined by undercard fighters from the event including world champions Rene Alvarado (32-8 21 KOs) and Felix Alvarado (35-2 30 KOs) and many others.

The fight will take place on Jan. 2 2021 at American Airlines Center in Dallas and will be streamed live exclusively on DAZN in more than 200 countries and territories including the U.S. Mexico and the UK.

Below is what today’s main event participants had to say at the press conference:

RYAN GARCIA WBC SILVER LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION:

“I wanted this fight after Francisco Fonseca. When it was offered to me for the interim title I thought that my dream was finally coming true. I’ve always said he is a good fighter. I never said he wasn’t a good fighter. But I just know that with my skills and my training I will be victorious.”

“My fights haven’t gone long because I don’t let them. If it happens to go that way then I’m ready for 12 rounds. If he’s tough and he can take a shot then I’m ready for that. They can say all they want about me not being able to go 12 rounds. I’ve trained to go 1000 rounds. I expect this to be a great fight. I expect this to be a great war.”

LUKE CAMPBELL FORMER WORLD TITLE CHALLENGER:

“I’m confident because I want to prove that I am the best in the division. From what I have seen he is good. He is fast. He’s got good skills. But I believe in myself. My strategy is to win by any means possible and I’m going to be the best version of myself.”

“Tune in Saturday night. I’ve come to fight. This is going to be a fantastic fight. We are two of the best lightweights in the world and it will be a fantastic battle.”

OSCAR DE LA HOYA CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF GOLDEN BOY:

“I see what I’ve always seen in Ryan: an incredibly gifted wildly charismatic fighter who never takes his foot of the gas in training or in the ring on fight night. I also see a fighter with an incredible appreciation of and admiration for the sport. When he’s not fighting or training he’s watching film or going to other fights. The kid eats sleeps and breaths boxing. At the same time at a really young age Ryan has an understanding of marketing that only a handful of fighters ever truly achieve.”

“We live in an era when fans can feel closer to their heroes than ever before through the development of social media. Ryan engages with those fans and has grown a following that is close to unrivaled in the sport. You put all these things in a package and what you end up with is a fighter who is primed to crossover and become an international superstar.”

Most U.S. investors had a lot of winners in their portfolios this year but some stocks certainly performed better than others.

Here’s a look at the 10 worst-performing stocks in the entire S&P 500 in 2019 as of the Dec. 29 closing price.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY)

Investors will notice a common theme among these worst-performing stocks. Travel restrictions and economic shutdowns crushed oil industry demand and oil stocks in 2020 and Occidental was the hardest-hit in the group. The stock dropped 57.7% in 2020 more than any other S&P 500 stock.

Carnival Corp (NYSE: CCL)

The travel and leisure industries have been hit nearly as hard as the oil industry in 2020. Carnival’s cruises have been shut down completely for most of 2020 and will likely remain shut down for at least a couple of months in 2021 as well. The stock dropped 57.2% in 2020.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NCLH)

Norwegian shares dropped a nearly identical 56.2% in 2020 for nearly identical reasons Carnival shares lagged.

10 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Of 2020

TechnipFMC PLC (NYSE: FTI)

The oil services group struggled in 2020 but offshore oil projects were hit especially hard due to their higher associated costs. Shares of offshore service provider TechnipFMC dropped 56.1% in 2020.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO)

It may seem redundant but no travel or industrial demand coupled with record-low oil prices is bad news for oil stocks like Marathon which is down 51.1% in 2020.

HollyFrontier Corp (NYSE: HFC)

Add refiner HollyFrontier to the growing list of battered energy stocks in 2020. The stock is down 50.2% year-to-date.

United Airlines Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL)

Airline stocks were crushed during the worst of the pandemic. Although shares have recovered throughout the year as bankruptcy fears eased United shares are still down 50.1% overall in 2020.

ONEOK Inc. (NYSE: OKE)

Same energy story different energy stock. Shares of natural gas transportation stock ONEOK are down 49.2% in 2020.

Diamondback Energy Inc (NYSE: FANG)

Permian oil producer Diamondback certainly wasn’t immune from the energy sector carnage in 2020 and its stock dropped 48.7% on the year.

Schlumberger NV (NYSE: SLB)

Rounding out the list of travel and energy casualties in 2020 is oil services giant Schlumberger. The stock lost 46.3% of its value this year.

Due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in Hampton Roads and across the nation and in accordance with our reopening blueprint Old Dominion University will start at least the first two weeks of the spring 2021 semester from Jan. 19 to Feb. 1 with remote instruction. This means nearly all classes will be delivered online with the exception of a limited number of courses and labs that require in-person hours. Faculty will reach out to students in these programs. Prevailing conditions will determine if further modifications will be needed.

The decision to delay students' arrival on campus and face-to-face instruction which was made by the University's Executive Policy Team will help protect the health and well-being of Monarchs and the Hampton Roads community at a time when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Virginia Department of Health project COVID-19 cases will peak. Students facing extenuating circumstances or who need additional support are encouraged to contact the Dean of Students Office at oducares@odu.edu or 757-683-3442.

As a community we will continue to promote Monarchs' safety while providing the same high-quality education and minimizing disruptions. ODU offices will reopen as scheduled on Jan. 4 to ensure the continuity of student support services as well as our academic and research enterprise. Telework and staggered on-site shifts are still encouraged wherever possible.

We are committed to providing classes in-person — when it is safe to do so — online and in a hybrid mode this spring. The Executive Policy Team will continue monitoring the latest developments and will provide updates every Monday of what lies ahead.

In the meantime ODU's CLIA-certified COVID-19 clinical diagnostics lab in Innovation Research Park is expanding its on-demand and surveillance testing program. More details will follow.

Please continue to #ReignResponsibly and follow recommended precautions to stay healthy. We will keep you informed of the latest information via email and on ODU's official social media channels.

Best wishes for a happy new year!

Sincerely

Giovanna M. Genard

Assistant Vice President for Strategic Communication and Marketing

The Monarchs led throughout the first three quarters until the Panthers managed to hold ODU to just 12 points in the final quarter of play and pull ahead.



Junior Amari Young and senior Victoria Morris each compiled 21 points which led the team in scoring. Young went 9-of-13 from the field and grabbed seven rebounds while Morris went 6-of-14 draining two triples and grabbed a season-high five boards.



""Today's game was one where it turned into a track meet and we never could find our rhythm defensively explained head coach DeLisha Milton-Jones. ""We definitely don't have a problem with scoring the ball but how are we going to put together a string of stops when the other team has their offensive side going just as well as we do.""



In the first period FIU jumped out to a 22-14 lead but the culmination of a Dejah Carter layup two Young baskets a Morris trey and jumper and two-made free throws took ODU to a 27-26 edge heading into the second quarter.



ODU and FIU traded baskets in the second quarter both compiling 24 points in 10 minutes of play which resulted in five lead changes. At the break ODU led the Panthers by just one point.



The Monarchs outscored FIU 22-18 in the third quarter. In that 10 minutes of action FIU turned the ball over seven times while ODU scored nine points off of those Panther turnovers. Redshirt freshman Mackenzie Smith went three-for-three from the field during that third quarter stretch. Smith's layup in the final four seconds of the third quarter helped give ODU a five-point lead heading into the final frame of play.



With the help of an Aziah Hudson triple ODU jumped out to an eight-point lead in the first two minutes of the fourth quarter. The Panthers then fought back to compile nine unanswered points and tied up the contest with 5:46 left in regulation. ODU regained the lead once more with a Carter layup but FIU pushed ahead in the final two minutes of play. Hudson's final three-point field goal came with 54 seconds left on the clock but it was not enough to take back control.



""While we had good contributions from several players we still have to look at the fact that we are not defending at the rate that we need to defend in order for us to walk away victorious within these games.""



Notes

Ajah Wayne did not dress for the game and will not play in tomorrow's rematch against FIU due to contact tracing protocol and out of an abundance of caution.

Young put together her best scoring performance of the season. She previously scored a season-high 16 points on Dec. 3 against William & Mary. Her career-high is 23 points which occurred last season.

Young has now put together double-figure scoring in every single game this season.

Smith added six points and four rebounds both a career-high.

Hudson made her first start of the season also pouring in a season-high 16 points which was highlighted by three three-point field goals.

ODU shot 48.5% from the field the best percentage this season.

Up Next

ODU will take on FIU once again at Chartway Arena tomorrow Jan. 2 at 2 p.m.

""I signed with Arizona State"" Bethea said. ""It was just the amount of coaches who have been in the NFL and the NFL exposure they have on that team. They have a lot of knowledge and they know how to get me to the NFL and that is pretty much every football player's dream to go to the NFL.

""I feel like that is the best situation for me to go there and develop.""

Key among the group of coaches was offensive analyst Kevin Mawae who spent 16 years as a player in the NFL and is the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Half of his career was spent with the New York Jets which plays less than 20 miles from his school in East Rutherford N.J.

""What I like about him is you can really listen to him and he's just a great coach"" Bethea said. ""Kevin Mawae he's a hall of famer. That really just opened my eyes. You can't get better than that -- a hall of famer in the NFL at Arizona State. There is nothing better than that.""

Although the NCAA shut down official visits and traditional unofficial visits in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic Bethea was able to make it to the Tempe Ariz. school in the fall to look around the campus and get a feel for the area.

Although he could not get the typical tour of the facilities and meet with the coaching staff the trip was beneficial on other levels.

""What really stood out to me was just the atmosphere of Arizona"" Bethea said. ""It's warm weather. It's not as cold as it is in New York. It is real cool nice laid back state. It was really chill. The campus was great.""

New York postponed its football season until the spring and Bethea thought about staying at Erasmus Hall so he could play his senior season.

However he opted to enroll at Arizona State this month so he can get ready for his freshman season.

""It's so I can get in the routine of the lifts of the practices know the plays"" Bethea said. ""It's just getting a nice early jump on being a student-athlete at Arizona State.""

Coretec Group is looking to exploit an unusual compound called cyclohexasilane as the basis for new batteries that would allow for quick recharging of electric vehicles (EVs). If Coretec’s exploration of nanotech is successful that would make EVs instantly more practical.

Automotive manufactures are striving to create a more sustainable future with EVs but the market for EVs still lacks sufficient infrastructure for refueling and benefits from improved battery technology. A robust fast-charging network and silicon anode batteries could be keys to making the EV market more rapidly viable. In an interview with Michael Kraft CEO of the Coretec group he highlighted the properties of these new solutions and analyzed which materials could contribute to the development of e-mobility.

“Our focus is on advanced materials that enable next-generation technologies in the global challenge area. Semiconductors solar panels LEDs and silicon anode next-generation batteries for high power and fast charging. We’re always looking for additional materials that enable these next-generation technologies materials companies to partner with or acquire. Currently we are putting a majority of our resources into the commercialization of cyclohexasilane” said Kraft.

The company based in New York City but with roots in the Midwest believes this and a few other new materials will be applicable to several markets including energy storage solar solid state lighting printable electronics and 3D displays. Kraft pointed out that the company’s product portfolio is based on the production of silicon products starting with cyclohexasilane (Si 6 H 12 or simply CHS) a liquid that converts to pure silicon when exposed to heat or UV radiation; it is amorphous silicon but becomes crystalline silicon as exposure increases.

CHS is the key element for advanced energy storage applications.

Through a partnership with Evonik (a specialty chemicals company in Germany) the Coretec Group is providing customers with CHS samples for evaluation. For production scale Evonik can easily supply large-scale quantities. CHS can be varied in purity to meet specific application needs with pricing correlated to level of purity.

“Coretec Cyclohexasilane is ideal for applications where purity safety fast deposition rate and low-temperature deposition of silicon and/or doped silicon (C Ge B Co and P) are important” commented Kraft.

Electric vehicles (EVs)

Electric vehicles are an environmentally friendly alternative to their common petrol-powered counterparts but they lack one crucial quality: convenience. The EV infrastructure and battery capacities are not comparable with current vehicles. While there seems to be a petrol station every meter electric vehicle charging stations are not yet common which means that drivers have to make detailed charging plans well in advance of their journey. An efficient infrastructure with fast charging and a long-range battery should contribute to the success of EVs.

Many manufacturers are looking for new solutions (materials) to overcome the limitations of graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries. New silicon anode battery technology promises to charge batteries quickly to over 80% of their capacity in 5-10 minutes without physically damaging the battery while also increasing the energy density by 2-3×.

Upcoming Gen 2.0 lithium-ion batteries will see new materials incorporated to increase energy density and solve swelling problems. Kraft highlighted how many companies are working with materials engineers to add nanotechnology into the manufacturing process including incorporating silicon precursors such as cyclohexasilane.

Kraft explained how CHS offers a much faster rate of device fabrication than traditional precursors and more importantly generates amorphous nanostructures which means batteries can be charged quickly without swelling. Such material also helps to withstand many charges and discharge cycles an important consideration for e-mobility.

“Coretec Cyclohexasilane makes it possible to increase energy density by replacing the graphite anode commonly used in lithium-ion batteries with silicon-carbon nanostructures and alloys. These materials store more lithium ions increasing energy density while reducing eventual destruction” said Kraft.

Cyclohexasilane is a liquid silicon precursor for lithium-ion battery anode applications. Its liquid state offers advantages for processing low-cost carbon-silicon nanostructures as a direct replacement for graphite in high-energy lithium ions. A key advantage is the high charge/discharge life cycle and higher energy density.

Kraft pointed out that Tesla stated it is moving towards the silicon anode solution representing a significant milestone for EV batteries. Consumers demand a battery that can charge faster travel farther and last longer and today’s materials do not adequately address this challenge.

New features for SiC manufacturing

Power electronics is evolving at an impressive pace through wide bandgap material needs. Power electronics for EVs can effectively be enhanced with Silicon Carbide solutions that meet design parameters and make an essential contribution to system performance and long-term reliability.

Silicon carbide (SiC) devices are increasingly used in high-voltage power converters with strict requirements regarding size weight and efficiency because they offer a number of attractive characteristics when compared with commonly used silicon (Si) devices. The on-state resistance and switching losses are considerably lower and SiC provides about 3× more thermal conductivity than silicon allowing faster heat dissipation from components. This is important because when Si-based devices become smaller in terms of area it becomes more difficult to extract the heat generated by electrical conversion processes and SiC dissipates the heat better.

SiC wafers are very complex compared to traditional silicon wafers and as the market demands them a number of barriers need to be resolved when it comes to mass commercialization and total replacement of more traditional forms of silicon. Silicon precursors known as cyclohexasilane (CHS) can help.

High-performance SiC devices have been limited by the inability to grow SiC films on semiconductor wafers with low defect density as well as the additional difficulties of adhering the SiC layer to the substrate: α-SiC (e.g. 4H-SiC 6H-SiC) and β-SiC (3C-SiC) are well-known examples.

The wide adoption of β-SiC as an alternative material for power electronics presents several challenges. One in particular is the need for a silicon precursor that is not only economical but chemically viable to develop advanced films and strutures of SiC devices.

CHS can create β-SiC thin films on a variety of substrates under normal conditions. In addition CHS allows easy p-doping of materials into β-SiC films. This precursor can help the development of power electronics by simplifying the process from transport to storage and silicon deposition. Kraft pointed out that CHS offers the potential to overcome the historical limitations of SiC semiconductor production in a cost-effective way.

The autonomy of an electric car directly reflects the efficiency of its powertrain and energy management system. In addition to the necessary infrastructures such as powerful fast-charging systems available everywhere the EV must have improved SiC power electronics and a silicon-based anode battery with higher energy density and improved charging times. Electric Vehicles with these improvements will not only be adopted at a large scale and replace today’s petrol vehicle but they will create the sustainable e-mobility future the world needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY5NDMzMjIwMzI0Nzc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photo-reduction synthesis of Cu nanoparticles as plasmon-driven non-semiconductor photocatalyst for overall water ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169433220324776 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY5NDMzMjIwMzI0Nzc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIwMzI0NDE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black phosphorus-based semiconductor multi-heterojunction TiO2-BiVO4-BP/RP film with an in situ junction and Z ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385894720324414 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIwMzI0NDE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY5NDMzMjIwMzI0ODQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reactivity of different nitriding agents with chlorine-terminated surface during atomic layer deposition of silicon nitride,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169433220324843 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY5NDMzMjIwMzI0ODQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Niels Teusink of Dutch cybersecurity firm EYE discovered a secret hardcoded administrative account in the latest 4.60 patch 0 firmware for some Zyxel devices.

$ ssh zyfwp@192.168.1.252 Password: Pr ******* Xp Router> show users current No: 1 Name: zyfwp Type: admin (...) Router>

This account does not show in the Zyxel user interface and has a login name of 'zyfwp' and a static plain-text password. Due to the severity of this vulnerability BleepingComputer decided not to publish the password.

Teusink found that the account could be used to log into vulnerable devices over both SSH and the web interface. Since the SSL VPN interface operates on the same port as the web interface Teusink found that many users have allowed port 443 to be accessible on the Internet.

""As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally more than 100.000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet"" Teusink reported.

VPN device vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous as they can be used to create new VPN accounts to gain access to an internal network or create port forwarding rules to make internal services publicly accessible.

""Someone could for example change firewall settings to allow or block certain traffic. They could also intercept traffic or create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device. Combined with a vulnerability like Zerologon this could be devastating to small and medium businesses"" Teusink warned.

These types of vulnerabilities have become a favorite among threat actors who are known to exploit Pulse Secure Fortinet and Citrix Netscaler VPN vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware or compromise internal corporate networks to steal data.

Administrators of affected devices should upgrade their devices to the latest firmware as soon as possible.

Zyxel releases new firmware for firewalls

In an advisory Zyxel thanked EYE's for their disclosure and stated that they used the hardcoded credentials to deliver automatic firmware updates via FTP.

""A hardcoded credential vulnerability was identified in the “zyfwp” user account in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP"" states Zyxel's advisory.

Zyxel has released ZLD V4.60 Patch 1 to remove the hardcoded credentials in vulnerable ATP USG USG Flex and VPN devices. Zyxel states that ATP USG USG FLEX and VPN firewalls using earlier firmware or SD-OS are not affected.

The patch for NXC AP controllers is expected to be released in April 2021.

The table of affected Zyxel products and the patch availability is below.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Richison purchased the Tuscan-style home for $26.5 million.

The Il Pelicano estate was occupied by sellers Liz Edlich a skincare entrepreneur and trial attorney Dale Kinsella. The estate was originally purchased back in 2000 for $2 million.

Free from neighbors and direct access to two private beaches nearby.

The home features a long and steep driveway blending into the rocks leading down the Pacific Coast Highway and into a private motor court.

Over the next twelve years the couple had received numerous permits to enhance the two story 3800-square-foot four bedroom four and a half bathrooms and manages to blend into its natural surroundings.

When you first step on the porch you are greeted by antique doors imported from France along with home exterior and imported stone from Italy.

Inside the home is filled with one-of-a-kind artifacts from Edlich travels.

The chandelier hanging in the kitchen came from a fossilized Amazonian jungle vine. The intricately carved mantle hanging over the fireplace was originally part of an antique stone door purchased in India. Another personal touch is going to be a hand carved ceiling fan shipped from Sri Lanka that is 200 years old. The sink within the powder room is made up of fossilized clam shell that was pulled from the bottom of the ocean.

Richison 50 first started out his career in sales for ADP before his journey as founder of Paycom in 1998. The Oklahoma native start up is one of the original first companies to process payroll completely online.

The Kentucky Republican argued on the Senate floor Wednesday the measure has ""no realistic path to quickly pass the Senate"" while Democrats and some Republicans unsuccessfully pushed for a vote on $2000 stimulus checks before the Senate adjourned Friday.

In response several people tried to demand the money from the Senate majority leader directly using Venmo and PayPal.

""I'm getting that stimulus check one way or another"" one Twitter user wrote Tuesday one day before McConnell blocked the bill's quick passage. The person included a screenshot of a Venmo request for $2000 sent to an account named Mitch McConnell that had the senator's headshot as its profile picture.

""(I)’ll be venmo requesting mitch mcconnell for $2000 every day this year"" another person tweeted.

Another person said they couldn't find a Venmo account for McConnell so they ""took it to PayPal"" which allows users to send emailed requests for money even to people who don't have an account.

A spokesperson for McConnell did not answer an email from The Courier Journal asking for a response to the requests.

During his floor speech Wednesday McConnell said ""the Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of Democrats' rich friends who don't need the help.""

Travel perks still aren’t what they used to be and it’s going to be at least 3-6 more months before they are once again. For travel heavy premium credit cards that means it’s time to get creative. Once again American Express has. After offering $20 monthly credits last year for streaming or mobile devices Amex is offering a broader credit for 2021 with $30 in monthly PayPal credits for 6 months. Here’s everything you need to know.

Amex Platinum PayPal Credit For 2021

If you have the personal Amex Platinum Card in the USA congrats you just got $30 of your PayPal purchases covered each month for the first six months of the year. That’s $180 towards purchases you make with PayPal including shopping at most major retailers.

The only catch – person to person transactions don’t count. With the $30 credit the amount will automatically come off of any tallies you rack up over the month. So if you were to buy some Yeezy’s for $200 you’d receive a credit back of $30 making it $170.

Good to know: the credit resets monthly so if you don’t spend at least $30 in PayPal each month you won’t get the full $180 in perks over the six months. You’ll basically want to spend at least $30 each month via PayPal. If you don’t already it’s quite handy for shopping since it saves all your details and makes checkout both faster and more secure.

PayPal and Amex have a partnership explainer page which hammers out the rest of the details you might be curious about. For example – all transactions must be made in USD.

With an annual fee of $550 on the Platinum Card $180 back in the first six months plus all the 18+ other useful money saving benefits like $180 in Uber credits $100 Saks credit and a $200 airline fee credit plus Fine Hotels & Resorts offers still makes this a compelling card.

If you don’t already have the Amex Platinum Card Amex is currently offering a sign up bonus of 75000 Membership Rewards Points plus 10X points on the first 6 months of gas and groceries which can add up quickly.

PayPal has been a popular partner with credit cards in recent months as Capital One added its name to the list of rewards points currencies which you can redeem directly on PayPal to cover some or all of a purchase instead of paying cash.

Amex has long offered integrations with Amazon and PayPal to present ways to use points for daily online purchases directly but they typically don’t represent the best value. That honor still goes to travel and holding onto American Express Membership Rewards points for when travel recovers is most likely the way to go.

For him and his ilk Bitcoin is an asset in which funds may be parked (and hopefully grow in value) while mostly outside the reach of the government-managed economic system. Like goldbugs they have a distrust of federal authority and think that the economic lesson of the Covid-19 crisis is that scarcity reigns—in fact should reign—and that central banks by simply printing money through quantitative easing and relief efforts like the Cares Act are risking inflation and cheapening the value of the dollar. The virtue of Bitcoin is that it’s limited—according to the code underpinning the cryptocurrency only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be “minted” with about 18.5 million already in circulation—so better to get in as soon as possible. Even Saylor who has also called Bitcoin “digital gold” has his regrets about not buying more earlier: “I wish I knew then what I know now” he told a journalist in September.

Saylor described his company’s decision as a way of dodging inflation taxes and fees and putting extra capital to more productive use. He says that the company will hold onto its Bitcoin for 100 years . But a company struggling to increase revenue that chooses to put its cash reserves into a speculative digital cryptocurrency is reason enough to take pause . Saylor and MicroStrategy’s history of alleged fraud is another one."

It was these innovative thoughtfully considered features combined with the package’s eye-catching graphics as well as its high scores in the areas of economics marketing performance environmental impact and “Save Food criteria” that led judges of the 2020 AmeriStar Awards to honor the 16-oz Mtn Dew Game Fuel can with the competition’s Design Excellence Award.

As Colin Haynes Associate Principal Engineer – PepsiCo Packaging R&D explains the Dew marketing team has played a role within the gaming space for the last 15 years. “Through various partnerships and activations in that time we gained valuable insights into what gamers are looking for” he says. “Dew identified an opportunity to create a beverage specifically for gamers and what better way to do so than by working with them.”

Mtn Dew Game Fuel is specially crafted for gamers with theanine and caffeine which in combination have been shown to improve accuracy and alertness PepsiCo explains. The functional beverage is available in multiple flavor options in the resealable can “so both the beverage and packaging aid gamers in their quest for being the best” the company says.

Packaging for Game Fuel was developed in partnership with gaming pros and elite amateurs. “Gamers were involved at the very beginning during concept development and later when vetting prototypes” Haynes explains. “To create a product that was authentic to the gaming space Dew hosted multiple focus groups to understand what players are looking for in a drink including taste and benefits. Dew learned that gamers wanted a beverage container that was resealable in order to protect their expensive gaming equipment from spills easy to open and close with one hand—allowing them to stay in the game—and wouldn’t slip out of their hand. Each of these insights was addressed with the final Mtn Dew Game Fuel can.”

The can’s most innovative feature is its resealable closure which makes Game Fuel the first to nationally scale the use of a resealable aluminum can. The resealable closure is supplied by Xolution GmbH which refined the plastic component for PepsiCo’s needs. According to PepsiCo’s AmeriStar entry form the consumer experience with the XO System closure is related to but still distinct from a standard end. “The opening of the Game Fuel can begins with the familiar motion of lifting a tab. From that point forward the experience is unique and exciting” the entry form explains. “The consumer grabs the lifted tab and slides it back until it passes over a detent locking it open and revealing the drinking aperture. After consuming the beverage (either a sip or half the can) the process is reversed. The tab is slid forward (until a soft click is heard) to cover the drinking aperture. With the slider fully forward and covering the etched line the tab can be pushed down creating a gas-tight and liquid-tight seal.”

Refinements by Xolution included reducing the opening force of the tab from approximately 25N (newtons) to 20N which PepsiCo says is lower than current non-resealable ends. In addition insights from focus groups also led to a design feature that addressed an issue with users damaging the resealing mechanism. The new feature a biaxially-oriented polypropylene tamper band is placed such that if visible it indicates the end is not fully closed. When the feature is completely covered it means the end is fully resealed and is protected from damage.

During development PepsiCo conducted extensive testing to quantify carbon retention. CO 2 measurements were taken weekly and the data showed that the cans met all performance parameters. According to the company “Whether the can has been opened by the consumer or direct from the filling plant once the can is resealed the product is protected from CO 2 egress and foreign object ingress. This exceeds the protection requirements normally assigned to products in cans.” The shelf life for Mtn Dew Game Fuel in the resealable can is 20 weeks.

To enable speed-to-market of the product and minimize capital expenditure the Game Fuel can was designed to work with all existing PepsiCo filling infrastructure. The can is filled on existing fillers from various suppliers seamed by multiple models of Angelus seamers and packed into existing secondary packaging used for standard 16-oz cans. At most of the production locations PepsiCo is now using automatic debagging and lid-feed systems from CSW Can Systems Worldwide which can run both resealable and standard ends leading to efficiency gains for both.

But the can’s resealability is just one of the functional features incorporated into the Game Fuel can that make it more convenient for video gamers at play. Another is the use of tactile ink technology from can suppliers Ball and MCC that helps consumers keep a grip on the can. The tactile ink is combined with standard inks adding a matte/gloss combination effect that helps the can visually pop on the shelf. Graphics include a bright stripe of color that signifies the flavor variant—e.g. blue for Charged Berry Blast red for Charged Cherry Burst etc.—next to a stripe of black bringing to mind the black of gaming consoles.

Additionally there are opening instructions etched on the can end as well as printed on the can body depending on where the beverage is distributed. In California opening instructions on the end were replaced with deposit information to comply with local laws. Game Fuel advertising highlights that resealing the can helps keep the beverage “fresh and your hardware dry so you can focus on grinding.”

Another significant feature of the Game Fuel can that caught AmeriStar judges’ attention certainly my own was its recyclability. According to PepsiCo during development of the can PepsiCo Packaging R&D collaborated with Xolution and Waste Management to identify recyclers with the ability to shred the cans prior to sortation to remove the plastic component and a network was created. Explains PepsiCo “Once shredded the plastic pieces fully separate from the aluminum and can be removed using existing technology (i.e. eddy current separators) prior to the aluminum entering the de-lacquering furnace. Thanks to these two methods we have identified the appropriate ‘graves’ for this packaging and are proud to say that the can is recyclable.”

Launched in 2019 Game Fuel has been a significant contributor to revenue growth for PepsiCo. Noted the entry form “It continually exceeded plans and this trend looks to continue for the remainder of the year.”

For soda and sparkling water lovers across the globe the invention of the SodaStream is the next best thing since sliced bread. According to a 2018 Motley Fool article SodaStream has been around since 1903 and was birthed by a gin distiller out of London who found a way to ""fizz up"" beverages. The whole concept of making carbonated beverages in your own home really took off in the 1970s. Fast-forward to the present day and one in every four homes in Sweden has one of these gadgets while the United States made up 32 percent of new sales for the PepsiCo-owned company.

If you are not familiar with how the SodaStream works you may become a believer and decide you need one once you do. It's a fairly simple and straight forward process. Per the SodaStream website all you need is regular old cold tap water. Fill up the SodaStream BPA-free reusable bottle and place it into your sparkling water maker. Your machine comes equipped with a CO2 cylinder ready for action. Once you have your water in place just press the carbonating button and voila you have carbonated water ready for whatever added flavor your taste buds desire. But what happens when you run out of CO2?",,,

The decision represents the conclusion of a complex and public kabuki dance between the Food and Drug Administration Pfizer and vaccine volunteers as well as with Moderna which developed its own Covid-19 vaccine. The FDA and its advisers pushed hard for volunteers to remain on placebo as long as possible to gather more safety and efficacy data about the vaccines while the companies argued volunteers should receive the vaccines sooner for both ethical and practical reasons.

Among some trial participants the issue had become fraught with many protesting further delays in heated messages on social media and in letters to media organizations including STAT.

Michael Tovar a volunteer who had been publicly campaigning for Pfizer to offer the vaccine more quickly to participants in the 44000-person clinical trial thanked the company and its chief executive on Twitter.

“Thank you for listening and for changing your study protocol to allow for speedy vaccination of your placebo arm” Tovar wrote. “You have made this New Year so much brighter for the 22000 placebo volunteers that stepped up for this vaccine.”

advertisement

Pfizer and BioNTech revealed the decision on a website for clinical trial participants and in a letter obtained by STAT that was sent to researchers conducting the clinical trial.

The letter to researchers indicated they are also asking participants to take additional Covid tests to be conducted by clinical trial volunteers at home to help understand whether the vaccine which reduces symptomatic infections by 95% also prevents asymptomatic infection. The answer to that question is important; currently there is no way to know whether people who received the vaccine can still transmit it to others.

In medicine the most reliable answers about treatments and preventatives come from double-blind placebo-controlled trials. This means that patients are randomly assigned to receive either the treatment in this case a vaccine or placebo. Neither they nor their doctor knows what they have received. In many trials such as those for cancer it’s simply assumed that patients who received placebo will get the treatment once the study is completed. This step is known as crossover.

But the matter of how placebo crossover should be handled during a pandemic was left open by both the FDA and the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed effort which sped vaccine development when the studies began in July. Consent forms given to volunteers obtained by STAT made no mention of when or if those who received placebo would get the two-dose vaccine.

At a Dec. 10 meeting of an advisory committee regarding the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine the FDA discussed how the placebo crossover should be handled. At that session Steven Goodman associate dean of clinical and translational research at the Stanford University School of Medicine argued that there was no ethical reason that volunteers in the placebo group deserved to receive vaccine before the general public.

Newsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy

Goodman laid out a complicated scheme known as a double-blind crossover study in which all volunteers who wanted to be sure they received the vaccine would be offered two more shots. Those who had received the vaccine would be offered placebo and those who had received placebo would be offered the vaccine.

William Gruber one of Pfizer’s top vaccine executives argued that this plan was unworkable. Essentially it would require running a large part of the study a second time.

Instead Pfizer set out a plan in which volunteers who wanted the vaccine could receive it when they would be eligible to receive the vaccine in their local area. Health care personnel or residents in long-term care facilities who were already eligible to be vaccinated would get the vaccine immediately.

“If you are not health care personnel or a resident in a long-term care facility (or in any other future added group) we will discuss an option to transition from the placebo group to the vaccine group at your fourth study visit approximately six months after you originally received your second injection” a letter sent to participants in late December said. “We respectfully ask that you wait until Study Visit #4 to discuss the Vaccine Transition Option.”

This complicated process was moving forward quickly because many of the participants in the study were health care providers. According to the letter obtained by STAT 2000 volunteers who received placebo have already gotten their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. But it was clear that others would have to wait.

But then on Dec. 17 the FDA held another advisory meeting this time for Moderna’s vaccine which had been developed more closely with Operation Warp Speed. Again Goodman made his presentation. A researcher representing Moderna made a case as Pfizer had that his idea was impractical and laid out a plan for giving placebo-receiving volunteers the vaccine much faster than Pfizer would. They would not have to wait until they were eligible to get vaccinated outside the trial.

The FDA’s advisers spent considerable time comparing Goodman’s plan to Moderna’s eventually agreeing that Goodman’s was unworkable. But they spent little time comparing Pfizer’s plan which delayed vaccine longer to Moderna’s.

That left Pfizer in a bind as more and more volunteers publicly protested that they should be offered the vaccine if they received placebo.

Alan S. Goldsmith a retired physician in Florida who volunteered for the Pfizer trial told STAT that he and his wife who also volunteered for the study did not even expect they’d get the vaccine if they were in the placebo group. They just wanted to know if they had already received the vaccine.

“What it would allow us to do is know our vaccination status which might allow a little more freedom to do things like visit our grandchildren” he wrote.

On Dec. 23 Moncef Slaoui the head of Operation Warp Speed told reporters that he thought volunteers who had received placebo should receive the vaccine at once contradicting the FDA. He also called the Pfizer plan intellectually elegant but impractical saying that with different requirements for vaccination in all 50 states it would be difficult to administer.

Pfizer was apparently already working to make its plan for crossover more like Moderna’s. New language posted on its website for trial participants on New Year’s Eve stated that vaccine doses had been secured and that it and BioNTech aimed for all participants who received the placebo to have the opportunity to get their first dose of the vaccine by March 1 if they choose to.

A letter from Nicholas Kitchin a senior director in Pfizer’s vaccine clinical research and development group struck a cheerful tone for a clinical document.

“We recognize that our clinical trial participants are selfless volunteers who have made the important choice to make a difference and fight this pandemic” Kitchin wrote.



“While the study continues to be blinded to answer important public health questions such as persistence of protection longer term safety and protection from asymptomatic infections we are committed to ensuring that our trial participants are recognized for their contributions and that placebo recipients who wish to can receive BNT162b2 within the study.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9wZml6ZXItYmlvbnRlY2gtb2ZmZXItY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS12b2x1bnRlZXJzLXdoby1nb3QtcGxhY2Viby0yMDIxLTAxLTAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer and BioNTech to offer COVID vaccine to volunteers who got placebo,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-biontech-offer-covid-vaccine-volunteers-who-got-placebo-2021-01-01/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9wZml6ZXItYmlvbnRlY2gtb2ZmZXItY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS12b2x1bnRlZXJzLXdoby1nb3QtcGxhY2Viby0yMDIxLTAxLTAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIxLzEvMS9jb3ZpZC1iaW9udGVjaC1mb3VuZGVycy13YXJuLW9mLXZhY2NpbmUtc3VwcGx5LWdhcHPSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9lY29ub215LzIwMjEvMS8xL2NvdmlkLWJpb250ZWNoLWZvdW5kZXJzLXdhcm4tb2YtdmFjY2luZS1zdXBwbHktZ2Fwcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID: BioNTech founders warn of vaccine supply gaps,"Scientists fear shortages because other vaccines are not being approved leaving Pfizer-BioNTech to fill gap.

BioNTech is working flat out with partner Pfizer to boost production of their COVID-19 vaccine its founders have said warning there would be gaps in supply until other vaccines were rolled out.

The German biotech startup has led the vaccine race but its shot has been slow to arrive in the European Union due to relatively slow approval from the bloc’s health regulator and the small size of the order placed by Brussels.

The delays have caused consternation in Germany where some regions had to temporarily close vaccination centres days after the launch of an inoculation drive on December 27.

“At the moment it doesn’t look good – a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel in an interview.

A shot from Moderna is expected to be cleared by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on January 6.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn has urged the EMA to also quickly approve a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca that Britain cleared this week. The EU timeline for that treatment remains uncertain.

Sahin said the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus should be able to cope with a variant first detected in Britain that appears to be more contagious.

“We are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralise this variant and will soon know more” he said.

Asked about coping with a strong mutation he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks – though such new treatments might require additional regulatory approvals.

New production line planned

Sahin founded BioNTech with his wife Oezlem Tuereci who is the company’s chief medical officer. Both criticised the EU’s decision to spread orders in the expectation that more vaccines would be quickly approved.

The United States ordered 600 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine in July while the EU waited until November to place an order of half that size.

“At some point it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver so quickly” Tuereci told Spiegel. “By then it was already too late to place follow-on orders.”

BioNTech hopes to launch a new production line in Marburg Germany in February that could produce 250 million doses in the first half of the year said Sahin.

Talks are under way with contract manufacturers on boosting output and there should be greater clarity by the end of January he added.

Sahin also said BioNTech would make its vaccine which requires storage at around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) easier to handle.

A next-generation vaccine that would keep at higher temperatures could be ready by late summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9ub3QtZXZlcnlvbmUtd2lsbC1nZXQtdGhlLWV4YWN0LXNhbWUtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS13aGF0LXRvLWtub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not everyone will get the exact same COVID-19 vaccine. What to know,"The first wave of coronavirus vaccinations is finally underway and with it comes a heap of questions. Are there different kinds of coronavirus vaccines and when might you get one? Before vaccines started being administered the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prioritized which groups should get the very first available doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (the agency continues to update its guidance). However states aren't required to follow the CDC's lead and some have already started bucking the federal agency's guidelines in favor of their own priority lists.

Regardless of who's first in line for a coronavirus vaccine more are on the way and with them more questions. Who will get those other vaccines and how soon can you expect to be protected against COVID-19?

With more than a dozen COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in late-stage clinical trials and dozens more not too far behind it's now evident that not everyone in the world will get the same vaccine. Not only are there different manufacturers -- AstraZeneca Johnson & Johnson Norovax and so on -- but each vaccine is delivered and works a little differently from the others. Most COVID-19 vaccines come in the form of a shot but some are patches and others you can swallow as pills. The vast majority require at least two doses but a few are expected to provide effective immunity after just one.

That means it's possible some vaccines may be reserved for certain groups instead of others based on how the drugs act in the body or how they're delivered. For example some single-dose vaccines might better serve low population density rural communities whereas city dwellers and suburbanites who live closer to more health care providers may get vaccines that require subsequent ""booster"" doses.

The vast majority of coronavirus vaccines are still under development and the science continues to evolve so nothing is set in stone just yet. Here we paint in broad strokes a picture of what the coming vaccine landscape may look like. We'll continue to update this story as new information comes to light. This article is intended to be a general overview and not a source of medical advice.

Not all COVID-19 vaccines will need to be injected -- some can be delivered without a needle. Sarah Tew/CNET

Pfizer and Moderna are available now

What they are: Both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are mRNA or ""genetic"" vaccines an entirely new class of drugs that are unstable at room temperature and must be kept frozen until right before they're dispensed.

When they're coming: Both have been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration and are currently being administered to priority individuals like health care workers as well as nursing home residents and staff.

Who they might be best for: So far nursing home staff and residents and front-line health care workers.

Refrigeration: Pfizer's vaccine requires long-term storage colder than Antarctica: minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. It can then be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures of 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to five days. Moderna's needs temperatures that a commercial deep freezer could probably handle for long-term storage: minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. It keeps at typical refrigerator temperatures (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 days.

Dosing: Both vaccines require an initial injection followed by a booster shot several weeks later.

The frist vaccines are being dispensed to priority groups like front-line health care workers and older adults. Sarah Tew/CNET

Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine could be next

What it is: Once the frontrunner in the race for a coronavirus vaccine the candidate developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has run into a few snags along the way which have delayed its application for authorization.

When it's coming: The UK approved the vaccine just days before the start of 2021 but the FDA won't approve it in the US until clinical trials wrap up here possibly as soon as February or March.

Refrigeration: A standard refrigerator could handle it: 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

Dosing: Two doses originally intended to be spaced one month apart. Referring to unpublished results of the trial however regulators in the UK have authorized a three-month gap between doses saying the data supports that window as the more effective time scale.

Novavax shows promise and an advantage

What it is: The Novavax coronavirus vaccine is in late-stage clinical trials. Though it isn't on the road to approval yet this vaccine shows promise in its high efficacy and its stability in regular refrigeration conditions versus deep-freeze conditions. That could make it more practical for wider distribution.

When it's coming: Likely sometime in the first half of 2021.

Refrigeration: Standard refrigeration needs at 39 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

Dosing: Two doses spaced three weeks apart plus an adjuvant which is a second drug that helps the vaccine work better.

With several different coronavirus vaccines likely to be authorized in 2021 the next challenge will be figuring out which one's best for you. Sarah Tew/CNET

Needle-free vaccine delivery from Inovio

What it is: Instead of a syringe and needleInovio's unique system uses an electrical pulse to deliver the vaccine into the body where it can trigger an immune response.

When it's coming: Inovio just began midstage clinical trials in December so a summer 2021 release might be a realistic expectation if all goes well with the studies.

Who it might be best for: Children and adults with an intense fear of needles; people in developing areas where safe needle disposal is a challenge.

Refrigeration: Can be kept at room temperature.

Dosing: Two doses delivered with a patch four weeks apart.

There's no guarantee that any of the as-yet unauthorized vaccines listed above will be cleared by the FDA for emergency use nor do any of the timelines take into account the potential for future snags or delays. We'll update this article as new information surfaces and continue to add more vaccines to this list as it becomes clearer when other manufacturers might apply for authorization as well as which groups are likely to receive them.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved by the bloc late last month after being accepted by the UK Canada and the US. They and other countries have also since approved the Moderna or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine leaving the EU trailing behind.

With criticism growing of the slow pace of the EU’s vaccine programme Uğur Şahin thehead of the German biotech firm told Der Spiegel that the order process in Europe “certainly did not go as fast and smooth as it did with other countries”.

Şahin who founded BioNtech with his wife Özlem Türeci – the firm’s chief medical officer – said the situation was “not rosy” as the EU had wrongly assumed several different vaccines would be ready at once so spread its orders.

“The assumption was that many other companies would come up with their vaccines” Şahin said. “It would seem that the impression was: ‘We’ll get enough it won’t be so bad and we have this under control.’ It surprised me.”

Türeci told the magazine the EU had assumed there would be “a basket of different suppliers” to choose from. “Such an approach makes sense. But then at some point it became clear that many would be unable to deliver so quickly” she said. “By that time it was too late to make up for under-ordering.”

The US ordered 600m doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine in July while the EU waited until November to order half as many. Şahin said the firms were now working flat-out to increase production and “fill a hole due to a lack of other approved vaccines”.

He said BioNTech aimed to get a new manufacturing plant up and running in Marburg Germany in February “far earlier than planned”. It should be able to produce 250m doses in the first half of 2021.

Tureci said the firm had also signed deals with five other pharmaceutical companies in Europe to increase production and were negotiating with others. “By the end of January we should have clarity on how much more we can produce” Şahin said.

The Moderna vaccine should be cleared on 6 January by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which is under mounting pressure to quickly approve the Oxford vaccine which was cleared this week by Britain.

Delays in producing and distributing the BioNtech vaccine have caused consternation in Germany where the focus has been on immunising elderly people in care homes with some regions having to halt vaccination programmes within days of starting them.

Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn said earlier this week he had been bombarded with mail from people complaining about citizens not getting quick enough access to the vaccine despite it being made in Germany.

He defended EU health ministers’ decision to take a united approach rather than each country operating alone arguing that having a united front meant smaller less wealthy member states could have access to it at the same time as wealthier ones.

Spahn said Germany – which has so far inoculated 130000 people – had taken delivery of 1.3m doses so far. But some of the 400-plus vaccine centres have had to temporarily close due to a lack of supplies.

There have been similar complaints in France where just 322 people have been vaccinated prompting the government to promise that health workers aged over 50 could get the vaccine from Monday sooner than originally planned.

Italy has so far vaccinated 8300 people and Spain said it was on track to have administered 1.3m doses.

A spokesperson for the French government Gabriel Attal defended the pace of France’s campaign on Friday saying it was targeting care homes for the elderly and was “not going to judge a vaccination campaign that will last six months on a few days”.

The health minister Olivier Véran announced on Thursday evening that the vaccine would be made available earlier than planned to older health workers. Ministers and officials had been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers by going too slowly.

Quick Guide How does the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine work? Show The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab is an mRNA vaccine. Essentially mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (“transcribed”) into a piece of mRNA which in turn gets “read” by the cell’s tools for synthesising proteins. In the case of an mRNA vaccine the virus’s mRNA is injected into the muscle and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins – which can’t by themselves cause disease – just as if they’d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that studies suggest lasts for some time. The two first Covid-19 vaccines to announce phase 3 three trial results were mRNA-based. They were first off the blocks because as soon as the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 was known – it was published by the Chinese in January 2020 – companies that had been working on this technology were able to start producing the virus’s mRNA. Making conventional vaccines takes much longer. Adam Finn professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre University of Bristol Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

“Some of you have questioned the rhythm of the Covid-19 vaccination in France a few days after it began in Europe” Véran tweeted.

“Some countries have already vaccinated a lot; others haven’t started. Be reassured. The vaccine campaign will soon pick up speed. The vaccine is a historic opportunity to end this epidemic and return to normal life and we will not miss it.”

In his new year address President Emmanuel Macron said he would not allow an “unjustified delay” in the inoculation of the population to happen for “bad reasons”. The president called on people to trust their doctors and scientists.

French officials had admitted they were taking a “marathon not sprint” approach to vaccination after running into strong public opposition.

A Europe-wide poll by Ipsos showed that only 40% of French people questioned said they were willing to have a Covid-19 jab. France says those receiving the vaccine must give written consent after being fully informed of possible side-effects and time to consider whether they want it.

Opposition politicians and doctors have criticised this approach."

PG Tips has long been a household staple in Britain. Initially celebrated for its memorable advertising campaigns featuring its iconic monkeys and renowned comedians like Peter Sellers Bob Monkhouse and Johnny Vegas the tea brand gradually lost its resonance with modern audiences.

Around a decade ago it fell into severe neglect. The monkeys were retired the brand ambassadors appeared outdated and its parent company Unilever significantly reduced its advertising investments.

Today it’s back on TV screens for the first time in eight years with a new brand campaign aptly titled ‘It’s Not Just Tea. It’s Progress’. For its huge return PG Tips has enlisted legendary director Steve McQueen with Top Boy actor and acclaimed musician Ashley Walters in front of the camera to excite a nation of tea drinkers. It’s the brainchild of indie agency Calling which is making a name for itself by modernizing heritage brands.

“We separated the tea business from Unilever just under two years ago” explains Karen Owen global senior marketing executive at Lipton Teas and Infusions. “PG Tips hasn’t really been invested in for many many years. So we said no this is the nation’s tea. It is the nation’s favorite tea.”

‘Rock Solid’ which is the first ad in this new approach forms part of a £12m marketing push that aims to help PG Tips reclaim a place at the heart of modern British culture as well as connect with a younger demographic of tea drinkers.

Owen continues: “When you look at Gen Z culture there’s a real fear of burnout. They are not interested in coffee because that’s burnout culture; it’s pushing the problem down the road. They are much more about recovery and reconnecting with their self.”

It's an idea that Calling brought to the table in the formative chats with PG Tips. Owen says the initial storyboard had relatively few tweaks and the whole team was beyond excited. “The way we positioned it in our strategy is that tea is recovery not a drug” says Calling co-founder and executive creative director Josh Tenser. “And that felt like a massive unlock for the value system of those younger audiences. And then we were like OK so what is it about recovery that people might want to lean into?”

Tea tends to have lower caffeine levels than coffee. Tenser says that this thought process led them to having a cup of tea while reconnecting and having a conversation with themselves.

What transpired in a powerful 70-second film tells the story of overcoming self-doubt and finding inner courage. In the spot viewers watch as Walters coaches himself out of the doldrums over a cup of PG Tips before inviting the nation to summon their self-belief and positivity too.

Tenser continues: “We wanted to use talent that shows the world what a progressive modern Britain could be like and that’s why Ashley is so great. He’s had ups and downs in life they’re well publicized. He’s a hero to so many people because he isn’t perfect but he’s been very open about his mental health.”

The other aspect that makes Walters such a brilliant choice to bring PG Tips back to the nation is that he connects with many audiences the ones that remember him from his music career and the newer fans that know him from acting in Top Boy.

Tenser says they knew that if they were going to bring back this heritage brand they had to have someone equally iconic behind the camera and that person was Steve McQueen. The 12 Years A Slave director doesn’t do a lot of commercials but apparently this one didn’t take a lot of convincing.

“One of the first comments Steve made when he started talking with us was that tea is the lifeblood of the nation” recalls Owen. “He grew up with PG Tips and he said ‘You know what it’s really important that we write something together that is about creating moments of progress.’ So we showed him the draft storyboard that we had and he came up with some amazing additions.”

It wasn’t like working with a typical commercial director; everyone on the team thought about this as more of a film than an ad. Walters talking directly to the audience through the TV screen feels personal and refreshing.

“It was amazing to work with Steve; he’s a wizard” adds Tenser. “There was just such a deep level of respect between Ashley and Steve that it made the whole thing. They both felt totally invested in each other. A different director talent combo wouldn’t have given you that beautiful comfort that you could feel in the performance.”

The ad is an address to the nation in a way. Gone are the days of the dreary grey day being made slightly better by a cuppa this is people’s moment to take a moment of reflection with themselves rain or shine.

“It’s a real honor to be working with such an iconic British brand and be part of a campaign that encourages taking time out putting the kettle on taking a break and giving ourselves some time to re-calibrate” added Walters. “We’ve all grown up with tea being a big part of our lives marking every occasion from starting the day to a family celebration. For me enjoying a cuppa is a moment to pause re-gather re-energize focus and then press play.”

It’s a long-term play for the brand. Recently there’s been a further £40m investment in new machinery training and blends at its Trafford Park site in Manchester. Owen says aside from traditional media they will be launching this campaign across social platforms too which is a key area for reaching younger audiences that are invested in the rising wellness trends. She believes firmly that tea can play a role in that.

“We’re not looking for everything to be perfect and polished. We want to understand what matters. And that’s how we’ll see the campaign evolve” she concludes.

“We don’t know quite what’s going to happen next but what we do know is it’s going to be about progress. And Steve when I was with him last week he’s said ‘So what are we going to do next?’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndib3kuY29tL2dvbGRhbmRibHVlbmF0aW9uL2RldnJpZXMtYWRkcy10b3AtYXZhaWxhYmxlLXBnLWphdm9uLXNtYWxsL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndib3kuY29tL2dvbGRhbmRibHVlbmF0aW9uL2RldnJpZXMtYWRkcy10b3AtYXZhaWxhYmxlLXBnLWphdm9uLXNtYWxsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DeVries adds top available PG Javon Small,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wboy.com/goldandbluenation/devries-adds-top-available-pg-javon-small/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndib3kuY29tL2dvbGRhbmRibHVlbmF0aW9uL2RldnJpZXMtYWRkcy10b3AtYXZhaWxhYmxlLXBnLWphdm9uLXNtYWxsL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndib3kuY29tL2dvbGRhbmRibHVlbmF0aW9uL2RldnJpZXMtYWRkcy10b3AtYXZhaWxhYmxlLXBnLWphdm9uLXNtYWxsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvbWFnaWMvbmV3cy9tYWdpYy1jYXZhbGllcnMtMjAyNC1uYmEtcGxheW9mZnMtZ2FtZS02LWNvbGUtYW50aG9ueS1qYW1haGwtbW9zbGV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Magic PG Cole Anthony Crucial in Game 6 Win vs. Cavaliers,"Orlando Magic point guard Cole Anthony stepped up in a big way to push their 2024 NBA Playoffs series against the Cleveland Cavaliers to Game 7.

ORLANDO — The Orlando Magic are heading to Game 7 after a strong 103-96 comeback win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night.

While Jalen Suggs Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero grabbed credit for being the heads of the snake Anthony played his best minutes of the series so far in Game 6.

Anthony played a series-high 19 minutes some as the closing lineup point guard in the win and scored nine points while doing so.

""I've lost a lot of trust with my lack of play this season"" Anthony said postgame. ""It's been a tough year. But at the end of the day I'm just here to try to help this team win.""

Anthony has struggled to adjust to his full-time bench role this season but he still finds ways to be productive. He's averaged 11.6 points this year which is the worst mark in his four seasons with the Magic. But even with his role changing coach Jamahl Mosley recognizes his value.

“He’s had a pop about him he had an energy about him"" Mosley said postgame. ""I think he got himself going a little bit early. I thought he did a great job defensively staying with the game plan. I think those are the things you look at throughout the game. I thought he did a tremendous job.”

Now with the team going to Game 7 Anthony's confidence is where it needs to be as he helps his team in the biggest game of the season — again.

The point was driven home in West Virginia last year when the Mountaineers parted company with coach Bob Huggins and had to rebuild their roster twice in one season while they had to try to negotiate their way through injuries and suspensions that turned the season into an Abbott and Costello routine of slapstick basketball.

Now they have a new coach in Drake’s successful mid-major leader Darian DeVries and he started completely over with only one returning player Ofri Naveh a late addition from Israel and with the transfer portal having just closed he and DeVries have found a way to add some important parts.

Turned out for one of those parts he only had to look across the dinner table to bring in his son Tucker who averaged 21.6 points per game for his father at Drake last year and carries an 18.0 career average with one year left to play.

That took care of the scoring guard but who would get him the ball?

Problem solved this week with the addition of Javon Small a skilled point guard from Oklahoma State to distribute the ball. It was such a big addition that WVU jumped its recruiting class out of the portal to No. 5 in the nation with still a lot of work to do.

But a roster is taking shape and Small is a big part of it.

Last season West Virginia only faced Oklahoma State and Small once which was probably not a scheduling gift to the Mountaineers as the Cowboys finished tied for last place in the Big 12 with an identical 4-14 conference record.

The tiebreaker went to the Cowboys however as they won that lone game played in Stillwater against WVU 70-66 and it was Small who made the difference in the game. Small’s bordered upon classic ash he scored 15 points on 5 of 6 shooting from the floor 2 of 3 from 3-point range while adding an expected 7 assists as he is a point guard.

But 12 rebounds too.

This in and of itself would tend to create euphoria among the Mountaineer faithful but one would expect that DeVries studied more than just that game film.

See the reality is that there was no defense for the way West Virginia played defense last season.

The Mountaineers ranked 303rd in the nation in points allowed giving up 76.8 per game including 81 or more in the last five games and 90 or more in four of those final five games.

Individual players feasted on openings in the defense be it from outside the 3-point line or inside the paint.

Seven different players scored 29 or more points against West Virginia and it was capped off in the Big 12 Tournament loss to Cincinnati when Day Day Thomas had 29 and Simas Lukosius 31 in the same game.

So it is best that you not expect 25 points a night from Small when he wears the WVU jersey but know that he can score and led Oklahoma State with 15.9 points a game this season.

More important though is that Small is known as a solid defender something the man he replaces Kerr Kriisa could not claim and that they will find out in Kentucky where he has signed for his final season of play.

Small may not be like the second coming of Jevon Carter but he can do the job and as a point guard he is smart and crafty at his task.

He comes out of basketball territory in Indiana. He was in South Bend until he was a high school sophomore and then moved to Indianapolis. Indiana produced both Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird so he understands what the sport means in the state.

“He’s very very cerebral” Oklahoma State Mike Boynton told the Oklahoman last season in a profile of their point guard. “He wants to lead. He wants his teammates to learn from him as much as possible.”

And Boynton said he has much they can learn from him.

“You look at his assist-turnover ratio for his career it’s always been pretty good. (After two years at East Carolina and a year at Oklahoma State he has 244 assists and 167 turnovers)” Boynton said.

“Always shot a pretty good percentage mostly because he takes good shots” he continued the figures showing him shooting 41.4% from the floor and 34.7% from 3.

“He plays with a great sense of pride in having his team be successful and those are earmarks of a really good point guard and also a lot of kids from that state.

“When you talk about basketball meaning something in a state — like Texas football is king — in Indiana basketball is king” Boynton told the Oklahoman. “There’s an element to having guys from there that learned that basketball’s really important and if you play you play a certain way. You don’t turn the ball over you take good shots be a good teammate. And all those things still ring true.

“It’s a basketball state” Small said. “You just don’t have a lot of cameras around like other states like North Carolina or California. But in my opinion most of the best hoopers come out of Indiana.”"

By George Gay

Historically classical oriental tobacco (COT) production has been associated with tradition which looked at from one viewpoint was epitomized by the often-exquisite packaging of the relatively tiny leaves of the highest quality tobaccos while looked at from another direction it was personified by the huge amount of labor that went into forming such presentations—such works of art.

Of course while such traditions encompassed values that transcended the field of economic activities many of them could not survive the shifts in business priorities that gathered pace especially during the final quarter of the 20th century. Consequently changes were gradually introduced to the way that COTs were produced so as to conform to new marketplace and social realities while safeguarding the essentials: the unique tastes and aromas that these tobaccos imparted to the smoker.

But even with such changes having gathered pace during the past 10 years or so it is somewhat surprising to learn that two major developments in the field of COTs came to fruition in 2020 a year that most businesses and industries including the tobacco industry were glad to see the back of.

Nikos Tzoumas managing director of Missirian and president of the Hellenic Inter-professional Organization told me in November that after nine years of hard work and substantial investments by his company VIT SA and Philip Morris International (PMI) a second model of the HMO-2020-2R oriental tobacco harvesting machine was ready for the market.

The new harvester had been tested and trialed during the summer of 2020 when it was used to harvest crops in four stalk positions Tzoumas said. With only two people the machine proved capable of harvesting eight hectares of oriental tobacco during a season—up to 12 tons of cured oriental tobacco which is a far cry from traditional harvesting in which teams of hired labor and family members have to undertake back-breaking work in high temperatures to bring in the tobacco by hand. Little wonder then that Tzoumas said farmers especially younger ones were eager to embrace such new technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PHILLIPS 66 – the firm behind forecourt brand Jet – has appointed a new marketing managing director.

Renee Semiz takes up her new position this month joining from Phillips 66’s office in Houston Texas.

Semiz succeeds Mary Wolf who will relocate to the US to assume the role of general manager global specialities.

With more than two decades of experience at Phillips 66 Semiz brings experience from a broad range of roles within the firm having serves in positions across refining process engineering commercial commodities optimization and marketing.

Semiz most recently served as manager brand US marketing responsible for rebranding service stations and advertising for Phillips 66’s network in the United States.

Outgoing marketing director Mary Wolf said: “[Semiz] brings a great deal of experience and enthusiasm to the team and I’m sure she will lead the business to new heights.

Monica Epling struggled with morning sickness during her pregnancy with Shaine Casas while serving on a Navy base in El Centro Calif. The remedy: time in the base’s pool or a bathtub.



“I would get in the water and he’d be calm” she said. “It was almost instantaneous.”



Epling described Casas as “a very fussy baby” who would stop crying when she gave him a bath and recalled him always stumbling toward the pool when he was around 8 months old.



Casas is naturally drawn to the water and has an affinity for swimming that helped him make the U.S. National Team and gives him a strong chance of qualifying for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.



His 53.14 performance in the 100 backstroke in November 2019 was the fourth-fastest time in the world during the 2019-20 season and was 0.35 seconds behind world record–holder Ryan Murphy. Casas a Texas A&M junior also ranked within the top 13 in the world in the 200 backstroke and the 200 IM.



His success in swimming comes following a tragedy that shook his family.



Casas’s father James Epling drowned in 2003 while pursuing a smuggler as part of his work for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. When Monica decided to get a pool at the family’s home in Mission Texas and with her husband’s death in mind she enrolled Casas in water safety lessons. She did this Casas said so he didn’t become “another stat.”



Casas showed promise early but didn’t dedicate himself solely to swimming until his sophomore year of high school. That’s when Texas A&M associate head coach Jason Calanog recalled being struck by the sight of Casas on the pool deck during a meet.



“I couldn’t believe the size of his body the length of his arms and legs” Calanog said. “It was definitely a sight to see. I had a feeling he was going to be something special.”



Casas proved his coach right at the 2017 Speedo Junior National Championships at which he tied for first in the 100 butterfly placed second in the 100 backstroke finished third in the 200 IM and 50 freestyle and made the A final in all seven of his individual events.



Casas’s confidence that he could become an Olympian grew when he tied Alexei Sancov who represented Moldova in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics in the 100 butterfly.



“I think I was ranked like eighth or 12th in the world in 18&under and 30-something in the world rankings” Casas said. “I was like ‘Wow we’re not too far off. We have a lot of work but maybe one day I’ll be there.’”



Casas still went to Texas A&M in 2018 as something of a swimming newbie.



He regularly asked high school and club coaches for workouts and swam on his own throughout high school. Texas A&M needless to say provided quite a different training environment.



Calanog said Casas had to work on simple details with his stroke swim at a faster pace in workouts learn more about race strategy and get used to training with other swimmers.



“He had to do a lot of learning when he was 18 years old” Calanog said.



Consider those lessons learned.



Despite suffering an ankle injury that kept him from training for several weeks Casas broke two individual school records his freshman season and became the first Aggie freshman to score points at the NCAA Division I Men’s Swimming & Diving Championship in two events.



During his sophomore season which was cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic he became the fastest teenager ever in the 200-yard IM and broke 12-time Olympic medalist Ryan Lochte’s Southeastern Conference record in the 200 backstroke by more than a second.



With his biggest meets of the season still to come Casas holds seven individual school records and is part of five relay school records. He commemorates each one by placing a placard listing each record on the walls of his apartment but he’s starting to run out of room.



“I’m going to figure out what I can do” Casas said. “I’m missing like five.”



Along with his early collegiate successes Casas shined at the 2019 Phillips 66 National Championships capturing his first national title in the 100 backstroke along with second-place finishes in the 200 I.M. and 200 backstroke.



His improvement leaves him with a good chance at achieving his goal of qualifying for the Olympics. He’s certain he’ll swim the 100 and 200 backstroke the 200 IM and the 100 butterfly at Trials and he’s thinking about adding the 200 butterfly to that list.



No matter what event it is Casas just hopes to represent the United States next summer.



“That’s what I’ve been chasing since I was introduced to the sport” Casas said. “I don’t think I ever wanted to be in something and not be the best. I feel like finally I’m at that point. I feel like I’m ready to have my opportunity to go. It would mean the world to me. It would make my family proud my brothers proud the school proud and myself proud.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aC5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdS9zdGF5aW5nLWhlYWx0aHkvaXRzLW5vdC10b28tbGF0ZS10by1nZXQtaW4tYmV0dGVyLXNoYXBl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s not too late to get in better shape,"As a service to our readers Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

One hundred city firefighters responded to extinguish the four-alarm blaze which was reported a little before 1 a.m. at a condominium complex in the 9800 block of Walnut Street. Flames spread from the man’s third-floor unit into the breezeways and through the roof of the complex building before being put out around 2:30 a.m. according to Dallas-Fire Rescue.

The man was treated at a hospital for his burns and later released the fire agency said. Although no one else was injured at least three residents were displaced and power to more than a dozen condos in the complex was temporarily shut off due to the fire.

Investigators believe items left too close to the open electric oven likely caught fire. The man told authorities he called 911 after he was awakened by the glow from the fire in his kitchen.",,,,,,,,,,,,

With no long-term debt on its books MTN Uganda has borrowed $114m (Shs385.8 billion) from four local banks in Uganda. This is the third largest corporate finance facility arranged by local banks in Uganda’s history.

The money according to MTN is meant for further expansion of data network construction of their head office on Jinja Road and upgrade of their IT systems.

Two of Uganda’s largest banks Stanbic Bank and Standard Chartered Bank provided the syndicated loan together with Barclays Bank and Citi Bank. A syndicated loan is one that involves a group of lenders (called the syndicate) who pool their lending resources to make a loan.

“We intend to invest Shs238 billion in 2016 and Shs299 billion in 2017 in Uganda for further expansion. We cannot do that without funding from various sources” Mr Brian Gouldie the CEO MTN Uganda told Daily Monitor on the sidelines of the signing ceremony yesterday.

Mr Gouldie further pointed out that investment would improve the quality of service to MTN Uganda customers.

This is the second time MTN Uganda which is Uganda’s largest telecommunication corporation with annual revenues in excess of Shs1.2 trillion is securing a syndicated loan from banks. In 2009 a mix of local and international banks lent MTN Uganda $100m (Shs338.4 billion) meant for expansion.

According to Mr David Blackburn the chief financial officer MTN Uganda the company has long paid off that loan in full.

Mr Glen Ssekabira the deputy executive director Supervision Bank of Uganda (BoU) told reporters that syndicated loans help the banks share the risks associated with lending large corporations.

“MTN Uganda could have gone elsewhere outside the country to get the money. Instead they used local banks and in the unlikely event that MTN Uganda defaults the banks can share the risk” he says.

He also noted that this was an indicator that Uganda’s banking sector had the capacity to finance – to some extent – several projects if they worked together more closely.

Ugandan banks are estimated to have the capacity of financing a single project to a tune of no more than $200m (Shs676.9 billion).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL21hcmtldHMvbmljLWludGVuZHMtdG8tY3Jvc3MtbGlzdC1zaGFyZXMtb24tbmFpcm9iaS1zdG9jay1leGNoYW5nZS0tMTU3NjQwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NIC intends to cross list shares on Nairobi Stock Exchange,"Kampala.

National Insurance Corporation Limited (NIC) plans to float its shares at the Nairobi Securities exchange for the first time as a means of improving the value of individual shares.

NIC will become the second Ugandan firm to cross-list on the Nairobi bourse after UMEME a power utility was cross-listed last year.

The move to cross-list on the Nairobi bourse was announced by the board of directors during the 13th Annual General Meeting of shareholders held on Friday in Kampala.

“We are going to start on the approval process of the various bodies in Uganda and Kenya said Mr Bayo Folayan the managing director of Nic.

Mr Bayo said the insurance company will widen that market for its shares thus increased demand.



“Cross-listing of the shares will lead to better visibility improved competitive edge in the regional markets increased share liquidity better price discovery access to a wider pool of both sophisticated and retail investors and better prospects of raising capital” said Dr Martin Aliker the vice chairman to the Board of Directors as he explained the intention to cross-list to the shareholders.



The insurance giant intends to have its name changed from National Insurance Corporation Limited to NIC Holdings Limited.

“We are changing the name of the company in order to separate the life and none life businesses” said Mr Bayo.

He added that the change of name is in line with Insurance law which was amended in 2011. The law states that the life and general business should be separated into two different bodies. The deadline for all insurance companies is December this year.

The shareholders also unanimously approved the issuing of 819661942 new shares worth Shs20 491548550 at the current market price as bonus shares to shareholders who were on the register of Shareholders on June 20 2014.

The bonus shares shall be selected in the ratio of 11 new shares for every eight shares held by the shareholders respectively on that day and such new shares shall rank pari passu (at the same rate) for all purposes with existing issued shares of the company.

Performance of National Insurance Corporation Limited

Dr Aliker whilst presenting the company’s 2013 annual report on behalf of the chairman Mr Remi Olowude said the company’s premium increased in 2013 by 22 per cent from Shs7.83 billion recorded in 2012 to Shs9.52 billion as at December 31 2013.

The company’s total assets also grew by 3.6 per cent from Shs82.053 billion in 2012 to Shs85.04 billion in the year under review.

Some shares in NCB Financial Group Limited NCBFG and the Lee-Chi- owned swanky Trident Castle villas in the parish of Portland in Jamaica – the parish of Lee-Chin’s birth – are being put up as security for the bond.

The amount of NCBFG shares being used as collateral is equivalent to 60 per cent the value of the bond debt being sought but with a 40 per cent margin. The prospectus for the bond offer notes that AIC Barbados the gurantor of the senior secured notes placement will secure the offer with the first mortgage over Trident Castle as well as “execution of Jamaica Central Securities Depository pledge form by the guarantor in relation to NCBFG ordinary shares with market value equivalent to 0.6 (times) the principal amount; subject to a maintenance margin of 0.4 (times)”.

NCB Financial Group which is listed on the Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago stock exchanges is a super-rich financial entity with tentacles across the Caribbean region including majority ownership of insurance giant Guardian Holdings. NCBFG is 52 per cent owned by Lee Chin’s AIC Barbados Limited. The Jamaica-based financial company’s latest filings indicate that Lee-Chin’s 52.1 per cent majority stake is held by one shareholder with five accounts controlling a total of 1.2 billion shares at September 30 2020. The ultimate parent company is Portland Holdings Inc incorporated in Canada and controlled by Lee-Chin its chairman who is also chairman of NCBFG.

At September 30 NCBFG had amassed assets of $1.8 trillion had net operating income of more than $108 billion and returned a net profit of $26.8 billion for the 2020 financial year ended September 30 – down from over $31 billion in 2019.

Trident Castle is an upscale villa property which Lee-Chin bought some years ago from retired architect and businessman Earl Levy.

The top-class assets are being put up with an eye on further expanding Portland’s investment network with more acquisitions said to be on the cards.

“Management of Portland Barbados Limited has indicated that the purpose (of the bond raise) is for general corporate purposes including acquisitions” Robert Almeida Lee-Chin’s investment point man and the managing partner of the affiliated Portland Private Equity PPE told the Financial Gleaner this week.

Portland Private Equity is not involved in the capital raise but is part of the Portland group which includes Portland Barbados.

“The Portland group of companies is quite extensive and has many transactions in progress at any point in time” Almeida said.

Portland Holdings includes CVM TV; Wallenford Coffee Company and Mavis Bank Coffee Factory; Trident Hotel and Blue Lagoon in Portland; Reggae Beach now known as Bamboo Beach Club in Ocho Rios St Ann; Coral Springs tourism development in Trelawny; and Model Agricultural Production Limited a super farm in St Catherine. Portland Holdings’ financial companies include NCBFG National Commercial Bank Jamaica Limited PPE Guardian Holdings and Canada-based investment advisory outfits Mandeville Group and Portland Investment Counsel.

Portland Holdings is also affiliated with the Jamaica Stock Exchange-listed Portland JSX Limited PJX which earns revenues from income and capital gains on its direct and indirect investments. PJX is not connected to the bond issue. PJX is a partner in Portland Caribbean Fund II a private equity fund with a mandate to make investments in equity or debt securities of private companies located in the Caribbean and Latin America.

The high taxes instituted on Savings and Credit Corporative Associations and micro lenders continue to hinder financial inclusion according to the Stromme Microfinance chief executive officer.

Speaking at celebrations to mark 25 years of operations in Uganda Mr Paul Katende the Stromme Microfinance chief executive officer said government has failed to appreciate the role of micro lending in boosting financial inclusion given the heavy taxes instituted on Saccos and microfinance institutions.



“We are heavily taxed. We are regarded as just mere companies in a country that are making profits” he said noting government should put in place deliberate policies that uplift micro lending institutions.

In 2016 government dropped taxes on Saccos and other micro lending institutions but were later reinstated with a requirement that Saccos will be charged income tax of 30 per cent on their net profits

Mr Katende said Saccos and micro lending institutions extend financial services to the poor which helps to cover a large gap of the unbanked as well as help extend credit through which businesses and households have been uplifted.",,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

But Stephen Procter’s large stoneware garden vessels some as tall as five feet and incorporating 250 pounds of clay are nevertheless functional pottery — even without the soil and the plants.

In the clay world he said there’s always talk about functional versus nonfunctional pottery attempting to draw a line between the two. Mr. Procter a Vermont-based ceramist has seen his and other such outsize garden sculptures in action though.

“An object that invites contemplation and inspires and offers this kind of mysterious sustenance is functional in a deep and important way” he said. “Not functional that you’re going to drink your coffee out of it but the work has high purpose in the landscape and in the world.”"

Hansotia: One tool was an app that was rolled out in just a few days. If a farmer subscribed to it a service technician could access the farmer's phone's camera microphone and speaker. The farmer might say ""Here's what I hear or see on my machine."" The service technician could be there as if he is standing next to the farmer to diagnose that problem. This is a tool we will maintain going forward.

PF: What technologies especially interest AGCO?

Hansotia: We believe autonomy and our smart machines go hand in hand. To create an autonomous piece of equipment and take the operator out of the cab you have to first automate all the functions in the cab. We are automating feature after feature on our sprayers combines and planters. In the short-term the equipment will be smarter sensing field-specific information on the go and adjusting on its own. That brings higher value to the farmer today. With each step in the process you get closer to taking the operator completely out of the cab.

PF: Give us an example of improved machinery productivity.

Hansotia: Consider Precision Planting's SmartFirmer. It travels in the furrow and senses soil temperature soil moisture organic matter and residue. Using it you can put the planter in autopilot mode. In areas of high organic matter the planter will plant a higher population. In areas with more limited productivity it will plant a lower population. The operator won't have to make those adjustments. [The planter] can also switch hybrids to a racehorse hybrid for a high-fertility area or a more defensive hybrid in lower-fertility areas.

PF: Tell us about AGCO's swarm robot concept?

Hansotia: We have an automated fleet concept for planting called Project Xaver. It's a swarm robot approach where a single row unit can be used for planting or field scouting. Each works in tandem with other robots in the field. They all know where all the others have been so they can collectively plant the field. Smart machines like SmartFirmer are a value to all farmers. Autonomy such as Xaver will have value for some farmers. [Find out more about Project Xaver at fendt.com/int/xaver.]

PF: AGCO has been introducing a new line of Fendt products. What features in those equipment and technology lines make you think it will be a game-winner?

Hansotia: People are blown away by the Fendt 1000 Series tractor the fuel efficiency the comfort and the quietness because it runs at a low rpm. It's the largest fixed-frame tractor in the industry. It's got tremendous pulling power. There are a lot of farmers in North America with high expectations and we have the tractors for them. We also have the Fendt IDEAL combine the Fendt Momentum planter the Fendt tracked tractors. We're bringing to the marketplace a full set of solutions.

PF: You've talked throughout this interview about AGCO investments in the future. Would you be more specific?

Hansotia: We have five main investment areas. One of those is [building] a machine that can communicate to send information through telemetry. Second is automation so machines are able to understand their environment and adjust their activity or optimize performance. Third is robotics like Project Xaver which provides autonomous machines working out in the field to complement functions of larger equipment. A fourth area is electrification to power machine operation and components for new levels of control and efficiency. The last fifth is future fuels. Whether it be for the environment or efficiency we are invested in various options such as synthetic fuels biomethane fuels electrification hydrogen and things like that.

PF: Once 2020 passes into history what about 2021?

Hansotia: The average age of equipment is getting older. We are seven years past the last [sales] peak. We believe farmers' confidence is growing. Large ag sales will be down from 2019 but not as bad as we once expected. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market for 2021. We're just not sure what's going to happen with the virus. We also don't know what governments are going to do to support the farm industry. But if you neutralize those 2021 may be a year of recovery in many of our markets. We're seeing an uptick in commodity prices. Higher prices are generally tied pretty closely to demand for machinery.

Donald Trump made a transparently racist appeal to the so-called suburban housewives of America warning that liberals were plotting to “abolish the suburbs” by flooding their neighborhoods with low-income housing and Black Lives Matter protests. And while Joe Biden acknowledged the increasing diversity of American suburbia his campaign continued the decades-long centrist Democratic project of crafting electoral appeals and calibrating policy positions toward moderate upper-income voters. The obsession with upper-income white suburban professionals provides myopic understandings of the past and flawed lessons for the future. In 2010 the US Census revealed that for the first time a majority of African Americans Asian Americans and Latinos in America’s one hundred largest metropolitan regions resided in suburban areas and not in central cities. More than half of all poor people and of first- and second-generation immigrants in these major metropolitan regions also lived in the census-designated suburbs where fewer than one-fourth of households conformed to the mythical suburban ideal of a married couple with children under the age of eighteen. Suburbs today are more working-class and more diverse than ever before. But it is not clear that the Democratic Party establishment including the incoming Biden administration is ready or willing to embrace the suburban electorate on its own terms.

The Roots of the Affluent Suburban Strategy The Democratic Party’s suburban strategy of chasing affluent white-collar professionals and simultaneously marginalizing its traditional working-class base has deep roots in the racial upheavals and economic crises of the 1960s and 1970s. During the intraparty warfare of the 1980s a faction of professional-class politicians labeled the “Atari Democrats” argued that embracing high-tech corporations and suburban knowledge workers represented the best path forward to a prosperous future and an electoral realignment. In the aftermath of the 1988 election when George H. W. Bush defeated the technocrat Michael Dukakis the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) the self-styled centrist outfit of professional class Democrats commissioned political scientists William Galston and Elaine Kamarck to draft a postmortem. The resulting document titled the “Politics of Evasion” insisted that the party needed to fashion its appeals to middle-income white voters in the suburban Midwest and affluent white professionals in the high-tech suburban Sunbelt. It was a direct repudiation of the multiracial working-class “Rainbow Coalition” strategy of Jesse Jackson in his 1984 and 1988 presidential bids which sought to mobilize the “desperate the damned the disinherited and the despised.” Jackson responded that the DLC which he dismissed as the “Democrats of the Leisure Class” was seeking to “suburbanize the Democratic party.” He was quite right. The “Politics of Evasion” shaped the DLC’s centrist agenda in the 1990s most notably Bill Clinton’s approach to the white suburban electorate and his “Third Way” rejection of a progressive policy agenda especially after the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1994 midterms. During his 1996 reelection campaign Clinton elevated America’s “soccer moms” — imagined as affluent college-educated white married suburbanites — as the archetypal swing voter and captured 53 percent of the suburban female vote. During the nadir of the George W. Bush administration the Democratic Party’s quest for dominance in the white suburbs seemed hopelessly adrift. But in 2008 Barack Obama captured 51 percent of the diversifying suburban electorate during a severe recession by promising progressive economic policies that “invest in our middle class.” Obama proved able to thread the needle electorally galvanizing record turnout among African American and young voters while also making inroads in the white suburban swing districts of new battleground states such as Virginia and Colorado. In 2016 Donald Trump’s racist campaign and shocking victory convinced many mainstream Democrats that their path back to power required writing off white workers and rural America in favor of rebuilding the unstable coalition of white college-educated suburban professionals and reliably Democratic nonwhite voters. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer famously argued that the party could regain control of Midwestern battlegrounds by targeting moderate Republicans in the white-collar suburbs rather than trying to win back blue-collar white voters in places such as Western Pennsylvania. Leading Democratic strategists termed this the “Panera Bread” strategy a blueprint for retaking Congress in 2018 and the presidency in 2020 by focusing on moderate and conservative white suburbanites across the nation who were alienated by the rhetoric and character of Donald Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “Red to Blue” initiative intervened in the primaries in a number of suburban districts to thwart progressive challengers helping to bring moderate Democrats such as Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia into the US House of Representatives. These centrist suburban politicians have urged the party to reject the progressive left and double down on its white-collar suburban strategy. But it is becoming increasingly clear that this is a strategic cul-de-sac with fewer and fewer moderate Republicans left to convert — and a misguided path for anyone invested in a progressive policy agenda.

The Dangers of Courting Moderate Suburbanites In the lead-up to the 2018 midterms we argued in an op-ed in the New York Times: “Democrats cannot cater to white swing voters in affluent suburbs and also promote policies that fundamentally challenge income inequality exclusionary zoning housing segregation school inequality police brutality and mass incarceration.” The relentless pursuit of moderate white suburbanites is at once a symptom and cause of the Democratic Party’s unwillingness to fight for a working-class agenda. These warnings are even more critical two years later as the United States confronts an interlocking set of social economic and political crises that are rooted in both the bipartisan policymaking of recent decades and the inept and reactionary leadership of the Trump administration. Immediately following the 2020 election a coalition of progressive groups issued the “Memo to Interested Parties  ” which laid out the electoral drawbacks in stark terms. The groups warned of the risks of alienating grassroots organizations of color and other progressive activists that have spent the last four years mobilizing the party’s “core base of support: young people Black Brown working class and social movements.” The relentless pursuit of moderate white suburbanites is at once a symptom and cause of the Democratic Party’s unwillingness to fight for a working-class agenda that attacks economic inequality systemic racism and the global climate crisis by guaranteeing quality housing health care and employment; freedom from police brutality and the carceral system; and enacting a Green New Deal. This moment plainly calls for the Democratic Party to stop viewing economic redistribution and far-reaching criminal justice reform as political liabilities and instead to understand that tackling entrenched problems of economic and racial inequality offers an alternative way to mobilize the American electorate including the diverse working-class populations that live in suburbs and metropolitan regions. The Democratic breakthrough in Georgia in the 2020 election offers a case in point. The Biden-Harris campaign won Georgia because the voter registration drives led by Stacey Abrams’s New Georgia Project helped to mobilize a multiracial electorate regardless of where they lived. While some moderate white professionals and typically Republican suburbanites did vote for the Democratic presidential ticket it is a profound mistake to equate the suburban counties north of Atlanta with the demographic category of the white college-educated professional vote. Joe Biden won 56.3 percent of the vote in Cobb County and 58.4 percent in nearby Gwinnett County both of which were overwhelmingly white and Republican strongholds as recently as a quarter-century ago. Today Cobb County is less than two-thirds white and Lucy McBath an African-American progressive activist easily won reelection in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District which includes parts of Cobb and two other suburban counties. Gwinnett is now a majority-minority suburban county (30 percent African American 22 percent Latino 13 percent Asian) and in 2020 a progressive white Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux flipped the Seventh Congressional District thanks in large part to the multiracial get-out-the-vote efforts of progressive organizations. In Arizona the Biden-Harris victory in the 2020 election also depended upon grassroots progressive organizations targeting a multiracial increasingly working-class electorate in new battleground areas. Maricopa County once gave Ronald Reagan more than 70 percent of its vote and Trump carried it by a 3.5 percent margin in 2016 leading the Democratic establishment to treat it as hopeless in presidential contests. Groups such as the Latino-oriented Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA) however mobilized working-class families in Maricopa where the population is now almost one-third Hispanic through an agenda of economic and racial justice. Biden narrowly won the suburban county. At the same time there is ample evidence that the Democratic Party’s prioritization of affluent white suburbanites actively undercuts a progressive policy agenda. It is extremely optimistic to expect a meaningful number of affluent white suburbanites to accept such priorities even if more of them have been reading White Fragility and throwing out terms like “institutional racism.” Despite the conventional wisdom about hyper-partisan polarization many affluent white suburbanites are still inclined to split their tickets and vote for Republicans in down-ballot elections. This is true even in very “blue” states such as Massachusetts Maryland and Vermont where a significant subset of white college-educated voters who are reliably Democratic in presidential contests prefer moderate Republican governors that support fiscal conservatism and cultural tolerance. It therefore should not be surprising that a sizable number of the moderate and generally Republican suburbanites who rejected the extremism and incompetence of Trumpism on the presidential ticket simultaneously voted for GOP candidates and divided government in congressional races and in contests at the state level. Even in California where Trump received barely one-third of the vote the majority of the statewide electorate along with the majority in blue-trending suburban areas such as Orange County handily rejected ballot initiatives aimed at increasing corporate taxes to fund social welfare programs restoring affirmative action in higher education and public employment and curtailing Uber’s and Lyft’s assault on workers’ rights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MveWVsbGVuLXNwZWFraW5nLWZlZXMtZGlzY2xvc3VyZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Washington Has Been Lucrative for Some on Biden's Team (Published 2021),"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R.

Ms. Yellen’s paid speaking appearances — which included $992000 from the investment bank Citi for nine appearances — were among the lucrative payments from a range of Wall Street Big Tech and corporate interests to three prominent prospective members of the incoming Biden administration.

The payments revealed in disclosure statements covering the previous two years and released on New Year’s Eve have caused consternation among progressive activists concerned about the influence of special interests around Mr. Biden who they see as part of a Democratic establishment that has not sufficiently embraced liberal priorities.

The purpose of these publications is to explain the principles techniques and methodologies used by the financial supervisors to monitor authorised persons and entities bringing to light the scope approach/es interlinkages and complexities of carrying out supervisory and enforcement work.

The ultimate aim is that of informing stakeholders on what financial supervision means and how through their work MFSA officials aim at achieving the common good specifically by protecting consumers of financial services and safeguarding systemic stability and the integrity of financial markets.

Thematically financial supervision falls under four main areas: micro-prudential supervision which looks into the soundness of individual financial institutions; macro-prudential supervision focusing on threats to the system as a whole; conduct supervision monitoring the way financial services are provided to customers; and the supervision of the integrity of the financial system which includes the prevention of financial crime mainly in the form of fraud money laundering the financing of terrorism and financial market abuse.

Effective supervision is not a static process but involves continually striving for improvement efficiency and effectiveness and responding to new challenges.

It is a process whereby risks to the safety and soundness of a financial institution including operational prudential conduct and financial crime risks are properly identified through desk-based analytical reviews and inspections and analysed with the aim of detecting failures and weaknesses in the system.

Effective supervision is not a static process but involves continually striving for improvement efficiency and effectiveness and responding to new challenges

Regulatory action which is proportionate and dissuasive ranging from requests for remediation plans to the cancellation of licences depending on the severity of the case is then taken to address these weaknesses. Financial supervision also involves understanding changes and developments in financial services such as in the field of technology (fintech) and climate change and the associated regulatory risks and proactively adapting the approach to financial supervision accordingly.

Looking back on 2020 it has been another eventful year with measures being imposed by supervisors national and supranational alike inter alia to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the exit of the UK from the EU. During this year financial supervision has been strengthened in line with Moneyval’s recommendations. The authority carried out over 380 inspections a significant increase from previous years.

The MFSA has published its supervision priorities document which sets out where we are going to focus our supervisory engagement in 2021.

Five cross-sectoral priorities have been identified for 2021 namely: corporate governance and culture; financial crime compliance; the impact of COVID-19; ICT risk and cybersecurity; and fintech and innovation. Building on these cross-sectoral priorities sector-specific areas of focus have also been identified. The document also highlights the MFSA’s risk-based approach to supervision which seeks to ensure the efficacy and effectiveness of supervisory engagement together with select key initiatives that may impact stakeholders.

In 2021 the MFSA will continue implementing its Strategic Plan 2019 – 2021 and start setting the tone for the next strategic period (2022-2024). We will seek to reinforce the industry’s compliance culture and lay the foundation for an outcomes-based approach to supervision.

Participation in the policy discussions taking place at EU and national level will continue being a priority; particularly sustainable finance digital finance and the upcoming EU AMLCFT framework all of which will broaden the duties of financial supervisors and add more layers to the complex nature and art of financial supervision.

Heritage Auctions is now vying to match the high water mark left by Goldin Auctions’ shocking $369000 USD Pokémon Trading Card Game Charizard with covetable cards that include three first edition Charizards one of which has been granted the PSA GEM MT 10 rating denoting it utterly flawless.

Heritage Auctions expects the card to bring in at least $350000 USD by the time its auction ends on January 14 coming close to the record-setting card sold earlier this month. Arguably the Pokémon TCG’s most desirable collectible at the moment this “Charizard #4 First-Edition Base Set Rare Hologram” card is one of only 2627 copies certified by the card grading authorities at the PSA. Its GEM-MT 10 (Gem Mint) rating ensures that it’s a visually perfect card freed from creasing and staining. Furthermore its original gloss is wholly intact and — crucially — the printed Charizard image is neatly centered.

Though the auction offers one clear standout there are plenty of other attractive items in store including first-edition Venasaur also from 1999 and in Mint 9 condition and a first-edition sealed Fossil booster box. Each is already bidding at over $2600 USD with nearly two weeks to go until the auctions’ end.

“This is an incredible card one that collectors have been chasing to make the centerpiece of their collections” said Heritage Auctions assistant comics & comic art operations supervisor Jesus Garcia in a statement. “The demand and prices paid for this card are sky-high especially in this condition. It is an absolute must-have for the most serious of collectors.”

By James Carsey–

Two major building projects under consideration by village trustees would bring about the most dramatic changes to the Tarrytown waterfront since the construction of Hudson Harbor townhouses a decade ago. Both include large multi-story structures on opposite sides of the Metro North tracks just south of the station. If implemented as proposed the 88-unit apartment building at 29 South Depot Plaza and the 103-bedroom “Boatel” on the site of the current Tarrytown Marina would alter both the form and the function of the riverfront area. Each however has met with notably different responses from the public.

29 SOUTH DEPOT PLAZA

Originally proposed as a three-story self-storage facility two years ago this project has morphed into a high density 60-foot tall five-story mixed use building containing 88 studio 1- and 2-bedroom apartments on a plot of land about the size of a football field. A vote on this configuration on November 23rd produced a rare split within the Planning Board which led to the submission of Majority and Minority reports to the Board of Trustees. Those reports as well as further public comment will be addressed at the trustees’ January 4th meeting.

The Planning Board’s chair Dr. Stanley Friedlander who with board member Paul Birgy constituted the minority opposing the plan said “To my recollection the Board has never had a 3-2 split on any application or recommendation to the Board of Trustees.”

The Majority Report representing the opinion of three board members contends that the applicant for the project Collins Enterprises LLC has met all the requirements and regulatory standards and that it is consistent with the goals of the village’s Comprehensive Plan and “Transit-Oriented Development” (TOD) goals.

“The Applicant is proposing to use the foundation for the existing one-story metal warehouse building and build a mixed-use building containing 2000 square feet of retail and 20750 square feet of self-storage on the ground floor with 88 residential units on four floors above” it states. “The Project’s unit mix is proposed to consist of 12 studios 48 1-bedrooms and 28 2-bedroom units. The Project will include nine (9) affordable units consistent with Section 305-130 (Affordable Housing) with rents affordable for households whose incomes do not exceed 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI).”

An 11-page Minority Report reflecting the views of Friedlander and Birgy takes issue with the proposal on many fronts including its height density lack of public support and the developer’s attitude about the project. It questions the math used to determine the density of the building. “Density levels approaching 200 people on one acre is excessive and may be detrimental to the health and safety of the residents” the report states. The structure’s height according to the memo seemed to have changed as it went through the approval process to benefit the developer’s profit margin.

The original application for a three-story self-storage facility would have required no variance as it complied with the area’s existing industrial use zoning. It was the Planning Board that asked the applicant to include moderately priced housing as a way of addressing the Tarrytown Train Station Area Revitalization Plan’s call for more mixed-use development.

That’s when Collins Enterprise LLC a residential builder with experience in creating transit-oriented developments was brought in. According to the Minority Report when Planning Board members questioned the proposed 88-unit size the firm responded with an ultimatum “If this was not granted” stated the Minority Report “they would withdraw the application and [only] self-storage would be built.” Friedlander’s and Birgy’s response was “We reject the process of coercion and the ‘take it or leave it approach’ or the ‘my way or the highway’ situation the Planning Board faced.”

Arthur Collins the company’s principal has said he wants to build the same public consensus he has created in other towns including Yonkers and Princeton New Jersey. “We hope to become a friend a neighbor and a long-term holder of real estate at Depot Plaza” Collins said.

As the public became aware of the scope of the project over the past month opposition to the plan has mounted. The lion’s share of letters emails and call-ins to recent public hearings reflect concerns about the mass and height of the building and its effect on the “viewshed” of the Hudson for residents living on the hills to the east and about the increase in traffic likely to result from hundreds of new residents only some of which would be relying on Metro North.

At the December 21 Trustee meeting more than 30 residents spoke during the public comments section. Among them was Main Street resident Howard Smith who cited “an unprecedented level of density and height for buildings in Tarrytown—particularly the inner village” as his principal concern. The apartment building he and others contended would be out of character with the rest of Tarrytown.

Dolph Beil a White Plains resident who works on Main Street offered visual displays of the proposed height of South Depot Plaza. According to Beil the developers’ “balloon test” which purports to show height and visibility of a project underestimates its true height.

Proponents of the project believe it helps solve the lack of affordable housing in Tarrytown. Sadie McKeown chairperson of Tarrytown’s Housing Affordability Task Force supports the project and said it provides options for people with different income levels. “Housing [in Tarrytown] is out of reach for most people as the average price is $650000” McKeown said.

Lisette Mendez a Grove Street resident who has spoken in support of the project at more than one public meeting acknowledged that it will bring more traffic and does compromise some of the Hudson River views but favors it because it offers mixed income housing for Tarrytown. Views are not the only issue at stake she argued during the November 20 Board meeting. “In Tarrytown 15% of the families are severely cost-burdened and we are only concerned about the impacts on views and not about the impacts on family” Mendez said.

These and other views will likely be re-stated at the January 4 regular Board of Trustees meeting accessible on Zoom or on the village’s cable access channel.

THE BOATEL

Though it is only yards away from the South Depot Plaza site the four-story marina hotel has so far not elicited the kind of passionate reactions aimed at the apartment building on the other side of the tracks. At the recent Board of Trustee work session Trustee Douglas Zollo and Mayor Thomas Butler expressed concerns about the apparent lack of facilities needed to repair or service visiting craft. “There is nothing on land to fix or store boats” said Zollo. “And if you’re going to have a marina you have to have that.” Lynne Ward representing National Resources a real estate development company that currently owns the Tarrytown Boat Club and has a vested interested in the project responded “You really have two paths here. You either go with a full-scale messy boating operation or you try something of this nature with limited servicing facilities.”

Trustees also wanted to know what role the existing Tarrytown Boat Club would play in the Boatel project. Ward said they intend to keep the existing 100-year-old club while acknowledging that the changes were needed including dredging and upgrading docks that still show damage from Hurricane Sandy.

Parking for the proposed attraction was a concern. Mayor Butler asked if a portion of the parking structure could be reduced in size and the remaining spaces for vehicles moved to lot A or another area of Tarrytown. Butler was flexible about forming a partnership around the parking issue as long as it is beneficial to the public.

Despite the sticking points around parking traffic and a proper boat facility the trustees were open for future proposals relating to the Boatel project. They welcomed discussions in the new year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzZnJlZXByZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvamFuLzAxL3Jvc3N2aWxsZS1jb3VwbGVzLW5ldy1ibHVmZi12aWV3LXZhY2F0aWhvdXNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rossville couple's new bluff-view vacation houses created from shipping containers,"Who could have guessed that two tiny houses could pose such sizable challenges?

Everything changed in 2020. With COVID-19 much of the world’s population was forced to quarantine in the hopes of preventing the spread of the virus. That led us to become reliant on video calls and social networks far more than we had been in the past. Our phones helped keep us connected entertained and distracted from the relative horrors of the world around us. Thankfully mobile tech kept innovation apace throughout the year despite the hellfire that was 2020. Phone makers didn’t drop the ball. In fact many pushed boundaries like never before.

With the year finally (finally!) coming to an end it’s high time we peered forward. Here’s what to expect from smartphones throughout 2021. See also: 7 smartphone trends that really should stop in 2021

Affordable foldables

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Phones that fold are still a nascent product category. We saw three major efforts during 2020 including the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and Flip 5G the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and the Motorola Razr 5G. Each of these phones had strengths and weaknesses though we really liked the Z Fold 2. If there’s one common thread to the foldable phone category however it’s outrageous pricing. The Z Flip and Razr 5G cost upward of $1400 and the Z Fold 2 cost a brutal $1980. Clearly the foldables of 2020 were not mass consumer devices.

As we head into 2021 it’s fair to expect that foldables will become more affordable. That’s not to say that they’ll be cheap. You can expect phones such as the Z Fold 2 to keep their $2000 price points. Instead what we’ll see are new efforts that fall into the upper end of the mid-tier with price points in the $800 to $1000 range. Related: The best foldable phones you can get

“While most rivals are working on their first folding flipping or rolling phones Samsung is readying its third-generation foldables and promising to bring prices down” said Avi Greengart President Lead Analyst Techsponential. “More affordable options will help clarify just how much consumers want their phones to change shape. Microsoft is also worth watching as it learns from its first-generation Surface Duo and LG seems especially bent on experimentation.”

5G across the board

Qualcomm

Samsung was the first major phone maker to add 5G to its entire line of high-end devices and much of its mid-range as well. The entire Galaxy S20 series had 5G onboard — and the high price tag to match. Later Samsung brought 5G to its more affordable devices including the Galaxy A71 and Galaxy S20 FE. Apple Google Nokia and others followed suit as did other manufacturers. By the end of 2020 we started to see 5G adoption really take off.

For 2021 it’s clear more phones than ever will have 5G. We can thank chipsets in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 700 series for bringing the new connectivity standard to the mid-range. We should therefore expect that the majority of mid-range phones will have 5G aboard next year. What’s not yet clear is how far down the product map 5G will trickle. Google already offers truly affordable 5G phones such as the Pixel 4a 5G. Will we see 5G in phones below the $399 price point? It’s possible. Read more: Here’s what’s coming next for 5G in 2021

5G will also get much faster. While mmWave 5G impresses with its raw performance its limited availability means most people are surfing on slower mid-band 5G.

“Phones integrating Qualcomm’s X60 modem will bring significantly faster sub-6 5G speeds as it allows more flexibility combining frequency bands” said Greengart. “In the U.S. the impact will be largely confined to T-Mobile’s network in 2021 until the winners of the government’s mid-range auction are able to build on it. In the second half of 2021 if the pandemic eases we may also start seeing real-world use cases for mmWave 5G in crowded areas and stadiums.”

Fast(er) displays

C. Scott Brown / Android Authority

If there was one trend we saw in 2020 that we liked it was the proliferation of fast displays. Leading phone makers ramped up the refresh rate of their screens from 60Hz to 90Hz 120Hz and even 144Hz. Faster refresh rates offer a smoother experience particularly when scrolling or gaming. These are found on phones such as the ROG Phone 3 and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.

We fully believe high-refresh-rate screens will become the norm in 2021. For example leaks suggest that inexpensive Redmi phones will score 120Hz screens. More to the point MediaTek’s Dimensity 700 series of chips bake in support for 90Hz. This will bring speedy screens to cheaper handsets.

(Hopefully Apple will sense the trend and adopt faster screens too.)

Under-display cameras

David Imel / Android Authority

ZTE introduced the first phone with an under-display camera in 2020 the Axon 20 5G. This brand new technology relies on transparent layers to allow a camera to take pictures through a screen. The idea is to hide the camera in such a way as to lose the notch or punch hole design creating a more seamless screen experience. Here’s how the under-display camera works.

It's a solid bet that more phones with hidden cameras are on the way.

Xiaomi was among the first wave of phone makers to say it’ll adopt under-display camera tech. However you can be assured that Xiaomi and ZTE won’t be alone. While we don’t have more commitments from other phone makers and under-display camera technology is not perfect it’s a solid bet that more phones with hidden cameras are on the way.

8K recording proliferates

Hadlee Simons / Android Authority

If there’s one trend that’s probably obvious to you by now it’s that we expect the features found primarily on high-end phones in 2020 to reach phones with lower price points in 2021. That applies to 8K video capture.

We first saw 8K video capture enter the limelight with devices such as the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S20 series in early 2020. The feature later came to the LG V60 ThinQ and a number of other flagships throughout the year. The good news is that a wider array of chips support 8K video capture today which means the feature will proliferate across a wider range of price points. More to the point now that 8K television sets are (almost) affordable there will be a place to actually watch that 8K footage.

Augmented reality gets a grip on reality

It’s easy to shoot down augmented reality. At the moment Apple and Google appear to be the only companies truly interested in the technology. Apple continues to update its ARKit developer tools and release AR-capable hardware. That isn’t what we’re talking about.

“Qualcomm has been heavily investing in AR and VR functionality and its chips can be found in nearly all the self-contained VR systems on the market” noted Greengart. “Thanks to Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 VR does seem poised to break through to the mainstream but primarily as a gaming platform.” If you’ve been paying attention to your television set at all you’ve likely seen Oculus’ push to get consumers’ attention with dramatic commercials.

In 2021 we will see headsets that plug into Snapdragon-based phones.

However “AR has much broader potential” suggests Greengart. “In 2021 we will see headsets that plug into Snapdragon-based phones leave the labs and arrive on shelves. Apple has been working on its own AR glasses; if history is any guide Apple will sit out the first round of solutions next year and define the market on its own terms later.” What smartphone trends do you think we’ll see in 2021?

Thanks to a report now we have some findings about a possibly new smartphone and an unannounced SoC of Qualcomm.

1 of 2

The Mi 11 source code(via) reportedly has new filenames of what could be an upcoming processor from Qualcomm. Accordingly a screenshot shows two sets of filenames – one with ‘Venus’ and another of ‘Xiaomi’. The ‘Venus’ is the codename for Mi 11 as it is listed with “SM8350” part number which is of Snapdragon 888.

However a new “SM7350” also appears along with “Xiaomi“. If we recall Snapdragon 750G 765G 768G have part numbers SM-7225 SM-7250-AB SM7250-AC respectively. And older SoCs like Snapdragon 730 730G belong to the “SM7150” series. Thus the SM7350 could be an upcoming SoC.

We also have a few reasons to believe this. Back in July a tipster said that Redmi’s K40 and K40 Pro are coming with SM7350 and SM8350 SoCs respectively. Out of this Redmi has already confirmed that the Snapdragon 888 processor will debut on a Redmi device in Q1 2021 and it could be the K40 Pro.

Later a popular tipster Roland Quandt in September said that SM7350 could be Snapdragon 775 and is codenamed “Cedros”. According to him Qualcomm was working to close boundaries with flagship processors with this SoC.

Also what could be Qualcomm's SD775 is SM7350 and seems to be codenamed ""Cedros"". — Roland Quandt (@rquandt) September 24 2020

The unannounced 7-series SoC also was reportedly tested with 12GB DDR5 RAM 256GB UFS 3.1 storage 120Hz screen putting the SoC in close quarters with 8-series SM8350. That said Qualcomm is yet to officially reveal the processor.

And if reports are to be believed the SoC is coming soon in Q1 2021 which also falls in-line with the Redmi’s launch timeline. Either way it looks like Redmi K40 will sport a Snapdragon 7x processor(likely Snapdragon 775) but let’s wait for more details in the coming days.

UP NEXT: Redmi 7 has begun to receive Android 10 update in India",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhZGdldHMzNjAuY29tL21vYmlsZXMvbmV3cy9xdWFsY29tbS1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTg4OC1wbHVzLWxhdW5jaC0yMDIxLXNlY29uZC1oYWxmLTIzNDY0NTLSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYWRnZXRzMzYwLmNvbS9tb2JpbGVzL25ld3MvcXVhbGNvbW0tc25hcGRyYWdvbi04ODgtcGx1cy1sYXVuY2gtMjAyMS1zZWNvbmQtaGFsZi0yMzQ2NDUyL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus Tipped to Launch in Second Half of 2021,"Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus or Snapdragon 888+ is said to launch in the second half of this year. We are yet to see many smartphones arrive with the Snapdragon 888 — the flagship SoC that launched in December — but reports of its Plus variant have already started. According to the tipsters we can expect the 888 Plus variant to arrive in the second half of 2021 which makes sense as Qualcomm typically has a mid-year refresh.

So far the Xiaomi Mi 11 has been launched with Snapdragon 888 and iQoo 7 has been confirmed to debut with the new chipset on January 11. Several other brands have also announced smartphones for 2021 that will have Qualcomm's latest SoC. This includes the Samsung Galaxy S21 and OnePlus 9 series.

As per a Weibo post by tipster Digital Chat Station Qualcomm will launch the Snapdragon 888 Plus SoC in the second half of 2021. Apart from this there is no information on the rumoured chipset. The tip seems to be in line with Qualcomm's traditional timeline of launching a mid-year refresher to its SoCs. For instance the chipmaker announced the Snapdragon 855 Plus in July 2019 as an upgrade to its flagship chipset. The same goes for Snapdragon 865+ launched in July 2020.

The tipster also claims that the US-based chipmaker capped the GPU frequency of the Snapdragon 888 at 840MHz to prevent OEMs from overclocking the chip on their devices. This means that the Snapdragon 888 Plus will likely be a small upgrade over the Snapdragon 888 — just like in the case of Snapdragon 865 and 865 Plus. The Snapdragon 865 Plus is claimed to deliver a 10 percent performance boost over the Snapdragon 865. Its Adreno 650 GPU is also only 10 percent faster than the GPU present in the Snapdragon 865 as per Qualcomm.

As mentioned the Xiaomi Mi 11 is the first smartphone to be launched with the Snapdragon 888 (features and details). And a complete list of smartphones to come with Qualcomm's flagship SoC has been announced.

Unlock Bootloader: Overview

The bootloader is a program that starts whenever a device is powered on to activate the right operating system. It packages the instructions to boot the OS from the kernel. Like a smartphone tablet or PC etc.

A Locked or Unlocked Bootloader is what gives you access to root a device easily. If you root your device it means you have a superuser or administrator access to the operating system that runs on your phone. Therefore you can change some of the system settings manage customizations tweaks etc.

Unlocking your Android Device Bootloader may get security issues. Android users often unlock their device bootloaders to root and install Custom ROMs. But it may void your device warranty sometimes. If your device bricked or stuck into boot loops etc. For the same reason Android doesn’t come rooted; smartphone OEMs also don’t want to unlock the bootloader or root your device. It’s your choice and needs.

By Unlocking the device bootloader may void your device warranty. We are at GetDroidTips will not be responsible for any bricking/damage to your phone while/after following this process. Do it at your own risk.

Dave DeGuglielmo Tests Positive OUT vs. Dallas

The team announced on Friday that offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo tested positive for COVID-19 and was immediately isolated. DeGuglielmo will not be available to coach against Dallas this Sunday. According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan assistant offensive line coach Ben Wilkerson will fill the void left behind by DeGuglielmo “barring any change.”

Alongside DeGuglielmo’s positive test the Giants revealed that “two potential close contacts” have also been isolated from the team. New York has yet to disclose whether those close contacts were players or coaches. Per Raanan the understanding as of now is that the offensive line unit is believed to be in the clear although he cautioned to see how contract tracing and future tests unfold.

Here is the team’s official statement on the matter:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYXJpZC00MDE5OTc2Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cervical Check: Terminally ill young mother makes moving appeal to Taoiseach,"A young mother of two with terminal cervical cancer has issued a moving appeal to the Government to push through legislation to support her children and other bereaved families.

Lynsey Bennett (32) who is suing for alleged misinterpretation of her cervical smear slides taken under the national screening programme wants to know her 12-year-old and seven-year-old daughters will be protected.

“My girls are not getting the support they need” she said. “I suppose as someone who lost their own mam at 24 I know the scary feeling of being alone and feeling like you have lost your biggest support.”

A single mother Ms Bennett estimates the girls have lived with her own aunt for 18 months during the last four years while she attends St James Hospital.

Lynsey Bennett wants support for her 12-year-old and seven-year-old daughters.

In March the Supreme Court while ruling on Limerick-woman Ruth Morrissey’s case noted legislation is required around support to replace services which would have been provided by a deceased parent.

In a moving video shared on her social media account Ms Bennett addresses Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

“The Supreme Court ruling held that damages for loss of services care costs cannot be recovered from these cases"" said Ms Bennett. ""This is totally wrong.

Despite the court stating that changes to this complex area of law should be made by legislation the government has not acted. And has again failed me and other victims in my position.

Ms Bennett from Longford survived two previous bouts of cancer but it returned during the pandemic.

On her first diagnosis she said: “I knew something was wrong but I didn’t think it was cancer because my smear test had said I was fine. No more than when my GP saw me the first thing he checked was my smear test and he said to me ‘Your smear test was fine Lynsey and it wasn’t even a year ago’.”

She has found support in the 221+ group which represents women affected by failures in the Cervical Check programme.

“It’s so good to not be alone in this but then it is so heart-breaking to see what other women are going through” Ms Bennett said. “And it is so hard because everybody is at different stages and you can see what’s possibly your future.”

A government spokesman said Micheál Martin was 'deeply saddened' by Ms Bennett's letter has discussed it with the Health Minister and asked him to respond.

The Supreme Court ruling is being considered by Justice Minister Helen McEntee who met with the 221+ group.

Lynsey Bennett says her girls have lived with her own aunt for 18 months during the last four years while she attends St James Hospital.

The spokesman said: “However changing the law in this area would require detailed policy consideration given that any changes would apply to all personal injury cases involving death into the future.”

Separately Ms Bennett is suing the HSE Eurofins Biomnis Ireland Ltd and Quest Diagnostics Inc. in America.

Ms Bennett’s cancer it is claimed was allowed to develop and spread unidentified unmonitored and untreated until she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in January 2017.

Special for IndyStar

TAMPA Fla. – Shirtless fans beer-chugging on the Jumbotron and tailgating were all back for the Indiana football experience for the first and only time this season.

Indiana capped off one of its best seasons in decades with a trip to the Outback Bowl which the Hoosiers lost 26-20 to Ole Miss the game offered an opportunity for fans to attend a game for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under restrictions set by the Big Ten Indiana was only allowed to have family members in attendance for games throughout the season. Even with the state of Indiana allowing fans to attend games at Lucas Oil Stadium and Notre Dame Stadium Memorial Stadium was mostly filled with artificial crowd noise.

Doyel:The Hoosiers did this to themselves. They took this special season and stained it.

That was not the case at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

There were 11025 fans — about 6% of maximum capacity — allowed inside to watch the Outback Bowl and Indiana was strongly represented.

“It was cool to be home and play in front of a semi-full crowd and just hear the roar” Indiana linebacker and Tampa native Micah McFadden said postgame. “Glad we got to do it one time this year.”

Outside the stadium there were plenty of patches of cream and crimson preparing for the game. One tailgate featured Tampa resident and former Indiana football player Matthew Rohan who was a member of the 1979 Holiday Bowl team under Lee Corso.

Rohan has seen the ample amount of Tampa fan experiences lost last season including the Rays making it to the World Series the Lightning winning the Stanley Cup inside a bubble and Tom Brady leading a hopeful season with the Buccaneers this season which initially brought him hope about Indiana coming to play in the “city of champions.”

Despite the game not going as Rohan expected he is among the numerous alumni who are excited about the culture and direction of the program under Tom Allen.

“He’s the real deal” Rohan said. “…And he’s recruiting people from Florida. That’s the key. We’ve got (22 athletes) from Florida — student-athletes who are getting their degree and going out there to change the world. That’s what college is about.”

It wasn’t only those that were left out of the stadium this season that made the trip to Tampa for the game.

Indiana senior Sierra Bergdoll has been interning with Indiana’s marketing department this season which meant she was one of the few allowed inside on gamedays.

Her family was already planning on vacationing in Florida before the bowl announcement so they decided to drive up the morning of the game.

Bergdoll a senior was disappointed she wasn’t able to tailgate and celebrate IU’s wins like normal circumstances in Bloomington would allow but she found the silver lining in still being able to attend and watch a successful football team.

But the Outback Bowl allowed her to get a taste of what she missed.

Her family and friends helped fill the same parking lot as Rohan just outside the stadium with candy stripes and IU gear before heading into the game as a group for the first time this season.

“I’m super excited that everyone can enjoy the nice sunny weather and we’re able to tailgate” Bergdoll said. “It’s a good day to be a Hoosier.”

Joey Saporito is a former IU student from Cincinnati who didn’t have a group to attend the game with but still decided to make the trip on his own to get a glimpse of the historic season.

Saporito knew he’d be attending the game wherever it was as long as fans were allowed. Once the Outback Bowl was announced he was quick to book his trip.

“It’s been rough” Saporito said of not being able to attend games. “That’s why I wanted to jump on the opportunity since I wasn’t able to watch them any other time.”

Kevin Greve has been an Indiana football fan his entire life. He and his fellow IU friends got together each week to watch the team compete this season and they made the same decision as Saporito to attend a bowl game regardless of where it was.

They initially thought Indiana would be playing in Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl but once it became clearer IU would be left out of a New Year’s Six game the Citrus Bowl came into the picture.

One of Greve’s friends even booked a ticket to Orlando before finding out that Indiana would be knocked down in the pecking order in the Big Ten and would actually be playing in the Outback Bowl.

“Once we saw it was Tampa we were a little disappointed just for the guys because we thought they deserved a little better bowl” Greve said. “But the Outback Bowl is incredible and it was a cool opportunity. We knew we’d get the chance to go.”

Greve his wife and four of their friends made the trip for New Year’s and through the weekend.

Most of the group has owned season tickets since they were kids. Greve wore No. 11 as a quarterback in high school because of Antwaan Randle El.

They attended the Gator Bowl last season and after not being able to attend games this season Greve said it was a no-brainer to come to Florida.

Although the game didn’t meet up to expectations — Greve predicted a 37-14 win for Indiana — the attention now shifts to next year and hopefully returning to Memorial Stadium for another successful season.

“It’s gonna be hard not to shed a tear when we go to Memorial Stadium next year and get to ‘The Rock’” Greve said. “To just see them back in action there it’s gonna be a great feeling.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZ2F0b3JzLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEvaW5kaWFuYXMtbWljYWgtbWNmYWRkZW4tY2xvc2VzLW91dC1zZWFzb24taW4taG9tZXRvd24tZm9yLW91dGJhY2stYm93bC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indiana's Micah McFadden closes out season in hometown for Outback Bowl,"Indiana’s Micah McFadden will have his biggest crowd yet as he plays in his hometown Saturday afternoon in the Outback Bowl.

McFadden a Plant High product turned third-team All-American linebacker expects at least 45 friends and family to help fill the stands at Raymond James Stadium when the No. 7 Hoosiers take on Ole Miss (4-5).

“It’s going to mean a lot” said McFadden who had a team-best 52 tackles and five sacks en route to first-team all-Big Ten honors his junior year. “It’s going to be really exciting. I can’t wait to play in front of a big crowd to close out the season.”

McFadden’s not alone in his state ties. More than 20 Hoosiers have a link to Florida in some way. It’s the first game this season that the team will get to play in front of a true home crowd coach Tom Allen said. The Big Ten did not allow fans at games due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“Our fans have not seen us play” said Allen the former Temple Heights Christian coach and defensive coordinator at USF and Armwood High. “I’m so excited that our fans get to come to this game. I know there’s going to be a limit but it’s going to be more than just parents. Many of our loyal fans have not had the chance to see the 2020 Indiana Hoosiers play and man I hope that they come in droves and they support this team like they never have before. This team deserves it.”

McFadden has never played in Raymond James Stadium but he’s been there for a few Bucs games including the November 2016 matchup against Atlanta when former Bucs safety John Lynch was inducted into the Ring of Honor.

In normal times McFadden and his teammates would spend the week in Tampa. They’d enjoy the 80-degree weather and celebrate a great season with their families and friends in the week leading up to the season finale. But the coronavirus has altered all of that.

Indiana (6-1) didn’t arrive in Florida until Wednesday night. And Allen said some of his players might get to see some friendly faces outside of the Indiana program ahead of Saturday’s game in a “controlled bubble situation” with everyone wearing masks.

“There’s no question I want them to be able to be around their families” Allen said Thursday. “It’s been so long didn’t get to go home for Christmas so that’s kind of the compromise.”

Indiana hasn’t won a bowl game in nearly 30 years its last win coming against Baylor in the Copper Bowl back in 1991. Add in the fact that Indiana was excluded from a New Year’s Six bowl this year and there’s a little something extra to prove.

“(The bowl record is) talked about” McFadden said. “We definitely recognize it but I think these past two weeks the team’s really been focused and locked in on the opponent and getting ready for the execution and the fundamentals of the game and just putting in the word needed to make this week as clean and smooth as possible.”

Last year’s 23-22 loss to Tennessee in the Gator Bowl isn’t forgotten either.

“I choose not to forget about things like that in a positive way” Allen said. “There’s things from that game that I don’t want us to ever forget. … It’s that experience it’s that growth it’s that learning from the past and then letting those experiences be game-changers for your future and not things that continue to haunt you from the past.”

TAMPA — Ole Miss is the king of the Bloomin’ Onion in 2021.

In what served as a preview of the 2021 team the Rebels defeated No. 7 Indiana 26-20 in the Outback Bowl at Raymond James Stadium on Saturday. The win was the first bowl victory since the 2016 Sugar Bowl which was also the last bowl appearance for Ole Miss prior to this year.

The Rebels offense had a lot of unfamiliar faces and unorthodox looks to it due to opt-outs and injuries late in the season. Without Elijah Moore Kenny Yeboah Jerrion Ealy and Braylon Sanders quarterback Matt Corral was throwing to a few unusual suspects.

The biggest throw came during the Rebels’ final drive of the game when Corral hit John Rhys Plumlee for 44 yards setting up the game-winning touchdown reception by Dontario Drummond two plays later with just over four minutes remaining.

Plumlee served as a slot receiver on Saturday helping fill the void left by Moore’s absence. The quarterback finished with five catches for 76 yards.

“We were down receivers I think we were down to four scholarship receivers” said Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin. “For a guy to play only one week at receiver a remarkable kid to come in and do that. You just can’t do that. This isn’t pop warner. We’re in major college football playing a top 10 team and you play receiver for one week and make plays is special.”

Sophomore Jadon Jackson and junior tight end Chase Rogers were also part of an offense by committee for Ole Miss that saw above average playing time. Jackson recorded the first catch of the game finishing with four for 38 yards while Rogers had three catches for 18 yards.

Saving one of their better performances for last the Ole Miss defense stood tall against Indiana and quarterback Jack Tuttle in the final minutes. The Hoosiers (6-2) got to the Rebels’ 33 with just over a minute remaining and then went backwards 18 yards the ensuing plays. Tuttle’s pass on 4th and 18 fell incomplete sealing the Rebels’ win.

Ole Miss (5-5) held Indiana to 369 yards and two touchdowns. Whop Philyor had a record day for Indiana with 18 catches for 81 yards setting a new Outback Bowl record for receptions.

Junior Otis Reese made the biggest defensive play of the game picking off Tuttle late in the second half. Reese finished with nine tackles and Jacquez Jones led the team with 13 tackles.

The defense was also without a player with Lakia Henry not being available on Saturday.

“Really happy (with the defense)” Kiffin said. “We talked about all week we’re going to need that. We’re not going to go score 60 points. We just can’t do that without all those weapons versus a team that check people down. …We knew it was going to be a struggle and it was great to see the defense play like they did.”

Corral finished with 346 yards and two touchdowns earning Outback Bowl Most Valuable Player honors. The redshirt sophomore was more patient taking what Indiana’s defense gave him and making reads to his check down routes as opposed to forcing the ball down field any small windows.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvZ2FtZS9fL2dhbWVJZC80MDEyNTYxMTAvb2xlLW1pc3MtaW5kaWFuYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ole Miss 26-20 Indiana (Jan 2 2021) Final Score,"S.C. court orders ACC to provide Clemson with ESPN agreements

The Revision 2.0 board the spitting image of the prior revision sports a third 8-pin PCIe power connector.

The GeForce RTX 3080 rated for 320W makes do with a pair of 8-pin PCIe power connectors. Bearing in mind that the PCIe x16 slot provides 75W a setup with two 8-pin PCIe power connectors provides power delivery up to 375W more than sufficient for a GeForce RTX 3080. However custom models with high factory overclocks typically sip more power explaining the dependency on more PCIe power connectors.

In terms of pure performance the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G sports a 1845 MHz boost clock approximately 7.9% higher than the boost clock on the Founders Edition model. The graphics card is the second-fastest SKU in Gigabyte's Ampere GeForce RTX 3080 product stack. It only lags behind the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Xtreme 10G which flaunts a 1905 MHz boost clock and has three 8-pin PCIe power connectors.

Image 1 of 2 Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G (Rev. 1.0) (Image credit: Gigabyte) Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G (Rev. 2.0) (Image credit: Gigabyte)

The previous revision of the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G only required two 8-pin PCIe power connectors. The revamped power design certainly calls for attention. We suspect that Gigabyte's decision was purely based on optimizing costs because the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Xtreme 10G and the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G are practically the same graphics card sans the boost clock speed. By unifying both power layouts Gigabyte could easily recycle GPUs that don't qualify for the Xtreme variant for the Master variant.

With the extra 8-pin PCIe power connector on the new revision Gigabyte also raised the minimum power supply recommendation from 750W up to 850W. It remains to be seen whether Revision 2.0 will actually sip more or the same amount of power under normal circumstances. In any event it shouldn't be a major issue unless you're running a power supply at the borderline capacity of what Gigabyte recommends.

We don't expect the first revision to be in ample circulation anymore. Performance should be identical on both revisions but if you're set on adding the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G to your system grab the new revisions just for peace of mind. We've reached out to Gigabyte for more information and will update as necessary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbS5oZXh1cy5uZXQvdGVjaC9yZXZpZXdzL2dyYXBoaWNzLzE0NzE4NC1ldmdhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNjAtdGktZnR3My11bHRyYS1nYW1pbmcvP3BhZ2U9MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FTW3 Ultra Gaming - Graphics,"...If you can find one in stock at close to the mooted £429 price point it's worth a shout.

We wrap up the review roster for 2020 with a product emblematic of the times. The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti verges on impossible to find in stock and if you do be prepared to pay a handsome premium over recommended pricing.

Such matters are out of EVGA's hands and it produces a trio of aftermarket boards based on the thoroughly decent GPU. The FTW3 Ultra is the pick of the bunch as it elevates core speeds to run at a real-world 2GHz. Performance is fairly close to last generation's RTX 2080 Ti which means excellence at QHD and more than passable at UHD. Imbued with raytracing smarts and DLSS technology EVGA does a solid job in a crowded market.

We'd prefer a second BIOS it doesn't match the very best in the noise department and there's little scope for more performance by overclocking because EVGA already runs it fast.

Our advice is simple. If you can find one in stock at close to the mooted £429 price point it's worth a shout. If not the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FTW3 Ultra isn't as refined as some of the premium competition.

It looks like NVIDIA is still deciding on what to do next with its Ampere lineup and as such there are new rumors emerging from Kopite7kimi (via Videocardz) according to who NVIDIA is preparing two brand new SKUs which might possibly by the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Reportedly Under Consideration Could These Feature 16 GB GDDR6(X) VRAM?

For starters the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER are not going to affect the upcoming card lineup which would include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti & the GeForce RTX 3060. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti could be a whole different story since we have heard about this SKU for a while now but nothing has been formulated aside from some rumored specifications. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti have also been canceled and relaunched with different specs a couple of times now.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is even going to be introduced earlier than the RTX 3070 Ti so the status of this particular SKU is not confirmed yet. At the same time one thing to note about the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 is how both of them feature much higher memory capacities than their predecessors. The RTX 3080 Ti replaces the RTX 2080 Ti with 9 GB higher VRAM (11 GB vs 20 GB) and the RTX 3060 replaces the RTX 2060 with twice the memory buffer (6 GB vs 12 GB). The same might just be the case with the SUPER series that NVIDIA has planned.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & RTX 3070 SUPER

We don't have any concrete specifications of these two chips but if we go back to earlier rumors then we can tell that NVIDIA had initially planned higher VRAM variants of both RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 graphics cards. The RTX 3080 was expected to feature 12-16 GB VRAM while the RTX 3070 also had been expected to feature similar VRAM amounts. However that plan was scrapped in favor of NVIDIA going literally bonkers with its RTX 3090 design and keeping the rest of the lineup capped to 10 GB VRAM due to limited availability of GDDR6(X) modules.

I know there are some new SKUs recently but I don't know their names yet maybe 3070 Super and 3080 Super. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

By the time the RTX 3080 Ti launches the memory supply will be far better. NVIDIA themselves have also confirmed that supply would get better by the end of the first quarter of 2021 so that is probably when NVIDIA can devise a better plan to re-release their GeForce RTX lineup in a SUPER fashion.

For this purpose the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER could be the first entrants in the lineup. Similar to the previous generation NVIDIA wouldn't want to touch the high-end models since they will be positioned right against the competition. It's the RTX 3080 and below lineups such as the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti which would require a SUPER refresh to tackle AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6700 series.

GA102 and GA103S — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

For that purpose alone NVIDIA could end up featuring 16 GB of GDDR6(X) memory on both the RTX 3080 SUPER (GDDR6X) & the GeForce 3070 SUPER (GDDR6). As for core configurations they might also change with the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER expected to utilize the GA103S GPU while the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER would retain its GA102 GPU.

However one critical thing to consider here would be the prices. Whether NVIDIA offers a price cut on existing variants and ends their production to make room for the new cards which is similar to what they did in the last generation or keep the existing cards and offer the SUPER variants with a slight premium that remains to be seen. Lastly don't expect the SUPER cards anytime soon as the green team has yet to be done with the original lineup. We can probably expect an announcement around Computex or during Summer which was also the case with the GeForce RTX 20 SUPER line.

This model features GA104-200 GPU from the RTX 3060 Ti graphics card model.

Gigabyte has a new VISION

The RTX 3060 Ti VISION OC is a factory-overclocked model to 1755 MHz which appears to be an average clock speed for customs designs based on this NVIDIA SKU. Compared to the RTX 3070 the new VISION model features the same triple-fan WindForce 3X cooling solution however for the first time Gigabyte has brought this cooler in a true 2-slot design. Previous models such as RTX 3070 or RTX 3080 were all 2.5 to 3-slot designs.

The graphics card features a full custom PCB with dual power connectors. Unlike many other custom designs this card features 8-pin and 6-pin power connectors which theoretically provides as much as 300W of power for the whole card when PCIe power is also considered. Naturally this model will not consume this much power but the power envelope for potential manual overclocking is certainly improved. Sadly Gigabyte does not list TGP values for its graphics cards hence it is unclear how much more power the graphics card needs compared to the Founders Edition.

Another interesting aspect of this model is the display output configuration. Unlike reference design this card features dual DisplayPort 1.4 and dual HDMI 2.1 ports. Sadly there are no USB Type-C on this card despite the VISION series being targeted for content creators.

Gigabyte has not yet confirmed when will this model will be available for sale it has only just appeared on the company website this week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvYXN1cy16ZXBoeXJ1cy1nMTUtZ2E1MDNxcy1ib2FzdHMtcnl6ZW4tNy01ODAwaHMtcnR4LTMwODAtYW5kLTE1Ni1pbmNoLTE0NGh6LWRpc3BsYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 GA503QS Gaming Laptop Boasts Ryzen 7 5800HS RTX 3080 And 144Hz Display,"



CES 2021 is less than two weeks away and the leaks are already starting to flood in. Earlier this week we informed you that ASUS has several ROG Strix gaming laptops on the way with up to a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU and up to a Ryzen 9 5900H processor onboard.

Now we're learning about another ASUS gaming laptop that will likely be unveiled at CES 2021: the Zephyrus G15 (GA503QS). The listing for the laptop comes from Amazon China and surprisingly is still active even though ASUS has not made any official announcements. Rather humorously there actually aren't any images of the Zephyrus G15 presented in the listing; instead there are images of what appears to be a shower curtain. But we digress...

Digging deeper into the listing (via MyLaptopGuide) we see that the Zephyrus G15 is powered by AMD's new Zen 3-powered Ryzen 7 5800HS processor (35W) which is the successor to the Ryzen 7 4800HS. Given that the Ryzen 7 5800HS hasn't even been announced yet we don't have any official specs to offer you at this time. However it's rumored that it is an 8-core/16-thread SKU with a base clock of 3.0GHz and a boost clock of 4.3GHz.





When it comes to memory the laptop has 8GB of DDR4-3200 soldered onto the motherboard and another 8GB of DDR4-3200 is installed via an accessible SO-DIMM slot (a maximum of 24GB is supported). This machine has a 512GB PCIe 3.0 SSD installed although we still don't know at this point if Zen 3 mobile processors will support PCIe 4.0 like Intel's Tiger Lake mobile platform. AMD's Zen 2 mobile processors skipped out on this feature so we're hoping that it won't be a repeat with this generation.

On the graphics front we're looking at an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card which drives a 15.6-inch Full HD display. That display also comes with a fast 144Hz refresh rate which is a perfect pairing with the RTX 3080. Other items of note include a 90Whr battery and a total system weight of 4.19 pounds which is quite respectable for a gaming laptop in the size class.

We'll have to wait until CES 2021 kicks off on January 11th to hear about the Zephyrus G15 along with pricing and availability."

Live trees are serving a purpose beyond the holidays through the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's Habitat for the Holidays program.

""Instead of letting that tree go to waste we have drop-off locations to improve angling throughout the state"" said Colton Dennis a fisheries habitat coordinator with Game and Fish. ""Throughout January anglers can create brush piles in nearby lakes from these donated trees increasing fishing opportunities and habitat for themselves and other anglers.""

Trees may be dropped off at Beaver Lake at the Arkansas 12 bridge access and at the Don Roufa access near the U.S. 412 bridge according to a news release from the commission. Trees may be dropped near the boat ramps at Lake Elmdale near Elm Springs Crystal Lake in Decatur and Bob Kidd Lake in Prairie Grove.

Artificial trees aren't allowed at those drop-off locations and all ornaments tinsel and lights must be removed before dropping off live trees.

Any angler can take the trees. Anglers supply their own rope and weights to sink the trees.

""Cinder blocks and sandbags work well to sink the trees and parachute cord works very well to bind trees together and attach them to the weight"" Dennis said. ""By the time the cord deteriorates the tree will be waterlogged enough to stay put.""

Most Christmas trees will likely deteriorate within a year or two he said but they offer very good cover for small bait fish and ambush locations for larger sport fish until they rot away.

The Benton County Environmental Department encourages residents to work through trash collection providers to dispose of live Christmas trees according to Teresa Sidwell environmental manager.

Artificial trees with all decorations removed can be dropped off at Benton County Convenience centers in Centerton 5702 Brookside Road from 8-11 a.m. and noon to 3 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday; in Rogers 2307 N. Arkansas St. from 8-11 a.m. and noon to 3 p.m. Tuesday-Friday and the second and fourth Saturday of each month; and Siloam Springs 1108 E. Ashley St. from 8 a.m. to noon the first and third Saturday of each month according to the Benton County Solid Waste District website.

Curbside tree collection won't be offered in Bentonville according to a representative with Republic Services the city's waste and recycling provider.

Fayetteville residents can have live Christmas trees turned into compost by putting them out on the same day as their residential trash collection through January according to the Fayetteville Recycling and Trash Collection Department web page.

Trees may also be dropped off at Fayetteville's composting site at 1708 S. Armstrong Ave. for free from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday and from 8 a.m. to noon the first Saturday of each month according to the web page.

All trees must be free of plastic bags stands decorations lights and tinsel before they'll be accepted and artificial trees won't be collected.

Residents of Rogers can have live Christmas trees picked up curbside Monday through Jan. 8 on their regular service day according to an Orion Waste Solutions representative the company that provides trash and recycle service for Rogers.

People must call (479) 878-1384 by noon the day before their usual service day to notify Orion of the pickup according to the representative. Artificial trees can be picked up on customers' bulk pickup day through coordination with Orion as well.

The Waste Management collection provider in Springdale hasn't determined when it will be picking up Christmas trees this season according to a Bulky Waste Program representative. Residents can call (479) 750-8135 to leave their name and contact information with program staff so they can be notified when collection begins.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pdGNoZWxscmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbWF4aW5lLWktaG9oYmFjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maxine I.

How do we get and not hurt neighbors?,"Mo Stein and Sheila Harris

opinion contributors

Arizona is sadly experiencing increased homelessness. The challenges faced by those seeking support are more complex than we knew or understood 15 years ago when the Human Services Campus was created in Phoenix’s Capitol Mall neighborhood.

The campus does not create homelessness. But it simply cannot keep up with the needs especially during the global pandemic and economic downturn we now face.

At the same time it is not a responsibility of neighborhoods to solve homelessness challenges either. Phoenix’s general plan clearly notes that every neighborhood has a right to be sustainable and support the lives of individuals and families in all walks and ambitions.

Every neighborhood and community deserve to have a level of certainty.

The campus has helped thousands

The campus was the result of significant energy love and money to invest in our city’s social equity. The idea of bringing social service providers together at a common place to leverage missions had never happened before. It was the result of a willingness to take on the toughest of problems because there was no constituency prepared to own them.

This effort remains a landmark experience that has truly made a difference in thousands of lives.

Everyone involved in the formation of the campus knew we could not end homelessness definitively but we knew we could make a difference.

Today we are faced with an unfair situation: growing homelessness maintaining safe and equitable neighborhoods and recognizing this issue requires all parts of a great city to be involved.

The neighborhoods surrounding the campus are negatively impacted because many cannot be helped at the campus. As you might expect others not seeking support are drawn here too. There are not enough beds and services to meet the volume.

Everyone agrees we have a problem

The campus has asked for zoning permission to grow to 1000 beds to address the growing need. However the neighborhoods need to be able to grow thrive and restore the sense of community and safety they have worked so hard to attain.

Both conditions must be addressed.

On Sept. 17 the Phoenix Community Alliance (PCA) convened a forum of public officials and community stakeholders to bring people together to solve a tough problem. Catherine Reagor of The Arizona Republic moderated the discussion.

Catherine asked two very clear questions to get past the normal angst and emotion of zoning conditions. The goal was meaningful dialogue and new ideas:

First what is it that you really want to accomplish?

Second what are you willing to do to make it a reality?

The result was a call to listen and a plea for action. The issue is not agreement on the problem; the issue is not having consensus on what to do about it.

What we can agree on

This is a regional reality. Most agree the problem we face is a regional issue. While the initial investment of the county is laudable and the continuing efforts of the City of Phoenix are significant this is not just a Phoenix issue and it is not just a downtown issue. This problem can never be moved the right direction until other parts of the city and other cities themselves take action and provide resources and energy.

We must better communicate. While the concerns of the campus and of neighborhood residents and businesses would seem to be aligned that is not the case. This is largely due to lack of common conversations or resources to bring people together until there is a mandatory public reason to work together. Investing in neighborhoods by zoning stipulation is never successful.

There is much fear and uncertainty. Although we are talking about a location that is walkable to downtown and the state Capitol with a future light rail extension years of not knowing where to turn and where to go for answers impact neighborhoods. The result is an environment based on fear and uncertainty.

5 ways we can help solve this

Based on this dialogue and transparency PCA calls on elected officials and business leaders at all scales to join us in recommending these specific actions:

1. The boards of the Human Services Campus and the neighborhoods must act in concert and with the earned support of each other. We call on each to diversify their boards to include members of both groups.

2. Communication that goes beyond a zoning request is essential. We call on city leaders to assign a “go to” person to coordinate efforts backed up by a coordinated hybrid inter-departmental work group.

3. Every part of our city has a core plan or special district plan to guide growth – every part except the Capitol District. We ask the city Planning and Development Department and Central City Village Planning Committee to initiate the formation of an East Capitol District Special Plan and then overlay the entire geography with a Planned Area Development (PAD) to assure it is followed. The 1997 Legislative Governmental Mall Commission District Plan has been largely ignored for more than two decades.

4. We ask the city Community and Economic Development Department to work with business leaders and area representatives to create a new model of improvement district that will attract opportunities for business and affordable residential development. The goal is to establish new financial resources and critical mass for maintenance safety and public amenities.

5. We applaud Mayor Kate Gallego’s plan to dramatically increase affordable housing in Phoenix. We propose to initiate that challenge with the first 1000 homes to be built in this district to incent our new spirit of urban growth and commitment.

We know other nonprofit organizations and businesses are working diligently to address the issues of affordability supportive housing and homelessness. We ask you to align efforts with PCA to bring the effort and attention that this problem deserves. We cannot get to any goal line until we have the city county and state committed to working together to improve the Capitol Mall neighborhood.

The September forum was the first dialogue PCA will convene on reframing the social infrastructure of homelessness and supportive housing. PCA remains committed to doing our part to bring diverse groups together roll up our sleeves and get the job done.

It is a difficult and thankless job but that’s what caring communities do.

Campaigns and messages have told us enough that no matter how you consume it or in what form you consume it — be it cigarettes hookah or bidi there is no safe substance in any tobacco product.

“These substances don’t just affect your lungs they have a detrimental impact on your entire body and contribute in reducing the number of years in your life” shared Dr Sibasish Dey from ResMed.

Effects of smoking

Reports suggest that India contributes 38% to the global burden of COPD – a rather alarming figure . (Source: Getty/Thinkstock) . (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)

While few long-term effects of smoking can take years to develop — some of the physical effects that develop in short term are anxiety and irritability dull sense of smell nausea loss of appetite along with yellow fingers and more.

“In fact according to the American Lung Association cigarette smoking generates over 7000 chemicals many of which are poisonous and over 70 are carcinogenic. Smoking damages the air sacs in your lungs and makes breathing difficult leading to respiratory ailments such as COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)” pointed out Dr Dey.

Did you know that for an asthma patient even passive smoking which happens by standing close to a person who is smoking can prove to be a factor for an exacerbation?

Evidence suggests that smoking is by far the leading cause of the development of COPD because there were more than 10 million deaths globally as a result of tobacco consumption. “According to WHO (World Health Organisation) over 80 per cent of the 1.3 billion smokers live in low-income countries where the burden of respiratory ailments is the heaviest. Out of these over 12 per cent of the smokers are found in India itself” said Dr Dey.

While COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is not that much heard of but it is projected to be the third leading cause of deaths worldwide as per a 2020 report by GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) an international body dedicated to the disease.

“Closer to home reports suggest that India contributes 38 per cent to the global burden of COPD – a rather alarming figure” says Dr Dey.

How to avoid respiratory ailments?

The first and major effective method to avoid respiratory ailments is to quit smoking. “The ongoing pandemic is an opportunity for people who smoke to recognise the serious health risks associated with the addiction such as COPD vulnerability for COVID-19 and consider quitting” shared the doctor.

Existing COPD patients must continue with their medications and refer their treating physician in case of difficulty in breathing and those with critical cases should resort to Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) in order to avoid exacerbation of COPD symptoms.

She picked the best time to shop: New Year's Eve.

Shopping malls were not as busy as the Christmas Eve rush but there was a steady flow of shoppers.

""There was no line going in or going out. I was just taking my time looking around so it took me about two hours to shop only at one store Ross"" Mendiola said after shopping at the Guam Premier Outlets in Tamuning. ""I'm from Santa Rita so when I go out and about I make sure I make the most out of it.""

Mendiola a fifth grade teacher at Harry S. Truman Elementary School said she's worried and still a bit scared going back to face-to-face classroom teaching because the COVID-19 pandemic is still not over.

""I'm nervous but excited at the same time because I get to see my students for the first time"" she said.

Teachers will report back to work on Jan. 4 and classes begin two weeks after that.

""This is a day by myself to do some shopping because my stress level is creeping up there because of heading back to school but this kind of helps me out doing this just by myself"" she said.

The longtime educator said she's thankful retail stores are open on New Year's Eve.

The only thing she bought for herself is a snow globe with a unicorn inside for her school desk. She was holding on to it to make sure it doesn't break.

She brought with her four reusable shopping bags to Ross.

""I'm trying to get used to this. Jan. 1 is the start of the plastic bag ban"" she said.

Compadres Mall in Dededo just like other shopping centers saw ""a lot of increase in activity"" during the holiday season especially toward Christmas according to Vice President Jose Untalan.

""Despite how busy it became our tenants made sure to continue following the safety guidelines given by the governor"" he said.

Shopping centers require masks temperature checks and social distancing.

""We have been seeing a consistent healthy crowd and once higher indoor dining capacity is allowed and bingo opens up we expect the mall to be even busier. We have been very blessed and fortunate that we’ve continued to operate at 100% capacity during the second half of the year"" Untalan said.

As 2021 rolls in Untalan said ""Compadres Mall would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year and May God continue to bless us all and keep us safe.""

For Amalia Tedtaotao 18 shopping on New Year's Eve also proved to be so convenient.

""I got a few items that we really needed baking stuff for the New Year's Eve celebration"" she said after shopping at GPO.

Tedtaotao said especially with the pandemic her first choice is to shop online but there are always some items that are not available online or retailers don't ship them to Guam.

""Thankfully many stores on Guam are open now so we can get the items we need right away too"" she said.

San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt came to the defense of his right fielder saying Tatis is ""seeing way too many pitches up and in.""

The rant came after the Padres' 7-1 win over the NL West rival Arizona Diamondbacks.

Tatis ducked out of the way of a pitch near his head several innings after he hit a two-run home run.

""It's enough. It really is enough. If you want to throw in that's fine. But I don't know what people are trying to accomplish by throwing up and in. All you're doing is p---ing the guy off and it's uncalled for"" Shildt said. ""It's happening way too frequently and it's not something that we're going to tolerate much longer.

""Throwing inside is part of the game’’ Shildt added. ""We know this for 100-plus years. It’s part of it. And the inner half can be a battle between the pitcher and the hitter. We do it. We expect people to do it. It’s part of it. But I’ve seen way too many pitchers up and in on Tati.

""I mean listen if you want to throw up and in on the guy fine. But get away from the top of his body and definitely stay away from his head. That’s just not appropriate. And no hitter no pitcher nobody could defend it. I don’t get it. It’s not necessary. It’s not the way it needs to be played.""

Tatis says it's simply just a strategy.

""Pitchers feel like that’s the only way to get me out"" he said.

But he says he has noticed there have been a few pitches near the danger zone.

""I’m trying to stay in the game but I feel like there’s been so many of those"" Tatis said. ""You're throwing at my head. So if you can’t go inside just figure it out and clean it up.""

Tatis received an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a banned substance in 2022 but he doesn't think it has anything to do with that. It's been well over a year at this point.

Tatis is without a doubt one of the more colorful players in the league though. When an opposing fan base mocked his suspension with a chant last season he danced to it. And his bat flips will always annoy plenty.

He's even had a brushback from his own organization.

When Tatis got suspended Padres general manager A.J. Preller seemed to insinuate Tatis was out of his circle of trust citing a lack of ""maturity."" Tatis had been injured in one of several of his motorcycle crashes over the previous offseason and the suspension came down just as he was about to return from injury.

Tatis is slashing .246/.333/.455 after winning a Gold Glove in right field last year his first year at the position. He finished in 14th in the NL MVP vote last year after finishing in fourth and third in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

Tatis signed a 14-year $340 million extension before the 2021 season after playing just 143 big league games.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3Mvcy1qYWlzaGFua2FyLXJlYWN0cy10by1jYW5hZGEtYXJyZXN0aW5nLTMtaW5kaWFucy1pbi1oYXJkZWVwLW5pamphci1tdXJkZXItNTU5MTE2NNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3Mvcy1qYWlzaGFua2FyLXJlYWN0cy10by1jYW5hZGEtYXJyZXN0aW5nLTMtaW5kaWFucy1pbi1oYXJkZWVwLW5pamphci1tdXJkZXItNTU5MTE2NC9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S Jaishankar Reacts To Canada Arresting 3 Indians In Hardeep Nijjar Murder,"S Jaishankar said he had seen news of the arrests. (File)

India will wait for Canadian police to share information on the three Indian men it has arrested and charged with the murder of a Khalistani terrorist last year Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday.

Canadian police charged the three on Friday over the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and said they were probing whether the suspects had links to the Indian government.

Mr Jaishankar said he had seen news of the arrests and said the suspects ""apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background... we'll have to wait for the police to tell us.""

""But as I said one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that you know they have allowed organized crime from India specifically from Punjab to operate in Canada"" said Mr Jaishankar.

Sanjay Verma India's high commissioner to Canada said that it hopes to get regular updates from Canadian authorities regarding the three arrested Indians.

""I understand that the arrests have been made as a result of investigations conducted by the relevant Canadian law enforcement agencies. This issue is internal to Canada and therefore we have no comments to offer in this regard"" Mr Verma added.

The trio all Indian nationals were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday police said.

Nijjar 45 was shot dead in June outside a gurdwara in Surrey a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population.

Cosmetics?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m not going to lie it was - and still is - hard! But at the same time it was exhilarating. The world to come is going to be like this: we’re all going to be disrupted 70000 times in our lives and we’re going to have to get out of our comfort zone more regularly. For managers like me this means making quick decisions based on partial information and no longer with full knowledge of the facts. And this is not an ability that can be learnt overnight it’s a muscle that you train throughout your life.

What measures have you taken to withstand the crisis?

Sabrina Herlory - We have trained our sales consultants in ""virtual selling"" i.e. one-to-one personalized advice at a distance. This has been appreciated by the teams who have suffered quite a lot during these periods of partial unemployment which are very depressing. They realized that even if there was pressure on the retail sector their occupation could evolve thanks to digital technology and not disappear!

And does ""virtual selling"" work for makeup?

Sabrina Herlory - Many doubted it but I can tell you that yes it’s very interesting from a human point of view and from a pure business point of view as well. The one-to-one digital concept is a bubble even more insulated than the physical experience in the store. It allowed us to maintain a connection with our customers who are used to human interaction when buying makeup. We launched these virtual appointments in September 2020 and 70% of the customers who received advice remotely then moved on to a physical store. Real remote personalized advice can channel traffic for brands when the stores reopen.

Is the humanization of digital the next step?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m convinced it is! This was the missing piece and the lockdown allowed us to implement it thanks to digital tools. It’s quite satisfying to say that yes there has been an explosion of the digital but what we’re learning is that consumers need to talk to real people! For me the brands that understand this will be the ones that will remain sustainable. If we can prove that the humanization of digital is turning into R.O.I. live chats will be one-to-one remote consultations will be one-to-one... Because we are all social animals with a real need for quality human interactions. And that goes beyond sales.

What does that mean?

Sabrina Herlory - Today if a brand is not organically socially committed to a 360-degree project I think it will not be able to count in the world to come: it’s ""how I treat customers my suppliers what footprint do I leave how do managers treat their employees"". I see more and more managers deeply preoccupied by this global commitment. They often come from the next generation I must say. They are socially engaged and that’s very gratifying!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9ld2Fsc2gvMjAyMS8wMS8wMS95ZWxsZW4tZWFybmVkLTcyLW1pbGxpb24taW4tc3BlYWtpbmctZmVlcy1vdmVyLWxhc3QtdHdvLXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yellen Earned $7.2 Million In Speaking Fees Over Last Two Years,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/01/01/yellen-earned-72-million-in-speaking-fees-over-last-two-years/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9ld2Fsc2gvMjAyMS8wMS8wMS95ZWxsZW4tZWFybmVkLTcyLW1pbGxpb24taW4tc3BlYWtpbmctZmVlcy1vdmVyLWxhc3QtdHdvLXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9zZXR0aW5nLXVwLXB5dGhvbi1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC11c2luZy1naXRodWItYWN0aW9ucy05YTgxOTM2YmU1YznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Configure Github Actions the Easy Way. | by Salma El Shahawy,"Introduction

The historic Sherwin warehouse along Horton was the only building persevered when the former Sherwin-Williams paint factory was demolished in 2006. The building once supported the iconic “Cover The Earth” neon sign whose history we spotlighted last year.

The 3-story building consisting of 72000 square feet and is part of a larger 7.9 acre FDP that will include 500 housing units over two acres of park space ground floor commercial space the continuation of the Greenway and the city-funded bike/ped bridge to Bay Street.

DES Architects presented their plans to renovate and modernize the building to attract Life Science startups and office tenants.

The most dramatic update for the building will be the creation of a pass through “Alley” at 45th street allowing bicycle & pedestrian thoroughfare and breaking up the super-block the long structure created. The feature was a concession to neighbors of the 45th Street Artists’ Cooperative giving them more convenient access to the forthcoming park space.

The pass through will also include recessed linear downlighting and illuminated bollards. Renovations will also include street and landscaping improvements accessibility updates and roof screens to obscure the unsightly ventilation and mechanical equipment.

Shortly after the plans were approved a sale of the building was announced between Lennar Multifamily and Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. The deal was facilitated by New York-based Commercial Real Estate broker the The Newmark Group.

“1450 Sherwin represents a rare opportunity for an investor to acquire a fully-entitled large block vacancy with the ideal foundation for life science repositioning in one of the region’s hottest life science markets” Newmark’s Head of Northern California Capital Markets Steven Golubchik stated in a press release.

According to Newmark Walton Street Capital is actively acquiring and seeking acquisition of other Life Science opportunities located within the primary bay area clusters.

Emeryville appears to be in a strong position to build on its place as a hub for the flourishing Life Sciences sector. In addition to this project the city has seen the recent completion of the EmeryStation West tower approved plans for the Public Market’s Parcel B as well as the sale of the nearby Novartis property to BioMed Realty with plans to build another 561K square feet of office space.

When completed these projects will extend the Berkeley-Emeryville Biotech Corridor that already contains more than 150 life science companies.

According to Newmark research the Northern East Bay life sciences “footprint” totals over four million square feet and represents 15% of the total Bay Area market. They collectively boast an availability rate of just 5.6% with a current tenant demand of 630000 square feet.

Palm Beach Daily News

Well 2021 is here. And aren’t we glad?

Everyone has surely been awaiting its arrival happy to say goodbye to 2020 when the world endured such disquieting and difficult circumstances. COVID COVID COVID — that was rightly on everyone’s mind with cases increasing deaths rising and lockdowns and quarantines happening all over the world.

We’re not out of the woods yet by any means — keep those masks on and social distancing in place! But with the news of two vaccines being distributed I’m looking for sunshine in 2021.

I cannot wait to see the yellow daffodils bloom in springtime — and my color focus for the New Year is on bright happy yellow.

If you are thinking of painting your bedroom living room or nearly any room in your home this new year think marigold yellow lemon chiffon or Charlottesville gold beautiful colors from Fine Paints of Europe.

Or explore the yellow color range from Benjamin Moore or Sherwin Williams — many paint companies to choose from! Find a yellow you like and begin setting a background of cheerfulness.

This is the time of year that many color and paint companies offer their color choices for 2021.

I just got word that the Pantone Color Institute has picked as one of its two colors of the year a bold yellow it calls “Illuminating.” Along with the yellow the color experts at Pantone chose a color named ""Ultimate Gray.""

Now as you all know by now I am not a gray decorator. I’m not a fan of automobile color charts that offer “Cement” as a choice. Be that as it may all of us have different color preferences.

To start the New Year off right I’m offering a decorating suggestion or two for using Pantone’s Illuminating yellow with Ultimate Gray in a living room.

Begin by painting all the walls Illuminating yellow and all the trim white. Paint your ceiling the softest sky blue you can find.

At the windows hang plantation shutters painted gray and make sure the shutter knobs are bright-and-shiny brass. Upholster your sofa in a gray velvet and accent it with big cushions of covered in gold sky blue and a plaid or stripe in gray sky blue and gold. I would also add a sofa cushion also of tangy sunshine-mandarin orange.

I’d drape the end tables in yellow silk of the Illuminating yellow color and trim the bottom of the cloths with a fringe fashioned in the gray with black. On the draped tables place lamps with ebony-black ceramic bases with white shades.

Keep the gold shining in your room with a coffee table of brass fitted with a glass top. Accent the glass top with a pair of silver candlesticks and a pot or two of the current flower in bloom.

You’ll have to select a rug to top your polished white-bleached wood floor. My suggestion would be a faux-zebra rug in gray and white — at least 9-by-12 feet.

Cover your club chairs in the room in your colorful plaid as well.

And for the seats of your pull-up chairs select a fabric that smiles with sunshine. Whether it’s a stripe a floral or a geometric pattern it should include the colors of the year — Illuminating yellow and gray with added touches of white and my favorite sky blue.

There is always a way to make gray which can be such a sad color come alive when it’s paired with sky blue mandarin orange and gold.

Welcome to 2021 when we all hope we can look forward to some sunshine again. Happy New Year!

ployees worked from home. In 2021 many workers will return

to the office to at least collaborate on projects (Michael Collier).

In its latest Skyline Report real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) said downtown Cleveland’s office market is far healthier than some had feared. Its report had some interesting data to share showing that downtown is quietly waiting for the all-clear from pandemic-related restrictions to resume its renaissance.

The report also suggests that downtown Cleveland is in need of more Trophy Class or Class A multi-tenant office space either by renovating older buildings or more likely building new ones. With Ohio’s passage of the Transformational Mixed Use Development tax credit program developers may soon have the resources to add high-end competitive office spaces downtown.

JLL reported that even with some employees working remotely “the purpose of the office will transform from a place to complete routine tasks into an environment that encourages collaboration innovation and social interaction.”

Sherwin Williams (SHW) continues to press ahead with development of its 1-million-square-foot single-tenant global headquarters in downtown Cleveland. A groundbreaking by the end of this year is reportedly the goal. SHW has signaled no plans to scale back the size of its project in any way.

“Driven by our continued need to serve our customers at the highest level and retain and attract top talent we intend to build a next-generation headquarters in downtown Cleveland that ignites creativity collaboration and industry-leading innovation” said SHW Chairman & CEO John Morikis in a written statement.

In fact pre-development activity for SHW’s HQ suggests two skyscrapers just west of Public Square along Superior Avenue. The office tower may rival the height of its Public Square neighbors. However some are speculating that the second tower may not be an office building but a hotel built atop a parking garage.

Some of the highest-quality most-expensive office buildings

in downtown Cleveland have the best occupancy rates. Black

floors show leased spaces. Red is vacant. Blue is hotel. Gray

is casino. Orange is a vacant sublease. Light brown is a resi-

dential conversion either existing underway or planned (JLL).

Increasingly downtown’s new or existing offices will be built or redesigned to obtain a Healthy Building designation by providing superior standards for air quality ventilation and natural light. Healthy buildings also help reduce the spread of bacteria and viruses by leveraging touchless technologies in high-traffic areas JLL said.

Despite some media reports saying downtown buildings will see a significant increase in sublease space due to the economy and remote working JLL’s research team has not seen this yet.

“Through the first nine months of the year though this has not been the case. The amount of sublease space on the market is relatively unchanged from the end of 2019” JLL’s report said.

Over the past decade tenant demand has been disproportionally skewed towards Trophy and Class A inventory. Because of historic tax credits 23 obsolete office buildings have been redeveloped since 2010 eliminating more than 6.1 million square feet of downtown office space.

The only multi-tenant office tower built downtown in the last decade was the 2013-built 470000-square-foot Ernst & Young Tower 950 Main Ave. As a Trophy Class property it has the third-highest rents in Cleveland yet is 97 percent leased according to JLL.

The real estate services firm points out that a significant number of tenants have migrated from the suburbs to downtown Cleveland “to take part in the renaissance of the urban core.” With the recent challenges of downtown from COVID-19 to remote employment to civil unrest some are speculating that companies will move back to the suburbs.

downtown Cleveland offices in the North Point Tower (HOK).

This is not likely to be the case JLL said. It conducted a survey which found a resounding 93 percent of business leaders who currently have offices downtown have no intention of relocating to the suburbs.

Instead of offices moving to the suburbs the exact opposite appears to be occurring.

FM Global a Providence RI-based commercial property insurer will be relocating more than 100 employees from the Great Northern Corporate Center in North Olmsted to downtown Cleveland. It is leasing 32915 square feet in the 19-story North Point Tower 1001 Lakeside Ave. according to plans filed with the City of Cleveland. Those plans show an office layout accommodating 138 seated workers.

Last year sources said FM Global was destined for the proposed One Lakewood Place mixed use development to give its employees a more connected urban setting. But when Carnegie Management & Development walked away from the project FM Global resumed its search for a more urbanized location to attract young talent.

It will spend nearly $2 million to white-box and renovate the 11th floor and part of the 12th floor of the North Point Tower built in 1989. FM Global will also be adding new data infrastructure an employees cafe and other amenities plans show.

This follows news that NEOtrans broke in 2020 that Fathom marketing and Goldwater Bank N.A. Mortgage Division are relocating their offices and about nearly 150 jobs total from the suburbs to downtown.

And the biggest relocation of all is that of CrossCountry Mortgage LLC. It intends to bring its headquarters and more than 500 employees from Brecksville to downtown Cleveland. It will renovate for $40 million the former Tap Packaging (previously The Chilcote Co.) complex in the 2100 block of Superior Ave.

Sources said the fast-growing company will likely add another 200 jobs at its new headquarters. And in the near future company officials reportedly anticipate increasing its headquarters workforce to 2000 employees. Long term one of the buildings they’re looking at expanding into is the former Plain Dealer building 1801 Superior Ave. a source said.

Wherever the sun shines people need shade. These recent canopy projects from around the world fulfill that mission with inspired design and expert execution.

by Jeff Moravec

Custom canopy projects can present unique challenges to their creators but that’s a reason many designers fabricators and installers enjoy them. These projects give them a chance to flex their creative muscles while solving problems.

Here are three examples of recent canopy projects from locations around the world that offered their creators an opportunity to shine.

Mexico City: Industrious inspiration

Completed in 2020 “Ant Walk” a shade structure in the Azcapotzalco municipality of Mexico City provides a space where the community can carry out commercial and recreational activities. Designed by the Mexican company Ketan Membranas Arquitectónicas the canopy illustrates that inspiration can begin with unusual sources.

“The concept of this project came from a visit to the park with my daughter where I saw groups of ants carrying leaves” says Miriam Vargas CEO of Ketan Membranas Arquitectónicas. “That led me to imagine the merchants as a large community that works together and fights for its objectives taking care of each other.”

Starting with the analogy of how ant colonies are organized and the work dynamics that these insects use to provide themselves with resources a team of architects engineers and technicians assumed the task of solving the protection function of the canopy in an aesthetic way resulting in the set of stelae in the shape of giant leaves says Vargas.

One of the challenges of the project was to achieve harmony between the existing foliage and the proposed roofs since the intention was to reflect them as an extension of the same environment without losing the original concept a challenge that was achieved because of the experience of all collaborators.

The project includes 1908 square meters of VALMEX® FR 900 MEHATOP® N type architectural membrane from Mehler Texnologies®️ (Freudenberg Performance Materials) along with A500 steel with a Sherwin-Williams® paint finish. Project partners of note included Gobierno Organización y Desarrollo S.A. de C.V.

Vargas says she is satisfied with the work of her entire team. “For me more than designing and proposing is inhabiting spaces and imagining how they will look in the real life” she says. “It is very satisfying to materialize what I imagine.”

New Zealand: Problem solving

When a New Zealand musician wanted to cover his new deck to create a sheltered area to entertain guests he turned to Fresco Shades NZ Ltd. but not because the company was the low bidder.

“He was very particular about the design” says Megan Cummins one of Fresco’s founders. “He chose us over others despite the fact that we were [thousands of dollars] more expensive due to our understanding of his needs great customer service and ability to translate his dream space into reality.”

The project called for a modern practical canopy to cover two sides of the house which was totally enclosed according to Cummins. The client also wanted the canopy to flow seamlessly around the corner rather than having it in two separate sections which would have made it look like an add-on. Two entry and exit points that would be quick and easy to use were also required.

“Making the canopy into a continuous flow around the corner was the most complicated part of the project” explains Cummins. “Getting the angle correct as well as ensuring weather tightness of the cover was very important or it would not have worked. The angle detail was drawn in CAD and fabricated with precision in our workshop. It fit perfectly on-site and everything worked out as planned in less than the time allowed for.”

For fabric Fresco chose Serge Ferrari 502S White supplied by QCD Ltd. for its ability to block UV rays and most heat and glare in the summer.

“The client was very happy with the finished product and we returned to enclose the whole area with retractable curtains and a swing door at each end for quick and easy access in and out of the canopy” says Cummins. And the client wasn’t the only one impressed with the results. This project won the Tension Structures and Canopies (less than 50 square meters) category in the 2020 Awards for Excellence from the Outdoor Fabric Products Association of New Zealand (OFPANZ).

England: Space for growth

Cambridge Design Partnership Ltd. in Toft a village on the outskirts of Cambridge England needed to accommodate the company’s growth but with limited space it decided to do something innovative to handle its medium-term (about three years) needs—it would convert 10 shipping containers to provide meeting rooms video-conferencing booths kitchen facilities and laboratory space.

The company turned to Streetspace a Kent England-based specialist in providing covered space to design and build a tricky part of the project—a tensile membrane canopy allowing high light transmission that would be used to create an atrium area in the center of the containers.

“A big challenge was the complexity of the design” says William Deacon Streetspace project consultant. “Interfacing with the shipping containers required very careful detailing to incorporate tensile gable end panels tensile roof membrane and aluminum curtain walling. This also made the fabrication of the steel framework a complex job with some very large assemblies on which our fabricators did a great job.”

Plus says Deacon Streetspace had not previously done a project involving attaching fabric to shipping containers. The company found that containers are well worth consideration as a base for structures in temporary situations.

“Their weight and rigidity are very useful from a structural point of view” he says. “The result is a lighter framework as they contribute more than a conventional combination of columns and foundations.

“We also haven’t done many enclosed tensile structures over the years but it is something we are seeing an increase in” Deacon adds.

Cheese’s Friendly’s other chains filed for bankruptcy in 2020,"This year saw a number of large chains file for bankruptcy. Some will close but many will survive.

Bankruptcy meant the end for longtime chains like Stein Mart and Pier 1 Imports. But it is important to note that bankruptcy doesn’t always mean the end of a business. For many it means restructuring which could mean store closings or a new owner.

And the midstate saw a number of large chains with a presence in the area file for bankruptcy with some of those chains like Pier 1 Imports Wolf Furniture Tuesday Morning GNC New York & Company Justice Catherines Stein Mart and Francesca’s closing stores in the Harrisburg area.

And so we learn to accept the loss of say our favorite classic snack foods or these 50 foods that simply ceased to exist. But 2020? Now this has been a year like no other in terms of its comings and goings.

Old-time restaurants we thought would always be there for us have shuttered their doors—even famous restaurants like these. Sure we've embraced the whole eating-at-home thing. We've even learned patience as we waited for our grocery stores to restock their empty shelves with our favorite items.

""It's just a pandemic-related shortage"" we told ourselves as we walked past said shelves. But as 2020 draws to a close we've come to suspect that some of the foods that have vanished are never coming back.

So we did a little digging. And the news was . . . not as we'd hoped. Read on to learn of the beloved food brands that have in fact disappeared in 2020 never to return again.

Read on to learn about The Saddest Restaurant Closures In Your State.

Snapple in classic glass bottles

Of course we're aware that some of Snapple's tea flavors are among the unhealthiest iced teas around. But if Snapple teas have a special place in your heart and you start noticing entire Snapple product lines have been missing for months from your grocery store how can you not feel alarmed?

In fact something is definitely up. But it's all for a good reason Eat This Not That! learned from a Snapple spokesperson. Turns out Snapple is retiring its iconic glass bottles in favor of environmentally sustainable plastic bottles which is why you're having trouble finding the drink in its recognizable packaging.

Costco sheet cakes

In June Costco customers were faced with what they thought was only a temporary shortage of Costco's famous half-sheet cakes. Of course to call it a ""shortage"" was a vast understatement. Those cakes were nowhere to be found.

And it turns out the beloved Costco sheet cakes are never coming back. A Costco spokesperson told Eat This Not That! that the grocery giant would now be focusing its efforts on smaller cakes. Here are 7 Costco items that may be able to take our minds off the loss of those beloved sheet cakes.

Lean Pockets

Yes Lean Pockets are among the7 foods nutritionists hate most. But some of us thought they tasted good enough to enjoy on an occasional splurge. Well those days are now over. In a tweet parent-company Nestle confirmed that Lean Pockets have officially been canceled.

These Pringles flavors

Among the 20 beloved snacks that vanished from grocery shelves this year were several Pringles flavors including Ketchup Kickin' Chicken Taco and Multigrain Sour Cream & Onion.

At least you can still get the regular Sour Cream & Onion flavor. And if all else fails you can always turn to this handy recipe to make your own potato chips at home.

Lay's Classic Multi Pack

In a year in which many companies found themselves re-evaluating their marketing and supply strategies PepsiCo the parent company of Frito-Lays made the decision to cut back production of a full 20% of its portfolio. At least during the pandemic they said. Well we've now learned that our favorite multi-pack featuring a variety of different Frito-Lays snacks is never coming back.

Yoplait Mix-Ins

Remember all those times this year when you visited the dairy section of your grocery store hoping finally to see Yoplait Mix-Ins back on the shelf? Well it turns out it was all for naught. The yogurt-and-crunch mix has been canceled and the company confirmed the news on Twitter.

These Kellogg's cereals

The year 2020 marked the end of at least two Kellogg's cereals including Rice Krispy Treats and Cinnamon Frosted Flakes. It's not like either of these were among the healthiest cereals on the planet. On the other hand they weren't among the worst.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

But apparently Kellogg's wasn't thinking about nutrition so much as popularity. Here are 19 fast-food items that got canceled due to a lack of popularity.

Fiber One Protein granola style

In a short Tweet reply to an inquiring Fiber One fan General Mills confirmed it had discontinued its granola-style Fiber One Protein cereal. No explanation was offered but the company promised to ""let the team know"" that this cereal's return would be welcomed. And at least you can still find General Mills' original Fiber One at the grocery store which is a very good thing because it happens to be one of the best healthy cereal brands for weight loss.

These Coca-Cola beverages

In late October Coca-Cola announced it would be discontinuing 200 of its brands representing the underperforming half of its beverage portfolio. At the time we already knew Tab Zico and Odwalla were on the chopping block. We have since learned that Coca-Cola Life Diet Coke Feisty Cherry Hubert's Lemonade Northern Neck Ginger Ale and Delaware Punch have been discontinued as well.

Jif Power Ups

Jif Power Ups we hardly knew ye. This creamy yet crunchy peanut-buttery snack food made with Jif peanut butter was introduced in 2018 but was discontinued as early as February 2020. J.M. Smucker Co. which owns Jif announced the cancellation of the Power Ups line in order to remain focused on their biggest crowd-pleaser: peanut butter. In fact the company has since launched a healthier peanut butter spread featuring no added sugar.

Rihanna claps back at fans demanding new music as she posts sizzling New Year's snap

Rihanna has hit back at fans pestering her for new music telling them to ""grow up"" as she posted a racy snap on Instagram.

Johnny Isakson a third-term Georgia Republican announced his surprise retirement following a kidney cancer diagnosis Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp shared the head table at a 4H fundraiser gala with two titans of Atlanta's finance scene: Jeffrey Sprecher whose company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) owns the New York Stock Exchange; and Sprecher's wife Kelly Loeffler at the time the CEO of a cryptocurrency joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

The fundraiser pulled in $200000 and Kemp himself scored $18100 from Loeffler. A few months later Kemp would appoint Loeffler a lifelong executive with no previous political experience to fill Isakson's seat passing over numerous other Republicans incluidng insiders from his own administration former national officials and President Trump's personal favorite Rep. Doug Collins. The decision raised eyebrows at the time and still does today: In bypassing Collins who went on to challenge Loeffler in November's Georgia ""jungle primary"" Kemp not only alienated Trump but created a tight special-election race that may well determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. That showdown — in which Loeffler faces Democratic opponent Rev. Raphael Warnock — culminates next Tuesday.

Even the most innocuous explanation for Loeffler's appointment hinges on the advantages of her tremendous wealth: She promised Kemp she would pour $20 million into her own 2020 campaign and would not require outside fundraising efforts. Kemp was also apparently attracted by a perceived appeal to suburban white women in his rapidly changing state. Even so the appointment is difficult to understand taken on Loeffler's merits biography talents and expertise: She's a onetime Mitt Romney Republican who faced with the era of Trump and its hyper-partisan division was forced to run so far to the right that she hit the road with a QAnon candidate and more recently posed for a campaign selfie with a former Klansman.

Even Loeffler appears to have believed she was a long shot: A month after Isakson announced his retirement last August she was elected to the board of directors at Georgia Power the premier electricity provider for the state and largest subsidiary of the Southern Company — a position her Senate appointment would force her to abandon only two months later.

That brief chapter of Loeffler's pre-government life however opens the door to a deeper history and a new and complex set of unexplored ethical questions for a senator whose sprawling corporate ties overlap with an industry she is charged with overseeing making it impossible to avoid conflicts of interest and accusations (fair or otherwise) of insider dealings.

While Sprecher's involvement with the New York Stock Exchange grabs headlines as a familiar reference his company is mainly grounded in the energy sector which also provides much of the weight behind Loeffler's résumé. Despite this background — or perhaps because of it — she has never articulated exactly where she stands on energy policy.

Intercontinental Exchange underpins an astounding array of energy futures exchanges both in the United States and globally. Well before Sprecher started the company he was developing power plants. After the fall of Enron ICE took its place a position Sprecher leveraged cannily gradually making his company one of the most influential financial firms in the world.

ICE's subsidy the NYSE is itself home to more than 90% of all publicly traded utilities and pipeline companies in the U.S. and many of those use ICE markets to trade and hedge against their energy investments. To that point ICE's website claims that ""more electric power is traded on ICE than any other electronic marketplace in the world.""

The southeastern U.S. — the second-largest energy market in the country and coincidentally home to ICE and Loeffler — is one of the few regions that does not have a unified power exchange and thus no derivatives.

Around the time Loeffler was elected to the board of Georgia Power the major utility companies in the Southeast secretly began engaging in talks about uniting the region into a single exchange. The exchange would include Southern Company (the parent of Georgia Power) as well as major players Duke Energy Dominion and the government-run Tennessee Valley Authority.

The move according to the larger companies involved would benefit renewables and wholesale power sellers through a trading mechanism that more readily distributes excess energy capacity across a wider market which they say will boost renewables and nuclear power. Detractors are skeptical — especially clean energy advocates. Jeff Dennis general counsel at Advanced Energy Economy told Salon that the new exchange called the Southeastern Energy Market (SEEM) would mainly benefit the larger utilities eclipsing the concerns of smaller companies renewables and consumers.

""In general while the SEEM mechanism might help the sponsoring utilities capture additional revenues for their own largely fossil-fuel-generating plants and squeeze some marginal savings for customers out of the existing system it accomplishes little else"" Dennis said. While SEEM's sponsor companies claim that the exchange will save customers $40 million to $50 million annually he said that amount is small when spread across the entire region and the 50 million people it serves.

""Compare that to the benefits customers would get from a more integrated and competitive wholesale power market in the region which one recent study showed could generate $19.2 billion in annual regional savings reducing customer bills by 23% and lowering carbon emissions by 37% all while creating at least 285000 new jobs by 2040"" Dennis said.

""Customers and clean energy developers are concerned that SEEM will not be a stepping stone to a true regional competitive wholesale market and integrated transmission grid in the region"" he added ""and could lock in the region's reliance on existing natural gas and coal-fired power plants instead of serving to help the region transition to lower cost and cleaner renewable and advanced energy resources.""

Because SEEM's first iteration will not be as consolidated as other independent energy networks in different parts of the U.S. which trade on ICE's exchanges the system will not support futures trading. An ICE spokesperson told Salon that the company has not been involved.

""The utilities did this among themselves — no consumer advocates and no regulators"" the lawyer continued. ""There is no effective independent oversight. It's governed by a board run by the utilities. We need public interest stakeholders and government structure so that companies aren't the only ones making decisions.""

But the proposal is far from a done deal. The companies which want to open the exchange sometime next year must first get the go-ahead from federal and state regulators. Last week North Carolina authorities put a hold on their goal of filing with the federal government by Dec. 28. A Biden administration will likely prove a harder sell.

That might help explain why Thomas Farrell CEO of Dominion Power made a maximum donation to the Loeffler campaign last week. Thomas Fanning CEO of Southern Company contributed to Loeffler last February and along with his wife made a maximum donation at the end of November according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. While Loeffler might not have direct oversight over this issue she can act as an ambassador for their industry and a GOP-controlled Senate would be able to check the Biden administration.

The Georgia Power board found Loeffler's background attractive as an ambassador and inside eye for the financial side of the business. Paul Bowers company president and CEO said the board had picked Loeffler not only because of her knowledge about energy markets and European carbon trading markets in which Georgia Power deals heavily but her knowledge of cryptocurrency — Loeffler was at the time CEO of Bakkt the aforementioned joint venture between ICE Microsoft and Starbucks.

""This insight into the global energy market and her unique digital experience will provide an extremely valuable perspective as we evolve as an energy industry and as a business to build a sustainable energy future for our customers and state"" Bowers said in a press release at the time.

Cryptocurrency is also tied into energy markets in more than one way. First blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency is based has several actual or potential applications in energy and power exchanges particularly for new and renewable technologies. But it's also true that the industry itself uses a lot of energy: Bitcoin in which Bakkt deals consumes more energy annually than the entire country of Switzerland.

Loeffler's project with Bakkt was to develop what the company called a ""regulated global ecosystem"" designed to enable payments markets and ""new use cases"" for cryptocurrency — including launching a Bitcoin futures exchange with ICE.

When Loeffler joined the Senate she was named to the subcommittee that oversaw that very industry: Futures trading. She only stepped down from that post after widespread backlash to her remarkably well-timed stock trades ahead of the coronavirus pandemic — including in shares of her own company. She still sits on the broader Agriculture Committee however which has overall oversight of the industry. And she still holds shares of Bakkt which has performed increasingly and surprisingly well this year.

Tim Echols a Republican member of the Georgia Public Service Commission which regulates electricity in the state and sets statewide energy policies told Inside Climate News earlier this year that Loeffler's experience as CEO of Bakkt would be a political asset specifically when it comes to energy regulation and market design.

""For me as a conservative Republican Kelly has the full package"" Echols said. ""She is right on the social issues she knows business and she understands energy minutiae."" He predicted she would favor tax credits for electric vehicles and solar investments while supporting nuclear energy but to this point Loeffler appears only to have made one limited public statement about electric vehicles.

Georgia Power's mix includes coal natural gas renewables and nuclear power. Recent reporting from ProPublica revealed that following the enactment of a new rule mandating environmental disclosures for coal ash Georgia Power paid millions of dollars to buy land near its coal ash ponds often paying above market values before later disclosing evidence of groundwater contamination around those sites.

""In the nearly six years since the coal ash rule was finalized Georgia Power bought about 75 properties for an average price of $8800 per acre — outpacing the growth of average real estate values in rural areas of the state. The company purchased a third of those properties for over $30000 an acre — and a handful for over $100000 an acre"" ProPublica reported.

Loeffler does not sit on the Senate Energy Committee but as mentioned above she sits on the Agriculture Committee whose oversight includes issues regarding rural energy development.

Georgia Power has also been trying for years to finish construction on the Vogtle nuclear plant near Atlanta. The construction project has been a money pit to this point however running billions of dollars over budget.

In February Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar bought between $100000 and $250000 in futures for the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia a nonprofit municipal energy company with a significant stake in Plant Vogtle according to his mandatory federal financial disclosures. In that same period of time Azar had briefed Loeffler among other senators on the looming coronavirus pandemic.

CLAYTON COUNTY Ga. — Firefighters were on-hand to quickly extinguish a fire at a metro Atlanta hospital on Friday but the activation of the sprinkler system has forced some services to temporarily move.

Clayton County Fire & Emergency Services (CCFES) reported that a small fire started in a patient room next to where some firefighters were standing at Southern Regional Medical Center and was quickly put out with a handheld extinguisher.

However firefighter officials said that at the same time the sprinkler system activated causing water damage.

As a result of what it described as an ""unforeseeable water issue"" emergency services were shifted.

""Southern Regional staff and resources from CCFES collaborated to quickly relocate the remaining patients in the Emergency Room until the water could be removed"" a fire department spokesperson told 11Alive.

The hospital said that crisis patients brought by emergency medical services continue to receive treatment. Walk-in emergency patients are also being treated but are being diverted to ""a care area close to the Emergency Department."" The hospital also warned that wait times ""may be longer than normal"" as a result.

""The hospital thanks the community for its understanding while we work through this situation"" a hospital spokesperson wrote.

The system-wide policy applies to all employees traveling on university business. The upcoming changes have been vetted by a university-wide travel committee of faculty and staff as well as the chief business officers from across the NU system.

Personal credit cards in Concur

Employees will no longer be able to use personal credit cards when booking business travel through Concur or through direct contact to Fox World Travel. Employees will be required to use the university-provided credit card that is automatically programmed into the booking system.

By using the university-provided card employees are guaranteed access to the university’s airline hotel and car rental discounts ensuring competitive rates for travel. Not using personal credit cards also eliminates the need for employees to pay upfront for travel expenses. Furthermore exclusive use of the university-provided credit card will maximize NU’s travel rebate volume and opportunities for savings.

Employees wishing to bring a companion on business trips may contact a Fox World Travel agent by phone to make arrangements.

Travelers will still be able to earn mileage points with airlines by adding frequent traveler driver and hotel guest programs within their Concur profile.

Use of SWABIZ.com

Employees will no longer be able to use SWABIZ Southwest Airlines’ online reservation system to purchase Southwest Airlines tickets. Employees wishing to fly Southwest may access fares and flights through Concur or by contacting Fox World Travel.

The SWABIZ system limits the university’s ability to meet its full “duty of care” responsibilities to employees. For example the system does not allow travelers to attach flight information into Concur limiting the university’s ability to locate and message travelers quickly in cases of emergency. Furthermore SWABIZ allows travelers to use a personal credit card to book trips which will no longer be permitted for university employees beginning Jan. 1.

Faculty and staff may contact the University of Nebraska system’s travel office at traveloffice@nebraska.edu or 402-554-3456 with questions or for assistance in booking travel. Employees may sign up for the university’s travel listserv to receive up-to-date travel information here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvZXhoaWJpdC1vZi0zZC1zdGF0dWVzLWF0LWRhbGxhcy1sb3ZlLWZpZWxkLWNlbGVicmF0ZS13b21lbi1pbi1hdmlhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3D statues at Dallas Love Field celebrate women in aviation,"A pop-up exhibit on view through 9 March 2021 at Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL) features 3D printed statues of contemporary women working in aviation or aerospace-related fields and includes astrophysicists a rocket scientist and an aviation maintenance technician.

The bright orange and hard-to-miss statues on display at DAL were selected from the larger If/ThenSheCan collection of 122 statues featuring contemporary women of all ages and backgrounds working in STEM (science technology engineering and mathematics) professions.

A scheduled exhibit of all 122 statues for elsewhere in Dallas (NorthPark Center) has been postponed until later in 2021 due to COVID-19 so DAL art specialist Rachel Simpson coordinated a pop-up preview exhibition at the airport as part of the Love Field Art Program.

The Dallas Love Field pop-up exhibit features 15 statues from the If/Then series. Ten statues in the secured side of the terminal represent women working in aviation/aerospace professions. Five statues in the unsecured main lobby feature women working in other STEM related career fields.

Here is the full list of the women whose statues are featured in the pop-up exhibition at Dallas Love Field and their bios can be found at the If/ThenSheCan website.

Adriana Bailey – Atmospheric Scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research

Charita Castro – Social Science Researcher Office of the US Trade Representative

Xyla Foxlin – Engineer Entrepreneur and Nonprofit Director Beauty and the Bolt

Miriam Fuchs – Telescope Systems Specialist East Asian Observatory

Joyonna Gamble-George – Health Scientist National Institutes of Health

Erika Hamden – Professor of Astrophysics University of Arizona

Kelly Korreck – Astrophysicist Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Adele Luta – Scientist and Innovator Oceaneering

Jenn Makins – STEM Educator and Inventor Parish Episcopal School

Amanda Masino – Biologist Professor and Research Director Huston-Tillotson University

Tiffany Panko – Women’s Health Researcher Rochester Institute of Technology

Jasmine Sadler – Dancing Rocket Scientist and STEAM Entrepreneur The STEAM Collaborative

Nikki Sereika – Aviation Maintenance Technician Southwest Airlines

Nicole Sharp – Aerospace Engineer and Science Communicator Sharp Science Communication Consulting

Mary Beth Westmoreland – Vice President Amazon

To make each statue the subject stands in a scanning booth that uses 89 cameras and 25 projectors to generate a 3D image. It then takes a special machine about 10 hours to print/build the full-sized 3D human figure with layers of acrylic gel.

Why statues?

The larger If/Then project is an initiative of Lyda Hill Philanthropies and is designed to give young girls a look at a wide variety of career options especially those in STEM careers where women are grossly underrepresented.

The If/Then initiative believes that ‘IF she can see it THEN she can be it’ and says that the creation and exhibition of the statues “is just one of the ways If/Then is promoting positive portrayals of women in the images young people see in everyday life hoping to pique their interest in STEM careers.”

The group notes that the people a society chooses to honor with statues says a lot about culture and values.

Lyda Hill Philanthropies cites a 2016 study led by former Treasurer of the United States Rosie Rios that found the 10 largest US cities publicly display fewer than a half-dozen statues of real women.

“Women make up less than 30% of today’s STEM workforce – could there be a connection?” the If/Then initiative asks.

The statues featuring women in STEM professions is their answer: “Seeing is believing. When a girl sees a woman successfully pursuing a STEM career (and having fun!) she is more likely to imagine a STEM career for herself … and perhaps even change the world.”

The pop-up If/Then exhibit at Dallas Love Field will run through 9 March 2021. And now that this subset of statues of women working in aviation and aerospace has been gathered Lyda Hill Philanthropies says it is open to bringing the temporary exhibit to other airports that may be interested.

The Covid-19 pandemic has been brutal for U.S. airlines and significant relief isn't expected until the second half of 2021.

U.S. carriers' 2020 net losses likely topped $35 billion according to analyst estimates provided by FactSet. That includes what's expected to be Southwest Airlines ' first annual loss in more than four decades.

The pandemic ended a decade of profits that the historically boom-and-bust industry enjoyed until 2020 a stretch during which they hired tens of thousands of workers bought new planes and expanded their networks.

Airline stocks in 2020 dropped the most in years. American Airlines ' share price lost 45% its biggest percentage decline since before the carrier's 2013 merger with US Airways. Delta Air Lines ' stock lost 31% while United Airlines fell 51% over the last 12 months its biggest drop since 2008. Southwest shed 14%. The S&P 500 meanwhile rose by more than 16% in 2020.

The pandemic forced carriers to quickly shrink cut routes and park hundreds of jets. U.S. carriers' increased their total debt by $67 billion in 2020 to more than $172 billion to weather the crisis according to trade group Airlines for America. Paying that down will be a headwind over the next several years.

The good news is air travel demand has recovered a lot of ground compared with the volumes hit early in the pandemic. On April 16 the Transportation Security Administration screened 95085 people at U.S. airports less than 4% of the 2.6 million people that had passed through those checkpoints a year earlier. TSA airport screenings fueled in part by the yearend holidays surpassed 1 million people a day in the last five days through Wednesday though that's still down about 45% from a year earlier.

With lucrative business and international travel largely sidelined leisure travel became the most important market.

Airlines are expected to trim their losses and in some cases — including Southwest Delta Alaska — turn profitable next year according to analysts' estimates. Authorization of coronavirus vaccines has helped boost optimism about future travel demand though it isn't yet clear when more of the public will resume flying.

""Our mission of connecting the world has been reaffirmed by the events of the past year but we don't yet know what travel demand is going to look like when it rebounds"" said Delta's CEO Ed Bastian in an employee note on New Year's Day. ""Simply re-creating the Delta from 2019 won't be an option; our customers will give us the blueprint for the Delta of 2021 and beyond.""

Bastian reiterated that Delta expects the airline to turn cash-flow positive in the spring.

Airline executives have recently warned that they expect difficult months ahead as they pushed out targets for when they will break even and say they will continue to operate limited capacity to match weak demand. American Airlines President Robert Isom earlier this week said the carrier's January and February capacity will likely be 45% of 2019 levels.

Many potential customers are still not flying as coronavirus infections rise to ever higher records new travel restrictions are implemented and government officials recommend avoiding travel to slow the spread of the disease.

U.S. officials last week said all passengers must test negative for Covid-19 before flying to the United States after a highly contagious strain of the disease was detected in the U.K. though it has also been identified in California and Colorado.

Carriers recently won $15 billion in additional payroll support in the latest coronavirus relief package that President Donald Trump signed Sunday. That requires airlines to keep employees on staff through March 31 and to call back more than 30000 workers they furloughed when the terms of last package which was $25 billion expired on Oct. 1.

United Airlines executives said they expect it will be temporary.

""The truth is we just don't see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months"" CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart said in a Dec. 21 employee note. ""That is why we expect the recall will be temporary.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjAyMTAxMDEtY2lyaXVtLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cirium: 21 years of airline passenger traffic growth wiped out in 2020,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/01/20210101-cirium.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjAyMTAxMDEtY2lyaXVtLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Stanley Black & Decker Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.56 expectations were $0.55. Stanley Black & Decker Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

(NASDAQ: SBUX) had a bumpy year in FY2020 but it appears to be on the right path for FY2021. The company has a clear growth strategy for the year ahead and the China market forms a key part of this plan. The coffeehouse chain sees significant growth opportunity in this region and continues to invest meaningfully to drive growth here.

Q4 and FY2020 performance

Starbucks’ global comparable store sales declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Comp store sales in China fell 3% with comparable transactions down 7%. This was partly offset by an increase of 5% in average ticket. For the full year of 2020 comp sales in China were down 17% driven by a 21% drop in comparable transactions but slightly offset by a 5% growth in average ticket.

Starbucks ended Q4 with 32660 stores globally with stores in the US and China comprising 61% of this portfolio. At the end of Q4 the company had 4706 stores in China.

Strategy

Starbucks’ store fleet forms a key part of its growth strategy in China. After opening 259 new stores in the fourth quarter of 2020 the company is working on opening 600 new stores in the region during the full fiscal year of 2021.

Starbucks has a strong presence in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities and it plans on expanding further in these areas through its Reserve stores and Starbucks Now concepts. The company plans to roll out the Starbucks Now format in over 10% of its new stores in China in FY2021. Looking ahead Starbucks aims to have 6000 stores across 230 cities by the end of FY2022.

Starbucks’ investments in its digital capabilities such as mobile order and pay and delivery offerings are also paying off. At the end of Q4 the company had 13.5 million 90-day active members across its 4700 stores. Digital sales mix rose to 26% in the most recent quarter more than double versus last year.

Starbucks continues to expand its product offerings through its plant-based GOOD GOOD menu and its Tea Cloud platform. These are also expected to help drive growth going forward.

Outlook

For fiscal year 2021 Starbucks expects comparable store sales growth of 27-32% in China. In FY2022 new store openings is expected to continue with a net unit growth rate in the low teens. Starting in FY2023 the company expects comp store sales to grow 2-4% annually based on its belief that it can capture additional market share through investments in its digital capabilities and store fleet.

Competition

Luckin Coffee (OTC: LKNCY) which was once seen as a formidable opponent to Starbucks in China has had a nasty fall from grace. Following a round of allegations and investigations earlier this year it was found that the company’s 2019 revenues were inflated by more than RMB2 billion. This led to a change in management and the company reaching an agreement with the SEC to pay penalties.

Even though Luckin’s shares have jumped massively in the past three months the stock appears to have lost its charm and most analysts recommend staying away from it.

Starbucks Partners with COVID-19 To Deliver Killing Blows To 50% Of Chicago Restaurants,"STARBUCKS RESERVE ROASTERY — At the tail end of a catastrophic year Starbucks and the Novel Coronavirus have partnered up to spread holiday cheer throughout Chicago by delivering swift and brutal killing blows to half of the city’s restaurants.

“My favorite part of Chicago? Right where we’re standing” announced Starbucks VP of Sales Kenneth Chast 45 from the top floor of the five-story Chicago Roastery on Michigan Ave. “I go to my hotel for a night I come here to give dead-eyed smiles to 19-year-old baristas then I get an Uber to O’Hare. That’s all I know about Chicago and that’s why I was happy to partner with the mayor to celebrate the heart and soul of this great town by assassinating local restaurants that don’t sell as many blonde espressos.”

The plan as laid out in a sleek white-and-green slideshow projected on the side of Merchandise Mart is simple and effective. By destroying these local restaurants through inaction and bureaucratic incompetence Starbucks and other large chains will be able to assimilate seamlessly into the hollowed-out corpses of smaller businesses done in by the pandemic. “You know how you’d walk by a corner store for a few weeks and then it would turn into a Dollop overnight?” Chast said leadingly. “Well this will be like that except forget Dollop Dollop is small potatoes we’re going to bury Dollop ten feet into the dirt. We’re going to do it with—get this—with Starbucks stores. And then we’re going to walk Dollop’s owner around the store in a dog collar.”

Despite the brutal strategum to ring in 2021 with a bloodbath Chast is confident Chicagoans will love all the benefits the upcoming expansion will have to offer. “Maybe at your old favorite restaurant you could order a slice of pie with your coffee” he said. “We hear you! At Starbucks you’ll be able to order a scone or a cage-free egg white sandwich with your coffee. And you’ll like it and forget all about that other place.” Other brainstorms in the incubator stage include replacing the loss of local restaurants and bars by serving little lattes instead of hot dogs and little cappuccinos instead of alcohol.

Mayor Lightfoot approved the plan adding “What are you going to do not go to Starbucks? That’s all there is anymore!” Based on the success of this project she and Starbucks are planning to partner up by filling vacant schools with fast-casual coffee storefronts in the next quarter. “Change is good” Chast said hopping into an Uber Black on his way back to Seattle. “And no one can innovate like a multinational chain.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJzdnBsaXZlLmllL2xpZmUvbmV3LXllYXJzLW9wZW5pbmctaG91cnMtY29mZmVlLTIzMjQ3NzMz0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucnN2cGxpdmUuaWUvbGlmZS9uZXcteWVhcnMtb3BlbmluZy1ob3Vycy1jb2ZmZWUtMjMyNDc3MzMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Year's opening hours for coffee shops and cafes - Starbucks Costa Isomnia and more,"Something went wrong please try again later.

As the OutDaughtered parents frequently explain… They split up the girls and each take half (or nearly half) when they are running errands. Adam and Danielle have explained who goes with who depends on what they are doing. A doctor appointment for example would decide who goes where. But if the errands don’t involve appointments… The Busbys are flexible on who goes where.

When flexibility is involved Adam and Danielle give the girls the freedom to have some say in who goes where. And it is fairly common for Adam to have a few more girls than Danielle goes when they venture out in public.

Adam Busby enjoys a fun day with four of his girls

The OutDaughtered dad and four of his girls enjoyed a fun today together. He explained all of the things they did in the comments.

“Fun day with daddy! @dbusby divided the kids up so she could do a little shopping for things around the house. My crew took it to the @leaguecitytx League Park for some soccer and playground. Finished things off with a @starbucks run! It was a good day!”

According to his caption Danielle Busby needed to do some shopping for things around the home. So she took a couple of the girls to handle the shopping. And Adam took the bulk of the girls for a day of fun. He explained they hit the park to play soccer and enjoy the playground.

He rounded out the day of fun with his girls by heading to Starbucks for some sweet frozen treats. As an added bonus Adam was kind enough to share an array of photos of his day of fun on Instagram. The first photo in the collection featured the smiling faces of his girls as they held Frappuccinos in their hands from Starbucks.

Did he catch any heat from the Starbucks?

Now the biggest concern with seeing this Instagram post was that Adam Busby might catch some heat. Heat for taking the girls to get Starbucks. After all they are a little young for coffee. That being said there are tons of sweet treats at Starbucks that don’t contain any coffee. Frappuccinos just as an example can be cream based instead of coffee based. This means the drink would be made with ice cream and milk instead of coffee.

Now Adam did catch some heat for not having Hazel with him. Busby fans however were quick to defend him. They pointed out she was spending the day with mommy. So do you mind the quints or Blayke enjoying some Starbucks? Share your thoughts with us in the comments."

Louisiana State Police say that shortly after 4:30 a.m. on January 1 2021 Troop I was notified of a single-vehicle crash on Louisiana Highway 35 near Mandy Road in St. Landry Parish. The crash took the life of 21-year-old Garrett Allen Deshotel of Branch and 22-year-old Trey Steven Deslatte (aka Trey Lane Hebert) of Church Point.

State Police say the initial investigation revealed that the crash occurred as the two men were traveling south on LA 35 when for unknown reasons the vehicle ran off the roadway and overturned several times.

Troopers determined both of the men were unrestrained.

Troopers say Deshotel was located in the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene. Deslatte was ejected from the vehicle and transported to a local hospital in critical condition but succumbed to his injuries.

Speed is believed to be a factor in the crash and impairment is unknown state police say. Standard toxicology samples were obtained for analysis.

This crash remains under investigation.

We weathered the whiskey-worthy events: the pandemic pall; the protests for George Floyd in particular and racial injustice in general; the political bedlam of an unprecedented election. It was a year of chaos and volatility—a year spilling over into a new year.

In our year of turmoil we turned to strong coping mechanisms. Alcohol sales skyrocketed in the days following state-issued lockdown orders. Reported drug use and resulting overdose rates increased. Food consumption online gambling porn use—every vice was on the rise. The world was on fire and we were numbing ourselves to the terror of it all. I’d like to claim I avoided every vice. After all I’ve written thousands of words on the topics of spirituality and sobriety. Still in moments of chaos in 2020 I reached for my own coping mechanisms: social media consumption; doom scrolling the news feeds; drowning my sorrows in carbohydrates.

Throughout the year I fought my own coping mechanisms; and as I did I revisited the lessons I learned in my recovery journey. I reflected too on the saint who led me into a fuller richer understanding of spiritual sobriety—St. Ignatius Loyola.

Through Ignatian prayer practice I’ve learned a way of deepening my bonded attachment to the Divine Love which is the only path to true sobriety.

In September 2013 I admitted the unthinkable to my wife. Despite appearing to have it together and projecting something like Christian devotion I was a wreck I told her. After years of over-drinking to cope with the stresses of career and a son who struggled with chronic health issues I’d developed a bona fide drinking problem. It was time to make good on the words of Theodore Roethke’s poem “The Waking”—I learn by going where I have to go. But where did I have to go? I needed a path to a more sober life. I needed to not be so drunk.

That confession led me to a therapist’s couch. There we uncovered the reasons behind the booze the chaos uncertainty and pain that led me deeper into the bottle. He pointed me to resources gave me articles and materials that helped me understand the ways I’d used chemical euphoria to numb my own inner turmoil.

Over one of our noon-hour sessions he pointed me to the work of Sue Johnson a noted marriage therapist who specializes in “emotionally focused therapy.” She preached the power of “bonded attachments” he said; and though he couldn’t quite explain why he suggested I watch the last 15 minutes of one of her recordings.

An hour later I sat in my office chair unwrapped a $3 deli sandwich and clicked on the video link my therapist had sent me at the close of our session. Scrolling to the 15 minute mark I listened as Johnson said in a dry British accent “Effective dependency makes us stronger as individuals.” She explained that those with a bonded marital attachment were able to define themselves in more positive terms better able to regulate their emotions and could navigate the worst the world has to offer.

I’d developed a bona fide drinking problem. It was time to make good on the words of Theodore Roethke—I learn by going where I have to go.

“Bonded attachment”—the phrase grabbed me. If healthy bonded attachment to another person increased the chances of negotiating the pains of life could there be some divine corollary? This seemed an important question for me to ask. After all I was a Christian. Had any of the great spiritual writers or thinkers of the faith considered attachment to the Divine in the context of addiction?

These were the days before my Catholic conversion before I understood the deep well of saintly wisdom. I scoured the internet for some spiritual guru who’d written about attachment and addiction and one name kept rising to the top of the search results: St. Ignatius Loyola.

I was Protestant; I knew nothing about St. Ignatius other than he was some Catholic dead dude who up to that point had no particular relevance to my life. I read his story.

Before St. Ignatius’ conversion he described himself as “a man given to the vanities of the world.” But after a battlefield wound the 16th-century Spaniard found himself laid up in a makeshift hospital boasting a spartan two-book library. One book was on the life of Christ the other about the lives of the saints. As he read his vain appetites would give way to something more holy.

I discovered a new way of imaginative prayer one that would help me cultivate a less anxious less shaky sobriety.

Ignatius began attending daily Mass and tempering his appetites for food drink wealth and glory. He cultivated his own bonded attachment but not to a spouse (as Johnson might recommend). Instead he attached himself to the divine love of God through Christ and treated everything else as secondary.

After learning this kind of Divine attachment Ignatius penned his Spiritual Exercises which he described as “every way of preparing the soul to rid itself of all inordinate attachments and after their removal of seeking and finding the will of God in the disposition of our life for the salvation of our soul” (Spiritual Exercises No. 1).

I pored over the Spiritual Exercises. I began meeting with an Ignatian spiritual director to help me understand Ignatius’ notion of attachment to God and detachment from the vices of life. As I did I discovered a new way of imaginative prayer one that would help me cultivate a less anxious less shaky sobriety. That way of praying came directly from Ignatius’ writings on food and wine.

Recognizing that food and wine might lead to “disordered attachments” or addiction the good saint offered a practical prayer exercise to bring all things into their proper order. He wrote:

“While one is eating let him imagine he sees Christ our Lord and His disciples at the table and consider how He eats and drinks how He looks and how He speaks and then strive to imitate Him. In this way his mind will be occupied principally with our Lord and less with the provision for the body. Thus he will come to greater harmony and order in the way he ought to conduct himself” (Spiritual Exercises No. 214).

When the chaos comes calling we should imagine Christ in the room with us and then eat drink (use or click) only as Christ would.

The advice was as simple as it was profound. When the chaos comes calling when we are tempted to turn to food or alcohol (pills porn or whatever) to numb the pain we should imagine Christ in the room with us and then eat drink (use or click) only as Christ would. Through this sort of imaginative prayer we come to learn the way of Christ who lived a life of perfect sobriety of perfectly ordered attachments.

I began to practice this kind of imaginative prayer and it forever changed my approach to sobriety. It led to the recognition that every moment is an opportunity to choose attachment to the Creator instead of to created things. It was a way of prayer that put Christ in the room with me. Through it I began to see that created gifts—things like wine food sex or whatever—are really good and they can be portals to the goodness of God if we use them as God the giver intended. But if we use these gifts as ends in themselves addiction is the natural result.

I’ve been walking this path of ordering—and constantly reordering—attachments for seven years now. Through it Ignatius has become the patron saint of my own sobriety. He led me through the early days of shaky sobriety. And when I found myself turning to my own vices in a near-apocalyptic 2020 his prayer practice again helped me reorder things. I suspect he’ll help me make it through whatever chaos 2021 has to offer too. Through his prayer practice I’ve learned a way of deepening my bonded attachment to the Divine Love which is the only path to true sobriety.

We’re entering another year one that I hope is marked by less volatility uncertainty and chaos. But if it’s not we can navigate it soberly if we learn the way of St. Ignatius: Cultivate a bonded attachment with the Giver instead of the gifts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWFjb25qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvMjAyMS8wMS8wMS9zdC12aW5jZW50LXN0LW1hcnktYmFza2V0YmFsbC1sb29raW5nLWhvbmUtaXRzLXBhdGllbmNlLW9mZmVuc2l2ZWx5LWRydS1qb3ljZS80MDkzNTEwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Vincent-St. Mary basketball looking to hone its patience offensively,"The St. Vincent-St. Mary boys basketball team did just enough offensively against Cleveland St. Ignatius on Thursday afternoon to pull away with a 50-40 win.

In a game that was largely a defensive battle the Irish got a game-high 18 points from Ohio State recruit Malaki Branham. Ten of those 18 came in the second quarter giving them a 21-17 halftime lead. STVM (4-1) also went on a crucial run over the final 3:34 of the third quarter turning a three-point lead into a 12-point advantage.

But if there is one lesson STVM coach Dru Joyce II wants his team to take away from this particular matchup it's the importance of patience going forward.

""I've been preaching to my guys all year long about being patient"" Joyce said. ""We got to reverse the ball once maybe twice before we try and drive that. And we didn't do that. We're driving in there and they had a lot of length a lot of guys in the middle of the lane and that made it hard.""

STVM shot 19 of 48 from the field (39.6 percent). In the first quarter the Irish missed seven of their first nine shots. The score was tied 5-5 at the end of the first eight minutes.

But it's not that STVM was completely stagnant on offense. The Irish still assisted on 13 of their 19 made shots. And as Joyce pointed out after the game their 5-of-12 mark on 3-pointers was an improvement from recent games.

Part of them putting up their lowest point total of the season was that the Wildcats defense as orchestrated by coach Cam Joyce — Dru Joyce's son and a 2007 graduate of STVM — was that good.

""I told Cam at the end I said 'Hey man if you guys defend like that the rest of the season you'll be fine'"" Dru Joyce said. ""I think we're a pretty powerful team offensively when we want to be. Some of our offensive woes were on us but a lot of it was because of them.""

For as good as St. Ignatius (5-2) was defensively the Irish still forced 17 turnovers and held the Wildcats to just 4-of-17 shooting from behind the 3-point arc.

Cam Joyce said that when game-planning against STVM the biggest thing that stands out is the discipline the Irish bring.

""What separates them is not only are they talented they're disciplined"" he said. ""They're in their principles defensively they execute their offense at a high level and when you're able to get talented players to buy in collectively and do those things at a high level that's going to make it tough for opposing teams to beat. So game-planning you know coming in what they're going to bring.

""They're going to be stout in their half-court man-to-man and offensively they're going to be really good scoring points at the rim. They're going to get the ball to their best players and put them in spots to be successful.""

The win over the Wildcats who were undefeated entering the week before losing by three points to Lutheran East on Tuesday gave STVM its second big win of the week. On Monday the Irish topped Division IV powerhouse Richmond Heights 70-57 as Branham surpassed the 1000-point threshold for his career.

But in what has become characteristic for one of the top programs in the state the Irish still have plenty of tests looming including two tough ones to round out this week.

STVM will play Pickerington Central at home Saturday and Cleveland Heights at home Sunday. Pickerington Central made state final four runs in both 2017 and 2018 and Cleveland Heights won the Lake Erie League last season and made a district semifinals appearance.

All of that is to say patience offensively will be required with a schedule of tough games still looming.

""We need to work on it a lot"" Branham said. ""We've really been working on it the last few days in practice four five maybe even six passes before getting a shot is key for us. I think when we do that the defense shifts more and that's what coach Dru said and our assistant coach coach [Mike] Meneer. And if the defense shifts we'll get more easy buckets.""

From the coaching perspective Dru Joyce said that developing that patience will also require the coaching staff assuring playmakers including Branham and Sencire Harris (who had nine points 10 rebounds and two assists against the Wildcats) that the ball will come back to them if they keep it moving.

""They don't feel like the ball is going to come back to them so sometimes they just go"" he said. ""We have to make those guys patient and understand that we're going to make sure the ball gets back to them because those are the two guys who are usually leading us usually offensively.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0bG1hZy5jb20vbG9uZ2Zvcm0vYmVzdC1zdGVha2hvdXNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best steakhouses in St. Louis,"× Expand COURTESY OF THE CAPITAL GRILLE Capital Grille's Prime grade 22-ounce bone-in ribeye

More than any other restaurant concept the steakhouse has persevered in spite of old-school baggage: dark wood low lighting high prices humongous side dishes Pleistocene hunks of meat…and few other menu options. In SLM’s first-ever roundup of the top local steakhouses (listed in no particular order) we discovered that stodgy reputation is no longer deserved. The newest contenders are contemporary yet classy while Al’s Restaurant the oldest and most traditional now offers a de rigueur prix fixe menu and even “Wine Wednesdays.” Herein SLM weighs in on both independent and chain steakeries. Go ahead and dig in—as with the perfect tenderloin filet you won’t even need a knife.

Best Reason to Spend the Night in Collinsville

Porter’s Steakhouse

Instead of a dessert cart Porter’s has a wine cart and an easygoing sommelier who offers no-obligation samples from a serious list. Remodeling has made things comfy and the hotel location serving three meals a day means the kitchen has perked up and improved on one-time Tenderloin Room classics like Senate bean soup and pepperloin steak. Porter’s also understands rare and shows a good touch with appetizers. Gone are the giant slabs of dessert replaced by plenty of nonclichéd choices.

Best Historic Staple in a Land of Big-Box Stores

Annie Gunn’s

They don’t fool around here. The menu lists four choices—New York strip filet mignon rib-eye and lamb chops—but take note of the day’s bone-in specials. There are no wrong choices but devotees tend toward the 16-ounce dry-aged USDA Prime rib-eye. The glossy cabernet-spiked black pepper–studded butter on top doesn’t hurt nor does a mashed potato chive and butter dollop of Irish champ on the side. Inevitably crowded this West County institution is comfortable pleasant and a reliable haven for the St. Louis steak lover. 16806 Chesterfield Airport Rd. 636-532-7684.

If The Sopranos’ Last Meal Was Here That Whole Final Scene Thing Would Have Made Sense

Carmine’s Steak House

Protein gets an Italian flavor at this downtown destination that’s more Old World than Wild West. A cracked pepper–dusted tenderloin in a Chianti sauce or one charbroiled with a white wine–Gorgonzola sauce affords Continental flair. If you like it simple though Carmine’s comes through with a massive porterhouse or a delectable bone-in strip steak that is strictly gloriously meat and heat. An elegant interior and excellent wine list are an essential part of the experience. 20 S. Fourth 314-241-1631.

Best Reason That Classic Steakhouses Remain So

Al’s Restaurant

Al’s is celebrating its 85th birthday and there’s a reason for that long life. The meat pricey as it may be is wondrous and practically any special request will be honored. A spoken menu from an elegant display on a silver tray adds a special touch to those seeking to impress. Fabulous onion rings make a fine appetizer; fried eggplant is a close second. A newly established prix fixe is a good buy and the wine list is substantial. 1200 N. First 314-421-6399.

You Can Sense the Ghost of Orson Welles—Ordering Extra Onion Rings With His Rib-Eye

Citizen Kane’s

There are critics who say the selection of wines by the glass here is inadequate. Yeah—and Linda Ronstadt’s iconic Rolling Stone cover was compromised by the color of her slip. Are you kidding? The glistening New York strip is a testament to beef’s glory. Kane’s rib-eye Delmonicos are unparalleled. And is there a steak that doesn’t go with the beautiful ’05 Domaine de Beaurenard Chateauneuf-du-Pape? We doubt it. 133 W. Clinton 314-965-9005.

Kreis’ Restaurant

Kreis’ feels like a Ralph Lauren ad and looks deeply establishment. Martinis of gin and vermouth carefully waved hairstyles and slabs of prime rib larger than first base (for $64.95) all mark the spot. The menu too is retro-feeling with a vast number of steaks and some Viennese specialties. We’re not sure who orders schnitzel but potato pancakes aren’t a bad idea with the beef as recommended by the adept and well-tenured service staff. 535 S. Lindbergh 314-993-0735.

That Sam’s: Quantity. This Sam’s: Quality.

Sam’s Steakhouse

Just up the road from Grant’s Farm this near-century-old building fits into the throwback aura of Germanic south St. Louis. Sam’s like most restaurants turned its dress code over to guys in polo shirts and ladies in fancy denim. They’re knocking back excellent beef as well as potatoes in a twist of brown paper topped with a scoop of butter so big it looks like French vanilla ice cream. Plan on highballs not wine. 10205 Gravois 314-849-3033.

Best Brush-On Steak Sauce Not to Brush Off

Andria’s

Over the river and through the woods of suburban Illinois Andria’s frame building and wide porch feels like grandmother’s house. While many steakhouses reek of testosterone Andria’s is family-friendly with homemade soups unchallenging salads and pleasant service. Steaks are brushed with the signature Andria’s Steak Sauce a salty but tasty addition and the pork chops offered standout flavor and texture long before “heirloom” pork entered our vocabulary. 6805 Old Collinsville O’Fallon Ill. 618-632-4866.

Moussalli’s Prime

The iconic former Andria’s space in Edwardsville offers the same low-key charm an incredible wine cellar and a flame-spouting grill that turns out impressive steaks such as the Niman Ranch USDA Prime–certified Angus. 7415 Illinois Route 143 Edwardsville 618-656-0281.

Bet On It

Winning additions at St. Louis casinos

Morton’s

You expect to meet the cast of Mad Men at this unapologetic temple to cosmopolitan cow consumption. Steaks and strictly a la carte prices are both brawny big. A porterhouse here has the table groaning. Even the normally petite strip steak is formidable. More reasonably sized offerings include a Cajun-spicy rib-eye and a hopelessly extravagant filet Oskar topped with a crab-loaded béarnaise sauce. 999 N. 2nd.

Bugatti’s Steak & Pasta

At a steakhouse it’s unusual when the center of the plate is not the center of attention. Rarely are the incidentals—side dishes bread service service in general—so memorable that you’d return just for them. But we will return to Bugatti’s if just to reserve a half-round booth and to relive that King Filet straddled by perfectly seasoned perfectly uniform asparagus—only to leave again both surprised and sated. 1 Ameristar St. Charles 636-940-4471.

A Great Steak for Less Than the Babysitter’s Going Rate

Tucker’s Place

Tucker’s uses USDA Choice rather than Prime meat and it’s reflected in the moderate prices but the steaks brushed with a “house” sauce (similar to but chunkier than Andria’s) are carefully cooked and very tasty. The original Soulard space has romantic potential and the “no highchairs” signs signal that all three locations aim at adults. Tucker’s bars are extremely popular especially at happy hour and behind the filet strip top sirloin and porterhouse steaks (and a recently amped-up wine list) the menu has a wide range of fried bar food pizza and sandwiches. Beer seems to be the beverage of choice in easily the most casual of the restaurants on this list. 2117 S. 12th 314-772-5977; 3939 Union 314-845-2584; 14282 Manchester 636-227-8062.

Steering You Straight

What you need to know about the nomenclature

Grass-Fed vs. Corn-Fed

Someday we’ll sit down over a wedge of Stilton and some tawny port and argue the environmental health nutritional and moral implications of grass-fed versus grain-fed beef. For now: What’s the difference purely in taste? Your palate will likely find grass-fed meat leaner (lacking some of the corn-fed cow’s fat it cooks much faster) while corn-fed meat is more “minerally” or “liverish.” The former is an acquired taste—though one might insist it’s worthwhile in getting a more authentic beef flavor.

Dry-Aged vs. Wet-Aged

Steaks can age two ways: enclosed in plastic bags in their own juices or more expensively hung open-air in climate-controlled rooms. Wet-aged they acquire a juicy tenderness. Dry-aged steaks lose moisture concentrating a “roast-beef brown” flavor. Most of us favor wet-aged probably because we’re accustomed to it though dry-aged aficionados are enthusiastic. Either way remember other factors—climate breed feed and slaughter—affect beef as well and postmortem aging is no guarantee of quality.

Kobe vs. Wagyu

Don’t confuse Kobe beef with Wagyu in general. The first though it comes from the Wagyu breed is almost unavailable outside Japan. The second is beef from Wagyu grown in the United States. Restaurants sometimes play with terms like “Kobe style” to deliberately muddy the difference. Marbling makes both special with veins of fat that give the meat a frosted appearance. The taste? Exquisite if you’re eating it sliced thin served rare. For normal-sized cuts it’s usually not worth the outrageous price. —D.L.

The Chain Gang

801 Chophouse

This restaurant is a throwback to the days when green-coated servers pushed guéridon carts through fine dining rooms. A magnificent oval bar anchors the restaurant part of a seven-unit Des Moines Iowa–based chain.137 Carondelet Plaza 314-875-9900.

The Capital Grille

Dry-aged beef luxurious seafood and meticulous service are specialties at this high-end addition to the Clayton dining scene. 101 S. Hanley 314-725-0930.

Ruth’s Chris Steak House

Yeah the name makes no sense to us either. But this chain has maintained steakhouse élan with a refreshingly formal atmosphere that’s never stiff by flaming steaks at a sun’s-surface temperature and paying attention to detail like that sizzle of butter on your bone-in rib-eye. The Porterhouse for Two along with glasses of Napa Valley cab is as romantic as carnivorism gets. The whiskey-laced bread pudding nods at Ruth’s Chris’ birth along Broad Street in New Orleans. 16493 Wild Horse Creek Chesterfield; 315 Chestnut downtown.

Stoney River

Stoney River goes for the Mountain Lodge look. Along with superior steaks (and a foothill appetizer of blue-cheese chips) an outdoorsy atmosphere prevails. You’ll fancy a postprandial canoe ride—right after you tuck into a fragrant meltingly tender filet marinated in coffee molasses and brown sugar. The horseradish-encrusted strip steak wins praise with or without caramelized-onion mashed potatoes cinnamon-spiked sweet potatoes or three-cheese macaroni. On second thought forget the canoe—just bring on that cappuccino crème brûlée. 377 Chesterfield Center East 636-536-1301.

Fleming’s

Fleming’s combines a plush contemporary feel with the atmosphere of a private club that would definitely blackball your brother-in-law. Broiled corn-fed cow here is well-trimmed and extravagantly marbled. But this is a place to try some decidedly nonstandard steakhouse preparations: filet rubbed with porcini dust and splashed with gorgonzola cream; a veal chop with béarnaise sauce; peppercorn-flecked strip steak; and a most gratifying aside of 100 wines by the glass a number unmatched in St. Louis. 1855 S. Lindbergh 314-567-7610.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest steel companies in the world. Without steel much of our infrastructure currently would not exist. It is by far the most important engineering and construction material and if you have any doubts as to its importance you can ask the 19 largest construction companies in the world. While the steel industry itself has enabled millions of jobs on a global scale it is actually its indirect contribution to the global economy which is even more important since it is a raw material in many industries around the world.

Steel is an alloy of carbon and iron where less than 2% of the total makeup is of carbon 1% is manganese and has trace amounts of oxygen silicon sulphur and phosphorous. Wherever you look you will find some sort of application of steel; from construction to cars to electronic products to refrigerators washing machines surgical instruments and even cargo ships which is why it is essential to the 15 biggest shipping companies in the world too. Of course this list is by no means exhaustive and there are tons more applications pertaining to steel in the world. It is said that for every $1 that the steel industry generates $2.5 are generated indirectly which is why it has a significant impact on the global economy.

Even though steel is required by more or less every single country in their construction sectors as well as other sectors the production isn't quite as evenly spread as you might have thought. In fact just 15 countries are responsible for more than 89% of the total steel production with China topping the list with absolute dominance. China produced approximately 1000 million metric tons while second placed Japan was only able to manage 100 million metric tons showing the strength of China in this sector.

Technology has impacted most industries and the steel industry is no exception. Recently the biggest iron ore producer in Europe LKAB< has announced that it will invest $46 billion over the next two decades to create an emissions free iron process which could is major news for the steel industry and will increase pressure on other companies to follow these steps in a world which is increasingly and rightfully so environmentally conscious. After all the steel industry is responsible for approximately 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions which are among the biggest contributors to climate change but response in the industry has been slow as convenient replacements have continued eluding the industry. In the last few years however solutions have been forthcoming and it looks like the steel industry is poised for a massive change in the coming years.

Story continues

The Covid-19 pandemic which is still currently raging across the world even after a year has tanked the global economy and it will take years to recover from the effect and that's when we don't even know when this pandemic will subside. As other industries such as construction shipping and manufacturing had to stop production due to lockdowns the demand for steel fell as well while inventories increased especially in China where the virus originated and which is also the biggest exporter of steel globally as well.

The biggest steel companies in the world are ranked based on their production of steel in 2019 since some of these companies engage in production of other products as well. There are only a few companies which are listed in the United States with companies such as Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) However we have also mentioned other information where relevant for these companies including their market cap revenues assets and profits.

The simulation environment will also depend on the problem at hand. CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) packages exist to simulate particle material flow (Discrete Element Methods) dynamics and kinematics (Multi-body Dynamics) structural stress analysis (Finite Element Analysis) and a host of other real-world physical characteristics. All these packages generally operate in isolation and simplify the analysis to the confines of the software package’s ability.

The real power of simulation comes in when combining these software packages. By coupling specialised CAE tools from different physics domains a more realistic representation of the product can be created. This enables accurate behaviour replication all within a safe simulated and repeatable environment. VR Steel is at the forefront of coupled analysis and has the ability to combine particle material flow dynamic analysis and stress analysis in the same simulation environment. This provides a comprehensive analysis tool which can be utilised to design innovative solutions and solve complex mining problems. An illustration is provided of a BE 1570 W dragline bucket simulation where the 1st and 2nd generation VR Taper Buckets are compared. In this coupled simulation a multi-body dynamics package is utilised to account for the overall dynamics and kinematics in the simulation. This is coupled with particle flow software to provide ground reaction forces during excavation. Finally the forces derived from the interaction between these software packages are used as input forces for structural stress analysis (click here to see the full simulation video).

Through an extensive iterative optimisation process VR’s 2nd generation taper bucket revealed an improvement of 8.3% in efficiency. This increase was quickly validated when the first 2nd generation bucket hit the dirt.

Being able to replicate real-life mining conditions enables VR Engineers to continually improve and expand upon their product offering with minimal risk to the end user. This makes VR Steel a highly sought-after technology partner in the mining industry.",,,,,,,,,

Everything changed in 2020. With COVID-19 much of the world’s population was forced to quarantine in the hopes of preventing the spread of the virus. That led us to become reliant on video calls and social networks far more than we had been in the past. Our phones helped keep us connected entertained and distracted from the relative horrors of the world around us. Thankfully mobile tech kept innovation apace throughout the year despite the hellfire that was 2020. Phone makers didn’t drop the ball. In fact many pushed boundaries like never before.

With the year finally (finally!) coming to an end it’s high time we peered forward. Here’s what to expect from smartphones throughout 2021. See also: 7 smartphone trends that really should stop in 2021

Affordable foldables

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Phones that fold are still a nascent product category. We saw three major efforts during 2020 including the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and Flip 5G the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and the Motorola Razr 5G. Each of these phones had strengths and weaknesses though we really liked the Z Fold 2. If there’s one common thread to the foldable phone category however it’s outrageous pricing. The Z Flip and Razr 5G cost upward of $1400 and the Z Fold 2 cost a brutal $1980. Clearly the foldables of 2020 were not mass consumer devices.

As we head into 2021 it’s fair to expect that foldables will become more affordable. That’s not to say that they’ll be cheap. You can expect phones such as the Z Fold 2 to keep their $2000 price points. Instead what we’ll see are new efforts that fall into the upper end of the mid-tier with price points in the $800 to $1000 range. Related: The best foldable phones you can get

“While most rivals are working on their first folding flipping or rolling phones Samsung is readying its third-generation foldables and promising to bring prices down” said Avi Greengart President Lead Analyst Techsponential. “More affordable options will help clarify just how much consumers want their phones to change shape. Microsoft is also worth watching as it learns from its first-generation Surface Duo and LG seems especially bent on experimentation.”

5G across the board

Qualcomm

Samsung was the first major phone maker to add 5G to its entire line of high-end devices and much of its mid-range as well. The entire Galaxy S20 series had 5G onboard — and the high price tag to match. Later Samsung brought 5G to its more affordable devices including the Galaxy A71 and Galaxy S20 FE. Apple Google Nokia and others followed suit as did other manufacturers. By the end of 2020 we started to see 5G adoption really take off.

For 2021 it’s clear more phones than ever will have 5G. We can thank chipsets in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 700 series for bringing the new connectivity standard to the mid-range. We should therefore expect that the majority of mid-range phones will have 5G aboard next year. What’s not yet clear is how far down the product map 5G will trickle. Google already offers truly affordable 5G phones such as the Pixel 4a 5G. Will we see 5G in phones below the $399 price point? It’s possible. Read more: Here’s what’s coming next for 5G in 2021

5G will also get much faster. While mmWave 5G impresses with its raw performance its limited availability means most people are surfing on slower mid-band 5G.

“Phones integrating Qualcomm’s X60 modem will bring significantly faster sub-6 5G speeds as it allows more flexibility combining frequency bands” said Greengart. “In the U.S. the impact will be largely confined to T-Mobile’s network in 2021 until the winners of the government’s mid-range auction are able to build on it. In the second half of 2021 if the pandemic eases we may also start seeing real-world use cases for mmWave 5G in crowded areas and stadiums.”

Fast(er) displays

C. Scott Brown / Android Authority

If there was one trend we saw in 2020 that we liked it was the proliferation of fast displays. Leading phone makers ramped up the refresh rate of their screens from 60Hz to 90Hz 120Hz and even 144Hz. Faster refresh rates offer a smoother experience particularly when scrolling or gaming. These are found on phones such as the ROG Phone 3 and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.

We fully believe high-refresh-rate screens will become the norm in 2021. For example leaks suggest that inexpensive Redmi phones will score 120Hz screens. More to the point MediaTek’s Dimensity 700 series of chips bake in support for 90Hz. This will bring speedy screens to cheaper handsets.

(Hopefully Apple will sense the trend and adopt faster screens too.)

Under-display cameras

David Imel / Android Authority

ZTE introduced the first phone with an under-display camera in 2020 the Axon 20 5G. This brand new technology relies on transparent layers to allow a camera to take pictures through a screen. The idea is to hide the camera in such a way as to lose the notch or punch hole design creating a more seamless screen experience. Here’s how the under-display camera works.

It's a solid bet that more phones with hidden cameras are on the way.

Xiaomi was among the first wave of phone makers to say it’ll adopt under-display camera tech. However you can be assured that Xiaomi and ZTE won’t be alone. While we don’t have more commitments from other phone makers and under-display camera technology is not perfect it’s a solid bet that more phones with hidden cameras are on the way.

8K recording proliferates

Hadlee Simons / Android Authority

If there’s one trend that’s probably obvious to you by now it’s that we expect the features found primarily on high-end phones in 2020 to reach phones with lower price points in 2021. That applies to 8K video capture.

We first saw 8K video capture enter the limelight with devices such as the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S20 series in early 2020. The feature later came to the LG V60 ThinQ and a number of other flagships throughout the year. The good news is that a wider array of chips support 8K video capture today which means the feature will proliferate across a wider range of price points. More to the point now that 8K television sets are (almost) affordable there will be a place to actually watch that 8K footage.

Augmented reality gets a grip on reality

It’s easy to shoot down augmented reality. At the moment Apple and Google appear to be the only companies truly interested in the technology. Apple continues to update its ARKit developer tools and release AR-capable hardware. That isn’t what we’re talking about.

“Qualcomm has been heavily investing in AR and VR functionality and its chips can be found in nearly all the self-contained VR systems on the market” noted Greengart. “Thanks to Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 VR does seem poised to break through to the mainstream but primarily as a gaming platform.” If you’ve been paying attention to your television set at all you’ve likely seen Oculus’ push to get consumers’ attention with dramatic commercials.

In 2021 we will see headsets that plug into Snapdragon-based phones.

However “AR has much broader potential” suggests Greengart. “In 2021 we will see headsets that plug into Snapdragon-based phones leave the labs and arrive on shelves. Apple has been working on its own AR glasses; if history is any guide Apple will sit out the first round of solutions next year and define the market on its own terms later.” What smartphone trends do you think we’ll see in 2021?

To top it off the performance (a collaboration with Moment House and VenewLive) was to be held at a secret location and feature a visual spectacle powered by T-Mobile’s 5G technology.

The night didn’t entirely go off without a hitch. Logging into the streaming platform VenewLive proved problematic for scores of Beliebers who took to social media to complain about trouble accessing the concert (sample tweet: “We don’t even need a NYC ball drop because Venewlive did it early”). Although the company had in the past hosted virtual concerts by BTS (“Map of the Soul ON:E” which brought in 993000 ticketed viewers) Blackpink and AJR among others the confusing registration process required of every user delayed the show from starting by at least 30 minutes. In fact as the clock inched closer to 8:30pm PT it seemed the production might miss east coast New Year’s altogether.

Ever the resourceful bunch Bieber devotees found unauthorized streams on YouTube and Twitch but the second-generation screen share was a far cry from the multi-camera 1080-definition webcast on the official platform. Thankfully VenewLive sorted out its issues — the site crashed due to “too many people trying to validate their tickets last minute” it posted on Twitter (where it started the night with fewer than 400 followers) at 8:10pm PT.

In a statement released on Jan. 1 VenewLive said “The start time of Justin’s performance was delayed to accommodate the unprecedented demand. The extraordinary number of last-minute tickets that were issued and sold were at an overall volume and rate that far exceeded any pay-per-view concert we have ever seen.” That demand equalled more than 1.2 million T-Mobile customers according to the company.

At 8:45pm once “inside” the virtual show it was at long last possible to see the high-quality production that went into Bieber’s performance. Most impressive: the multi-camera control which allowed viewers to see additional angles from the back of the stage and above with a crane (see screen-grab below).

Getting “inside” meant being outside for those friends and family invited to view the concert in person at the Beverly Hilton hotel. The iconic building opened in 1955 and home to the Golden Globes since 1961 was designed in a V shape by architect Welton Becket allowing nearly all of its 500-plus rooms to have a balcony and a view. The “stage” was in fact the roof of the ballroom which also hosts the annual Clive Davis pre-Grammy party (it goes virtual this year Variety recently reported) and onto which half of the rooms face.

Concertgoers were checked into individual rooms with maximum occupancy strictly enforced (two or four depending on the room size). No one was allowed to interact with other guests in public spaces and the hotel’s services were mostly closed but T-Mobile generously footed the bill for all in attendance to receive a generous spread that included dinner dessert wine and champagne. Social media posts suggest that the balconies facing west really were the best seats in the house as they allowed a view from which to take in the full scale of lights lasers pyrotechnics fireworks and the 150-drone displays (Bieber’s initials a cross) used throughout Bieber’s 85-minute set as well as the intricate choreography of his eight dancers.

The idea to use the Beverly Hilton as a location for the New Year’s show came from Bieber’s management team at SB Projects in particular Jules Ferree the company’s head of brand partnerships. Speaking to Variety ahead of the main event she pointed to a longtime relationship with T-Mobile Bieber’s tour partner for his upcoming 2021 trek (AEG is Bieber’s tour promoter and CAA his agent) that made the show possible. “They have a great commitment to Justin and to us and have helped bring some crazy ideas to fruition” she says. The NYE plan first came together in late fall with support from SBP’s Scooter Braun and Allison Kaye. Their goal says Ferree: “To create an innovative exciting way for fans to experience a Justin livestream that was anchored and differentiated by the look of the location and where we could do it at scale to reach as many people globally as possible.”

While thinking global however they acted local. Los Angeles is currently ground zero for coronavirus infections and safety was of paramount importance. Says Ferree: “We followed all of the local and industry COVID-19 protocols making sure that everyone had been tested” in addition to the strict regulations related to accommodations.

By all accounts Bieber had a personal stake in how the evening would look and sound. “Justin worked so hard on this show” adds Ferree. “He’s been extremely involved every single day since he went into rehearsals which was back in November. He’s been wanting to to perform and this is a huge production.”

150 drones spell out “JB”

Indeed the 21-song set tested Bieber’s energy and vocal cords — after starting the song “Lonely” Bieber asked to stop so he could drink some water (“I’m literally gonna die” he said from the stage) — and pulled on many a heartstring. The song “Holy” was one such moment as Bieber declared his love for wife Hailey wherever she may roam (Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas who co-wrote “Lonely” were also in attendance). For his final number Bieber debuted a new song “Anyone” which dropped officially at midnight.

From ideation to execution Bieber’s New Year’s bow really couldn’t be pulled off at any other time other than COVID. Consider: when is the high-turnover Beverly Hilton completely vacant on New Year’s Eve? “It’s the silver lining I guess” adds Ferree. “It felt like the right time to do it. And to be honest we all needed something to bookend the year.”

Whereas most live TV streaming services put nearly all their channels into one expensive bundle TVision offers a $10-per-month bundle for entertainment channels plus another bundle starting at $40 per month with local channels news and sports. T-Mobile also sells its own $50 streaming player the TVision Hub with a remote control that resembles what you’d get with a cable box. By combining inexpensive TV service with familiar hardware TVision could be a great gateway to cord-cutting.

In practice T-Mobile’s TVision service and Hub device fall a bit short of those admittedly lofty expectations. The service doesn’t support 60-frames-per-second video—a necessity for smooth sports and news channel playback—and it could use more ways to manage your DVR and channel guide. The Hub device also has its own little annoyances including a lack of master TV volume controls on its remote.

More importantly TVision is only available to T-Mobile wireless subscribers at the moment and T-Mobile has suggested that its current pricing won’t apply to everyone else. Some TV networks have also claimed that T-Mobile tricked them into unbundling their channels creating even more uncertainty about how long TVision’s current pricing and packaging will last.

That’s not to say prospective cord-cutters should avoid TVision outright but jumping in now would mean using a promising-but-flawed service that’s subject to change in the months ahead.

Looking through the channel list the big omissions are CBS and regional Fox Sports channels. Cord-cutters can still get the former as a separate service (through CBS All Access at $6 per month) but the latter is becoming harder to get without traditional cable TV service as most other live TV streaming services have dropped Fox Sports regionals over the last year to keep their costs down.

TVision does include the other major broadcast networks—ABC Fox and NBC—but in some areas the local ABC or Fox affiliates are not available and you get a national broadcast feed instead. T-Mobile’s website lets you plug in a zip code to check on local coverage in your area.

Jared Newman / IDG No matter which package you choose you’ll get a big bundle of live TV channels.

Subscribers can watch on up to two devices at a time for the Vibe package or three devices at a time for all other packages but with one big exception: If someone’s already watching on TV at home you can’t stream from another TV outside the home at the same time. TVision doesn’t currently support logging into individual “TV Everywhere” channel apps either so you can’t use those as a workaround for the service’s device limits (T-Mobile says it plans to offer TV Everywhere logins in the future.)

As for DVR service TVision’s Live plans include 100 hours at no extra charge but it’s a $5-per-month add-on for Vibe subscribers. These recordings are stored online so you can access them from any device.

Choose your streaming device

Unlike typical cable TV service TVision isn’t tied to a specific set-top box. The service offers apps for Fire TV Android TV Apple TV iOS and Android and it works the same across all those devices. (Roku support is notably absent for now.)

Jared Newman / IDG The T-Mobile Hub is an Android TV-based streaming device that’s built to run the TVision service.

The best version of TVision though is on T-Mobile’s own Hub device a $50 streaming dongle that runs Google’s Android TV operating system. With the Hub you get a remote control that’s optimized for TVision with buttons that can instantly launch the app load the TV guide and bring up the DVR list. The remote also has channel up/down buttons a recording button for the DVR and a number pad. This brings the experience much closer to what you’d get with a cable box and it also supports other streaming apps including Netflix Amazon Prime and Disney+.

The Hub also has a nifty integration with Google Assistant so you can press the button in the middle of the remote and say things like “tune to ESPN.” No other streaming device offers this level of voice control for T-Mobile’s service.

Jared Newman / IDG The TVision Hub’s Google Assistant integration lets you tune to live channels and find content by voice.

Unfortunately T-Mobile erred in its handling of volume control on the Hub. Although the Hub’s remote has an infrared emitter for controlling TV power and switching inputs its volume keys don’t support infrared control. Instead they control an internal volume level on the Hub itself which means you can’t increase the volume beyond whatever maximum level you’ve set with your TV remote. (I also could not get the remote’s input button to work with my Vizio TV.)

Jared Newman / IDG The TVision Hub remote offers cable-like shortcut keys but in some ways doesn’t work as expected.

The Hub has a few other issues as well. The home screen is less customizable than other Android TV devices so you can’t rearrange the order of certain home screen apps and while a Netflix app is built-in it doesn’t put any content recommendations on the home screen like it does with other Android TV devices. For apps that do offer home screen recommendations—like Amazon Prime and HBO Max—you can’t rearrange the order of them.

Jared Newman / IDG Hit the Home button on the Hub and you’ll land on a home screen where you can launch other apps.

Also worth noting: While the Hub can stream 4K HDR video and Dolby Atmos audio it doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR. If that feature is important to you or you’re turned off by the Hub’s other limitations I’d suggest using TVision with a Fire TV Stick 4K or Chromecast with Google TV instead even if it means giving up the Hub’s unique remote.

The TVision experience

While testing out the TVision experience my heart sank when I realized that all its channels are limited to 30 frames per second. That means live sports news and talk shows look choppier than they do on cable and on most live TV streaming services. This limitation applied to every streaming device I tested with TVision including the Hub Amazon’s Fire TV Sticks the new Chromecast and an Apple TV 4K.

Not to be overly dramatic but the lack of 60-frames-per-second support is a major knock on what is otherwise a decent enough service.

The TV guide loads smoothly and includes filters for sports news movies and kids programming. While watching a live channel you can pause and rewind to the time you started watching. You can set up individual or series-based recordings for any program and the DVR has no restrictions on ad-skipping. You’ll also get visual thumbnail previews while fast forwarding or rewinding so you can easily avoid commercial breaks.

Jared Newman / IDG TVision lets you record any program and skip through the ads.

Still TVision’s DVR features could use more work. You can’t limit how many recent recordings to keep from a given program and the DVR menu doesn’t indicate which episodes you’ve already watched or started watching. There’s no easy way to delete already-watched recordings either; your only options are to remove episodes one-by-one or clear out the entire series. Worst of all TVision automatically deletes old recordings when you run out of space offering no way to “protect” certain shows from being tossed out.

Jared Newman / IDG With limited ways to manage recordings programs like Sportscenter can easily chew through your DVR storage.

I also ran into a few other annoyances: There’s no “favorites” list for the channel guide and TV listings are limited to seven days rather than the 14 days offered by many cable boxes. On the Hub the guide also has a bug where the filter menu fails to disappear after you open it covering up the part of the guide until you make a selection.

Jared Newman / IDG The TV guide has various filtering options but no way to view just your favorite channels.

Watching recordings while they’re still in progress is a convoluted process as well. You can select them from the DVR list but you if choose the program from the grid guide it’ll load the live version instead with no ability to jump back to the start of the recording.

A risky bet

In a way TVision reminds me of the early years of live TV streaming services when packages were cheaper and more flexible but when the overall experience was less refined than cable. Services like Sling TV Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV have since done a lot of catching up on the experience side but they’ve also become more expensive and more bloated.

TVision seems likely to follow the same pattern. Already the carrier has added its $10-per-month “Vibe” channels to the pricier “Live” lineup in a concession to complaining TV networks and while those channels carry no extra charge for now they’ll almost certainly result in future price hikes. As Variety reported last month the fate of the Vibe package also remains up in the air.

All this makes TVision tricky to judge. The current pricing and packaging is compelling but the service itself has some notable flaws and even if T-Mobile makes improvements to the latter TV networks could force some major adjustments to the former. If this is the way you decide to cut the cord just be sure you’re willing to roll with whatever changes occur.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFtZXJpY2FuY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLmNvbS9kaWQteW91LXNheS1tb2JpbGUtaG9tZXMtYXMtY2hpYy1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWhvdXNpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did You Say Mobile Homes as Chic Affordable Housing?,"The following is a lightly-edited extract from a podcast conversation I had with Andres Duany a principal founder of the New Urbanist movement. In it Duany proposes the mobile home as an intelligent response to the affordable housing crisis—bucking the dogma and the orthodoxies of our horrified New Urbanist colleagues. The full interview can be heard here (no paywall).

Kunstler: I know for a couple of years now you’ve been studying the mobile home industry mainly as a way of figuring out how to deliver affordable dwellings to people. This has raised a lot of ire among our fellow New Urbanists who can’t process the idea. What did you learn from all this?

Duany: It’s not ire. They think I’ve lost my mind. It’s like pity. Okay first of all where does it come from? (And it took me a long time to arrive at this.) Most people don’t understand how much subsidized affordable housing Liz [Plater-Zyberk] and I have built because we never show it. We’ve done so much affordable housing for agricultural laborers for black communities. It’s nice-looking—actually we’ve gotten some prizes. Why don’t we show it? I never show it because you might ask me how much it costs. And it actually costs twice as much as regular market housing. With government subsidies everything blows up in expense. Now I know very well that there will not be money for subsidies any longer but there are ways to deliver housing that costs much less to build without a subsidy. And the mobile home industry delivers at the most $50 a square foot. Regular market housing is never less than $130 a foot and when the government gets involved it’s $300 a foot. I heard today that the affordable housing built in San Francisco is $900000 a unit. And that cost doesn’t include the real estate. So it’s absurd.

So I backed into the mobile home industry and I realized that they had solved the problem technically. They know how to build it. And by the way it’s not like the 1960s mobile homes the ones that are collapsing. These are much much better. The codes have improved tremendously. But they still look horrible.

So what we have is a cultural problem not a technical problem. Whenever you see new mobile homes they’re not new parks they’re old ones being refurbished switching out the units. You can’t get new ones permitted. But what happens is nobody wants them [anywhere near them] because they’re so distinctly for “losers.” Now parenthetically they’re not “losers.” They’re actually people who don’t make enough money to get any other kind of house and very often they have jobs and everything else. Many are down on their luck but they’re not dysfunctional people on the whole. They’re paying every month for the charges and for the unit and maintaining them. Don’t think they’re “losers.” They’re just people on a low burn-rate.

But the mobile home industry has cultural problem. The reason is that the mobile home tries desperately to look like conventional housing with the little pitched roofs the clapboards the little shutters. When you compare them to conventional houses they’re always less good. If you compare them to the 1950s houses by Philip Johnson in Connecticut the great houses by the chic architects of the ‘50s for the Houston oil people which are flat-roofed boxes with sliding glass doors—they’re ultra-chic particularly these days when everybody loves mid-century modern. So instead of making my mobile homes look like “shotgun” houses we redesign them to look like mid-century modern.

Suddenly they’re so much better! You know how the [shipping] container houses are so popular? Well those are actually miserable inside. They’re only eight feet wide and so forth. So you pick up the aesthetic of the container house in mid-century modern and suddenly you have a winner—and it’s $90 a square foot! It’s not $50 anymore but that’s still $100 $200 $300 less than stick-built housing. We’re hacking the industry’s technical abilities and over-laying on it a very advanced aesthetic. It’s no longer the dwellings of losers but the dwellings of winners.

Kunstler: Part of your idea was a way to provide housing in the big corporate parking lots of companies like Google and Apple that don’t pay their tech workers enough to live otherwise in these high-priced places right?

Duany: The kids at Google are earning minimum 150000 okay? God knows maybe more than that. And they’re still commuting an hour and sharing a ranch house somewhere. The traffic jams are unbelievable. So we said “why not use the parking lots?” The tiny houses that we design meet the standards of the Department of Motor Vehicles. We followed that code so they’re legal to park in parking lots. You put them there instead of the car and the kids don’t have to commute. And they’re very very chic. They’ve got leather chairs they’re finished with Japanese interiors full baths queen-sized beds. They’re definitely not for losers. They’re cool. They’re not…a ranch house somewhere! We tried so hard and spent a lot of extra money so that they would not be associated with losers. They’d be associated with people who have a choice. This housing is for people with master’s degrees okay? I say that not to be cruel to everybody else but just to get the damn things permitted approved by the neighborhood.

But with the ongoing surge in coronavirus cases the Space Needle in Seattle decided to make the experience accessible from indoors — and it was bigger trippier and more dazzling than ever before.

In lieu of the regular fireworks show at the Space Needle officials of the iconic landmark opted to create a digital light show experience that displayed striking visuals of life science and illusions that were out of this world.

As stated on the Space Needle website organizers used sky-mapping technology and video footage to create the spectacle which was only visible on screen. People who visited the landmark in person only saw the Space Needle lit up in a magenta color.

Twitter users have been quick to comment on just how epic — and mind blowing — the New Year's Eve celebration was.

Others however described the show as the product of extra terrestrial collaboration or the work of a science fiction dystopia.

While it isn't exactly a connection to life outside of this world Terry Morgan the visionary behind the show told the Seattle Times that it is the product of a vivid dream he had earlier this year.

""I was semiconscious in the dream and the sky was just beautiful colors and faces all just kind of floating like clouds in the sky"" Morgan told the Times. ""And it was really one of those landmark dreams.""

Morgan decided to take the idea to Karen Olson the chief operating officer and chief marketing officer at the Space Needle and as the Times reported the concept was developed in just a couple of months.

""This was not something that has been planned for a year"" Morgan said. ""Once the Space Needle decided they were physically not doing fireworks because of the social restrictions due to COVID this really kind of popped up and became an alternative.""

It may have just been an alternative but for people who watched the event it may just be the future.

In 2013 Live Oak Bank got interested in chickens. The bank which formed five years earlier had grown fast by making Small Business Administration loans nationally to veterinarians medical practices funeral homes and other businesses that it understood well. CEO Chip Mahan wanted to add poultry farmers to the bank’s collection of specialty industries.

He called an El Dorado Ark. banker who was the nation’s most successful lender to chicken farmers recalls Lee Williams Live Oak’s co-founder and vice chairman. “The guy said ‘I’m perfectly happy down here.’”

That didn’t discourage Mahan says Williams who met him in the 1970s when both worked for Wachovia Bank in Winston-Salem.

“Just like he’s always done he called him in June and he called him in September” Williams says.

On the latter call the El Dorado banker revealed that he had developed cancer and that his employer was “‘treating me really really bad related to me being really really sick. And I’m ready to talk to you about taking my chicken-lending team and coming to work for Live Oak’” Williams says.

Live Oak started poultry lending in January 2014 and has since issued $1.2 billion in loans. It’s part of the reason the Wilmington-based bank with no branches tellers or ATMs has made more Small Business Administration 7(a) loans than any financial institution over the last three years.

Larger than life

Live Oak and its technology offshoot nCino which have a combined stock market value of nearly $10 billion are built in large part on the 69-year-old Mahan’s ability to recruit talent. So is Canapi Ventures the Washington D.C.-based investment firm that has raised $545 million for financial-technology investments and Apiture another affiliated tech company.

Mahan certainly has some technology credibility. In the 1990s he started the country’s first online-only bank in Atlanta. The Wilmington campus housing Live Oak nCino and Apiture has a design that has drawn architectural industry raves. But he takes issue with being portrayed as a Silicon Valley-style entrepreneur.

“We’ve got to get one thing straight” he says. “I am not a technical guy and I am not a visionary. I hang around guys that are really really smart. And then you give them a little capital and it’s amazing what they do.”

Those people say there is something amazing about Mahan. They’ve watched as he’s grown Live Oak from an idea to a bank with $8 billion in assets and $1.8 billion market value while developing other enterprises with potentially even greater prospects.

“He had the self-confidence of a successful entrepreneur” says Joseph Smith Jr. the N.C. banking commissioner when Live Oak was chartered. “He was a tough son of a bitch. He had a good idea. And he was willing to put his own money up and make a go of it.”

Mahan lured Huntley Garriott from Goldman Sachs Group to Wilmington to run Live Oak Bank in 2018. He calls his boss “a larger-than-life persona. … This company in a lot of ways is Chip’s persona.”

But Mahan’s entrepreneurial instincts haven’t always been so sharp.

Owning something

In the 1970s and early ’80s the Washington and Lee University graduate traveled across Tennessee and Kentucky for Wachovia selling cash management and other services to distilleries and other businesses. But he wasn’t happy working for someone else or with his $9000 annual salary. An early attempt to buy an equipment-rental franchise fizzled. In the early ’80s he spotted an opportunity: Farmers Bank & Capital Trust Co. in Frankfort Ky. the capital city where he spent his teenage years.

The stock was trading at just 25% of book value. “I got to thinking if I could get somebody to lend me the money — lend me three times what the stock’s trading for but still under book value — then we could basically buy the bank for free” he says.

Auto dealership owner Bill Gatton overheard Mahan talking about his idea on a flight between Lexington Ky. and Bristol Tenn. “I got off the plane and I went to his house and we talked until 3 a.m.” Mahan recalls. “He said ‘I’ll back you.’”

Before Mahan left his job in late 1982 to pursue the deal Wachovia CEO John Medlin gave him a warning: “‘You can’t do a hostile takeover of a community bank’” Mahan recalls Medlin saying. “‘It’s just not going to work.’”

Mahan was undeterred. “I thought I knew where the largest shareholders were because this was a small community where I grew up” Mahan says. He rented an office and started calling people. “I’m offering three times what the stock’s trading for. You know how much stock I got? Not one share.”

With a 3-year-old and 6-year-old at home Mahan had to “crawl on his belly” to get his job at Wachovia back. “But it was over after that. You just can’t go back” Mahan says. “It was exhilarating to think that you could actually own something.”

The internet beckons

Within a few months connections made during the Farmers Bank venture led to a chance to run another small community bank in Kentucky and then buy it with some other investors.

In 1985 that bank was acquired by Columbus Ohio-based Bank One which later became part of today’s JPMorgan Chase. Two years later Mahan raised $16 million and started Lexington Ky.-based Cardinal Bancshares which went public in 1992.

In 1993 over dinner with his brother-in-law Atlanta software company owner Michael McChesney Mahan heard about the internet for the first time. “I said ‘Well if people are going to go look at this stuff nationwide why don’t I advertise CDs [certificates of deposit] on the internet?’” Mahan says. “He said ‘You’re a dumbass’ — he’s way smarter than me — ‘What we need to do is put [budgeting software] Quicken on the web.’”

Mahan and McChesney flew to San Francisco and met with Marc Andreessen who helped create the first widely used web browser NCSA Mosaic and co-founded Netscape. Andreessen offered to write its software for $1 million.

McChesney nixed the deal insisting the company couldn’t let someone else own the source code. He would hire the programmers himself.

In 1995 they launched Security First Network Bank in Atlanta as the nation’s first FDIC-insured branchless online bank. It attracted just a few thousand customers who had to mail checks to the bank to deposit funds. In 1998 Mahan sold the banking operations to Royal Bank of Canada. (He’d sold Cardinal Bancshares a year earlier to another Kentucky-based community bank.)

While Security First had little success Mahan and McChesney knew they were on to something big. They spun off the technology created to develop Security First calling it S1. In the next few years it became one of the key early providers of online-banking technology for thousands of companies including JPMorgan Chase.

Team building

Chip Mahan has surrounded himself with these executives to lead Live Oak nCino Apiture and Canapi Ventures. Some are former colleagues at S1 or Wachovia.

Stepping away

In 2000 Mahan’s wife Peggy whom he’d met in Kentucky at age 11 developed cancer. Mahan quit his job as S1’s CEO but remained chairman and the couple moved to Wilmington to be closer to Duke University Hospital where she was being treated.

By 2005 Peggy’s cancer was in remission but S1 was struggling financially amid increased competition and management turmoil. Mahan returned as CEO just as activist investor Jeffrey Smith of the Starboard Value hedge fund was circling the company. Rather than wage a proxy battle S1 gave Smith a board seat where he exerted pressure successfully to put the company up for sale.

S1 directors met with 28 potential investors but attracted just one bid — from Mahan with backing from a San Francisco billionaire — for about $4 per share. The board turned it down. Mahan quit and sold all his stock the next day; it was trading at about $1.

The next week he was sitting around with Williams who had gained expertise in SBA lending while working with Mahan at Cardinal Bancshares. “We ought to start an SBA-only bank” Mahan suggested. And so Live Oak was born opening in 2008 as a state-chartered bank with a national online-lending platform.

Live Oak’s business model was to make SBA loans which are partially guaranteed by the government in industry sectors that have low default rates. It would hire lenders with deep expertise and connections in what is now 33 industry sectors.

Smith the banking commissioner says Live Oak showed a way to diversify business lending across the nation. “It wasn’t ‘bank everybody locally’ it was ‘bank everybody in an industry we understand deeply.’”

Aligning interests

An initial Live Oak investor was Neil Underwood who had met Mahan when he joined S1 in 2001 to head that company’s enterprise sales unit. Mahan told him about the new bank as the pair were sitting in a duck blind.

When Underwood expressed interest in investing Mahan inquired about his liquid net worth. After his hunting pal gave a number Mahan said “‘OK that will do’” Underwood says. “[I said] ‘You want all my liquid net worth that I’ve earned over the years in this bank?’

[Mahan replied] ‘Yep! Our interests have got to be aligned son.’”

Underwood joined Live Oak full time in 2010 and is president of the holding company. He didn’t give Mahan all his liquid net worth “but I gave him a large portion.” Government filings show Underwood now holds about 1.3 million shares or about 3.2% of the company with a mid-December valuation of about $60 million. Mahan owns nearly 16% worth about $300 million.

David Lucht who had worked with Mahan at Cardinal left the $10.5 billion Ohio-based FirstMerit Bank where he had been chief credit officer to join the new company.

“Although it was a startup I had kind of an inside knowledge that Chip usually had really good ideas” Lucht says. “I jumped at the chance.”

Leading lender

The idea has worked. Loan volume surged from $162 million in 2008 to $848 million in 2014 a year before the IPO. Three industries made up about 60% of the lending back then. Now the three biggest sectors — agriculture health care and veterinary — account for 30% with total loans topping $4.5 billion as of Sept. 30.

The lending is largely fueled by consumer deposits that grew by 60% to $4 billion over the previous 18 months. Live Oak sells online certificates of deposit that pay higher interest rates than most peers typically earning a wider profit margin because it doesn’t have the expense of branches.

The rapid growth hasn’t produced steady profit because of fluctuations in the sales of loans to other institutions. Net income peaked at $100 million in 2017 then slumped to $18 million in 2019. Shares that sold for $19 at the IPO reached $30 in mid-2018 before selling off over the next 20 months. Last March amid the stock market’s pandemic panic shares traded under $10. Since then they’ve quadrupled to more than $46 in mid-December.

In October Raymond James analyst Ammar M. Samma upgraded Live Oak from “outperform” to “strong buy” calling the third quarter the strongest in the company’s history. Live Oak “blew away our expectations this quarter” for its net interest margin and loan growth he wrote.

A few days later the SBA named Live Oak the agency’s largest lender by dollar volume processing more than 1000 loans worth nearly $1.5 billion in the 2020 fiscal year. It also ranked first in the two previous years.

Fintech future

While loans and deposits are Live Oak’s core what sets Mahan apart is his growing collection of financial-technology companies. The bank spun out nCino as a separate company in 2011 to focus on cloud software developed by the bank to manage its lending. Mahan and Pierre Naudé another former S1 colleague hired to run the business figured other companies would pay for the technology.

Revenue is expected to top $170 million this year and nCino (a play on encino the Spanish word for oak) calls itself the “worldwide leader in cloud banking.” It went public in July at $71 and traded for about $75 in mid-December. Though it has never reported a profit nCino’s market cap of $6.9 billion dwarfs Live Oak’s. Mahan owns more than 2 million shares or more than $150 million.

In 2018 Mahan partnered with Gene Ludwig founder and CEO of Promontory Financial Group (which is now owned by IBM) to found Canapi Ventures. The group raised $545 million from about 35 investors including banks and trade associations and lists seven fintech portfolio investments on its website.

Then there’s Apiture which has signed more than 400 financial institution clients for services to improve digital-banking offerings since Mahan’s team started the business nearly three years ago. The business is led by Chris Babcock another former S1 executive. In July it raised $20 million from investors affiliated with Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates and Nashville-based Pinnacle Bank. Mahan says Apiture has nCino-type potential.

Mahan’s success is having a big impact on Wilmington where the network of companies has become an important economic force. Live Oak’s three-building campus near a man-made lake seems more Silicon Valley than southern. Employees enjoy a 25000-square-foot fitness center fully paid health care with no copays or deductibles and an on-site cafeteria.

Because it profited from issuing Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020 Live Oak paid $10000 bonuses to each of its 600 employees including cafeteria workers. A few senior executives were excluded.

“The people that he hires the way that he invests in them is unique and it has landed them at the top of the list of the best banks to work for” says Peter Gwaltney president and CEO of the N.C. Bankers Association. “Part of their secret sauce is hiring smart people and letting them work in a casual relaxed environment with high expectations and the ability to make a really good living.”

Mahan sees his role as bringing people and money together and pointing them at problems.

Garriott says that he and Mahan talk frequently usually starting with a 5 a.m. exchange of emails but the elder banker almost never tells him what to do.

“He always has the veto since he’s the CEO and chairman” Garriott says. “But he hasn’t exercised it — maybe once in two years. … He’s really let me do my job which is probably hard for someone who actually made every decision for this company for so long.”

Mahan knows that managing senior executives isn’t so much about managing as it is about aiming and aligning.

“I never say ‘You work for me’” he says. “A Huntley Garriott or a Neil Underwood — unless they feel like they’re in charge they’re probably not going to do it. … You paint the target — we collectively paint the target — and then they go get that.”

But Mahan knows what the target is. And it’s not chicken farms or veterinarians or even software companies.

This year Rockstar Games is releasing an ""expanded and enhanced"" version of Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online for the PS5 Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Meanwhile it's believed that it's also already hard at work on GTA 6 which is likely PS5 Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X-bound as well. That said many GTA fans would love to see the developer return to previous releases. From San Andreas to Vice City entries from yesteryear are begging for a remaster or remake but at this point it's foolish to expect Rockstar Games to go back to these wells.

That said while Rockstar Games may never go back to these earlier releases YouTuber ""XXII"" has with a new video for ""GTA: San Andreas Definitive Edition"" a fan-made trailer that reimagines the game as a PS5 remaster.

As you can see the trailer gives the game a visual upgrade and while it's far from perfect it does provide a taste of what a remaster of the game could look like. And as you would expect all of the major characters -- CJ Big Smoke Ryder Officer Frank Tenpenny Kendl Cesar and Sweet -- are all present.

While it's unlikely Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive will remaster or remake GTA San Andreas there's a good chance it alongside a few other nostalgic entries will be re-released on PS5 just like it Vice City and more were re-released on PS4 last generation. That said for now this hasn't been confirmed. What GTA fans can look forward to this year is an ""expanded and enhanced"" version of GTA 5 and who knows maybe a GTA 6 reveal too.

This remuneration structure has also led to disagreements between the OEM and other developers.

4 Reviews

Huawei famously developed its own version of the Google Play Store (or Apple's App Store) and Google Mobile Services in response to its blockade from using these cornerstones of everyday normal Android. The OEM had offered attractive introductory cuts of the profits to get developers to contribute to its AppGallery.

However that was a while ago and apparently does not apply to big game-makers like Tencent in any case. This company became dissatisfied with its share of app revenue it got from Huawei for adding versions of its titles to the AppGallery reportedly set at 50%. The ensuing conflict caused Huawei to remove the entire Tencent portfolio from its store.

These apps have now reportedly been restored as new negotiations over the software company’s rates have begun. This situation – also said to be why you can’t get Genshin Impact on phones running Huawei Mobile Services – echoes the dispute between Apple and Epic Games.

Then again not even Apple demands the share Huawei apparently extracts from developers. On the other hand the OEM also commands a 41.4% share of the Chinese smartphone market thus representing a consumer-base running into the hundreds of millions that not even companies such as Tencent could afford to miss out on.

National Housing and Construction Corporation (NHCC) has said they are resuming the construction of low cost housing estates countrywide to address the housing needs of the middle-income population.

While commissioning the NHCC Impala Apartments in Namungoona on Tuesday Mr Parity Twinomujuni the NHCC chief executive officer said during its inception in 1953 NHCC was meant to construct low cost houses to sell to Ugandans in a profitable and sustainable manner so that they live in organised settlements.

However when president Idi Amin took over power in 1971 that vision was lost and the subsequent governments never bothered to maintain that vision.

“We constructed estates in Bugolobi Kyambogo Jinja Mbarara Kabale and other major towns and there was an impact on the quality of lives of people living there” he said.

He added that with a $ 9.5m (Shs32b) funding from Shelter Afrique the corporation has started constructing similar estates in Mbarara and Kabale districts to resume the project because NHCC has developed the capacity to carry out such projects.

The minister of Finance Mr Matia Kasaija who commissioned the apartments urged the corporation to carry out research on cheaper construction materials so that Ugandans can be able to buy good quality but cheaper houses.

In a news release posted on its website the company said it had delivered 180570 cars in the fourth quarter bringing its total for 2020 to 499550 a new milestone for the electric carmaker.

The 2020 sales total represents a 36 percent increase from 2019. And Tesla’s production of 509737 cars in 2020 was up 40 percent from 2019.

It is the latest success for a company that excelled in 2020 despite the pandemic. While some carmakers have seen increases in sales in the pandemic none has seen as big an increase as Tesla.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMi90ZWNoL3Rlc2xhLTIwMjAtY2FyLXNhbGVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSATxodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL3RlY2gvdGVzbGEtMjAyMC1jYXItc2FsZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla hit half-million car target in 2020,"New York CNN Business —

Tesla (TSLA) hit its goal of building a half-million cars in 2020 a first for the company it reported Saturday.

The completed deliveries to customers which is slightly different from the production figure fell just short of that same goal as it delivered 499550 cars. That sales total rounds up to the 500000 target though.

The full-year production and deliveries rose by more than a third from 2019 levels an impressive gain especially considering that the company’s major factory in Fremont California was shut for nearly two months from mid-March to early May by Covid-19 stay-at-home orders. A global recession caused by the pandemic also cut into worldwide auto sales. Tesla’s new plant in Shanghai which opened in late 2019 was a key element of its increased production and sales.

The company produced 179757 cars in the fourth quarter up 71% from a year earlier and it delivered 180570 a 61% jump. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk provided guidance in October that the company would reach the 500000-car target for the year Wall Street analysts were expecting the company would miss it by about 9000 cars rather than a few hundred.

Hitting that half-million number “is a major feather in the cap for the company and the bulls” given the hit to consumers’ buying power during the pandemic wrote analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. “In a nutshell Tesla had a high bar to hit for the fourth quarter and impressively exceeded the Street … an eye popping performance to finish the year.”

The company has even more ambitious plans to increase production with plants under construction and expected to open this year outside Berlin Germany and Austin Texas. Tesla is also set to start selling cars in India in 2021.

The company’s impressive sales growth is nothing compared to the rise in the Tesla (TSLA) share price which soared 743% for the year. The company’s 2019 and 2020 results proved it could be consistently profitable and its forecast of greater sales and profits in the future helped to fuel the stock rise.

Other automakers are due to report US sales totals on Tuesday and global sales totals for 2020 later in the month. But most are expected to report a drop in sales due to the impact of the recession and pandemic.

Impressive as Tesla’s sales numbers may be they are dwarfed by established automakers. Volkswagen (VLKAF) the world’s largest automaker sold just under 11 million cars worldwide in 2019. General Motors the largest US automaker had global sales of 7.7 million cars in 2019.

Tesla’s stock rise over the last 18 months has made it the most valuable automaker in the world. Its current market cap is worth roughly the combined value of the next eight most valuable global automakers – Toyota (TM) Volkswagen Daimler (DDAIF) GM (GM) BMW Honda (HMC) Hyundai and Ford (F).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy9yZWFyLXdpbmRzaGllbGQtZ2xhc3MtdHJpbS1taXNzaW5nLjIxNzAzNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rear Windshield Glass Trim Missing?,"You can install our site as a web app on your iOS device by utilizing the Add to Home Screen feature in Safari.

U.S. electric car company Tesla in 2019 built its first Gigafactory outside the United States in the new Lingang area with a designed annual production capacity of 500000 units.

Tesla said Saturday that it delivered 180570 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter beating its previous record as well as Wall Street expectations. The electric automaker produced 179757 vehicles total.

For the year Tesla delivered 499550 vehicles in 2020 slightly missing its most recent guidance of 500000 vehicles.

At an annual shareholder meeting earlier this year CEO Elon Musk told shareholders he expected deliveries to hit an implied range between 477750 and 514500 cars for 2020 despite the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Q4 numbers represent a new record for Musk's auto business which set its previous best in the third quarter of 2020 with deliveries reaching 139300 then.

As of Thursday Wall Street expected Tesla to report fourth-quarter deliveries of 174000 vehicles over the last three months according to a consensus of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Estimates ranged from 151000 at the low end to 184000 at the high end and included forecasts published between October and mid-December.

In the fourth quarter Tesla delivered 161650 Model 3 and Model Y cars and produced 163660 such vehicles. The automaker also delivered 18920 Model S and X vehicles and produced 16097 of them.

For the year Tesla delivered 442511 Model 3 and Model Y cars while producing 454932 of the vehicles. It delivered 57039 Model S and Model X cars while producing 54805 such vehicles.

In its quarterly reports Tesla does not break out delivery and production numbers by region. Tesla also combines delivery numbers for its older Model S and Model X electric cars and newer more popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.

However Tesla observers can glean some understanding of these segments from Light Vehicle Production reports published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Auto manufacturers are required to report the number of vehicles they produced for sale in the U.S. to NHTSA per quarter. The production numbers refer to the make model model year and propulsion system of a given vehicle that any auto manufacturer produces for the U.S. market through the end of each quarter.

According to these reports analyzed by CNBC In the first nine months of 2020 Tesla made 66175 of its 2020 Model 3 electric sedans and 46773 of its 2020 Model Y crossover SUVs for the domestic U.S. market alone.

By the third quarter of the year Tesla was making more 2020 Model Ys than 2020 Model 3s for US drivers.Tesla began producing its 2020 Model Y crossover SUV in serious volumes in the first quarter of 2020.

The NHTSA Light Vehicle Production reports indicate that Tesla only made 119 of its 2020 Model Ys in the fourth quarter of 2019 for sale in the US market-- but it made 29216 of its 2020 Model Ys for customers here in the third quarter alone. That compares to 28071 2020 Model 3s in the first quarter and 22667 of its 2020 Model 3s in the third quarter for the U.S. market.

(Before publication NHTSA had not published Q4 U.S. production numbers for Tesla.)

Throughout 2020 Tesla was able to increase vehicle production and deliveries by ramping up Model Y production successfully operating a new car plant in Shanghai and bringing on new battery cell suppliers (alongside its longstanding partner Panasonic) to make more of the high voltage battery packs that power its electric cars.

Tesla said on Saturday that Model Y production has begun in Shanghai with deliveries of the Made In China Model Y expected to commence shortly.

Musk has proclaimed that he wants to increase Tesla's vehicle sales volume from about 500000 in 2020 to 20 million annually over the next decade with plans for an electric vehicle that costs $25000 its Cybertruck Semi and revamped Roadster in the works.

After Tesla's Model 3's unveiling brought in higher than anticipated pre-orders in 2016 Musk said the company aimed to produce 500000 cars per year at the Fremont plant by the end of 2018. He also said that Tesla would produce 800000 to 1 million cars per year at Fremont by 2020 then reiterating the goal in 2018 with a slight hedge saying it could look more like 700000 to 800000 per year in Fremont. The company hasn't apparently hit that goal yet in California.

But looking ahead to 2021 Tesla is building new factories in Austin Texas and Brandenburg Germany among other efforts to grow its production and sales volume. Musk cautioned shareholders on the company's last earnings call that it could take 12 to 24 months to hit full capacity at new factories after they begin operations — significantly slower than what Tesla achieved in Shanghai.

As Tesla faces a greater number of competitors the world over in luxury and lower priced segments IHS Markit forecasts electric vehicle sales will represent 10.2% or 9.4 million of the nearly 92.3 million vehicles it expects to sell globally in 2024.

Correction: Tesla's Model 3 was unveiled in 2016. An earlier version had the wrong model. Also Tesla slightly missed its target for annual deliveries and the car company produced 179757 vehicles total in the fourth quarter. A previous version misstated the annual target and the Q4 production numbers due to editing errors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVubWF0dGVycy5jb20vcC9kby10ZXNsYXMtaGF2ZS10cmFuc21pc3Npb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do Teslas Have Transmissions? How The Electric Cars Run,"As difficult as it is to believe electric cars have existed since the mid-19th century. Back then these pre-Model Ts were little more than dangerous wind-up carriages though a lot has changed since then. Today's electric cars are some of the most advanced vehicles on the planet they’re good for the environment and many are considered a luxury. One of the leading electric car companies in the world Tesla is owned Elon Musk. But do Teslas have transmissions?

Tesla is currently the biggest name in electric cars and though other manufacturers offer commercially available options none of them seem to hold a candle to the Fremont California-based manufacturer. There are several reasons for this but the most important among them is what Tesla cars are lacking under the hood.

How do electric cars run?

Electric cars function using an electric motor though not all electric vehicles run on pure electricity. There are actually several types of electric cars — some run purely on electric power when they are plugged into a charge while others run on a hybrid mix of electricity and diesel or gasoline.

Plug-in electric cars only run on electricity and don’t need any gasoline at all. Of all the cars on this list these obviously produce the least emissions. These charging cars work using rechargeable batteries within the electric motor giving electric cars better acceleration than traditional fuel engines.

Plug-in hybrid and hybrid-electric cars both run on a combination of traditional fuel and electricity. The latter of the two uses more gas than the other and has a rechargeable battery as backup. Unlike plug-in hybrids which can be plugged in and recharged hybrid-electric cars are recharged through something called regenerative breaking. These models also allow drivers to switch between the fuel engine and electric engine at the touch of a button.

What is in an electric engine?

Electric engines have 90 percent less moving parts than traditional Internal Combustion Engines. The parts they do have include: An electric motor that provides power to rotate the wheels which are most often Alternating Current (AC) motors

An inverter that converts direct current into the more powerful and manageable alternating currents

A drivetrain including a single-speed transmission to send power from the motor to the wheels

Batteries to store the required electricity

A plug so electricity can pass into the batteries.

Do Teslas have transmissions?

No Teslas do not have a traditional transmission. Teslas utilize electric motors with only about 17 moving parts compared to a conventional internal combustion engine which has around 200. Teslas have a single-speed “transmission” of sorts that doesn't have gears to turn as opposed to a traditional motor vehicle which has multiple gears and speeds which are connected by an engine crankshaft.

Article continues below advertisement

Part of the reason that Tesla vehicles do not have any transmissions lies in the fact that internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed while Teslas and other electric vehicles don’t have that caveat. This is why you often hear a hybrid or electric motor slow to a hum when the car is idling or cruising at a very slow speed.

What makes Teslas different?

Teslas are different from other electric car manufacturers because they're both fun to drive and friendly to the environment. It is in those positive environmental intentions where the company's technology often surpasses the competition. However all of Tesla's technological advancements and luxury details obviously impact the bottom line."

To investigate whether and to what extent MSCs are capable of producing inflammatory cytokines under physiological conditions we cultured mouse BMMSCs and analyzed their production of TNFα which is one of the most widely studied inflammatory cytokines with a variety of biological functions.11 A combination of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to detect the mRNA expression protein expression and secretion of TNFα (Fig. 1a–c). TNFα production by MSCs was evaluated in comparison with the levels produced by naïve and activated T cells T helper 1 (Th1) cells and macrophages with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (Fig. 1a–c). The data demonstrated that MSCs indeed expressed both pro-TNFα and TNFα and they released a certain amount of TNFα into the culture medium which was more than the amount of TNFα released by naïve T cells but much less than the amount of TNFα released by Th1 cells and LPS-activated macrophages during the same period (Fig. 1a–c).

To address whether physiological TNFα is required for the functional maintenance of MSCs we first examined bone formation and bone marrow adiposity which indicate the osteogenic and adipogenic behaviors of tissue-resident MSCs2223 in wild-type (WT) and TNFα−/− mice. Calcein labeling analysis showed that TNFα−/− mice suffered from a decrease in bone formation as demonstrated by a lower mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR) compared to those of WT mice (Fig. 1d). On the other hand TNFα−/− mice exhibited higher percentages of fatty marrow area than WT mice (Fig. 1e). To directly evaluate whether MSC function was dysregulated under TNFα deficiency we isolated BMMSCs from WT and TNFα−/− mice (Fig. S1A B) and analyzed their behaviors ex vivo in terms of colony formation proliferation and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation (Fig. 1f–i).2224 The data confirmed that TNFα−/− MSCs were less capable of forming fibroblastic colonies (Fig. 1f) incorporating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Fig. 1g) during proliferation and differentiating into mineralizing osteoblasts than were WT MSCs (Fig. 1h) while they were misdirected toward adipocytes during differentiation (Fig. 1i). Interestingly MSCs derived from mice lacking IFNγ and IL-6 two additional potentially important inflammatory regulators of MSC function1025 did not show functional impairments (Fig. S1C–G) suggesting that TNFα-dependent MSC regulation occurs without general effects of inflammatory cytokines.

Next we intended to determine whether TNFα per se maintains MSC function by treating cultured TNFα−/− MSCs with TNFα. Dose-effect analyses demonstrated that a low dose of 1 ng·mL−1 TNFα mimicked the physiological concentration of TNFα secreted by WT MSCs (Fig. S2A). Furthermore 1 ng·mL−1 and lower doses of TNFα exhibited a limited ability to activate TNFR downstream signaling pathways which were previously revealed to be detrimental for MSCs34 (Fig. S2B–D). Therefore we applied TNFα at a concentration of 1 ng·mL−1 and explored whether this low “physiological” level of TNFα would be beneficial for MSCs. We further used receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) another member of the TNF superfamily of cytokines that is important for bone homeostasis26 at the same dose of 1 ng·mL−1 to treat MSCs as a control for TNFα. We discovered that 1 ng·mL−1 TNFα but not RANKL was effective in rescuing the functional decline of MSCs derived from TNFα−/− mice as proven by increases in colony formation proliferation and osteogenic differentiation with inhibition of adipogenesis (Fig. 1f–i). Additional in vitro experiments using genetic overexpression of TNFα in TNFα−/− MSCs confirmed that TNFα is functionally important for preserving homeostasis of MSCs (Fig. S3A–D). Further knockdown of TNFα using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) followed by extrinsic TNFα rescue also revealed that TNFα is indispensable for MSC homeostasis (Fig. S3E–H).

The initially expressed transmembrane pro-TNFα can be specifically cleaved by TACE to release soluble biologically active mature TNFα.13 Intriguingly pro-TNFα failed to rescue the deficient function of MSCs derived from TNFα−/− mice suggesting that TNFα regulation of MSCs was based on the mature form (Fig. S4A–D). Therefore we further investigated whether the release of mature TNFα is required for the functional regulation of MSCs by using TNF protease inhibitor-2 (TAPI-2) a hydroxamate-based inhibitor of TACE.27 We confirmed that TAPI-2 application elevated the intracellular protein level of pro-TNFα while remarkably suppressing MSC release of TNFα into the culture medium (Fig. 1j). We further revealed that TAPI-2 treatment in WT MSCs induced functional decline mimicking the phenotype of TNFα−/− MSCs (Fig. 1k–n). Taken together the above results indicated that MSCs produced and released TNFα for their functional maintenance (Fig. 1o).

TNFα safeguards MSC homeostasis in a receptor-independent manner through endocytosis

Next we explored how TNFα regulates MSC homeostasis. Exogenously added TNFα at a concentration of 1 ng·mL−1 was able to establish a physiological TNFα microenvironment to maintain MSC function without activating canonical TNFR downstream signaling in cultured MSCs (Fig. S2A B). To further evaluate whether TNFR contributes to the regulation of MSCs we isolated MSCs from TNFR−/− mice and analyzed their function compared to that of WT and TNFα−/− MSCs (Figs. 2a–d and S1A B). The data demonstrated that the colony-forming and proliferative capacities of TNFR−/− MSCs were not significantly decreased compared to those of WT MSCs (Fig. 2a b). Moreover although TNFR−/− MSCs were less capable of osteogenesis than WT MSCs TNFα−/− MSCs were deficient in osteogenic differentiation (Fig. 2c). In addition TNFR−/− MSCs showed similar adipogenic differentiation to WT MSCs (Fig. 2d). These results indicated limited effects of TNFR on MSC function which were further confirmed by in vivo analyses of bone formation and bone marrow adiposity revealing that WT and TNFR−/− mice were comparable (Fig. 2e f).

Data represent the mean ± SD Full size image

In deciphering how TNFα regulates MSC homeostasis in a receptor-independent manner we noticed that when TNFα−/− MSCs were treated with TNFα the levels of TNFα detected in the culture medium were always much lower than what we originally added (Fig. S2A) and that intracellular TNFα could be found (Fig. S2B). These data indicated that TNFα might be taken up by deficient MSCs despite the lack of receptor activation. To address this hypothesis we labeled TNFα with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for MSC treatments and discovered that FITC-TNFα was indeed taken up by TNFα−/− MSCs (Fig. 2g). To examine whether TNFα uptake was mediated by endocytotic processes we used Pitstop® 2 an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.28 We identified that Pitstop® 2 effectively inhibited but did not block TNFα uptake by TNFα−/− MSCs suggesting that TNFα uptake occurred at least partially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 2g). We further found that TNFα uptake was not affected by TNFR deficiency indicating a receptor-independent mechanism (Fig. 2g).

Next we examined whether TNFα endocytosis regulates MSC function. Western blot analysis confirmed that Pitstop® 2 treatment efficiently suppressed the uptake of TNFα into TNFα−/− MSCs (Fig. 2h). As expected Pitstop® 2 treatment further significantly diminished the ability of TNFα to rescue TNFα−/− MSCs leading to dysregulation of proliferation and differentiation (Fig. 2i–k). The above results collectively suggested that TNFα safeguarded MSC homeostasis in a receptor-independent manner through endocytosis (Fig. 2l).

Endocytosed TNFα binds to mTORC2 and restricts the activation of mTOR signaling

Next we investigated how endocytosed TNFα regulates MSC homeostasis. In screening the multiple signaling pathways that modulate MSC behaviors we discovered that mTOR signaling changed in response to TNFα deficiency and replenishment (Fig. 3a) whereas the canonical Wnt pathway the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway were not influenced by TNFα (Fig. S5A). In detail phosphorylation of mTOR (p-mTOR) which indicates pathway activation29 was restricted by TNFα but was not affected by TNFR deficiency in MSCs (Fig. 3a). mTOR functions downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in two distinct kinase complexes termed mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2) and Akt is a downstream target of mTORC2 that regulates mTORC1 activity.29 We therefore analyzed the different components of mTOR signaling and found that TNFα inhibited phosphorylation-mediated activation of key mTORC2 subunits Rictor and Sin1 (Figs. 3b and S3I) without affecting PI3K and PTEN expression in MSCs (Fig. S5B). TNFα also suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt and the key mTORC1 subunit Raptor as well as the downstream ribosomal protein S6 kinase (P70S6K) in MSCs29 (Figs. 3c and S3J).

Data represent the mean ± SD Full size image

To decipher how TNFα regulates mTOR signaling in MSCs we hypothesized that TNFα interacted with mTOR complexes given that the upstream factors PI3K and PTEN were unaffected (Fig. S5B). To address this hypothesis we performed a protein coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay to examine the potential binding of TNFα with mTOR complexes. We discovered that when using an anti-TNFα antibody for co-IP mTOR Rictor and Sin1 could be captured but Raptor failed to be detected suggesting that TNFα binds with mTORC2 but not mTORC1 in MSCs (Fig. 3d). Further co-IP analyses using mTOR Rictor and Sin1 antibodies also captured TNFα in MSCs (Fig. 3e). Interestingly although TNFα did not directly interact with mTORC1 mTORC1 kinase activity was repressed by TNFα in MSCs possibly through the restricted activation of Akt (Fig. 3f). We also confirmed that the release and uptake cycle of TNFα contributed to mTOR suppression in MSCs as inhibiting TACE with TAPI-2 and inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis with Pitstop® 2 resulted in mTOR signaling activation mimicking the effects of TNFα deficiency (Fig. 3g h). Additionally although pro-TNFα could be taken up by MSCs mTOR activation was not repressed by pro-TNFα collectively proving that only the mature form of TNFα was capable of regulating mTOR signaling in MSCs (Fig. S4E–H). These data indicated that endocytosed TNFα bound to mTORC2 and restricted the activation of mTOR signaling in MSCs which might be responsible for the observed functional regulation.

Rapamycin protects MSC function against TNFα deficiency

The above results prompted us to investigate whether inhibition of mTOR signaling indeed contributes to the functional regulation of MSCs by TNFα and whether pharmaceutical mTOR suppression serves as an effective approach to rescue the functional decline of MSCs under TNFα deficiency. In this regard we tested rapamycin (Rapa) a potent and specific chemical inhibitor of mTOR complexes and an approved drug in the clinic30 on TNFα−/− MSCs. We confirmed that rapamycin application suppressed activated mTOR signaling in TNFα−/− MSCs in vitro (Fig. 3i). Functional analyses of MSCs further identified that rapamycin treatment significantly improved the colony-forming capability proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of TNFα−/− MSCs while rapamycin inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of TNFα−/− MSCs suggesting restoration of the homeostatic condition of MSCs in the context of TNFα deficiency (Fig. 3j–m). These data indicated that mTOR signaling was a critical downstream target of TNFα in regulating MSC homeostasis and a potential therapeutic target for counteracting MSC disorders in the absence of TNFα (Fig. 3n).

To further evaluate whether inhibition of mTOR signaling rescues the functional decline of MSCs in TNFα−/− mice in vivo we infused rapamycin into TNFα−/− mice intraperitoneally at a dosage of 1.5 mg·kg−1 per day (Fig. 4a); this approach was based on our previous study using rapamycin to ameliorate osteopenia.30 After 2 weeks of rapamycin administration MSCs demonstrated remarkable recovery despite TNFα deficiency as indicated by the formation of more fibroblastic colonies ex vivo (Fig. 4b). Furthermore MSCs derived from rapamycin-treated TNFα−/− mice showed higher proliferative capacity than TNFα−/− MSCs (Fig. 4c). Regarding differentiation MSCs derived from rapamycin-treated TNFα−/− mice showed a preference for osteogenesis rather than adipogenesis (Fig. 4d e). Molecular examinations of ex vivo MSCs confirmed that rapamycin treatment repressed mTOR signaling under TNFα deficiency (Fig. 4f). Functional recovery of MSCs further contributed to improved bone formation with decreased bone marrow adiposity in rapamycin-treated TNFα−/− mice (Fig. 4g h). These results collectively suggested that rapamycin was an effective osteoanabolic therapeutic that protected MSC function against TNFα deficiency.

Mechanical force drives TNFα endocytosis and promotes MSC function

Next we aimed to investigate how the release and uptake of TNFα are coupled for MSC regulation. MSCs are exposed to a variety of mechanical stimuli in vivo18 which have been reported to influence cellular endocytotic processes.3132 To investigate whether mechanical force regulates TNFα shuttling across the MSC membrane we applied an intermittent stretch-loading model to cultured MSCs (Fig. 5a). Intriguingly we discovered that the TNFα concentration in the culture medium of MSCs dropped dramatically during each of the 2 h stretching periods whereas it gradually increased during mechanical unloading and generally increased with advancing time (Fig. 5a). Correspondingly intracellular protein levels of TNFα were upregulated after stretching but diminished upon unloading (Fig. 5b). These data suggested constitutive production and release of TNFα by MSCs with inducible internalization triggered by mechanical force.

Data represent the mean ± SD Full size image

To determine whether the force-driven dynamics of TNFα contribute to MSC regulation we examined and revealed changes in mTOR signaling activation in accordance with stretch-provoked TNFα fluctuations (Fig. 5c). Further cellular functional analyses demonstrated that intermittent stretching for 2 h per session twice per week significantly promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs with inhibition of adipogenesis (Fig. 5d–f). As expected stretch-loading did not induce changes in TNFα mRNA expression (Fig. 5g). Instead mechanical stretching promoted TNFα uptake in both WT and TNFα−/− MSCs (Fig. 5h i). We used Alexa FluorTM 488-conjugated bovine serum albumin (488-BSA) to confirm that the general endocytosis rate was also boosted by mechanical stretching (Fig. 5j k). Importantly when Pitstop® 2 was used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis stretch-induced TNFα and 488-BSA internalization was blocked (Fig. 5h–k). To further confirm that mechanical stretching restricted mTOR signaling via TNFα endocytosis we applied mechanical stretching to TNFα−/− MSCs and then examined mTOR signaling by Western blot analysis. The results showed that there was no significant alteration in mTOR signaling between the stretch-loading and control groups (Fig. S6A). TNFα treatment followed by mechanical stretching restricted mTOR signaling whereas this effect was diminished in the presence of Pitstop® 2 (Fig. S6B). Collectively these results suggested that mechanical force drove TNFα endocytosis and promoted MSC function (Fig. 5l).

Mechanical unloading induces MSC functional decline and bone loss that are counteracted by rapamycin

Inspired by the above data we intended to investigate the pathophysiological implications of mechanical force-induced TNFα endocytosis. Hindlimb unloading (HU) of mice has been widely used as a ground-based model to simulate the effects of spaceflight and microgravity environments in which osteopenia and MSC dysfunction have been reported.20 Interestingly we discovered that HU mice were characterized by an elevated level of TNFα in the bone marrow (Fig. 6a). To determine whether TNFα uptake by MSCs was impaired after hindlimb suspension we applied Prx1-Cre;tdTomato mice in which mesenchymal cells are labeled specifically in vivo. We found that among the bone marrow tdTomato+ cells TNFα+ cells were indeed less abundant in HU mice than in the control mice but there was a higher prevalence of p-mTOR+ cells indicating diminished TNFα dynamics with mTOR signaling activation under mechanical unloading (Fig. 6b).

Fig. 6 Mechanical unloading induces MSC functional decline and bone loss that are counteracted by rapamycin. a ELISA analysis of TNFα levels in the bone marrow of control and hindlimb unloading (HU) mice (N = 5). b Flow cytometric analyses of TNFα+ cells and p-mTOR+ cells in bone marrow mesenchymal cells.

Considering the above findings we continued to evaluate whether inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin infusion counteracts the putative MSC functional decline in HU mice (Fig. 6c). As expected rapamycin administration prevented the activation of mTOR signaling in MSCs after hindlimb suspension (Fig. 6d). Furthermore rapamycin treatment in vivo protected MSCs against HU-induced functional impairments as indicated by improved colony formation proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in MSCs derived from rapamycin-treated mice with suppressed adipogenesis (Fig. 6e–h). Importantly we revealed that rapamycin infusion substantially prevented the decline of bone formation in HU mice and rapamycin also rescued bone marrow adiposity (Fig. 6i j). Finally we identified rapamycin as an effective therapy for preserving bone mass despite mechanical unloading (Fig. 6k). Collectively these data indicated that mechanical unloading induced MSC functional decline and bone loss based on TNFα and mTOR signaling dysregulation and these effects were counteracted by rapamycin (Fig. 6l).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb3BoYXJtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vdmlldy9zdXBwb3J0aW5nLXRoZS1pbmR1c3RyeS1kdXJpbmctYS1wYW5kZW1pY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supporting the Industry During a Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic tested the R&D capabilities of bio/pharma companies and highlighted some of the challenges present in the bio/pharma industry before the crisis hit. Among the lessons learned from the pandemic response are changed perceptions within the industry regarding flex capacity risk management supply chain and inventory control according to Eric Langer managing partner at BioPlan Associates.

“These are not ‘new’ factors by any means. But the pandemic has demonstrated how critical they are not just in normal times but during crisis as well” says Langer.

Is the industry up for the challenge of handling the pandemic? “…the industry has in many ways known [that a pandemic response] would be possible and all the ‘moving parts’ have generally worked at the remarkable speed needed to develop vaccines and therapeutics around the world” Langer says.

Contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) proved integral to the biopharmaceutical industry’s ability to handle the pandemic providing expertise facilities and manufacturing capacity sponsor companies did not have. COVID-19 has emphasized the benefits of CMOs and CDMOs. So how did these organizations fare in 2020 and what is their outlook for 2021?

Can capacity meet demand?

Capacity has been a challenge in the past year says Langer. “CMOs and manufacturers have been managing their capacity since the beginning of this crisis from vials to stoppers from single-use devices to fill/finish lines and all the accompanying logistics. Many non-COVID projects have reportedly been shifted to other facilities and even other partners which has created bottlenecks in other adjacent segments as well. But by managing existing capacity we’re already seeing a smooth transition from R&D and clinical production to large-scale manufacturing” he says.

Fiona Barry associate editor at PharmSource–GlobalData agrees that there is insufficient capacity for the level of demand caused by the pandemic but doesn’t see the industry being able to catch up to the demand in 2021. “Eventually there will be a few different vaccine types on the market and these will require different technologies/processes to manufacture and so capacity will be specific to which vaccine types gain approval” she says. “A number of promising vaccine candidates in late stage use newer vaccines technologies such as mRNA-based products. As these become approved—the UK [United Kingdom] issued an emergency approval of Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 on [Dec. 2 2020]—then repurposing more traditional vaccine facilities will not help capacity issues.”

A balancing act

The pandemic has created another challenge: maintaining the manufacturing of non-pandemic drugs in addition to needed COVID-19 treatments. In 2021 Langer says CMOs and CDMOs will continue to balance pandemic and non-pandemic-related programs by shifting projects from facility to facility. “The cascade of scheduled pre-pandemic non-COVID projects are necessarily continuing since these too are lifesaving and must be moved forward despite the challenges to R&D and clinical trials during these times” he says.

COVID-19 vaccine developers are contracting with CMOs and CDMOs at a rate not seen before in the industry says Barry. “Consequently infectious disease drugs have already overtaken perpetual leader oncology as the year’s top therapy area for contract manufacturing service agreements since many of these vaccine-developer companies are small and lack manufacturing capabilities. Even the largest companies require extra resources to supply billions of doses with AstraZeneca and Inovio having the largest number of contract service agreements to date. Pharma companies such as Pfizer are also pushing internally manufactured drugs out to CMOs to free up space for COVID-19 vaccine manufacture” she says.

Barry agrees however that manufacturers will continue to juggle the needs of non-pandemic therapies and COVID-19 medicines and vaccines. “More than 1000 clinical trials worldwide were disrupted in 2020 by COVID-19 due to suspended or slow enrollment or delayed initiation (1). Resumed trials and delays in manufacturing of advanced biologics many of which require the same capabilities as vaccines will cause even greater demand of these already scarce resources in 2021” she says. Cell and gene therapies have also been affected by the pandemic according to Barry. She notes that a bottleneck in viral vector manufacturing was already a problem prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (2).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDM4LTAyMC0wMDQzOC0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defining the 'HoneySweet' insertion event utilizing NextGen sequencing and a de novo genome assembly of plum ...,"Plum genome assembly and annotation

‘Improved French’ from which a great majority of the commercial production of dried plums (prunes) is derived was chosen to provide a phased genome sequence such that all six copies of each chromosome would be represented. This was performed by NRGene using second-generation sequencing resulting in 210× coverage and third-generation sequencing resulting in 55× coverage. The data were assembled into 27870 scaffolds representing a genome of 1399321220 bases (Table 1). Using the number of conserved genes Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO)7 to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the genome assembly 1385 or 96.2% of all the genes were found to be complete and of which 1318 were duplicated. In addition there were 9 fragmented genes (0.6%) and 46 missing genes (3.8%). Table 1 presents summaries of various aspects of the genome. The assembled genome was then annotated resulting in 130866 gene models and is available on Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) https://www.rosaceae.org/8.

NextGen sequence of ‘HoneySweet’

Whole genome sequencing was undertaken not only to confirm the location and arrangement of the transgenes but also to verify the lack of other insertion events undetected by previous DNA blot analyses and PCR detections. Using the Illumina GAII sequencer 75 and 100 base paired-end sequences ~607000 reads were generated after trimming representing ~52 billion bases of sequence. The sequences were aligned to the transgene T-DNA insert sequence used to transform ‘HoneySweet’ (Supplementary Data Set 1). Junction sequences were detected where the sequence was aligned on only one side of the junction and was not homologous on the other (Fig. S1). In total 11 junction sites were detected (Table S1). Of these four junctions (junctions #1 8 9 and 11) represented inserts flanked by plum DNA. The remaining represented inserts with transgene DNA on one end and non-contiguous transgene DNA on other side. These sites marked duplications deletions or other rearrangements during the integration of the T-DNA a phenomenon known to occur with Agrobacterium transformation. A map was constructed based on these junction sites resulting in two separate insertion events each flanked by plum DNA (Fig. 1).

Each of the transgene regions is color coded with the NPTII gene promoter and terminator in yellow the PPV-CP in red the UIDA in blue the MUA-10 in green and plum in dark blue. The regions in pink represent the fragments of the initial T-DNA specified by the base numbers Full size image

The first event (insertion 1) consisted of seven copies of the insert with no intervening plum DNA. Two of those copies contained nearly the whole insert and the others contained only partial copies. No T-DNA border sequences were detected in these seven copies. The flanking plum DNA on one side matched that found previously in the BAC sequencing5 (see Table S5). On the other side flanking plum DNA was unique.

The second insertion event (insertion 2) consisted of two copies that each contained the 35S promoter from UIDA and the nearly complete CP gene (Fig. 1) with unequal amounts of the 3′ noncoding region of the CP gene. The copies were arranged toe-to-toe forming a hairpin arrangement with the unequal amounts of 3′ sequence forming an unmatched intervening sequence loop. The flanking plum sequences on either end matched the previously sequenced BAC containing the hairpin arrangement of the CP gene5

To confirm the arrangements of the insertion events primers were designed to the junction sequences and used to verify by PCR that those junction sequences existed in ‘HoneySweet’ (Table S2). Table S1 lists the junction sequences and the PCR reactions that were verified in this manner.

The predicted arrangement of the multiple copies was also confirmed by mapping the ‘HoneySweet’ DNA sequence reads to the predicted insert 1 and 2 sequence. Only sequences that were mapping uniquely were kept which should represent the junction sequences because of the repetitive nature of the insertion events. All the unique junctions were confirmed (Figs. S2 and S3).

No additional insertion of foreign DNA

Whole genome sequences were then aligned to the sequence of Agrobacterium Ti plasmid DNA as well as Agrobacterium genomic DNA and E. coli sequences to determine if there were any unintentional insertions of bacterial vector DNAs. No matches were found indicating that there were no unintentional insertions of bacterial DNA in other parts of the genome.

Identification of plum scaffolds that have homology to the ‘HoneySweet’ insertion sites

The ~1000 bases of the predicted plum DNA sequence closest to insertion 1 and insertion 2 that were derived from the BAC sequencing and the whole genome sequencing of ‘HoneySweet’ were used to identify scaffolds from the phased plum genome that contained matching sequence. For the multicopy insertion event 1 five scaffolds had significant sequence homology with the ‘HoneySweet’ flanking DNAs (Supplementary Data Set 2). Plum DNA 5’ (991 bases) matched that of Scaffold 2675 with only one base missing Scaffold 1234 had only an eight base indel and Scaffolds 1332 1429 and 1650 also had that eight base indel as well as a few SNPs and additional indels.

The 3′ flanking plum DNA (999 bases) had more divergence. Unlike the 5′ end this sequence was not derived from BAC sequence but based only on a consensus sequence derived from ‘HoneySweet’ short sequencing reads mapping to the related region in the peach genome. The first 419 bases matched well before diverging amongst the five contigs. In this region there are a handful of SNPs and indels with Scaffolds 2675 1234 and 1332 sharing most of the SNPs and the ‘HoneySweet’ sequence having some unique SNPs. The sequence following the first 419 bases of ‘HoneySweet’ separated the scaffolds into two groups as the sequence diverged (Supplementary Data Set 2). The first group contained Scaffolds 2675 1234 and 1332 while the second group consisted of Scaffolds 1429 and 1650. It is hard to place ‘HoneySweet’ reads into either group as reads mapped to either arrangement. Because of the distance from the insertion event the short reads could not be aligned with the new insertion DNA. The scaffold alignment with the ‘HoneySweet’ short reads predicted that there was a 33-base deletion (or 34 in the case of Scaffold 1429) that was at the site of insertion 1 in ‘HoneySweet’. A sixth scaffold that matched the flanking DNA even with relaxed criterium could not be found for insertion 1.

For the second insertion event the hairpin 1000 bases of plum flanking sequence was used for both the 5′ and 3′ that matched the BAC sequence and was confirmed by the whole genome sequence of ‘HoneySweet’. Seven scaffolds were found with significant homologies of which two had two different sites of homology. Of the seven scaffolds there are four that also contain the flanking sequences for insertion 1 Scaffolds 2675 12341429 and 1650.

A comparison of the sequences with ‘HoneySweet’ for insertion 2 is presented in Supplementary Data Set 3. The site of insertion 2 appears to be in a highly repetitive region with slight variations in sequence. The alignments at the 5′ end were very difficult because of the highly divergent sequences. The homologies improved in the 600 bases closest to insertion site. The alignments suggest grouping of the scaffolds with Scaffold 4101 closest to 1650 and 2675 along with 1234_1 and 1234_2 also grouping with them. Scaffolds 4359 and 1429-1 appear to group and 1429-2 and 6796 appear to be the closest to the ‘HoneySweet’ sequence. But there are variations within the groupings the most major of which are non-contiguous sequences for Scaffold 4101 1650 and 1429_2 in which a large insertion of bases appears to be present. For Scaffolds 4101 and 1650 that insertion event is at the same site and identical sequence. The predicted sequence for ‘HoneySweet’ diverges from the other sequences. This could represent a novel arrangement in ‘HoneySweet’ or a miss-assembly of the BAC sequence. There are many matches (~300) of the diverging sequence in the plum genome including 3 in Scaffold 6796 which are located quite close to the predicted insertion site.

Arrangement of flanking genes

To further clarify the arrangements as well as possible infringement on gene expression of flanking genes the closest annotated predicted genes were mapped. Figure 2 presents a schematic and Table S3 presents the actual locations on each scaffold. Insertion 1 is flanked upstream by a 2 carboxy-14 naphthoquinone phytyltransferase gene of ~5000 bases. The insertion is located from 1095 to 1976 bases 5′ of the gene in each scaffold. On the downstream side insertion 1 is flanked in three of the scaffolds by a predicted ncRNA of unknown function. In the case of Scaffolds 2675 and 1234 the predicted ncRNA gene is 565 bases away and in Scaffold 1429 it is over 35000 bases away. All five Scaffolds are then flanked by an ABC transporter G family member like-gene ranging from 15000 to 38000 bases away. In none of these five potential sites would the insertion event interrupt a gene.

Fig. 2: Diagram of the plum scaffolds that contain sites that match the insertion events. Under each scaffold number is the size of the scaffold in bases. The insertion sites are marked with a triangle and the flanking genes with a bar. The key identifies each by color Full size image

Insertion 2 was flanked in all cases by DMR6-LIKE OXYGENASE 2-like genes ranging from 6103 to 42874 away from predicted insertion site on one side and 2337 to 13351 away on the other side. Again in none of the scaffolds was the predicted insertion site interrupting a gene.

Synteny of region with peach genome

The plum scaffolds were compared to the Peach V2.0 genome assembly9 to look for regions of synteny again as further evidence for the relevant plum scaffolds. Previous results suggested a location for related sequences on chromosome 8 of peach and as expected the synteny was with Pp08 from 9473585 to 10635400 bases. (Table S4). The eight scaffolds were compared with the region of peach that would cover both insertion sites (9474968–9968036 bases) with each predicted transcript annotated (Fig. 3). Matching genes have similar colors and non-matching are a similar gray. There are striking homologies at either end of this segment with peach and between all the scaffold sequences that cover these regions. Between these ends there is considerable variation within the plum scaffolds as well as peach. The first variable is the size of this region. For peach Scaffolds 2675 1234 1429 1650 4359 and 4101 the sizes are 493068 578239 1218611 696146 855117 618536 and 784033 respectively. Scaffold 1332 and 6796 are much shorter at 67859 and 388486 respectively. This represents an expansion in the plum genome relative to peach (or a reduction in peach) at this site of up to threefold as well as considerable variation between the plum scaffolds.

Fig. 3: Synteny between peach and the eight scaffolds that have matching sequence to the flanking sequences for insertion 1 and 2. Like color blocks are orthologous genes. The names of all the genes for peach are listed on the side. Light gray blocks for the plum represent unique genes deep purple blocks represent the repetitive DMR6-like genes and the forest green represent arabinogalactan-9 family genes. Blank space are gene gaps in the sequences. The asterisk for Scaffold 1650 is to indicate that there is an inversion in the middle of the synteny chart. The red stars indicate the location of insertion 1. The yellow stars are indications of where insertion 2 is Full size image

There are two sets of repetitive gene sequences in this region the first is arabinogalactan protein 9-like (AGP9) and the second is DMR6-Like oxygenase 2-like sequences. There are similar numbers of annotated AGP9s in peach (10) and the plum scaffolds (5–8). But for the DMR6 genes there are many more in plum at this region (8–10) than in peach (3). One plum scaffold 2675 also has only 3.

There are small regions where there is significant synteny between the plum scaffolds that are not found in peach such as the region between Prupe.8G065600.1 and Prupe.8G066000.1 but there is also variation amongst the plum scaffolds such as between Prupe.8G065200.1 and Prupe.8G065400.1. The last major difference is the inversion found in Scaffold 1650 between Prupe.8G065200.1 and Prupe.8G066500.1.

Expression of genes flanking matching insertion sites

To verify the lack of influence of the insertion events on expression of flanking genes as well as the intervening space RNAs were mapped to predicted gene sequences of the newly assembled plum (Figs. S4 and S5). A collection of ‘HoneySweet’ trees from three locations and ‘Stanley’ trees from four locations was used as they represented a variety of environments and management schemes that might affect expression. Quantitatively there were considerable differences between expression in fruit and leaf tissues but qualitatively no new sites of transcription were seen between the 16 ‘HoneySweet’ library RNAs and the 20 ‘Stanley’ libraries. To quantify any differences TPMs (transcripts per million) were calculated and analyzed statistically amongst the different libraries (Table 2). Based initially on the total reads which including those mapping uniquely to each predicted transcript as well as a proportion of those that mapped to multiple predicted transcripts 10 genes had significant differences in expression in leaf as judged by the P value of 0.05 (Table 2). Of these two were significant using the Bonferroni Correction value of 0.05. There were 23 predicted genes that had significant differences of expression in fruit as judged by the p value of 0.05 of which only two were significant using the Bonferroni Correction value of 0.05.

Table 2 DEGs of flanking genes to predicted insertion sites in all scaffolds Full size table

The TPMs were recalculated for these potentially significant genes using only the unique reads as these were the only transcripts that could definitively be mapped to each allele. On doing this only three genes had an average TPM with a standard deviation that did not overlap with ‘Stanley’. All three had very low expression from 0 to 1 TPM per library which for most of the libraries meant less than five reads (Table 2). Heat maps were constructed from the TPM values for the unique reads (Tables S5 and S6). These show the variation between each tree sampled is for the most part greater than the variation by cultivar similar to that seen when sampling fruit composition from these trees10.

To confirm that no new genes were formed by the insertion events all the RNA-seq reads from the 16 ‘HoneySweet’ libraries were mapped to the two predicted insertion events which included ~1000 bases of flanking plum sequence (Fig. S6). Only the expected reads for the coding sequences of NPTII CP UIDA and partial transcripts from the interrupted BLA gene in MUA-10 sequence were detected. A few random transcripts were detected but were less than one read per library and hence not significant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAxNDc2NTEzMjAzMTMxNzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cadmium induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition and migration of renal cancer cells by increasing PGE2 through a ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651320313178 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAxNDc2NTEzMjAzMTMxNzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

With the coronavirus vaccine starting to roll out travelers are getting excited about making plans again so much so that travel companies and organizations are seeing an uptick in late 2021 bookings. You don’t have to pull the trigger on booking a trip just yet to start feeling hopeful for 2021. A travel New Year’s resolution can help with that.

Thomas G. Plante a psychologist and professor at Santa Clara and Stanford universities says that after the “mental health tsunami” that was 2020 we need hope more than ever and setting goals can provide just that.

“New Year’s resolutions historically have had to do with diet exercise and weight loss stop drinking those kinds of health habits” Plante says. “This year might be different given the pandemic. When it comes to travel people who like to travel have been grounded for almost a year now and it makes a lot of sense for people to have some specific goals around travel.”

My 2021 travel resolution (for when we can travel again) is to stop complaining about travel annoyances (crowded trains; bad airplane food; jet lag). What are yours? — Natalie B. Compton (@NatBCo) December 29 2020

However it’s possible to do more harm than good when making New Year’s resolutions.

“Realistically it’s going to take a while to get everybody vaccinated” Plante says. “It’s great for people to have travel expectations and hopes it’s just that we’ve got to be thoughtful and realistic so they’re not terribly disappointed.""

Instead of thinking “I’m going to visit 12 countries in 2021” a more realistic resolution may have to do with how you’re going to travel in 2021. Do you want to see more art? Tackle more physical challenges? Live more in the moment?

Plante says travelers can think of resolutions like using a map for a road trip. If you don’t have a goal and a direction you may get lost along the way. What travel did you dream about during the pandemic? What do you miss about travel that you’d like to experience next year?

To help you get your brainstorming going we asked avid travelers many of whom are writers to share their 2021 travel resolutions. Here are some examples as you reflect on your own travel goals.

Stacey Leasca travel journalist and journalism professor

My travel resolution is to stay up late no matter where in the world I am. I have a deep love of waking up early to see the sunrise in every new spot I see but always wind up asleep far too early. I want to see the way each spot spends its mornings noons and well into the night. I’m so ready to experience it all.

I look forward to also thanking every TSA agent from now on and rather than get flustered assist my fellow passengers who don’t understand that yes you do need to take your shoes off and laptops out.

Erik Cooper founder of Erik Cooper Adventures

Guiding adventures leads me to some of the world’s most remote locations from Mongolia to Patagonia; my lifestyle is one that’s always on the move it’s been a tough year having to stay put. Covid-19 and the restrictions it’s brought has made me make a resolution to dig even deeper once the pandemic is over.

The freedom to travel really is something special and once it’s back I’m not going to take it for granted. I’m going to focus my energy on creating more intimate experiences and spending more time soaking in the nuances that make them memorable.

If there’s one thing I’ll be taking with me in what I can only hope will be the beginning of the roaring ’20s when taking to the skies is patience. Lives have been lost jobs have been lost homes will be lost and the sanity of humanity is questionable. Everybody is going through something that we know nothing about. This should be remembered every step of the way from the ride to the airport the lines at check-in and security and the disembarking from the flight.

This I would like to highlight: Be patient have some compassion and use your grown up thoughts before dashing off the plane before your row is called. You don’t know what your neighbor in 34D is going through. You don’t know what type of anxiety your “uptown” neighbor in 2B could be battling. Travel especially in a post-coronavirus world will be a luxury. A little kindness will go a long way.

I’m not sure what 2021 will bring none of us are really but I’m certain my first flight back in the saddle will be an emotional one. My resolutions for 2021 involve some destinations but also some mind-set adjustments.

I had a trip scheduled with friends to eat our way through Japan last April. If things go well with the vaccine distribution maybe we’ll be able to plan for some time in the second half of the new year. My family has been talking about going on a holiday to Hawaii for years and the hope is to say Mele Kalikimaka with them on the islands in December.

On the mind-set side I hope to be more cognizant of the great cost it takes to travel the world. The impact on the environment and our bodies is immense. In the “Great Before” I was so concerned about chasing miles and earning the top status that I would nonchalantly crisscross oceans just to attain or maintain that status. I will be trying to find ways to be more responsible and maximize future trips by spending more time in a given region discovering what other stories can be uncovered while I’m there.

Just about all my travel is for work and therefore I already have plans in place to travel a lot in 2021.

My resolution this year however is that I bring my kids with me as much as possible. I realized during the pandemic how important my kids’ travel memories have been and how they’ve actually sustained us as we navigated thru this emotionally difficult year without school friends and family. So it’s not just the experience of travel itself but building up that reserve of wonderful experiences to always strengthen us.

Bill Ezparza James Beard award-winning author

I wouldn’t consider myself jaded about travel but this halt to my travel routine that has been nonstop since I was around 22 has given me time to reflect.

I’m not going to hesitate when that quick side-trip comes up and I’m going to be more in the moment when dining or sightseeing. I miss the spontaneous discovery and joy that comes from travel. My resolution for when travel returns is to focus on the many delights I’m privileged to savor.

Next time I’m in São Paulo I’m going to fly to Curitiba just to dine at Manu and I won’t even spend a moment worrying about the inconvenience or logistics. No more taking anything for granted.

My travel resolution is to support more local entrepreneurs in the destinations I am visiting. This year has really taught us that small businesses need support to survive and are also the heart of many communities. As a freelancer myself I look forward to putting my money into the local markets that feed a community artisans that create beauty in the world and other creatives that celebrate innovation.

This year is an unforgettable reminder that we are all connected and in seen and unseen ways we rise and fall together. So I pledge to be an exceptional traveler. I will travel with a spirit of enchantment and wonder with my eyes wide open my heart and soul focused on discovering more and more about the African Diaspora. For me this means amplifying awareness and heightening my devotion to sharing the brilliance genius talent resiliency and humanity of African descendants wherever I travel.

Konrad Waliszewski CEO and co-founder of TripScout

I will stop letting life and work get in the way of my next trip. I took for granted that travel would always be there for me. I assumed that there would always be a flight tomorrow and an open border waiting. I’m now reminded how much of a lucky privilege that was and how quickly it can be taken away.

Post-pandemic I feel like I have a second chance with one of my true loves and I won’t take it for granted. Last-minute flight deal in my inbox? Booked. Hotels are too expensive on those dates? Oh well I will figure it out. Work is too busy? I will work from a cafe there. I will not put the trip off to next month.

Once I depart I will travel slower. I will do less but go deeper. And most importantly I will savor every single physical human interaction. Seriously I will probably hug to the first tourist-hustler who tries to scam me.

Celine Bossart wine spirits and travel writer

Once it’s safe to travel again I envision myself prioritizing my comfort and mental health more than I have in the past even in the smallest ways. I used to travel like a maniac almost exclusively for work purposes sacrificing things like sleep or nourishment and finding myself in a constant state of stress and anxiety.

I want to give myself enough time between trips to recover reset and spend time with the people I love. I think that if I’m able to strike more of a balance between home life and life on the road I’ll be able to make the most out of both.

Mickela Mallozzi travel TV producer and host

As a professional traveler and travel TV host I usually have a limited amount of time in each destination I visit. If my crew and I have a five-day shoot in a destination we’re usually filming 10 to 13 hour days with little to no sleep and definitely no downtime to enjoy the destination more slowly.

I’ve always said I should do this but now I will definitely implement this going forward. Therefore my 2021 travel resolution (and beyond) is to take my time with travel by spending a little more time in the destination and allowing myself to tack on at least one full day to explore the place without a camera. And I think this can translate for all travelers. You don’t need to jampack your travels or your itinerary. Take a breath and take your time to travel slowly within that destination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcHJpdmF0ZS1hdmlhdGlvbnMtd2lsZGx5LXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwteWVhci0yMDIxLTHSAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3ByaXZhdGUtYXZpYXRpb25zLXdpbGRseS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLXllYXItMjAyMS0xP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Private aviation's wildly successful 2020,"The private aviation industry went from virtually no flights at the peak of the pandemic to thriving by year's end.

It's been a rollercoaster of a year for the aviation industry but private aviation has become one of the 2020's greatest success stories.

A promising start to 2020 quickly turned sour as fears of the novel coronavirus inflicted commercial flight cancellations across Asia with the industry as a whole going off a cliff in March. Private aviation's continued growth since the 2008 economic recession was halted overnight as there was simply no place to go during the pandemic's peak.

A rush of wealthy flyers chartering emergency evacuation flights quickly turned into stagnation for many operators with some firms temporarily closing up shop and furloughing workers. But its recovery began in earnest come May with more wealthy flyers taking to the skies as lockdowns ended across the US.

Florida Georgia Texas and Colorado were among the most popular destinations early on as the wealthy wanted to social distance in peace and luxury. And aircraft manufacturers continued producing the latest and greatest private aircraft in preparation for when the world's borders will once again be open for travel.

Here are some of private aviation's highlights from 2020.

Vista Jet took delivery of its first Bombardier Global 7500

A VistaJet Bombardier Global 7500. VistaJet

VistaJet became the first charter operator to acquire the Bombardier Global 7500 in 2020 offering travelers a new option for ultra-long-range travel. With a range of 7700 nautical miles the Global 7500 is the longest-ranged aircraft in its class beating out any competitor from Gulfstream or Dassault Aviation.

Cities pairs like New York-Hong Kong Moscow-Buenos Aires and Los Angeles-Dubai are easily achievable under the right conditions. The jet even features a private bedroom complete with a full-size bed and owners can opt for a shower.

The Global 7500 is still one of the rarest private jets currently flying having debuted in December 2018. A sales firm was tasked with selling a brand-new model for $70 million from an owner who had purchased but no longer wanted the aircraft.

Airbus turns its controversial A220 into a private jet

The new Airbus ""TwoTwenty"" private jet. Airbus

Airbus unveiled the VIP version of its new A220 airliner known as the Airbus Corporate Jet ""TwoTwenty"" in October. European private aviation specialist Comlux was given the task of designing the interior.

Six orders have already been placed for the aircraft including two from Comlux with operators looking to take advantage of the jet's economics. Airbus says the plane can fly up to 5650 nautical miles enough to fly between Europe and the US West Coast. Comlux's design includes an 18-seat cabin and a private bedroom with a king-size bed

A group of aircraft management and design firms including Kestrel Aviation Management Camber Aviation Management and Pierrejean Vision also unveiled an alternative design for the aircraft that includes a private office and cinema suite.

We toured one of the newly-refurbished Bombardier Challenger 300s during a stop in Westhampton Beach New York.

XO also made a major acquisition of Wisconsin's Red Wing Aviation that saw the addition of 15 light jet aircraft. The firm's fleet now includes a mix of light jet and super-midsize aircraft to give customers more flexibility when booking complemented by a new booking app.

Bringing on more planes also means hiring more pilots. Kevin Thomas president and chief operating officer of XOJET Aviation told Business Insider that 4000 pilots have applied for his company as furloughs have crushed the airline industry.

We also reveal what private aviation executives are looking for when pilot hiring and how flying the wealthy is a different job description than flying airliners.

Jet Linx acquires Meridian Air Charter

Jet Linx's private terminal at Teterboro Airport. Thomas Pallini/Business Insider

Jet Linx purchased Teterboro New Jersey's Meridian Air Charter in a deal that solidified the former as the second-largest aircraft management firm in the Northeastern US. CEO Jamie Walker told Business Insider in an exclusive interview that he decided to move forward with the deal during the pandemic even when the industry's recovery wasn't assured based on his experience during the 2008 economic recession.

""We had made the determination that if there's ever a better time to start a new location it would be coming out of a recessionary period"" Walker told Business Insider about his firm's 2009 expansion to Dallas which shaped his thinking on expansion when the economy took another turn for the worse 11 years later. ""So having done it once already it was an easier decision to make this time around.""

The move gives the Omaha Nebraska-based company a larger foothold in the New York area as Teterboro Airport is one of the busiest executive airports in the country thanks to its proximity to Manhattan. We also toured Jet Linx's private terminal at Teterboro to see just how different the airport experience is for the wealthy.

Private aviation firms focus more on health and safety

The early days of the pandemic revealed a shortage of personal protective equipment in the US as healthcare workers struggled to keep up with the influx of new coronavirus patients in hospitals. A perfect storm of high demand and fewer passenger flights meant that getting more from China was more expensive and private aircraft operators saw an opportunity to get their planes back in the air.

One of the aircraft that participated was a Boeing 777-200 named CrystalSkye that acted as a flying cruise ship before the pandemic under the Crystal Cruises brand and later became a VIP aircraft available for charter. The massive cabin is ideal for heads of states and the wealthiest of travelers as it includes butler service a bar a full dining area and 88 lie-flat seats.

Kim Kardashian West later used the aircraft for her infamous island getaway and birthday bash.

Business travelers have been largely grounded since March as companies are shifting to virtual meetings to avoid sending their employees out on the road where they could possibly be exposed to COVID-19. The loss of the segment hindered private aviation's recovery until another stepped up and took the skies in massive numbers leisure travelers.

A surge of travelers over the summer continued into fall and has been propping up the industry while business travelers stay home. Firms began shifting their efforts towards leisure flying even more after a McKinsey and Company study found that only 90% of ultra-high-net-worth individuals don't fly private revealing an untapped market.

Private planes were used in 2020 for everything from a vacation to escaping lockdowns in the UK and even flying home to vote in person on Election Day.

While the aviation industry has been decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic LaGuardia Airport has been quietly undergoing major renovations.

NEW YORK -- It's long been the bane of traveling New Yorkers' lives and incoming president Joe Biden once described it as ""third world.""

But while the aviation industry has been decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic LaGuardia Airport has been quietly undergoing major renovations.

And now $8 billion later the new Terminal B is almost finished.

""New Yorkers love to criticize and they love to hate. I think if you looked at every single passenger survey LaGuardia was always the worst"" says Rick Cotton executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

""Our challenge was to take it from worst to first"" he tells CNN.

Today filled with art installations including one of the largest mosaic walls in the US and even a breathtaking water feature which projects images of New York icons such as the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge onto a cascading fountain LaGuardia is a very different place.

Passengers for Air Canada American Airlines Southwest and United -- which are all housed at the new terminal -- have been enjoying the new public spaces since the summer.

From worst to... best?

It was Joe Biden's comments in 2015 that sparked the renovation effort.

New York authorities green-lit the works after the then-Vice President said ""If I blindfolded you and took you to LaGuardia Airport in New York you'd think I must be in some third-world country.""

The central terminal B was built in 1964 and had barely changed since then.

And LaGuardia was according to travelers among the most outdated noisiest and least accessible airports in the country. Not to mention its on-time record which was one of the worst in the United States.

The redevelopment is the largest public-private partnership in US aviation history and is still only 80% complete -- there are still some last gates to demolish and reopen. The project will be fully completed in 2022 and will see three out of the four terminals completely redeveloped.

But for now travelers in Terminal B can enjoy the new breezy light-flooded departures hall its entire back wall covered in Laura Owens' colossal 25000-square-foot mosaic mural ""I NY"" in which NYC icons such as signs for the Stonewall Inn Apollo Theater and Coney Island's Cyclone roller coaster are depicted against a background of blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's accompanied by a monumental aviation-themed sculpture by Sarah Sze ""Shorter than the Day"" hanging in mid-air.

In the Connector area is Sabine Hornig's ""La Guardia Vistas"" a modern stained glass installation (of latex ink and vinyl mounted on glass) pairing over 1100 photos of New York City into a cityscape in honor of the airport founder and former NYC mayor Fiorello La Guardia.

Jeppe Hein's 70 steel balloons dangle from the ceiling throughout the terminal and his bench sculptures provide photo-friendly seating.

Free Covid tests for all

2020 isn't the best year to be relaunching an airport.

When New York was the US center of the epidemic in March passenger numbers across the city's three airports plummeted by an astonishing 98%. Numbers are still down 75-80% according to Cotton.

But the airport is offering free Covid tests alongside the art to attract passengers back.

Cotton thinks the offering -- which spans 840000 square feet and four floors -- is now ""best in class.""

The Port Authority will be hoping that more travelers get to experience it in 2021.

Not-drinking is one of the most surprising trends of the early 21st century. A growing number of adults have realized the effects of alcohol on their mental and physical health often outweigh any benefits. Cue trending hashtags like #soberlife #sobercurious and now #sobertravel.

Perhaps a subset of the wellness movement sober living is really about connection rather than puritanism. By giving booze a raincheck on holidays travelers are finding they feel more authentic are more present and start tapping into a sense of belonging that alcohol once temporarily provided.

Nightlife

Going out after dark is the obvious time when giving up on drinking could seem problematic. How does one dance flirt or abandon yourself to ""where the night takes you"" without a couple of glasses of bubbly or some top-up tequila shots?

By not drinking when partying you’ll quickly realise that music is a greater elixir than the green fairy (absinthe). Get some travel companions on board and dive into some nightclubs sober – you’ll quickly find the right tune to get you on the dancefloor. And the messier the other patrons get the less embarrassed you’ll feel. What’s more the next morning you won’t wake up thinking ""Ich will sterben"" (""I want to die"") because you’ve downed so much Jägermeister you now think you speak German and you’ll have the energy to do all those daytime activities you planned as well.

Beyond dancing the night away at a roof-top bar in Bangkok or an underground club in Berlin there are myriad nights out that don’t require a ready-made excuse if someone offers to buy you a drink. Many of the world’s cities will have theater stand-up comedy spoken-word performances readings escape rooms live-music gigs late-night bookstores after-hours events at museums and art galleries or night-time walking tours to keep you busy and booze-free. Broaden your idea of a fun night out and you’ll find sober travel may well make you more adventurous not less.

The non-alcoholic world

Sober living is nothing new for a large percentage of the world. For reasons of custom religion or culture drinking is either frowned upon illegal or near impossible in some countries. While many Middle Eastern countries do take a more relaxed approach to the consumption of alcohol by foreigners it is usually kept only to hotels and restaurants and comes at a premium cost. So why not eschew the booze when traveling in a country where it’s otherwise banned and dip into a world of drinks you’ve never tried before?

Brits may love their tea but for many cultures tea drinking is an all-day affair and one steeped in ceremony no matter where you’re having a cup. Even huddled under a makeshift tent in the High Atlas Mountains a brew cooked over an open fire is given the same theatrical pour to oxygenate the flavors and is served with kindness and care to everyone present. Beyond tea drinking and Italy’s much-admired coffee culture you’ll find West Asian countries offer a broad variety of refreshing cordials called sharbat shorbot serbat or sherbet. Seeking out haunts for an afternoon refreshment such as yogurt-based sweet lassi or savoury doogh will reward your taste buds and offer a potential inroad to meeting and engaging with locals whom you wouldn’t have met drinking expensive beers at an international hotel.

Ten sobering trends

Alcohol what’s it for? Not drinking is a way of life in many Islamic countries; head where the locals socialize over tea or sharbat instead. Alcohol-free bars: Bars and pubs where the drinks are no- or low-alcohol are popping up in cities such as London and New York. Soft cocktails: No longer second fiddle to the ""real drinks"" mixologists are now taking mocktails seriously. Wellness retreats: Forget that ""yummy mummies re-live spring break"" yoga retreat: many are strictly drug- and alcohol-free. Booze-free festivals: Not common yet but popular among alternative lifestylers and families wanting to skip the hungover side of the festival scene. The great outdoors: Camping in the wild often means carrying all you will eat or drink leaving little room for non-essentials so leave the booze behind. It’s kombucha time: Served from a keg like beer you’ll see a kombucha pitch at street-food markets and music festivals across the US today. Sober raves: From Morning Gloryville to No Lights No Lycra dancing is the main focus of these alcohol- and drug-free events popping up worldwide. Sober sensations: Germany does multi-sensory club events in major cities with sober DJs light performances and scent artists. Sober travel companies: Tapping into the trend travel companies like Sober Vacations International have started organizing tours for sober folk only.

But no one’s lives have been more effected than those who have lost loved ones this year to this virus” said Mecklenburg County Public Health Director Gibbie Harris. “We are fighting hard every day to get the lifesaving vaccine to as many people as possible. It is fitting that we remember those we have lost with the symbolism of purple in Uptown Charlotte this New Year’s Eve.”

“Throughout the crisis the strength compassion and resilience of the community has been both overwhelming and inspiring to all Center City stakeholders” said Michael Smith president and CEO of Charlotte Center City Partners. “The lights on the building are one way to commemorate and honor those who were lost to this disease while also trying to provide a symbol of hope as the calendar turns from 2020 to 2021. We also want to thank all who are sacrificing so much by working tirelessly to keep our community safe.”

In addition the company raised $26.75 million in funding through strategic partners. The funding enables Future Meat to scale up production and accelerate its R&D.

The low production cost for a ¼-lb serving puts Future Meat in position to begin marketing to consumers and foodservice within 18 months according to the company. Food category players such as Tyson Foods ADM Müller Group and Rich's Products Corporation all back the firm and it has capital investment from as S2G Ventures ADM Capital Emerald Technology Ventures Manta Ray Ventures and Bits x Bites.

“Cultured meat technology is the Apollo program of the 21st century” said Professor Yaakov Nahmias founder and chief scientific officer of Future Meat Technologies. “It required massive efforts of biologists chemists engineers and food experts to reduce the cost of cultured meat by over 1000-fold in just a few years. We are proud to be within reach of cost parity with traditional agriculture without any need to resort to genetic engineering ensuring the supply of safe delicious food for coming generations.”

Future Meat uses proprietary technology based to produce cultured meat directly from animal cells without the need to harvest animals. The technology is based on the rapid natural proliferation of connective tissue cells growing in stainless steel fermenters that continuously remove waste products to maintain a constant physiological environment.

“Cost-efficient production has been a critical focus area for the cultured meat industry” said Rom Kshuk chief executive officer of Future Meat Technologies. “This development is a major step forward in Future Meat Technologies' ability to provide affordable scalable and sustainable products that can meet the growing demand for meat.”

The company plans to start production at its pilot facility in the first half of 2021 and is currently seeking regulatory approval in several territories. Future Meat also produces cultured fat.

The impact of the two hurricanes is thought to have set Honduras’ economic development back by 22 years and the country is not expected to fully recover for another 10 years. The number of people in the country facing food security since the hurricanes struck has more than doubled.

No exception

Cargill’s Pronorsa processing plant is located close to a stream that during the rainy season records a significant increase in water levels. Little surprise therefore that the plant has containment walls and shut down protocols in place should the risk of flooding be deemed high.

High water levels are potentially dangerous for the plant for two main reasons. Firstly the site contains a large high voltage electricity substation while secondly flooding could result in the release of ammonia used for refrigeration and freezing into the surrounding community.

Plans into action

On Tuesday November 3rd in advance of the impending hurricane hitting the plant’s technical team reviewed its shutdown procedures carried out drills and alerted in the in-house emergencies team trained to take control of the plant.

By Wednesday the first hurricane hit with full force and the disaster had started.

Luis Fernando Rivera Operations and Supply Chain Director with Cargill Protein Latam explains: “This hurricane was unprecedented. The last strong storm – Hurricane Mitch – was 22 years ago and the worst in Honduran history”.

Circumstances have changed however since Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras. Upstream from the plant various settlements and buildings have been erected and during these most recent hurricanes rain was particularly heavy.

The order for a preventive shutdown was given with the expectation that flooding could be prevented. However by 9 pm water started to slowly but continuously enter the plant.

Two hours later water trapped upstream surged and there was no time to evacuate the plant and distribution center’s 240 staff. Water levels had risen so quickly and high that buses could not be used to move them to safety.

Rivera continues: “Our closed-circuit cameras showed a counter current water flow that we think came from the dykes made at the settlements upstream that finally gave way”.

It was this surge of water that caused most damage with equipment quickly being under 1.5 meters of water.

The 240 people trapped inside the plant had to be moved to the second floor spending the night in space without light or electricity and that was doubly unsuitable given the need to prevent COVID-19 transmission.

While equipment may have spent several hours submerged in water the preventive shutdown meant that there was no electrical danger for those trapped in the plant and by 6 am water levels had receded sufficiently to carry out an evacuation with no lives lost.

Losses

Of the plant’s 35 truck fleet waiting to be loaded for deliveries the following day 30 were saved. Five however were total losses. The company notes that there were several heroes – for example the workers that saved these trucks and the supervisor that implemented the shutdown.

Rivera notes: “If he had taken an extra hour to do it more serious problems would have occurred”.

The plant however sustained significant damage. At first floor level finished product raw materials and equipment were lost. All equipment was damaged including recently purchased items. Electronic items were damaged and the workers’ cafeteria was also destroyed

After eight days some processing was restarted but not all operations could be restored immediately as the plant lacked spare parts and suppliers were also affected. Over 250 motors had to be dried and refurbished.

Disruption at the plant also led to problems at farms. Unable to receive all of the broilers originally planned for slaughter birds had to be kept on farm for longer with consequent increases in their weight feed costs and knock-on effects for hatcheries and breeder farms.

Stocking densities were raised and the time between flocks reduced. Some farms had difficulties in accessing feed due to blocked or flooded roads while a few farms were flooded and flocks lost.

To make matters worse the disaster happened in the run-up to Christmas the company’s busiest period.

Second hit

Hurricane Iota was as severe as Hurricane Eta  however its impact on the plant was less as the shutdown was implemented more quickly electrical fuse boxes were raised in case of water entry and the plant was evacuated more quickly. This time it was only necessary to close the plant for five days.

Rivera explains: “This was a much more controlled interruption without permanent damage. This time we knew of the impending threat earlier so we started to fill storage facilities deliver sufficient feed to the farms fill fuel tanks and stock up on gaskets for example and other materials”.

Sales down

A full week of sales was lost overnight and supply shortages were felt throughout the country. Yet in times of disaster competitors tend to pull together and this helped in securing nationwide food supply and fill the gaps in supermarket shelves.

Rivera notes that nobody has control where nature is concerned. Working with other companies and the Honduran government will be the only way to ensure stronger protection measures.

The company has also learnt that due to the plant’s position in relation to the country’s mountain ranges water passing through the area will be channeled through the river valley. In a worst case scenario hydraulic pressure is not sufficient to force the water out of the valley and it builds up and flows back. To minimize future disruptions the plant’s infrastructure will have to be redesigned and all electronic circuitry raised.

But as importantly the company has learnt about communication and risk management. Signs indicating dangerously high-water levels will need to be completely revised.

Despite the pandemic slowing recovery and the product mix having to be altered the majority of the Pronorsa plant is now back in operations.

Community effort

People and communities are more important that crisis or destruction of property and in response to the devastation wrought by the hurricane Cargill threw itself into helping its employees and the local community.

The Minneapolis-headquartered company immediately authorized funds to help people get back to normal as quickly as possible.

Around 200 of the plant’s 1200 employees lost their homes or cars. Despite this they dedicated themselves to the tasks of rebuilding the company and their jobs so that they could then rebuild their homes.

“There is no better example of commitment and solidarity” notes Blanca Villela Communicatinos Director with Cargill Protein Latam.

The company also joined with several non-governmental organizations private companies and 1500 volunteers working for the World Central Kitchen to distribute over 200000 meals during the last three weeks of November.

Courtesy of Northwest Community Healthcare

After retiring from a corporate career Ira Fingerman is now a beloved uber-active volunteer at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights where staff members say he's become a true staple.

The 71-year-old Fingerman volunteers an average of six to eight hours a day four to five times a week in the nutrition and food services department. In the last three years he's racked up 3175 hours helping greet people serving food cleaning tables and working in the physicians' lounge.

Fingerman “truly knows everyone” said Stephanie Chan Vo director of guest services for Northwest Community Healthcare.

“People are comforted when they see Ira and he asks how we are doing. He has gotten to know everyone and meal times are not the same without him” she said.

Fingerman was the hospital's No. 1 volunteer hours contributor for 2018 and 2019. Volunteer hours for 2020 will be tallied ahead of the recognition typically announced in March.

“Ira is our Northwest Community Healthcare community hero” Chan Vo said.

When asked why he gives so much time to the hospital Fingerman said he's the one who truly benefits.

“I get out of it more than I give to it” he said. “The community and the sense of seeing other people who do this it's a wonderful thing. ... There are many volunteers some who do far more about the patients getting families to and fro doing things in the emergency room. This is a community.”

Fingerman grew up in Skokie and owned the former Ira's Northbrook hot dog stand in Northbrook before working nearly 30 years in sales management for Tyson Foods. After retiring at the end of 2014 and moving from Chicago to Arlington Heights to be closer to family he decided he needed to volunteer.

He'd learned the value of giving back to others from his mother he said. Plus “sitting around is not a great thing for a person who is retired.”

He reached out to Northwest Community Hospital because it was near his new home and he especially credited the welcoming attitude of Chan Vo who interviews prospective volunteers.

“She was willing to listen to where I could help which is important” Fingerman said. “She was very welcoming about 'what are your thoughts?' and 'what do you need?' and 'let's see if we can fit you into it.'”

The nutrition and food services department was a natural fit because of his background in the food business and over time he got to know the hospital's staff members.

“I felt like the best way to get to know people is to clean their tables” he said. “I don't need to walk around in a suit and tie and ask 'How are you enjoying your meal?' I would take their trays and it went from there.”

Eventually Fingerman was asked if he'd like to staff a pop-up hot dog stand for “specialty day” at the cafeteria which he now does several times a year working with staff member Videl Vargas. The rotating menu also includes Polish sausages Italian beef and Italian sausages.

“The line is out the door with his fans” Chan Vo said.

“It's great fun” Fingerman said.

The hospital community is a true family of people who care for one another and that has been particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic Fingerman said.

“I do love it” he said. “I couldn't work one hour there if I didn't like it.”

Located in northeast Indiana the Hitzfield family raises grass-fed beef pastured pork and laying hens.

The oldest of the sons Blake said the operation’s tasks such as collecting 6000 eggs a day require many helping hands.

“All of us sons are involved along with our parents and we also have a great team” he said. “I’m very blessed to be a part of this. It is a great time to be in small-scale farming.”

In addition to family the farm has 25 full-time employees that work in every different area of the farm from moving cattle and gathering eggs to completing order fulfillment so they can deliver food to people’s doorsteps.

The farm has been very open to visits from producers and consumers alike. They offer farm mentorship for those who are new to pasture-based food production and participate as guest speakers for workshops across the nation. One of their more recent speaking engagements included a workshop on sustainable direct marketing with the Land Stewardship Project based in Minnesota.

Consumers can learn about food production firsthand with wagon tours and virtual farm experiences. Blake said that consumer connection became increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“What we’ve seen in the past 20 years is an element of distrust in our food system for various reasons” he said. “COVID-19 escalated some of those as well when it comes to just food security. I think there has definitely been a push from the consumer side to develop that relationship with their local farmers. It’s easy to think that food just comes from the grocery store and when the grocery store shelves are empty you start thinking about finding a farm.”

Out of all of the negativity in the pandemic Blake saw growth in the local food movement as one silver lining.

“I am encouraged to see that small family farms are there to help in this testing time” he said.

Their farm saw its fair share of ups and downs over the years. Neither Lee nor Beth Hitzfield the founders of Seven Sons Farms were raised on farms. After getting married in the early 1980s they purchased a conventional farm and raised confinement hogs to sell to Tyson foods.

Like most farms in the area at the time they had 1500 acres of row crops filled with corn and beans.

“We kind of hit a roadblock in the 90s” Blake said. “There were two main things. One was a health crisis in the family. This was also a time period where small farms really felt the crunch where they needed to scale to become profitable or get out. Unfortunately we were losing a bridge which made it even harder to be profitable.”

Beth was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and Blake said there wasn’t much conventional medicine could do at the time. They found their solution from an unexpected source.

“It was through a soil agronomist who shared his understanding of soil health and how that relates to the human body and how we are what we eat” Blake said. “It was able to do a lot to improve our mom’s health and that was really a light bulb moment for our family to realize that not only was our farm not profitable but we also no longer believed in that type of agriculture system.”

Seven Sons sold the confinement hogs and planted their row crops to hay and pasture land.

“We put livestock back out on the land and this is where the term regenerative comes into play” he explained. “We’re building upon what we already have without using inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and herbicides. With regenerative agriculture it is constantly building upon itself and we are just stewarding our resources to allow natural life to build.”

Although their farm lost acreage during those challenging times Blake believed they gained value in producing food products with regenerative agriculture rather than a commodity.

“Our farm went from down to 500 acres and not supporting one family to now having 500 acres and supporting 25 full-time positions” he said. “We developed a relationship with customers and were able to become price makers instead of price takers. It is exciting to see that on our farm and it is even more exciting to see it happen on other farms.”

A large part of their success was creating an early online presence.

“We can all compete on the same playing field with Walmart and Kroger because it is all based on where you’re located and the search terms used.”

Seven Sons Farms developed its first website in the early 2000s to draw awareness to their operation. They sold wholes halves and quarters early on and used the site to let customers know there was an on-farm store.

“That has changed to where it is now” Blake said. “We’ve started some buying clubs and home delivery in the past three to four years. That has been very helpful from a consumer standpoint because farmers aren’t very convenient to buy from. Farms are located out in the country and the majority of customers are in the cities. We needed a convenient way to get our proteins the foods that we’re raising into the hands of customers.”

The family worked with local carriers in the cities as well as FedEx and UPS to “put wings” on the farm. An important part of staying relevant was to understand the consumer experience. Blake said their family uses the same shopping platform they expect their customers to use.

“Instead of just walking into our freezer and pulling out whatever is on the list that my wife would send me to bring home we are going to force ourselves to go through that same buying experience through our website or our own farm store” Blake said. “It is really eye-opening because you may realize how inconvenient you are in some areas. Maybe your website is too many clicks to the checkout page. Maybe your farm store hours are not very convenient. Put yourself in your customers’ shoes.”

Their customers come from all demographics. Although Seven Sons Farms focuses heavily on their local region within a reasonable driving distance from the farm they do ship products nationwide.

“Food is something that brings people together and affects every demographic” Blake said. “It really seems in the last several years just about everybody cares about what they’re putting their body and what they are feeding their families.”

Seven Sons Farms offers opportunities for consumers and producers to connect online."

But a Mexican Bank after Run-ins with the US Can No ...,"Triggering a showdown — Government of Mexico v. Central Bank — over paper dollars with ramifications in the US and globally.



The amount of “currency in circulation” – the paper dollars wadded up in people’s pockets and purses stuffed under mattresses or packed into suitcases and safes overseas – jumped again in the week ended December 30 to a new record of $2.09 trillion according to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet where currency in circulation is a liability not an asset. This was up by 16% or by $293 billion from February before the Pandemic. The amount has doubled since 2011:

This amount of currency in circulation is a function of demand – and that demand has been red hot: US Banks have to have enough paper dollars on hand to satisfy demand at ATMs and bank branches. Foreign banks will also request paper dollars from their correspondent banks in the US or return unneeded cash to them.

When there is demand for paper dollars banks buy more of them from the Fed. They pay for them usually with Treasury securities they hold or with excess reserves they have on deposit at the Fed.

The surge of paper dollars is a sign of hoarding not of increased payments. In the US the share of paper dollars for payments has been declining for years replaced by electronic payment methods such as credit and debit cards PayPal Zelle and similar systems all kinds of smartphone-based payment systems the automated clearinghouse (ACH) system and checks every now and then.

During periods of uncertainty people load up on cash as they have done leading up to Y2K during the Financial Crisis and now during the Pandemic.

But much of the hoarding of US dollars takes place overseas with demand for those paper dollars then winding its way to the US banking system via the correspondent banks. These paper dollars also lubricate all kinds of corruption drug trafficking and other activities – and laundering this cash is a big profitable industry.

But these paper dollars overseas can pose their own challenges such as in Mexico where the Bank of Mexico is now facing off against the government over the paper dollars at a Mexican bank that can no longer unload them.

Here is Nick Corbishley’s report on this paper-dollar showdown in Mexico:

These paper dollars appear to be causing all sorts of headaches for one of Mexico’s biggest domestic lenders Banco Azteca which is sitting on a growing mountain of dollar bills. But the bank’s owner Ricardo Salinas Pliego is Mexico’s second richest man and wields a lot of influence particularly with Mexico’s current government. Three weeks ago the government unveiled a new draft law that will force Bank of Mexico (Banxico for short) to become <u>the buyer of last resort</u> of U.S. dollars that commercial banks cannot return to their country of origin. Banxico would be forced to buy those paper dollars regardless of how these banks had obtained them.

Defenders of the law say it would help Mexicans shut out of the financial system such as illegal migrants and hospitality sector workers paid in dollars to save cash. They also argue that it is necessary after a crackdown on money laundering in the US led some U.S. banks to cut ties with their Mexican counterparts which are now struggling to offload their surplus paper dollars.

But the law’s critics including Banxico’s Deputy Governor Jonathan Heath argue that it could undermine the central bank’s independence and risked tarnishing Mexico’s reputation with international financial authorities. Plus it is only really intended to benefit one bank: Banco Azteca.

“There are plenty of arguments against the proposed central bank reforms” tweeted Heath. “One of the most important is that it’s wrong to change the law only for the sake of one company especially one that has already had a run in with the SEC.”

In 2005 Salinas Pliego delisted two of his companies Elektra and TV Azteca from the U.S. after settling fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission without admitting wrongdoing. In 2011 the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency investigated Banco Azteca’s ties with its then-correspondent bank in the U.S. Lone Star National Bank and unearthed numerous money laundering risks which led Lone Star to sever its ties with Azteca.

Since then Azteca has been without a correspondent bank in the U.S. and has been unable to offload hundreds of millions of cash dollars according to the newspaper Proceso. But that could all change if the proposed central banking reform becomes law. The draft ruling has already passed the Mexican Senate but its final passage has been held up by a storm of protest not only from Banxico but also from other banks in the country as well as overseas financial institutions.

Moody’s warned that the reform would be “credit negative” for Mexico’s sovereign debt because it would compromise the bank’s autonomy in a country that underperforms on rule of law. Mexico currently only complies with 5 of the 40 recommendations issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog says the head of Mexico’s Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) Santiago Nieto Castillo.

Given the power of organized crime in Mexico Banxico is loath to buy commercial banks’ surplus foreign cash without being able to verify its source of origin. Not only would it make it easier for the proceeds of illicit transactions to flow into Mexico’s financial system; it would mean they could end up forming part of Banxico’s international reserves. And that could expose the central bank to money laundering sanctions and even disruptions to its dollar swap lines with the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Most members of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s Morena party still believe the reform is worth pursuing ostensibly to help Mexican migrants get dollars into the banking system. Yet according to Banxico which tracks money entering Mexico from overseas 99.3% of remittances arrive electronically meaning that less than 1% arrive in the form of cash.

On Thursday Mexico’s finance minister raised an additional objection: the draft bill “would only transfer the problem commercial banks have to the central bank because the central bank would have the same problem: how to export dollars.”

But the law’s backers have a solid majority in both branches of Congress. And they seem determined to use it.

“We are going to approve the law. This we want to make clear” said Mexican senator Alejandro Armenta who heads the senate’s finance committee. “We cannot put the concerns of the financial system at the center of our interests while the population suffers from the problem of exchanging dollars when they return from the United States after working and leaving their families. We have to find a balance.”

The senator added that the bill will pass in February and will include amendments to ensure that it does not facilitate money laundering.

“What is their use if the reserves are just saved sitting in vaults or as electronic data? The Bank of Mexico is one of the country’s institutions that has to adapt to the changes that the country needs” he said.

Some of the law’s most strident opponents warn that its real purpose — as depicted by Armenta’s words — is as a trial balloon to gauge the reaction of monetary authorities and investors both within Mexico and beyond to government moves against Banxico’s independence. What Mexico’s cash-strapped government really covets they claim is Banxico’s $194 billion of foreign currency reserves — and they are mostly assets in electronic form such as US Treasury securities that can be easily sold globally.

The government they say has already exhausted most of its financial buffers during this year’s virus crisis. Yet it needs to find more money to maintain its social welfare programs and continue supporting struggling state-owned oil giant Pemex. And the last thing it wants to do is to significantly increase Mexico’s public debt load which would make the economy more vulnerable to macroeconomic risks. Hence the move by the government on Banxico’s reserves.

The dollar’s share of global reserve currencies declined again. But other options are also shaky. Central banks are leery of the Chinese RMB and its share is still irrelevant. The euro’s share is stuck. But the yen’s share has been rising. Read… US Dollar as “Global Reserve Currency” amid Fed’s QE and US Government Deficits: Dollar Hegemony in Decline

The United States has added a Cuban bank to its restricted entities list alleging that the financial institution has ties to the Cuban military and its profits help fund the country’s “interference” in Venezuela.

In a statement on Friday the US State Department said it was adding Banco Financiero International SA (BFI) to the Cuba Restricted List a list of entities that the US alleges have ties to the Cuban military intelligence or security services.

Anyone subject to the US jurisdiction is prohibited from engaging in financial transactions with institutions on the list.

“Adding BFI to the Cuba Restricted List furthers the Administration’s goal of preventing the Cuban military from controlling and benefiting from financial transactions that should instead benefit the Cuban people” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in the statement.

Cuba’s foreign minister Bruno Rodriguez rejected the announcement tweeting on Friday that it was a “punitive measure of #US State Department to tighten blockade against #Cuba”.

“The inclusion of Cuban entities in its lists is intended to reinforce an economic siege that has failed to destroy the Cuban Revolution after 62 years” Rodriguez wrote.

I reject new punitive measure of #US State Department to tighten blockade against #Cuba. The inclusion of Cuban entities in its lists is intended to reinforce an economic siege that has failed to destroy the Cuban Revolution after 62 years. — Bruno Rodríguez P (@BrunoRguezP) January 1 2021

The move comes after the US media reported that President Donald Trump’s outgoing administration is mulling whether to designate Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism in its final days in office.

The New York Times said the State Department has drawn up a proposal but it was unclear whether Pompeo would sign off on it.

US Congressman Gregory Meeks the incoming chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee has warned Pompeo against making the terrorism designation saying it aims to “tie the hands” of incoming US President-elect Joe Biden.

“This would clearly be another stunt by President Trump and Pompeo” Meeks said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on “potential deliberations regarding designations”.

Biden policy shift

Biden who is set to be inaugurated on January 20 plans to move Washington closer to normalised relations with Havana Bloomberg reported earlier this month.

That includes easing restrictions on travel investment and remittances as well as reversing many of the sanctions and other regulations imposed by the Trump administration Bloomberg said citing people familiar with the discussions.

Biden served as vice president when the US and Cuba agreed to restore diplomatic relations.

“Today the US is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba” then-President Barack Obama said in December 2014 when the move was announced.

“We’ll begin to normalise relations between our two nations. Through these changes we intend to create more opportunities for the American and Cuban people and begin a new chapter.”

Obama later visited Cuba in 2016 – the first such trip by a sitting US leader in nearly 90 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXcteWVhcnMtZGF5LTIwMjAtd2hpY2gtYmFua3MtYXJlLW9wZW4tYmFua2luZy1ob3Vycy0xNTU4MjU20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Banks Open on New Year's Day 2020?

Some Pueblo County residents have been approved for unemployment benefits in recent weeks and informed of their acceptance into the state unemployment insurance program from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

Some have already received their U.S. Bank ReliaCard — the bank card used by CDLE to transfer unemployment benefit funds to Coloradans who qualify for the program — in the mail.

The only problem? Several of those who've received them are currently not unemployed. They never filed for benefits with the state and are targets of a scam that’s on the rise across the state.

Since Christmas the Pueblo County Sheriff’s Office has responded to at least four incidents in which a citizen was either notified their unemployment insurance claim had been approved contacted by the Human Resources department at their place of employment to ask if they’d recently filed a claim or received a ReliaCard in the mail.

Incident reports from the Pueblo Police Department show a similar trend. Pueblo PD responded to three unemployment fraud claims on Tuesday alone.

Those who’ve recently been targeted are just a few of the victims in an increasingly prevalent statewide scam.

Sgt. Rick Rhodes a detective with the Pueblo County Sheriff’s Office said this type of fraud has been going on throughout the pandemic but seems to have picked up in recent months.

“It’s actually getting pretty bad” Rhodes said.

Rhodes said because the CDLE has transitioned to mostly automated online unemployment services in recent months criminals who obtain a person’s Social Security number often are able to file an unemployment claim online.

Because a UI claim requires the claimant to file payment requests even after their ReliaCards are sent in the mail which are sent to the address listed to the claimant’s Social Security number Rhodes said he’s unsure what those perpetrating the scam have to gain.

He said that in the cases the PCSO has investigated so far the victims have not actually lost any money through the scam but noted “they still need to protect themselves.”

“They should put a fraud alert on their Social Security number with TransUnion and the other credit bureaus so if anyone does anything with their Social Security number it alerts them” Rhodes said.

And if someone does receive a U.S. Bank ReliaCard or other notification their unemployment benefits have been approved when they did not file a claim they should immediately contact CDLE.

In August CDLE issued a statement saying the department has seen a notable increase “in reports from individuals who never filed for unemployment receiving a ReliaCard in the mail.”

The department outlined five steps individuals should take to report suspected fraud and protect their information:

Deactivate the card by calling U.S. Bank at 1-855-279-1678.

Contact the three consumer credit bureaus and put a fraud alert on your name and Social Security number (SSN). Regularly review your credit reports from each of the three credit bureaus.

File a police report.

Report identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission at identitytheft.gov.

Create a file where you can keep any records relating to this identity theft in one central place in case you are notified of other fraud or breaches of your personal information.

NBC affiliate WBBH-TV said the incident took place Thursday morning at the Gulf Coast Town Center in Fort Myers.

The man involved told Lee County Sheriff’s deputies he was waiting outside for 30 minutes when a car matching the description of his Uber ride arrived.

The victim and the new driver got into an argument about his wait when the driver allegedly got out of the car and went to the trunk before pulling out a gun. The victim ran from the scene and called 911 from a nearby bar.

The driver spoke mostly Spanish during the incident according to the victim. Deputies say there were no witnesses and cameras may have captured images of the car involved but not the alleged argument.

That’s a new one.

Chicago rapper Lil Reese mistakenly leftover $20000 in his uber ride. The rapper took to his Instagram to share the entire experience. “Can’t believe I just left $20K plus in Uber bro” he posted with multiple mad emojis.

Fans were in the comments taunting Lil Reese for being irresponsible and predicting that the Uber driver would not return the $20000.

Usually when you leave something in an uber the driver would have no issue dropping the item back off to you. Luckily this was the case for Lil Reese and hours later he gave his fans an update on the cash. “He brong that 20K plus back f*ck yall mean.”

Lil Reese did not make mention if he rewarded the driver for giving his money back but Lil Reese’s fans let it be known that if they were in the situation they would not have returned the cash. “You mean to tell me a Uber driver had 20K in his backseat from Lil Reese hahaha sorry I’m moving out of chiraq you taking that L n*gga” one fan commented.

“If I was the driver. Then Lil Reese just lost 20k. That ain’t even hard” another fan commented.

Another fan was more concerned with the rapper being in the Uber in the first place “Lil Reese say he left $20K in his uber. Aint no way I got 20K on me & I’m in the back of a uber OnGod” he tweeted.

Hopefully Lil Reese did reward the uber driver for his good deed. Would you have given the money back?

As you can tell the ingredient's got a lot of different names and some people even consider it a straight-up godsend for any number of hair struggles (think: fine or finning hair dullness dryness the works). But because you can't believe everything you read on the internet (I've definitely made that mistake once or twice and totally paid the price) I turned to board-certified dermatologist Dhaval G. Bhanusali MD to figure out what black seed oil can really do for your hair (and you know what it can't).

Ahead everything you need to know about using black seed oil for hair straight from an expert.

Is black seed oil good for hair?

The reason you might see or hear black seed oil come up in conversation when you get to talking about hair-growth remedies is that the ingredient contains an antihistamine called thymoquinone. But is there enough evidence to support black seed oil as a hair-growth treatment? According to Dr. Bhanusali not quite. ""I haven't come across any good literature to support the effects on hair growth specifically"" says Dr. Bhanusali.

But not all hope is lost! ""There has been evidence that there may be a role for the seed as an anti-inflammatory anti-fungal and antibacterial agent. In theory if there was hair loss due to a condition like seborrheic dermatitis it may aid in treating the condition and allowing the hair to grow in once the pathology is resolved."" Not sure what specifically is causing your hair loss? Chat with a dermatologist or trichologist before you start testing out black seed oil.

BTW: Those anti-inflammatory benefits is what makes black seed oil a pretty effective scalp-soother too. Just massage a couple drops through your scalp and it can help relieve irritation or tension pre-cleansing or conditioning. Pretty cool right?

What are the side effects of taking black seed oil?

First of all if you do plan on trying black seed oil for hair growth or benefits Dr. Bhanusali recommends applying it to your hair rather than taking it as a hair supplement. ""Whether medicinal treatments or otherwise I tend to like topical application to minimize risk for systemic side effects"" Dr. Bhanusali explains. And remember: Supplements aren't FDA-regulated so before experimenting on your own by adding anything new to your routine run it by your doctor first k?

But even if you do apply black seed oil topically there's still a chance you could have a less than ideal response to it. ""With anything irritation or allergic contact dermatitis is possible"" Dr. Bhanusali says adding that it's always best to first spot test it and then expand from there. If you decide to use the essential oil in pure form rather than using it in a pre-blended hair or skin product Dr. Bhanusali recommends diluting it (same goes for any potent oil BTW) at least until you know your skin can handle it.

How long does it take to see results from black seed oil?

From there take regular photos (every three to four weeks) to track your results because any changes you might see will be subtle and gradual. According to Dr. Bhanusali it usually takes three to four months to see visible results for non-RX options so patience is key. ""If you hit a plateau or you aren't getting growth I will always recommend seeing your friendly board-certified dermatologist who can explore the causes of hair loss and put you on a regimen to get you back on track"" says Dr. Bhanusali.

The takeaway

If you've tempered your expectations and accepted the fact that black seed oil probably isn't going to give you super-long hair overnight and you still want to give it a try just be sure to test it first in a small area to make sure you tolerate it well before applying it all over (the same goes for any new treatment). And if you really want to figure out what's going on with your hair growth and address any hair loss make an appointment with a trichologist or dermatologist to find the right remedy for you.

Actress Mindy Cohn first stole our hearts as the confident teenager Natalie Green in the sitcom ""The Facts of Life."" Despite having a big figure Green didn't succumb to the pressures of her peers and was famous for proudly embracing life as a plus-size.

Since the show ended in May 1988 Cohn has maintained that self-reliant energy as she continued to rise through the ranks in Hollywood and live life on her own terms.

SHE LOOKS UNRECOGNIZABLE

On October 23 Cohn warmed fans' hearts with a vibrant photo of her shopping in a branch of Ulta Beauty posing in the section that showed the Beekman 1802 collection.

In 2011 Cohn shocked the world when she revealed her breast cancer diagnosis after five years of privately battling the health problem.

COHN'S CAREER AND PERSONAL LIFE

The talented actress was born on May 20 1966 in Los Angeles. She was the surrogate daughter of actress Charlotte Rae who discovered her talent. Rae stumbled on Cohn when she and the show's producers visited Harvard-Westlake School for research and noticed a young Cohn entertaining her friends.

Rae took her under her wings and helped put her on the path that her career is now. Her stellar performance on the show earned Cohn the No. 43 spot on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Kid Stars.

HER BREAST CANCER BATTLE

In 2011 Cohn shocked the world when she revealed her breast cancer diagnosis after five years of privately battling the health problem. The 54-year-old recalled the diagnosis saying she called her agent and told him she needed to stop working for at least one year and get away to heal better.

At the time of the revelation Cohn admitted that she was already undergoing chemotherapy radiation and had undergone a double mastectomy.

However she credited her fast recovery to Josh Kilmer-Purcell and Dr. Brent Ridge of ""The Fabulous Beeker Boys."" She recalled that while residing on their farm and feeding the animals she felt stronger and healthier.

""THE FACTS OF LIFE"" TRIVIA

Although the NBC sitcom aired more than 40 years ago it managed to break the ceiling by attaining some progressive heights. It was the first show to have an all-female main cast and the first featuring a disabled person. In season 2 comedian Geri Jewell starred in the show as Blair's cousin.

Unknown to many most of the show's characters were named after real people in Rae's life and late ""Growing Pains"" actor Alan Thicke wrote the sitcom's theme song.",,,,,,

Colorado Midland & Pacific Railway files to operate Tennessee Pass Line - by Tara Flanagan,"Will trains rumble through Chaffee County and over Tennessee Pass again? Do the communities between Cañon City and Eagle need and want them – particularly their environmental impacts?

A subsidiary of the Rio Grande Pacific Corporation is now in a commercial agreement with the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) for the majority of the Tennessee Pass Line the former Denver & Rio Grande Western line that has been sitting dormant since 1997. The route entails 163 miles from Cañon City to just past Eagle. In railroad parlance those are the Parkdale and Sage stations.

Colorado Midland & Pacific Railway Company (CMP) filed on Dec. 31 for common-carrier authority to operate the line with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) the federal agency that regulates railroads.

None of this guarantees that trains will once again polish the rails hereabouts. CMP says that it now plans to turn to the communities and policy makers along the way to take their temperatures regarding next steps.

The process is a “long arc” according to CMP spokesperson Sara Cassidy.

Indeed CMP may see open arms among the contingent that would like to see passenger service delivering tourists to the high country and possibly employees from Lake County into the resorts of Eagle County.

But the company can expect to see pushback from those who aren’t keen on the possibility of freight trains and what they might carry through places like Browns Canyon in Chaffee County. Claiming that the trains could eventually transport substantial amounts of crude oil through Browns Canyon and other environmentally sensitive areas the Friends of Browns Canyon organization is urging people to review and comment on a draft environmental impact statement on Utah’s Uinta Basin Railway – which could have connections to Tennessee Pass.

Environmentalists are also unhappy about the August 2020 rule from the Trump administration that relaxed guidelines for transporting liquefied natural gas creating the remote but thought-provoking possibility of “bomb trains” that could level entire cities. Ergo discussions about freight trains may now be more explosive so to speak.

The Dec. 31 filing with the Surface Transportation Board means that a much smaller suitor for Tennessee Pass KCVN and Colorado Pacific Railroad lost its bid for the line prompting a sigh among some railroad watchers who wanted to see the operation succeed in connecting lines to ship grain and mining commodities to the West Coast.

As part of that arrangement Stefan Soloviev who controls Colorado Pacific proposes to restore daily passenger service between Pueblo and Minturn. Soloviev had already taken over the old 122-mile Towner Line in eastern Colorado. The Towner connects Soloviev’s elevators in southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado to rail lines east of Pueblo. Acquiring the Tennessee Pass Line would have provided a shortcut through the mountains to the west.

The STB rejected without prejudice in March an $8.8 million attempt by Colorado Pacific to purchase the Tennessee Pass Line at liquidation value from UP. The “without prejudice” designation meant Colorado Pacific could file again.

Soloviev’s Colorado Pacific made moves to garner support for a second bid with the STB including letters to chairs of county commissioner boards and other parties outlining plans to add passenger service into its plans which would meet the “statutory test for public convenience and necessity” which the STB said had been lacking from Colorado Pacific’s earlier bid. There was also mention of an easement for trails.

But at the same time Union Pacific said it had been in negotiations with Rio Grande Pacific in a deal that could restore service to Tennessee Pass. Ultimately that plan came forward in CMP’s Dec. 31 filing.

Supporters of the smaller railroad say that whereas Soloviev has a plan of action they speculate that CMP may not get anywhere with passenger or freight service each of which is a possibility as CMP begins to reach out to communities along the route.

Critics say the local rails are a very possible conduit for transporting oil shale resources from Utah’s Uintah Basin. Rio Grande Pacific operates short-line railroads including the A-Train commuter service of Denton Texas and has been involved in an effort to build the Uinta Basin Railway to transport the waxy crude from northeastern Utah to existing rail lines.

The deposits hold an estimated 300 billion gallons of oil – some of the largest oil-shale resources in the world. Environmental groups are fighting development.

It should be pointed out that oil shale is not the same as shale oil (typically accessed through fracking) in that oil shale is basically rock that contains kerogen which is used to make oil. The reserves in the Uintah Basin are generally considered low quality but of possible interest if the right technology and economics play out.

“They’re betting on an oil play” speculated Salida’s Forrest Whitman a former Gilpin County commissioner current railroad enthusiast and vice chair of Chaffee County’s Transportation Advisory Board. “You never really know; it might help get them (CMP) investors.”

Whitman said the railroad blogosphere “lit up” after the Dec. 31 announcement with “a wide range of reactions.”

As someone who loves to ride trains he said the notion of passenger service sweetens the appeal. “They couldn’t possibly make money on it” he said but admitted he liked “the idea of getting on a train from Salida to Glenwood then picking up the California Zephyr.”

He said the future conversations with CMP will be interesting. “Certainly we’ve got a rail segment in there” he said regarding Chaffee County’s master plan. “We talk about what it could be.”

As of now the upcoming discussions with communities remain open as to whether the operations would include passenger service freight or both. There’s also the possibility that nothing will transpire.

Cassidy said the next step is to start talking to communities to determine how much they need and want rail service which could have a significant impact on the movement of workers and tourists in Fremont Chaffee Lake and Eagle Counties.

She said Thursday’s filing was the culmination of more than seven years’ discussion as well as several dormant phases.

“This is the initial step in a long process” she said. She described the Tennessee Pass move as “bringing a new option to the table” and “being a part of the conversation without overriding it.”

Cassidy said there have been numerous parties looking at the Tennessee Pass over the years. Given the typically slow speed of regulatory processes and the amount of restorative work the rails would require Cassidy wouldn’t speculate on how long it would take to actually run trains again.

It has been a long while since trains came through Chaffee County. The last passenger train departed from Salida in July 1967.

Freight service took quite a bit longer to go away. In 1984 Philip Anschutz acquired Rio Grande Industries Inc. the Denver & Rio Grande Western’s holding company which bought the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1988. Southern Pacific merged with Union Pacific in 1996 and that same year Union Pacific filed to discontinue the 173-mile Tennessee Pass Line.

The tracks were taken out of service but were left in place and not officially abandoned.

Most U.S. investors had a lot of winners in their portfolios this year but some stocks certainly performed better than others.

Here’s a look at the 10 worst-performing stocks in the entire S&P 500 in 2019 as of the Dec. 29 closing price.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY)

Investors will notice a common theme among these worst-performing stocks. Travel restrictions and economic shutdowns crushed oil industry demand and oil stocks in 2020 and Occidental was the hardest-hit in the group. The stock dropped 57.7% in 2020 more than any other S&P 500 stock.

Carnival Corp (NYSE: CCL)

The travel and leisure industries have been hit nearly as hard as the oil industry in 2020. Carnival’s cruises have been shut down completely for most of 2020 and will likely remain shut down for at least a couple of months in 2021 as well. The stock dropped 57.2% in 2020.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NCLH)

Norwegian shares dropped a nearly identical 56.2% in 2020 for nearly identical reasons Carnival shares lagged.

10 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Of 2020

TechnipFMC PLC (NYSE: FTI)

The oil services group struggled in 2020 but offshore oil projects were hit especially hard due to their higher associated costs. Shares of offshore service provider TechnipFMC dropped 56.1% in 2020.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO)

It may seem redundant but no travel or industrial demand coupled with record-low oil prices is bad news for oil stocks like Marathon which is down 51.1% in 2020.

HollyFrontier Corp (NYSE: HFC)

Add refiner HollyFrontier to the growing list of battered energy stocks in 2020. The stock is down 50.2% year-to-date.

The study was conducted in the seven districts of Dodoma region: Dodoma Municipal council Bahi Chamwino Kondoa Mpwapwa Kongwa and Chemba. The region was selected because the CHF Iliyoboreshwa was implemented there before a wider roll out to other regions in the country. Dodoma region is the administrative capital of the United Republic of Tanzania. The region is the 8th most populous in Tanzania with a population of 2083588. Dodoma urban (410956) and Chamwino (330 543) are the most populated districts while Bahi (221645) and Chemba (235711) are the least populated. Subsistence farming and livestock keeping are the main livelihood activities.

By 2015 the region had 360 health facilities providing health services [38]. Accessing health facility services was highly dependent on out of pocket payments with little contribution from health insurance schemes. At the time of the study about 15.9% of the households were enrolled in CHF Iliyoboreshwa a rate that was considerably below what was expected by its initiators and implementers. Bahi district had the highest enrollment (25.3%) followed by Chamwino (25%) and the lowest was Dodoma Municipal council (8.6%). Implemented by the council authorities of the seven districts with support from the Health Promotion and System Strengthening (HPSS) project the Redesigned CHF program reformed the original CHF to make it a viable social health insurance scheme [15]. The program described in detail elsewhere [15 37] comprised reforms across administrative governance and health service provision structures and management of enrolment outcomes. In the reformed scheme the CHF management teams (comprising CHF manager accountant Medical advisor District Medical officer District planning officer District Treasurer and District Community Development officer) were in charge of managing the scheme processes and the council health management team (CHMT) under the leadership of the District Medical officer were in charge of providing health services to the CHF clients. The district leaders such as the District commissioner The District chairperson (Mayor) District Executive Director and Councillors oversaw the implementation of the scheme in their areas of jurisdiction.

Study design

This paper is part of a broader study [19] that employed a concurrent mixed methods design [39] to assess the implementation processes of the Redesigned CHF at different levels of the district health system structures. The Good Reporting of A Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) framework for reporting mixed methods studies were followed in reporting the results for this study [40] (additional file 1). In this paper we focus specifically on implementation processes at the district level.

We adopted a mixed methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis to provide a more comprehensive picture of adoption fidelity and their modifiers. Based on the theory of intervention (TOI) developed by our team and described in detail elsewhere [19] we mapped the intervention district-level components to be followed up in the implementation assessment and grouped them into the following functions to facilitate analysis: 1) recruitment and training of program actors; (2) materials for the program; 3) remuneration of actors in the program; 4) monitoring progress; 5) addressing CHF benefits; 6) promotion to attract enrolments; and 7) addressing the quality of healthcare.

The quantitative component uses a multi-method approach employing a survey questionnaire and a document review checklist both aiming to identify to what extent certain processes were adopted carried out as planned and maintained as routine processes of the scheme and the influence of moderating factors.

Study sample

Sample for the quantitative component

The quantitative component of the study relied on a structured survey and a document review. The sample for the structured survey was drawn from district level implementers (N = 68) meaning the district CHF management team district health management team and policy leaders (such as District commissioner District executive director). The questionnaire was filled by all (census) concerned implementers.

The sample for document review checklist was drawn from documents from all seven districts in the region (N = 7). The documents that provided data for the study are: (i) program reports; (ii) day to day communication about the program i.e. letters memos and meeting minutes; (iii) strategic and operational plans; (iv) redesigned CHF policy documents and by-laws; and (v) information from insurance information management system (IMIS) database.

Sample for the qualitative component

The qualitative sampling procedure was multilevel in nature whereby the sample comprised 39 key informants purposively selected at regional and at district level. Participants ranged from regional leaders technical advisors for the CHF district leaders (public administrators and elected leaders) to frontline implementers (CHF officers and enrolment officers).

The respondents at regional level were selected based on their capacity and position to provide information related to the support given to the districts in implementing the CHF scheme but also their knowledge on contextual influencers of the implementation process. The respondents at the regional level included the regional secretariat members (N = 7) and the development partners operating at regional level (N = 6).

Respondents from district levels were selected based on their experiences with the redesigned CHF their position in the scheme and the expected knowledge they had about the scheme processes. They came from three districts: D3 D4 and D6 which had high average and low enrolment rates respectively in relation to the baseline values since the start of the CHF Iliyoboreshwa. The respondents at the district level included district leaders (N = 8) such as District commissioner and frontline implementers (N = 18) such as CHF manager accountant and CHF officers. The frontline implementers were included in this part of the study to verify the information provided at district level in terms of the support provided to the village level actors.

Data collection instruments and procedures

The first author managed data collection directly with support from a small team of trained research assistants who were recruited based on their level of training (mostly bachelor’s and master’s students in sociology anthropology public health development studies and rural development) and their experiences in conducting public health research.

Quantitative data

Questionnaire

We used a questionnaire (additional file 2) to collect data related to implementation outcomes focusing mainly on the adoption and FOI of the program components such as the recruitment and the training of program actors and materials for the program as reflected in our TOI. The questions on the adoption of the scheme focused on the functionality of Redesigned CHF structures and the usability of the guidelines in daily routines. FOI questions captured adherence to or departures from the CHF standard operating procedures (CHF-SOP) and the probable related moderating factors. The questionnaire was composed of yes/no and Likert scale questions. To ensure validity and reliability of our questionnaire 1) Development of the questionnaire was based on our theory of intervention 2) The questionnaire was discussed among the authors to agree on how the questions are constructed to improve the face validity 3) The questionnaire by the authors together with the trained research assistants 3) Principal component analysis was employed to ascertain key constructs and come up with scales and subscales 4) Cronbach’s alphas of each of the formulated scales were determined as an indication of consistency within the scales. Cronbach’s alpha of at least 0.7 was considered acceptable to measure the internal consistency of each of the scales and sub-scales [41].

Document review checklist

We used a checklist to extract data from the documents relevant to the scheme adoption and implementation (additional file 3). The checklist aimed at extracting numerical information that could quantify districts’ adoption and FOI based on the redesigned CHF original plan.

Qualitative data

We used a semi-structured in-depth interview guide to collect qualitative data from the participants. The interview guide aimed to collect experiences and opinion related to the implementation processes and the contextual influencers at the district level (see additional file 4). The interviews were conducted in Kiswahili recorded verbatim transcribed and translated to English by professional translators. The first author checked all the transcribed translations for accuracy.

Data analysis

Quantitative analysis

Data from the survey questionnaire

To understand the implementation outcomes and their moderators as reported by participants in the survey we had first to define and measure the outcome and explanatory variables before proceeding to statistical analyses. The outcome variables included in our study were: adoption and FOI.

In line with our previous work [19] we measured adoption as the presence or absence of and functioning of the redesigned CHF structures availability status and use of guidelines and related processes and job description. The structures considered include CHF governing board CHF management teams and the conduct of the scheduled or ad hoc meetings of these structures.

We measured FOI as adherence to the program model as originally stipulated in the Redesigned CHF standard operating procedures (CHF-SOP) and related operational document such as planning manuals supervision guidelines (movement plans) and financial management guidelines. To measure FOI we assessed adherence to procedures related to the seven functions of the redesigned CHF reflected in our TOI.

The questionnaire consisted of several items related to each of the outcome variables (adoption and FOI). To provide a clear picture about larger theoretical constructs under study and not to focus on single items included in the questionnaire not meaningful in and out of themselves composite indices were calculated based on an unweighted sum of scores of the items. Items with high face validity that measure the same construct were selected [42]. Thereafter a composite score (sub-scale) or index was obtained from the sum scores of the items. Sub-scales related to adoption were adoption of CHF structures adoption of CHF guidelines and adoption of the CHF processes and adoption of job-description.

Subscales related to FOI (measured as adherence) were 1) recruitment and training; (2) materials for the program; 3) remuneration of actors; 4) monitoring progress; 5) addressing CHF benefits; 6) promotion to attract enrolments; and 7) addressing the quality of health care.

It is worth to note that overall indices (composite scores) for adoption and FOI were obtained as sum scores of the sub-scales related to the adoption and FOI respectively.

Thereafter using the median as a cut off point adoption and FOI indices were categorized into high and low scores.

Explanatory variables here also called “modifiers of the implementation outcomes” were socio-demographic factors (Age categorized into <=40 years and > 40 year Sex categorized as male and female Occupation categorized as CHF service providers CHF fund managers and others Level of education categorized as secondary and below and post secondary and years of schooling categorized as <=15 years and > 15 years) Time worked in the scheme categorized as <= 20 months and > 20 months and Time stayed in the district categorized as <=7 years and > 7 years.

In our statistical analyses we were aided by STATA version 13 (STATA Corporation College Station TX USA) through which both descriptive and detailed analysis techniques to determine the relationship between variables were applied.

Descriptive analysis based on frequency percentages and measures of central tendency or dispersion (mean median or standard deviation and range) were used to understand the situation related to the adoption and implementation of the scheme. We used a chi-square test to determine the association between implementation outcomes and modifiers and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The unit of analysis were the respondents of the questionnaire.

Data from the document review checklist

The document review checklist consisted of several items grouped together per theoretical constructs intended to be measured. We assigned an arbitrary weight of score to each item. The weight scores were from 1 to 10 (or 10–100 in percentage). The summation of each item score lead to a composite variable namely adoption and FOI index for adoption items and FOI items respectively. The analysis of data from the document review was mainly descriptive with an explanatory component in the qualitative part of the study. We conducted descriptive analysis based on frequency percentages and measures of central tendency or dispersion (mean median or standard deviation and range) to understand the situation related to the adoption and implementation of the scheme. The unit of analysis were the districts.

Qualitative analysis

Qualitative data analysis was carried out by two independent researchers (the first two authors) and utilized the framework method [43] assisted by the N-Vivo software (QRS-international). The framework method as described by Gale et al. [43] was applied to analyse the transcribed material. The framework method is flexible and follows step-by-step interconnected stages that guide the analytical process. Coding started after multiple reading of the transcripts. It started deductively based on predetermined theoretical constructs based on our TOI followed by the addition of emerging codes as they emerged from the transcripts. The codes were applied to capture the adoption and fidelity of implementation of the scheme and the factors shaping these experiences also as explanatory to the district level implementation outcomes as determined in the quantitative document review checklist.

Integrated interpretation

The integration of quantitative and qualitative findings occurred at the interpretation level using a triangulation approach [39 44 45]. We investigated where the findings converged offered complementary information or appeared to contradict one another. Integration allowed us to develop a composite holistic and cross-validated picture of the facts based on the results from both quantitative and qualitative datasets. This process of integration took place after the completion of data analysis and entailed identifying similarities and differences merging the results and discussing the meaning of the integrated results across the two levels of analysis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZnR2b2ljZS5vcmcvNjIteWVhcnMtYWZ0ZXItdGhlLXJldm9sdXRpb24td2hhdC1hcmUtdGhlLXBlcnNwZWN0aXZlcy1mb3ItY3ViYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,62 Years after the Revolution: What Are the Perspectives for Cuba?,"January 1 was the 62nd anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. The government of Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel is celebrating with austerity and economic opening. This is opening lots of debates about perspectives.

January 1 was another anniversary of the 1959 revolution — the first socialist revolution in Latin America. Sixty-two years after those great historical events Cuba is entering a new stage. In the midst of the economic crisis unleashed by the pandemic which reduced tourism levels by half and the economic blockade tightened by President Trump since he took office in 2017 the government of Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel announced a series of economic measures in early December that open up a new period for the country.

There are two central characteristics of this new period: on the one hand there is severe austerity for the working masses in the form of inflation and cuts in “undue subsidies and free services” as the government cynically calls them. These measures will probably increase unemployment. On the other hand there is a new battery of measures to “attract foreign investment” and strengthen the so-called private sector the small and medium-sized merchants and businesspeople who employ nor more than a few dozen people.

The “Ordering Task” is the most important economic plan to be launched since Díaz-Canel assumed office in 2018. Taken as a whole and as part of the pro-market reforms initiated by Raúl Castro in 2010–11 it is a further step toward capitalist restoration. If completed this restoration will be a severe defeat not only for the heroic Cuban working class which resisted decades of imperialist intimidation but also for the leadership of the bureaucracy. It would be a blow for the working class and all the poor masses across Latin America and even beyond.

Capitalist restoration would entail the loss of historic gains like the nationalized economy with its centralized planning which — despite the blockade and bureaucratic mismanagement — allowed enormous social achievements such as the liquidation of illiteracy and hunger and the guarantee of full employment free and universal health care and high-quality education. Capitalist restoration would be a triumph for imperialism and the ruling classes of the entire continent.

In this critical framework old and new debates about the perspectives for Cuba have reopened. What is possible and what is necessary? There are a wide range of positions. This goes from openly reactionary ones that call for a more or less violent “regime change” — such proposals have been marginal for years though they were partially revived in the Trump era. It includes liberal positions that are very widespread and call for continuing the reforms while accepting the bureaucracy as a valid interlocutor. This line was in general the one pursued by Barack Obama during his presidency (2009–17) under the auspices of the Vatican and Pope Francis. This policy seeks to build bridges with the top bureaucracy of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) whose strategy aims at capitalist restoration (under the euphemism of “updating Cuban socialism”) in the style of China or Vietnam.

As part of this strategy the Catholic Church — counterrevolutionary organization par excellence — and other churches have enjoyed complete freedom to organize publish and spread their ideas in Cuba for years. They even have several seats in the National Assembly. This was seen especially in 2018 when all the congregations carried out a massive campaign against the inclusion of the elementary democratic right to marriage equality in the new constitution. That was eventually postponed and is set to be put to a referendum in mid-2021.

There are already countless positions on the Left both inside and outside Cuba. Many are still confident that the one-party regime can reform itself getting rid of authoritarianism bureaucratism and “other evils.” It could then open a discussion with the politically active population about how to resolve the crisis. This vision is based on defending the revolution and its gains but at the same time defending the reactionary political regime.

This school of thought fails to see that the one-party regime is part of the problem. Imperialism and its puppets throughout the continent are not the only enemies of the revolution. Prohibiting the organization deliberation and publication of ideas by all people who defend the revolution — which today is only allowed for the PCC and the mass organizations it controls — is itself a threat to the revolution. Implementing austerity for the big majority while reaping benefits from foreign investment and maintaining the privileges of the bureaucracy is a threat to the revolution. Weakening the nationalized economy and the monopoly of foreign trade and introducing more and more market mechanisms threaten the revolution. Relying on liberal sectors and tendencies that aim to restore capitalism as Raúl Castro did during the Obama administration instead of relying on the working and poor masses supporting and developing their struggles throughout the continent also threatens the revolution.

It is not just a question of individual bureaucrats who are corrupt and authoritarian and want to enrich themselves. It is a political regime that is undermining the foundations of the workers’ state. This is similar to what happened to the great October Revolution as the regime established by Stalin began a policy of “peaceful coexistence” with imperialism and the construction of “socialism in a single country” (or a bloc of countries after the Second World War). The great Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky who until his assassination in 1940 fought the bureaucratization of the Soviet state defended the program of political revolution that would return power to the working class and its soviets as the only way to avoid capitalist restoration.

A defense of the revolution that places its hopes in the self-reform of the regime attempting to thus correct its most reactionary aspects is ultimately powerless because it maintains the essential aspect of the one-party regime: the control of the masses and the containment of the international revolution.

That is why we emphasize the need today more than ever of defending the gains of the revolution — primarily in confrontation with imperialism but inevitably also with the PCC bureaucracy which is entrenched in the state. For decades that bureaucracy has been forcing the masses to pay for the crises scrupulously maintaining its privileges associating itself with foreign capital and systematically degrading the nationalized economy planning the monopoly of foreign trade and other social gains.

We uphold the need for a political revolution that will put an end to the one-party regime and install a government of the workers and peasants based on self-organization and self-determination. This new regime would include broad workers’ democracy and freedom of organization for all people who defend the revolution. It would permit a revision of all the pro-market reforms and discussion about the economic and social measures necessary to solve Cuba’s crisis — a solution in the interests of the big majority and not of the bureaucratic elite the foreign companies or the new well-to-do sectors. Moreover such steps would be a huge boost to the massive struggles that have swept the continent in the last two years including the Chilean rebellion the struggle against the coup in Bolivia the massive mobilizations against racism and repression in the U.S. and the struggle in Colombia and Peru against austerity and corruption.

In this way it would be possible to halt the current restorationist course; to revitalize the great revolutionary process that began in 1959 and culminated in a socialist revolution; and to return to the place in the vanguard of the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist struggle of the exploited masses of Latin America.

by Olivia Murray

omurray@dominionpost.com

Local yoga studios have undergone significant changes to not only the number of students permitted in their classes but how their classes are conducted and even the demographics of clientele — all as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Three yoga studios in Morgantown — The Mindbody Center Morgantown Power Yoga and Inner Life Yoga Studio — have all been affected by the pandemic though the ways in which the virus has impacted these businesses differ.

Chase Hyson owner and operator of The Mindbody Center offers a variety of services including massage therapy and life coaching in addition to workout programs and yoga classes. Hyson said while some services offered at his studio have changed in compliance with COVID-19 regulations others have remained almost unaltered.

“[Yoga has] definitely been impacted because I’m not using the studio as much” Hyson said.

Hyson’s studio can host 20 people during a class but the number of people allowed in the building at once decreased in accordance with social distancing. As the pandemic wore on students began to feel uncomfortable with in-person attendance further contributing to the decline in people attending classes at the studio.

“People weren’t able to consecutively get their classes in and people kind of just stopped coming altogether except for maybe one or two people and at that point it’s not conducive to keep the class for one or two people” Hyson said.

Hyson explained the difficulty of altering his style of teaching in accordance with COVID-19 guidelines. He can no longer physically help his students adjust their positions or perform Thai Yoga Massages on them during class. “It’s changed the dynamic of the classes for sure” he said.

Hyson said he doesn’t teach yoga online. However Hyson’s business has still been functional as its other services have become more prominent. These services particularly massage therapy haven’t drastically changed Hyson said.

“A lot of [massage therapy] surrounds universal health care precautions and safety measures like clean linens [the cleaning] of equipment not touching a human body and then touching my face washing of hands clean nails things like that. People wear masks for massages and I offer a little paper mask that are easily disposable and I think maybe those are the easiest to breathe in” Hyson said.

It is because of the other services offered through Hyson’s multi-faceted business that The Mindbody Center has been successful despite the hardship of COVID-19 on the Morgantown area he said.

“Surprisingly I actually have thrived this year. My massage and coaching have went up because people are now more stressed” Hyson said.

While The Mindbody Center may have managed to survive the difficult situation another local yoga studio suffered.

Suhil Zia owner of Morgantown Power Yoga said his yoga studio was a large older building that lacked the potential for expansive ventilation and he made the decision to close his studio in March to protect himself his teachers and his students.

“It would not have been wise to practice yoga during [the outbreak of] a respiratory virus” Zia said.

Though Zia anticipated the pandemic would be under control quickly he does not regret his decision to close his studio.

“I would not have minded if I got sick. I just wouldn’t have felt good if I gave it to somebody else and they got hurt significantly or very seriously so that was the biggest part of the decision-making” Zia said.

Since the closure of his studio Zia has stayed involved in the Morgantown yoga community and has been able to use his knowledge and expand his skills by offering online classes and working with Inner Life Yoga Studio.

The transition to online classes was difficult for Zia. “It didn’t feel natural to me; it didn’t feel organic … it was very different” Zia said.

He said he did acclimate to the new online teaching environment.

At Inner Life Yoga Studio Zia teaches Thursday classes that differ stylistically from what he taught at his own studio. Inner Life uses the Iyengar yoga method an innovative form of yoga developed by B.K.S. Iyengar.

“I was actually a student of their studio for the last two years. I’ve been taking their workshops. I just really love that place I love the Iyengar method” Zia said.

Kimberly Williams CEO of Inner Life Yoga Studio said she and her co-owner husband are trying to make the necessary changes to their studio to keep their business afloat. The studio now offers online classes in addition to onsite classes and has expanded its teaching staff to include styles of yoga supplementary to the Iyengar method the studio was founded on.

“We brought Iyengar Yoga [to Morgantown] … we were students of [B.K.S. Iyengar] and we teach his style of yoga or at least we did for the last 25 years” Williams said.

The studio offers courses in mindfulness meditation and yoga therapy in addition to traditional yoga.

Inner Life too experienced a shutdown in March due to the statewide stay-at-home order implemented by Gov. Jim Justice. During the shutdown Williams and her coworkers conducted classes over Zoom which she said about “one-third” of her clientele attended.

The studio has since been able to reopen though there has been a significant loss of loyal but high-risk older students and the retirement of three teachers. Since reopening the studio has been adhering to COVID-19 guidelines by requiring face masks social distancing temperature checks and symptom screening for students upon arrival and handwashing before and after classes.

Williams said the process of replacing Iyengar Yoga instructors is difficult because the method requires five years of practice prior to beginning training as an instructor as well as an exam to gain certification. The training and certification process can sometimes take an additional five years to complete.

The owners of Inner Life were forced to examine ways in which they could keep their passion for yoga and their livelihood alive. Their landlord has been willing to accommodate the owners who did receive a West Virginia Cares Grant which they used to pay off some back rent while they reevaluate their business.

“We decided ‘OK we want to reach out to a younger population.’ A lot of the young people are doing what they call Vinyasa yoga … it’s more of an athletic workout but it’s also something that young people like to do. We teach that but it’s not our main thing” Williams said.

To attract a younger clientele to the studio Williams realized that meant incorporating more styles of yoga and bringing in younger teachers.

Bri D’Alessandro a student of Williams and an instructor of Monday classes at Inner Life expressed gratitude for the staff at Inner Life for mentoring her.

“I’m so lucky I’ve got an opportunity to work with Kimberly and be a part of the Inner Life teacher team and staff. There are a lot of amazing people that have helped support and allowed us to stay open despite COVID-19” D’Alessandro said.

Inner Life Yoga Studio has incorporated discount offers. Students of all ages — middle school high school and college — are eligible for a 25% discount. Teachers are also encouraged to take advantage of the 25% discount through Jan. 31 2021.

“Trying to get the word out that’s the challenge” Williams said.

“Amid the people’s economic hardships particularly in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic and despite serious corruption issues within its organization PhilHealth callously announced that effective January 2021 it will implement an increase in monthly premium contributions as provided in the Universal Health Care Law” HEAD said.

Starting this month the premium rate of PhilHealth members will increase to 3.50% of monthly basic salary from 3.00%in 2020.

Contributions of employed members shall be equally shared between employees and employers while those of self-paying members professional practitioners and land-based migrant workers and other direct contributors with no employee-employer relationship are computed straight based on their monthly earnings and paid wholly by the member.

Under the Universal Health Care (UHC) law the premium rate shall increase to increments of 0.5% every year starting 2021 until it reaches the 5% limit in 2025.

HEAD said it has since been raising serious objections to the insurance-based UHC Law with PhilHealth as its prime mover.

“HEAD has also since pointed out that the scheduled increases of up to 5% in premium contribution in the next seven years as mandated in the UHC Law will impact heavily on the people” it said.

“PhilHealth’s announcement of the increase in the premium contribution reflects the government's utter disregard to the people’s well-being” it added.

The group said that instead of alleviating the people’s economic hardships the government inflicts more burdens to the people by increasing PhilHealth premium contribution from last year’s 3% to 3.5% deduction to the members’ salary in 2021 — amounting to P350 to P2450 per month.

“The additional government’s exaction is sought by PhilHealth amid the scandals and various cases of fraud and graft and corruption that its top officials have been accused of and which had resulted in the exhaustion of [health insurance] funds” HEAD said.

During the Senate hearings on the PhilHealth case billions of pesos were reported lost to corruption.

Based on the testimony of a whistleblower during a Senate hearing HEAD said that in 2019 alone an estimated P15 billion of taxpayer's hard-money and premium contributions went to the pockets of its officials and their cohorts.

“For year 2021 71.4 billion of people’s money is again allotted to the corruption-riddled PhilHealth” the group said.

PhilHealth has since defended the contribution rate hike saying it is mandated under the UHC law and it will sustain the health care benefits for all Filipinos.

“HEAD calls on the Filipino people to demand the government to reject the increase of PhilHealth premium and denounce the practice of making the insurance corporation a milking cow for corrupt officials” the group said.

“HEAD also reiterates its call for the government to take full responsibility for the people’s health and address the crisis of corruption” it added.

The group also called for abolishment of PhilHealth and allocate its funds directly for public health state-run hospitals and health facilities.

“With bigger and better funding public health facilities can have more medical supplies and medicines and can provide free and quality out-patient services while bigger facilities like hospitals will have better and more complete diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities” it said.

HEAD also called for the development and strengthening of the public health care system that is integrated and tax-funded and that can provide free and comprehensive health care.

“Develop a health care system that is centrally planned and anchored on the principle that health is a basic right” it said. —LBG GMA News",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhLXNwZW5kcy1qdXN0LTEtMjYtZ2RwLXB1YmxpYy1oZWFsdGhjYXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India spends just 1.26% of GDP on public healthcare - The Sunday Guardian Live,"New Delhi: India is among the countries having the lowest public healthcare budget in the world with the public healthcare system in the country merely getting 1.26% of the total GDP.

Compare this with countries like the United Kingdom Netherlands New Zealand Finland and Australia where all these countries spend over 9% of their total GDP in public healthcare system while countries like the United States spends over 16% of their GDP in public healthcare and Japan Canada France Germany and Switzerland spend about 10% of their total GDP on public healthcare.

Even some of the developing countries of the world have more contribution towards the public healthcare system with regards to their GDP compared to India. For example Brazil has a total budget of over 8% of its total GDP towards public healthcare expenditure. Even neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan have over 3% of their GDP going towards public healthcare system.

The National Health Policy of 2017 recommends government expenditure on health to be increased to 2.5% of GDP by 2025 but that seems to be a distant dream still since to reach the set target limit the country needs to increase its health budget by 0.35% each year from now on. On the contrary between 2015-16 to 2020-21 there has just been a mere increase of 0.02% in the health budget in India.

The National Policy also recommended that expenditure on health by states should be increased to 8% or more of their budget by 2020 but looking at the budget of different states in 2020-21 none of the larger states have allocated 8% of their budget towards health. On an average the state governments in India have just allocated 5.4% of their total budget towards public health care system.

States like Andhra Pradesh Jharkhand Maharashtra Karnataka Haryana Bihar and Punjab has less allocated less than 5% of their total budget towards public healthcare between 2015-2021 financial year.

Even in the Healthcare Access and Quality Index released by the medical journal Lancet in 2018 India ranked 145th out of the 195 countries in terms of quality and accessibility to healthcare much lower than countries like China (48) Sri Lanka (71) and Bangladesh (133).

A high-level group on the health sector was constituted by the 15th Finance Commission in 2019 and headed by AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria.

The committee also noted that: “To meet the ambitious targets of improvement in health services there is a need for larger allocation of funds for the health sector in general. Not only is this a necessity because good health as a key enabler to a happy life is a goal in itself.”

Srinath Reddy President of the Public Health Foundation of India and who was also a member of the high-level group on the health sector constituted in 2019 told The Sunday Guardian: “The foremost lesson that this Covid-19 pandemic teaches us is that a healthcare system that is insufficiently resourced and suboptimal in performance cannot create a strong and swift response when challenged by a public health emergency. Even if it mobilises resources on a war-footing there is an opportunity cost to pay in terms of many other health services suffering neglect. And an efficient and equitable health system cannot be developed without adequate public financing. The commitment to deliver universal health coverage by 2030 is based on fulfilling the promise of raising public funding on health to at least 2.5% of the GDP from the present 1.2% by 2025 as promised by the government or even earlier as urged by public health experts. About 70% of this has to be allocated to primary healthcare.”

India’s per capita expenditure on public health has also been low for several years. According to the National Health Profile 2019 India’s per capita public expenditure on health in nominal terms is Rs 1657 (2018-19) which is much lower than countries like Sri Lanka where it is three times more and Indonesia where it is twice more than India.

The country has also been battling with shortages of doctors trained nurses and paramedics for years now. As on February this year India’s doctor-to-population ratio stands at 1:1404 while the WHO recommends the doctor-to-population ratio to be 1:1000.

For people in the rural India who are completely dependent on government healthcare facilities the doctor to patient ratio is abysmally low with 1:10926 doctors as per the National Health Profile 2019.

“India has severe shortages of the health workforce across several categories from specialist and basic doctors to nurses and allied health professionals. In 2016 WHO recommended that a country must have 44.5 health workers per 10000 population to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and deliver Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Currently we have half that number. Even those available are severely mal-distributed between states and across the urban-rural divide. I think technology-enabled community health workers nurses and other frontline care providers can perform many functions in primary care liberating us from an entirely doctor-dependant model. However more doctors will be needed including those trained in family medicine” Reddy told this newspaper."

Pero claro el Covid-19 hizo acto de presencia y el sector de la automoción no tuvo más remedio que tomar medidas paralizando la actividad industrial y comercial durante varios meses lo que provocó unas caídas drásticas en las matriculaciones de vehículos en nuestro país.

Un año para olvidar

Ahora con el paso al 2021 han salido publicados los datos relacionados con el cierre del pasado ejercicio en lo referido a las ventas de automóviles en España. Como era de esperar tal y como recogen desde Europa Press el desplome ha sido importante y es que el 2020 ha cerrado con volumen levemente superior a las 850.000 unidades lo que se traduce en una caída de más del 32% en comparación con los 125 millones de unidades matriculadas en 2019.

Pese a este descenso en el número de vehículos matriculados el último mes del año registró unos números prácticamente idénticos a los del ejercicio anterior pues las entregas de turismos y todoterrenos en España rozaron las 106.000 unidades es decir subieron un 01% en comparación con las 105.854 matriculaciones que tuvieron lugar en diciembre de 2019.

Con respecto a los vehículos comerciales ligeros el descenso en el pasado mes fue del 32% con casi 16.000 unidades matriculadas mientras que los vehículos industriales se conformaron con las 1.500 unidades lo que se traduce en un aumento de más del 3%. Al analizar el 2020 al completo los primeros han cerrado el año con 157.000 ejemplares y los segundos con 19.000 es decir han caído un 27 y un 22% respectivamente.

Análisis por canales

Por último pero no menos importante cabe destacar que el canal de firmas de alquiler de vehículos fue el que experimentó una mayor caída en las matriculaciones durante el 2020 pues las 96.000 unidades matriculadas representan un descenso de casi el 60%. Las ventas a clientes particulares se redujeron por encima del 27% con unos 427.000 ejemplares mientras que el canal de empresas cerró con una disminución superior al 24% con alrededor de 328.000 unidades al término de 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxldmVsdXAuY29tL25vdGljaWFzLzYwNTA4NC9NaWxsb25hcmlhcy12ZW50YXMtZGUtTGltaXRlZC1SdW4tR2FtZXMtcmV2ZWxhbi1xdWUtYXVuLWhheS1pbnRlcmVzLXBvci1qdWVnb3MtZmlzaWNvc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millonarias ventas de Limited Run Games revelan que aún hay interés por juegos físicos,"Editorial: Gaming / Facebook / Twitter / YouTube / Instagram / Noticias / Discord / Foros

El formato físico fue una de las principales medios de distribución de juegos en los albores de la industria del entretenimiento electrónico. Sin embargo con el paso de los años en la industria ha surgido la opción de comprar juegos completamente de forma digital que para muchos es una opción mucho mejor y que por consecuencia ha relegado la compra de videojuegos en caja. Sin embargo aún hay muchos entusiastas del formato tradicional y como prueba está Limited Run Games que compartió la millonaria cantidad de juegos físicos que ha vendido en años recientes.

Limited Run Games fue fundado en 2015 y tiene como meta mantener vigente el negocio de los videojuegos en formato físico que aunque parece que su popularidad va a la baja aún hay personas que prefieren este formato antes que el digital. Desde su establecimiento esta compañía no sólo se ha aliado con estudios indie para lanzar versiones físicas de juegos nuevos sino para hacer relanzamientos de títulos añejos dándoles así la posibilidad a muchos fans de tener una copia física de su juego favorito al igual que ediciones de colección muy llamativas que muchas veces se venden en exclusiva en esta tienda en línea.

Por si te lo perdiste: el juego mexicano Neon City Riders tuvo distribución física gracias a Limited Run Games.

Limited Run Games muestra que aún hay interés por el formato físico

Pues bien el fundador de Limited Run Games Josh Fairhust reveló que la compañía comenzó el año de gran manera ya que el primer día de 2021 superó la marca de los 2.5 millones de juegos en formato físico vendidos un logro que se consiguió en en el transcurso de los últimos 5 años.

“Sinceramente puedo decir que en 2015/2016 nunca pensé que alcanzaríamos esta meta. Gracias por todo su apoyo a lo largo de los años” comentó Josh Fairhust.

Si crees que esta cifra es algo pequeña para el número de años debes tomar en cuenta que Limited Run Games como su nombre lo indica lanza juegos en tirajes limitados que tienen como objetivo principal a los fans que desean una versión física o de colección de algún título. Dicho esto en muchas ocasiones el número de copias disponibles no superan las 5000 unidades (y suelen agotarse en pocos minutos) por lo que una vez que se agotan las copias disponibles no se vuelven a producir más.

Today we crossed 2500000 physical games sold over the last five years at @LimitedRunGames.



I can sincerely say that back in 2015/2016 I never thought we'd reach this milestone. Thank you for all of your support over the years! — Josh Fairhurst (@LimitedRunJosh) January 2 2021

Asimismo destacó que durante marzo y abril se registraron las ventas más bajas ya que en estos meses el confinamiento por la pandemia apenas iniciaba en el municipio.

Lluvia Reyes Hernández otra comerciante de la cabecera municipal destacó que el año 2020 fue muy golpeado aunque al final la venta mejoró en comparación a los meses anteriores.

Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The telco had alleged Hearst TV was demanding price hikes of more than 45% to carry the local channels. The companies’ previous carriage pact expired Dec. 31.

The agreement covers nine Hearst-owned channels in Verizon’s Fios TV footprint: WCVB (ABC and MeTV) in Boston WMUR (ABC) in Manchester N.H. WGAL (NBC and MeTV) in Harrisburg Pa. WBAL (NBC and MeTV) in Baltimore and WTAE (ABC and Cozi TV) in Pittsburgh.

Nationwide Hearst Television owns and operates 33 TV and two radio stations serving 26 media markets across 39 states reaching over 21 million U.S. television households.

According to the American Television Alliance a trade group representing cable satellite and telco TV providers broadcasters during the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to use blackouts or the threat of blackouts “as a bargaining chip against consumers while negotiating retransmission consent fees.”

Just this month a fight between Dish Network and Nexstar resulted in a 23-day blackout of Nexstar stations on the satcaster nationwide (affecting 5 million Dish customers). AT&T and DirecTV customers across the U.S. lost access to Tegna’s 64 stations for more than two weeks before the two sides came to terms.

One of the companies that offers that Verizon can boast something that many of its rivals can’t: Its speeds are reliably fast both for uploads and downloads. Most cable companies for instance may be able to offer fast download speeds but can’t say the same about uploads.

“Fios has higher upload speeds than most Internet providers thanks to their fiber-optic network technology” Broadband Now said in its most recent speed test analysis. “While cable and DSL prioritize download speeds above all else the increased bandwidth of Fios fiber allows them to deliver upload speeds in the same range as their download speeds.”

“Fiber Internet is preferred by most customers since it provides gigabit download and upload speeds in the 200–1000 Mbps range which is several times higher than the maximums offered by legacy technologies like coaxial cable and DSL” Broadband Now said in its “expert overview.”

US News in its ranking of the Best Internet Service providers of 2021 ranks Verizon second behind Comcast’s Xfinity Internet although it places Verizon ahead of AT&T Spectrum Cox RCN CenturyLink and other cable and satellite rivals.

While the various companies in the rankings offer different download speeds Verizon offers the fastest minimum upload speeds with a range of 200 Mbps - 880 Mbps per the US News chart. Comcast by contrast offers 1 Mbps to 1000 Mbps while AT&T offers 0.4 Mbps to 940 Mbps. Cox does offer 1 Mbps to 1000 Mbps but it includes a data cap while Verizon’s plan does not even if it does cost slightly more than most cable offerings.

reviews.org recommends going with Fios for Internet if it’s between that and Comcast.

“Verizon Fios might seem expensive but its prices are actually some of the best when it comes to the speeds you get. To top that off you’ll get stunning fiber internet with no annual contract at all. Now that’s a win-win.”

The drawback for Fios? It’s only available in some parts of the country.

Fios like most companies of its kind lost pay-TV customers this year while gaining Internet subscribers as the pandemic has caused cord-cutting trends to accelerate. In the third quarter the most recent for which it has released numbers the company lost 61000 video subscribers after dropping more than 80000 in each of the year’s first two quarters. But the company did add 139000 Internet subscribers in the third quarter which it called the most Internet subscribers it has added in a quarter since the end of 2014.

WILLIAMSBURG Va. — Christopher Lewis was with his girlfriend on the morning of December 26 when he was shot and severely injured by another man.

Detectives with York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office identified the suspect as 29-year-old Alexander Berkley who is wanted on multiple counts including attempted murder. Police say Berkley knew 26-year-old Lewis through his girlfriend.

Meanwhile Christopher's parents Matthew and Justina Keller have not left his side since the incident. They say he is now paralyzed from the waist down and had a collapsed lung.

""We almost lost him Saturday night...but they saved his life here at Norfolk General"" said Matthew.

Justina said Christopher is slowly recovering but is still in a lot of pain saying “He told me last night. He said 'Mom the pain is just unbearable. I don't know if I can keep going on.'""

Both Matthew and Justina say they want Berkley to be caught but what they want more is for their son to get through this tragic experience. They ask anyone who may know Berkley or witnessed the incident to offer up information to police.

“Anything we can do to help you know we'll help but he's still out there and we've been focused on being right here for right now"" said Matthew.

Keller says Christopher doesn't have health insurance to cover the costs of his medical bills so his family opened up a GoFundMe page to help.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL2dlb3JnZS1iYW5rcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMjc5MzMzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Banks Obituary (1932 - 2020) - Norfolk VA - The Virginian-Pilot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/george-banks-obituary?id=12793330 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL2dlb3JnZS1iYW5rcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMjc5MzMzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zY2llbnRpc3QuY29tL2EtZ2VuZXRpY2lzdHMtcXVlc3QtdG8tdW5kZXJzdGFuZC1oaXMtc29ucy1teXN0ZXJpb3VzLWRpc2Vhc2UtNjgyNTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Geneticist's Quest to Understand His Son's Mysterious Disease,"Davis’s first step was to set up a centrifuge in the tool shed in his backyard. When he got home from his job as director of the Stanford Genome...

About 10 years ago Stanford University genomicist Ronald W. Davis began a new investigation into a mysterious disease that had disabled his son Whitney Dafoe. A photographer and avid traveller in his 20s Dafoe could no longer care for himself. He slowly lost the ability to eat and eventually even to speak. He visited doctors for years before he finally found one who could diagnose him with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) based on his strange constellation of symptoms. But with the diagnosis Dafoe and his family soon learned that little research had been done on the disease and there was no treatment. Davis decided to do what he could to fill that gap.

From these inauspicious beginnings Davis slowly began to change the course of his career advancing the little known much maligned field of ME/CFS research. Why Davis put his reputation at risk to explore the molecular underpinnings of a little known disease one that many in the medical establishment didn’t think was real is laid out in our book The Puzzle Solver which I wrote with Davis. The book also unravels the incredible story of how he managed to do this. He was beginning from scratch.

Since a highly publicized outbreak of ME/CFS at Lake Tahoe in California in the 1980s the illness has been called many things including disparagingly the “Yuppie disease.” Its multiple symptoms confused doctors. Routine lab tests yielded normal results. And when early on scientists failed to find a molecular cause—when no virus or bacteria could be blamed—frustrations grew. Soon the general consensus held that chronic fatigue syndrome was psychological even a made up disease and as such research funds devoted to finding its biological underpinnings were wasted.

When Davis discovered just how few federal research dollars were allocated for the disease he was shocked but not dissuaded. He immediately understood why so few studied it: Scientists couldn’t afford to. He was motivated not only by his son but by the many others sick with this disease: a 2015 Institute of Medicine report estimated that between 836000 and 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS. Luckily for Davis he had a large well-equipped research lab. “The scientific process begins with observations” he told me once. “So I needed lots of them. I planned to cast out a large fishing net then see what fish I caught.”

As he kept up his already-funded genetics research in addition to his new project Davis’s work hours extended long into the night filled his weekends and even penetrated his dreams. Early on he recruited a handful of scientists in his lab willing to volunteer some hours and they set to work running his son’s blood samples through hundreds of thousands of tests including cytokine analysis genome sequencing microbiome sequencing metabolomics PCR assays for viruses antibody assays for mycotoxins and much more. Davis was also able to map his son’s genome several times—thanks in large part to his earlier technological advances such as devising genetic markers that contributed to the success of the Human Genome Project—the mapping of the first human genome in 2003. This allowed his volunteer team to look for mutations or hidden viral or bacterial genetic information embedded in his genome.

The results of these and other tests uncovered abnormalities in Dafoe’s cells including an overactive immune system and unusual gene mutations. Davis also sent blood samples to a new startup that created a chart depicting Dafoe’s entire metabolome. From that Davis discerned abnormalities in his son’s citric acid cycle likely explaining his severe fatigue. When Davis won a $500000 genetics prize the Gruber award he dedicated his winnings to his ME/CFS research. When that money ran out he turned to a charity for help and set up a scientific advisory board filled with his colleagues and friends including Nobel Prize winners. As donations began to come in the research expanded.

ME/CFS is now Davis’s primary research focus. His leadership has contributed to changes in the field: ME/CFS is now accepted a biological disease and federal funding has increased. New talented investigators have joined the hunt for a cure. Davis is not alone in his race to find treatments for his son and millions of others like him.

But Helen Larkin admits she has ‘no goodwill’ to Liz Earle Beauty Co after still failing to receive an apology after winning her maternity discrimination and unfair dismissal claim at Southampton Tribunal Court in January.

The Southsea mum-of-two was put through a ‘nightmare 18 months’ by the Isle of Wight firm which made her redundant just a month before she was due to give birth in June 2019.

But despite representing herself during the emotional tribunal Helen won – leaving the company having to fork out £17000.

Helen Larkin and her children

The 39-year-old who lost her digital channel marketing role waived the opportunity to accept nearly twice what she was awarded by the tribunal after Liz Earle Beauty made a last-ditch offer to pay her off.

But Helen refused to be silenced – and is now helping other women who are suffering similar experiences by working as a volunteer mentor for charity Pregnant Then Screwed as well as having spoken at a conference to pregnant mums.

‘I spoke to a mentor from the charity before my tribunal which helped me and now I do the same to help others’ she said. ‘I’m making something positive from something bad.

‘It’s good to be able to help people – that was a big thing for me in not accepting their offer. If I’d accepted it then I wouldn’t have been allowed to speak about my case.

‘(Maternity discrimination) happens to so many people and is now happening four-fold since Covid happened.

‘Most women take an offer and accept a non-disclosure order where you are not allowed to talk about the case. I probably would have done the same if they had made me the offer before the tribunal but by that point it was too late.

‘It is unusual for people to speak out. But other women have found it inspiring and heartening when they are going through similar situations and are worried about pursuing firms.

‘They feel they have the support to do it on their own and stand up for themselves. It is still very rare to represent yourself and win.’

Reflecting on her feelings towards Liz Earle Beauty owned by American pharmaceutical giant Walgreens Boots Alliance which owns Boots Helen said: ‘I’m glad I won and have been able to speak out and help others. I’ve not bought any of their products since!

‘I have no goodwill towards them. They never apologised. They said they had done nothing wrong even after the tribunal – but they were found guilty.

‘I’ve heard of other women in the company say maternity rights have improved since and that’s because of the tribunal so that’s good if true.

Dominguez died on Friday according to the D23 newsletter. No further details were released about his death and no cause of death was given.

Dominguez's family originally owned and lived on the orange grove-covered property that was purchased by Walt Disney for his theme park in 1954.

“Our house was located right about where the entrance to Pirates of the Caribbean and Cafe Orleans are today” he once recalled according to D23. “The day we moved out in August of 1954 we were walking in ditches and holes. Things were popping up around us because construction had to move ahead. They built Disneyland in a year.”

A young Dominguez took a summer job as a ticket taker at the new theme park and later rose through the ranks to hold several managerial positions at Disneyland. In 1970 he was appointed director of operations.

Four years later he was named vice president of Disneyland and chairman of the park operating committee and in 1990 he was named executive vice president Walt Disney Attractions West Coast.

Park officials consider the opening an extension of Downtown Disney. Vikki Vargas reported on NBC4 News on Wednesday Nov. 18 2020.

“We are saddened to have lost a very dear member of our family Ron Dominguez” said Josh D'Amaro chairman of Disney Parks Experiences and Products. “Ron's contributions to Disneyland are nearly incalculable. He was well-known among the cast and community throughout his tenure at the park and continued to show his support long after his retirement guiding and mentoring leaders including me for decades. I am personally grateful for all that he has done for Disney and want to express my deepest condolences to his family on behalf of every Disney Parks cast member around the world.”

Dominguez who retired in August 1994 attended 60th anniversary festivities for the Disneyland Resort in 2015.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjEwMS83OTQ1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney World Offers New Discount as Park Hopping Returns,"Disney World Offers New Discount as Park Hopping Returns

Park Hopping is back at Walt Disney World as the resort also is introducing a new ticket discount offer for Florida residents.

Disney had prohibited guests from visiting more than one theme park per day once the parks reopened last July. Guests needed to reserve the dates they wished to visit specific parks using the new Disney Park Pass online reservation tool. Once they picked a park and a day they could not move over to another park later on that day. But starting yesterday annual passholders and other Disney World visitors with Park Hopper tickets could visit additional parks — just not until after 2pm.

That's new rule for Park Hopping at Walt Disney World during the pandemic. You must continue to reserve an initial park visit using Disney Park Pass but after 2pm you are free to visit another Disney World theme park without having to make a reservation. Blockout dates continue to apply for some annual passholders and cast members however.

Park-to-park bus transportation will be available in the afternoons Disney has said that however cast members will verify that you have a Park Hopper ticket or privileges before you will be allowed to board. And once a theme park reaches its capacity no additional Park Hopper admissions into it will be allowed.

As for the new offer Walt Disney World is offering two- three- and four-day Florida Resident Discover Disney tickets for $149 to $199 per ticket starting Monday. Note that these are not Park Hoppers but one-park-per-day tickets. The ticket does not have to be used on consecutive days but the two-day tickets expire March 11 while the three- and four-day tickets expire June 18. Blockout dates apply: January 16 - January 18 February 13 - February 15 March 26 - April 11 and May 28 - 31.

If you choose the four-day ticket that works out to $50 a day — which is pretty much the cheapest Disney World day ticket available right now. The deal ia available starting Monday on the Disney World website.

With the pandemic continuing to limit travel options the Orlando-area theme parks will continue to look for Florida residents to drive traffic for the next several months led by deals such as this one.

You don’t even need to watch the next 30 seconds to confirm it — it’s just a horror movie trope that happens again and again and now is a normalized aspect of a horror movie.

Well when you turn on Disney+ and pick a Disney film to watch you can often assume that the main character’s mom is either suffering dying or dead — and I want to find out why.

From the Walt Disney Company’s inception mothers in Disney films have almost always been dead. From Walt Disney’s first feature film in 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Walt Disney Studios have created mother characters who live the anti-fairy tale. What’s interesting about this trend is that even after Walt’s passing Disney films continue to create mother-less (or parent-less) characters. Also Pixar Animation Studios (acquired by Disney after it was founded) also falls into the dead mom trope fitting in perfectly with its parent company Disney Studios.

That being said this reporter wants to know why from 1937 to 2020 does Disney continuously put out films in which characters’ mothers die or are already dead in so many Disney movies.

One major theory fans have is quite sad and is one that would resonate with Walt Disney deeply. After the major box office success of the Disney princess movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs — which thanks to Guinness World Records we know “took $184925486 (then £37404022) at the US box office equivalent to $1.2 billion (£890 million) as of 2018” — Walt wanted to buy his parents Flora and Elias Disney a home near the Disney Studio in Burbank California. After Flora complained about the gas furnace Disney had repairmen sent to the home but unfortunately the problem was not resolved. Flora ended up dying of asphyxiation in the home Walt bought for her — which became a tragedy Walt would have to carry with him for the rest of his life.

Many Disney fans theorized that this is why Disney characters always lose their moms — because they themselves are a reflection of Walt and his pain. That being said there are a few rebuttals to this theory. Flora passed away on November 6 1938 a year after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered. It is established that Snow White herself loses her mother prior to the film’s beginning which means the thought of a motherless child was something that Disney was already focusing on prior to Flora’s passing. At this time the Disney Studios were also working on Bambi and Pinocchio another two films that showcase dead mothers prior to Walt having experienced the feeling for himself. And as we mentioned Flora’s passing due to asphyxiation means the death was sudden and Disney had no reason to have any personal connection to motherless characters prior to her passing.

That being said I have a rebuttal for my rebuttal. Many early Disney animated films were derived from fairytales as the source material. If we look at Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Snow White didn’t have a mother in the original story. Gepetto also never had a woman in his life according to the original story and in 1923 when the fairy tale of Bambi was written entitled Bambi in the Woods Bambi has to watch the death of his mother in order to gain the motivation to survive on his own. If there is one thing here that is for sure the original fairy tales are the ones here that pre-determined the death or non-existence for these Disney moms. Source material like fairy tales led to animated features for Disney that were highly successful so it is no surprise that the Disney Studios could have taken on the mantra “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it” carrying on with motherless characters already established in fairy tales.

We should dissect the fact that although the source material may be at times the cause of motherless characters and many Disney films up until now including original storylines such as Lilo & Stitch continue to have characters with mothers who have passed away. But first we need to find out why mothers were dying in the first place.

Jack Zipes author of Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales Children and the Culture Industry mentioned “Historically speaking people did not live very long from the medieval period through the early 20th century. Women died frequently from childbirth. Therefore there were many single parents although men tended to marry quickly after their wives died as in Snow White and Cinderella.”

Women during this time were often seen as expendable with their main purpose being to reproduce. Therefore for the purpose of a story the mother may have been cut out after she served her purpose. So it seems that what fairy tale novelists would do was create fiction but still allow that fiction to be rooted in real life perhaps making it more relatable. This in theory could be a brilliant idea considering giving the story a realistic base allows the readers to connect with the story while also encouraging believability by allowing the reader to develop sympathy.

This isn’t to say that Walt’s experience of “causing” (in his opinion) his mother’s death wouldn’t later transcribe into his films but it’s not where the trope would have originated. So why do modern Disney films still create these motherless characters from Beauty and the Beast to Tarzan to Frozen and the list can truly continue to go on and on Disney characters often lose their moms.

Aside from the fact that Disney is still using classic fairy tales as original source material another possible explanation for it could stem from the reason Bambi had which is the fact that the loss of a mother causes you to grow up and accept responsibility — something nearly every Disney character must often do. As a stereotype mothers are often seen as nurturing and protective. If you have a mom she will always make sure you are okay. Would Elsa have ever become Queen of Arendelle without having no other choice? Would Anna have risked her life to save her sister if her mother was there? Likely not because the person with the highest authority and maternal power would have probably taken over the situation as the leader — plus we know from Frozen 2 that Anna and Elsa’s parents would risk their lives for their children so Anna would never have had the chance to save Elsa as that would have put her in danger. This theory is not without its holes as well but in many cases proves true. The story of Frozen would have been very different if Anna and Elsa had not lost their parents.

Even when the mother doesn’t die but is simply removed or transformed in the story — such as in Brave when Merida’s mother turns into a bear — the character needs to step up and take charge of the situation. Therefore it seems that in order to propel the story forward the loss or suffering of a parent is almost essential.

Disney films like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast also showcase Disney characters who lost their moms. In The Little Mermaid Ariel loses her mother and after a falling out with her father is left to her own devices and that propels the plot forward. If in The Little Mermaid Ariel has a mother she may not have rebelled so much as there would have been 2 parental figures in her life.

The Disney films may also serve as a way to educate kids on the idea of death. Many children begin to watch Disney films at a young age and instead of learning about death in a scary way understanding it through a fairy tale and seeing that things can still turn out alright is a crucial message to help kids understand the circle of life.

In the end there is a clear pattern and formula here that not only Disney and other studios continue to abide by (take Harry Potter for example). That being said the constant use of a dead parent trope at Walt Disney Studios could be due to its success as a formula or it could be a continuation of Walt’s pain — and in turn the pain many people feel when they lose a mother — or even just a good way to propel the plot. The answer here is not clear but if there is one thing that is almost certain it’s that we are definitely not finished with dead moms in Disney movies.

Why do you think Disney moms pass away in so many Disney films? Let us know in the comments below.

Bates longtime SVP of U.S. government relations for the Walt Disney Company died on Thursday.

No cause of death was given but The Walt Disney Co. said that his passing was sudden. In a joint statement Disney Executive Chairman Bob Iger and Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek said that “his loss is profound.”

“He was passionate about his work and approached it with the same astuteness and unwavering enthusiasm he demonstrated when he first joined Disney three decades ago” they said in a joint statement.

Charles Rivkin the chairman of the Motion Picture Association said in a statement “Everyone loved Richard. Generous supportive charming and witty he was widely respected and admired here in Washington and beyond and he was a fierce advocate for the creative industries and the Walt Disney Company — which for him was much more than a job.”

Since 2010 Bates oversaw Disney’s D.C. office including its interactions with federal and state government entities and trade associations. He joined Disney in 1991 having been tapped to open a lobbying office for the company then a bit of a novelty for studios to have their own government relations representatives. He previously had a career in politics serving as executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Through the years Bates advocated on a host of issues include copyright trade travel and telecommunications.

Bates had recently been advocating on a host of issues including the recently passed Covid-19 relief package. In March Bates was among the media company executives who attended a White House meeting with President Donald Trump portions of which were televised as theme parks faced closures.

Gordon Smith president and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters said in a statement “Broadcasters were well-served on Capitol Hill by Richard’s larger-than-life personality his razor wit his humanity and decency and his extraordinary competence. As a U.S. Senator I witnessed firsthand his effectiveness and ability to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and I greatly valued his friendship support and counsel while at NAB.”

The full joint statement from Iger and Chapek is below.

All of us at Disney are heartbroken by the sudden loss of our longtime colleague and dear friend Richard Bates. As head of our Government Relations team in Washington D.C. Richard was second to none in his field —- widely respected for his incredible achievements and beloved for his extraordinary kindness compassion and irresistible wit. He was passionate about his work and approached it with the same astuteness and unwavering enthusiasm he demonstrated when he first joined Disney three decades ago. For those of us lucky enough to have known Richard personally his loss is profound. He will be deeply missed and our prayers and heartfelt condolences go out to his wife Rose their sons Ricky and Chris and his entire family.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDEvbXItZGlzbmV5bGFuZC1hbmQtZm9ybWVyLWRpc25leWxhbmQtZXhlY3V0aXZlLWRpZXMtYXQtODUv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMS9tci1kaXNuZXlsYW5kLWFuZC1mb3JtZXItZGlzbmV5bGFuZC1leGVjdXRpdmUtZGllcy1hdC04NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Mr. Disneyland’ and former Disneyland executive dies at 85,"Ron Dominguez a Disney legend who grew up on an orange grove ranch that later became part of the Disneyland theme park has died. He was 85.

Starting in 1955 Dominguez worked taking entry tickets as the Anaheim park first opened. He then quickly moved through the ranks and in 1990 he was named executive vice president for Walt Disney Attractions for the West Coast. He retired in 1994 and in 2000 he became a Disney Legend. He also was given a window on the theme park’s Main Street.

Many of the names on the windows for fake businesses on Main Street U.S.A. at Disneyland are references to people who helped build Disneyland or were key in later additions to or operations of the park.

Getting a window is a significant honor said Scott Fleener who was among the first to learn of Dominguez’s passing early Friday Jan. 1.

“It’s given to someone who made a large contribution to what the resort is today” Fleener explained.

Fleener president of the Order of the Red Handkerchief the oldest alumnae club in Disneyland and made up of people associated with the former Mine Train Ride through Nature’s Wonderland learned of his friend’s passing from Dominguez’s wife Betty. The couple was married 41 years. They met at Disneyland.

“He was a natural leader who took the time to develop future leaders from cast members” Fleener said. “Ron was very friendly and one of the things he said was ‘The higher I go up the more I miss getting to know the people who work in the park.’ If he or his wife were to look back now I would say he had a great life.”

Richard Ferrin chairman of the Disneyland Alumni Club agreed calling Dominguez “the spirit of Disneyland.”

“He was there from the very beginning and fully understood what Walt wanted in a cast member” he said.

Ferrin said he met Dominguez while working in the park’s entertainment division and as a theme park designer.

“When Roy Disney and Wally Boag asked me to assist with the Disneyland Alumni Club Ron Dominguez helped and supported me in my planning and events” Ferrin said. “He helped out tremendously during my production of the 50th anniversary event and the celebration video documentary which I directed.”

“Ron was a good friend and I will miss him very very much” he added.

Fleener said he last saw Dominguez in October when he and other members from the alumnae club presented him with a challenge coin made for the Mine Train ride. The ride operated from 1956 to 1977 when Thunder Mountain replaced it. Dominguez had been the first foreman of the attraction.

“We are saddened to have lost a very dear member of our family Ron Dominguez” Josh D’Amaro chairman of Disney Parks Experiences and Products said in a statement shared by the Disney fan club D23. “Ron’s contributions to Disneyland are nearly incalculable. He was well-known among the cast and community throughout his tenure at the park and continued to show his support long after his retirement guiding and mentoring leaders including me for decades. I am personally grateful for all that he has done for Disney and want to express my deepest condolences to his family on behalf of every Disney Parks cast member around the world.”

In October Fleener recalled Dominguez was already quite frail but spoke at the club’s luncheon sharing some fun trivia about Disneyland and his family.

For Dominguez Disneyland was in his roots. His family owned and lived on 10 acres of orange groves purchased by Walt Disney for Disneyland in 1954. Dominguez said the family’s home was near today’s Pirates of the Caribbean and Cafe Orleans. The Spanish-style two-story family was later moved behind Main Street U.S.A. and converted into administrative offices.

He also told the group about a giant palm tree that now stands near the entrance line to the Jungle Cruise. That palm had been a gift to his grandparents who were married in the 1890s Fleener said.

“It was very sad to see him so frail especially because he was so vibrant” Fleener said.

Dominguez had been in hospice for the past six weeks following a fall in which he broke his hip Fleener said.

Dominguez was born on Aug. 19 1935. He attended Anaheim High School and earned a degree in business administration from the University of Arizona.

His first day working at Disneyland was on July 13 1955 when at 20 he took a summer job collecting park entrance tickets.

A year after starting at Disneyland he had been trained on every attraction including the Mine Train.

Later in 1956 he was named a temporary supervisor of Main Street U.S.A. He moved on to supervisor positions of other areas throughout the park and in 1970 was made director of operations. In 1974 he became vice president of Disneyland.

Fleener said Dominguez was known as “Mr. Disneyland.”

“He was one of the nicest guys I’ve ever known” he said. “Sometimes ‘nice guys’ do finish first. It’s very sad.”"

SALT LAKE CITY — With the COVID-19 pandemic driving so many people to the great outdoors in Utah the great outdoors is becoming not so great in some instances.

At Zion National Park’s Narrows a ranger cleared out 14 pounds of debris — of which 9 pounds was human waste.

The ranger said he’d never seen the graffiti so egregious in an area covering just under a mile that was marred with more than 1000 handprints or etchings on the rock walls.

“While it hurts to see such a beautiful and unique place treated like this I feel honored I have the responsibility to protect it” the employee’s report said.

Part of the problem was lack of ranger patrols for the canyon’s Virgin River and people failing to heed signs to avoid the water due to high levels of toxins or cyanobacteria that can sicken people and domestic animals. The visiting public did not heed the signs to stay out and instead decided to leave their own print on the landscape protected under federal law.

The Narrows’ condition was dismaying to leaders of The Zion Forever Project the park’s philanthropic partner.

“This year has challenged all of us and places like Zion are essential to uplifting us in these difficult times. The Zion Forever Project as the park’s official nonprofit partner works side by side with the National Park Service to conserve these lands” said Lyman Hafen the project’s executive director.

“When the land is mistreated or marred with graffiti while devastating we are only strengthened in our resolve to educate the public about responsible land use and to ensure the Zion experience remains intact for future generations.”

National park officials state park managers the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management all have been overwhelmed this year with dramatic increases in visitation while at the same time tasked with caring for the land with flat budgets or even a bottom line that has seen sharp reductions.

Cedar Breaks National Monument as an example saw a 35% increase in visitors from 2019 to 2020 and visitation at Zion National Park has more than doubled in the last decade.

While some land managers or volunteer conservation organizations offer wag bags for people — a zip-lock bag to contain feces for proper disposal later — visitors often ignore them or supplies quickly run out.

Even bathrooms at the base of popular hiking trails in the Wasatch Canyons for example can become quickly overwhelmed with land managers struggling to keep toilet paper supplies on hand.

Like their counterparts at the National Park Service the Bureau of Land Management is seeing similar resource degradation this year due to high visitor counts.

“We do not have any statistics to verify our observations but we have noted that some of the resource issues associated with high visitation such as improperly disposed human waste and litter have been more widespread than normal this year on public lands” said BLM Utah spokeswoman Kimberly Finch.

This fall the agency launched a new social media campaign to help drive awareness of taking better care of public lands.

The campaign uses the hashtag #leaveitbetterUtah to address some of what BLM employees are seeing on the ground.

Multiple social media postings detail dumpsters surrounded by litter on the ground abandoned campsites full of discarded belongings or campfire rings filled to the brim with debris all of which can cost thousands to clean up.

Earlier this year the BLM discovered an abandoned camper vehicle with household trash on public lands in southern Utah.

The federal agency tracked down the owner who was charged with hazardous materials dumping and other related offenses.

The bill for removing the abandoned camper came to approximately $13000 and the suspect was fined and banned from public lands for a year due to being a repeat offender.

The issue of human waste is also a problem for the BLM which discovered an illegal sewage dump on the lands it manages.

Improperly disposed of human waste is a health hazard can contaminate water spread disease and is just plain unsightly for the next visitor to come along.

Finch said fines start at $250 for illegal sewage disposal on BLM lands.

Live trees are serving a purpose beyond the holidays through the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's Habitat for the Holidays program.

""Instead of letting that tree go to waste we have drop-off locations to improve angling throughout the state"" said Colton Dennis a fisheries habitat coordinator with Game and Fish. ""Throughout January anglers can create brush piles in nearby lakes from these donated trees increasing fishing opportunities and habitat for themselves and other anglers.""

Trees may be dropped off at Beaver Lake at the Arkansas 12 bridge access and at the Don Roufa access near the U.S. 412 bridge according to a news release from the commission. Trees may be dropped near the boat ramps at Lake Elmdale near Elm Springs Crystal Lake in Decatur and Bob Kidd Lake in Prairie Grove.

Artificial trees aren't allowed at those drop-off locations and all ornaments tinsel and lights must be removed before dropping off live trees.

Any angler can take the trees. Anglers supply their own rope and weights to sink the trees.

""Cinder blocks and sandbags work well to sink the trees and parachute cord works very well to bind trees together and attach them to the weight"" Dennis said. ""By the time the cord deteriorates the tree will be waterlogged enough to stay put.""

Most Christmas trees will likely deteriorate within a year or two he said but they offer very good cover for small bait fish and ambush locations for larger sport fish until they rot away.

The Benton County Environmental Department encourages residents to work through trash collection providers to dispose of live Christmas trees according to Teresa Sidwell environmental manager.

Artificial trees with all decorations removed can be dropped off at Benton County Convenience centers in Centerton 5702 Brookside Road from 8-11 a.m. and noon to 3 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday; in Rogers 2307 N. Arkansas St. from 8-11 a.m. and noon to 3 p.m. Tuesday-Friday and the second and fourth Saturday of each month; and Siloam Springs 1108 E. Ashley St. from 8 a.m. to noon the first and third Saturday of each month according to the Benton County Solid Waste District website.

Curbside tree collection won't be offered in Bentonville according to a representative with Republic Services the city's waste and recycling provider.

Fayetteville residents can have live Christmas trees turned into compost by putting them out on the same day as their residential trash collection through January according to the Fayetteville Recycling and Trash Collection Department web page.

Trees may also be dropped off at Fayetteville's composting site at 1708 S. Armstrong Ave. for free from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday and from 8 a.m. to noon the first Saturday of each month according to the web page.

All trees must be free of plastic bags stands decorations lights and tinsel before they'll be accepted and artificial trees won't be collected.

Residents of Rogers can have live Christmas trees picked up curbside Monday through Jan. 8 on their regular service day according to an Orion Waste Solutions representative the company that provides trash and recycle service for Rogers.

People must call (479) 878-1384 by noon the day before their usual service day to notify Orion of the pickup according to the representative. Artificial trees can be picked up on customers' bulk pickup day through coordination with Orion as well.

The Waste Management collection provider in Springdale hasn't determined when it will be picking up Christmas trees this season according to a Bulky Waste Program representative. Residents can call (479) 750-8135 to leave their name and contact information with program staff so they can be notified when collection begins."

According to Evergreen the 8452 TEU container ship encountered strong winds and rough seas 20 nautical miles south of Kyushu Japan causing the collapse of container stacks on the vessel. Twenty-one 40-foot containers fell onto the deck while 36 fell into the sea.

Evergreen said that no personnel were injured in the incident and none of the containers contained dangerous goods. The ship’s captain immediately notified Japan Coast Guard so that ships in adjacent waters could be notified about the drifting containers.

The EVER LIBERAL was diverted to the Port of Taipei to have the damaged cargo taken care of.

Evergreen also said that it is engaged in salvage operations to retrieve the drifting containers.

The extent of those adjustments haven't been determined yet.

Tournament organizers are considering various options to the format schedule and attendance for the championships set for Feb. 17-20 at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines. Any modifications will be to address COVID-19 pandemic safety and concerns.

'I think one of the reasons why people don't know much or they think they know but there's nothing definite is because there hasn't been anything definite' Iowa High School Athletic Association Director of Officials and administrator for wrestling Lewie Curtis said. 'We are very confident that we're not going to be able to have a state tournament that is going to look like it has every other year.'

Spectator limitations and crowd control will influence the upcoming decisions. Meetings with arena staff next week should shine a light on how many bodies will be allowed in the building. Once they get a number then they can decide how to distribute tickets social-distance seating and flow of fans entering and exiting between sessions.

Government mandates that restrict attendance similar to the prep football finals also can be a factor.

'In previous years the first 2 1/2 days of the tournament were general admission seating and come buy your tickets whenever you feel like buying them' Curtis said. 'This year we don't think it's going to turn out that way because of the limited spectators will probably require us to have reserved-seat ticketing.'

The number of participants will be the same. Sixteen wrestlers in 14 weight classes will compete in three classes. The order of events and competition structure could depend on spectator limitations.

The tournament could still maintain its regular schedule with multiple classes competing each day of a three-day traditional tournament after the state duals.

One proposal calls for single-class traditional tournaments from Wednesday through Friday and all classes compete in state duals on Saturday.

'That is definitely something we have been talking about' Curtis said. 'We mentioned it to our advisory committee.

'We're not in a position yet to say that is what we're doing. That is definitely something in consideration.'

State duals risks the biggest impact. Depending on floor layout to accommodate greater spacing the field could remain eight teams in each class or it could shrink to four.

'We realize that we can't have the same setup' Curtis said. 'It just isn't going to work that way.'

The IHSAA has tried to delay decisions because circumstances continue to be fluid. Curtis said he doesn't have a specific timetable for finalized plans but things will likely clear up after meetings next week.

'By the end of next week I think we will have a lot better idea about what is it we're going to do' Curtis said. 'A lot of that still hinges on what is the number we're getting told we're going to be able to have in attendance.'

The top priority is to hold a safe event. The style and details can be worked out but the goal is to provide wrestlers some kind of safe state tournament experience.

'The coaches I've talked to and are on my committee their No. 1 thing is they want to make sure we wrestle' Curtis said. 'The rest of it they can kind of live with whatever decisions get made or however we're going to do it. We might agree or disagree but the main thing they want is to give these kids a chance to put it out there on the mat.'

Wrestlers compete in Class 2A quarterfinals of the 2020 IHSAA state wrestling championships at the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines. (Andy Abeyta/The Gazette)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9mbHllcnMvdmFsZXJpZS1jYW1pbGxvLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1mbHllcnMtZXhlY3V0aXZlLW5obC13b21lbi0yMDIxMDEwMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia Flyers' Valerie Camillo leads NHL move toward gender diversity in leadership,"Standing alone at the end of a Wells Fargo Center runway one morning early in 2019 Valerie Camillo surveyed the slipperiest challenge she’d yet faced as the Flyers’ new president of business operations.

Just weeks after becoming the highest-ranking woman in franchise history Camillo had been invited to break more ground this time as the first female to join in the hockey team’s annual photo. Now gazing out at the Flyers assembled at center ice she wondered how she was going to get there on stiletto heels.

“I’d been told this would be the first time a woman had ever been in the picture” Camillo recalled recently. “Pretty cool right? So I walked down there trying to be as authentic as I could. I was telling myself ‘Don’t try to act like one of the guys. Just be yourself.’ Then I see I had to go out on this sheet of ice in boots with giant stilettos. I was like ‘Oh my god I’m going to die.’ ”

Fortunately an unlikely Sir Walter Raleigh then-Flyers president Paul Holmgren recognized Camillo’s distress.

“And this was a guy who if you know his history was one of the all-time leaders in penalty minutes” said Camillo. “The toughest of the tough. Old school. A Flyers’ institutional leader. And he literally and figuratively offered his arm to me. Later he introduced me around the building. And I think that helped me immensely. I’ll always be grateful to him. He certainly didn’t have to do that.”

Two years later Camillo has maintained her footing and as the first woman hired to be an NHL team’s president asserted her grip on the Flyers’ business side.

Despite a disruptive pandemic the 47-year-old executive has transformed the once-distinct managements of the Flyers and the arena into a single corporate entity revamped the game-night experience successfully reached out to a younger generation of fans aided the NHL in its quest for more diversity on and off the ice and maybe most impressively avoided the land mines that confront women in one of sport’s most macho outposts.

“With her energy level her style she just really connected from the get-go” said her boss Dave Scott Comcast Spectacor’s chairman and CEO.

Camillo’s arrival in Philadelphia coincided with an ongoing push by a league that’s playing catch-up in gender equality. The NHL has lagged behind its pro sports counterparts in female employment. According to a 2019 survey women who make up an estimated 40 percent of the league’s fan base held less than 5 percent of its hockey operations jobs.

The NHL is also alone among the four major sports with no domestic abuse policy. Each case is handled individually and the decision made by commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly.

In response the NHL last year formed a Female Hockey Advisory Board to address those issues and to foster the growth of the women’s sport. Like the Flyers several teams recently have added women to high-profile jobs. Canadian Olympic star Hayley Wickenheiser for example is now Toronto’s assistant director of player development. (Camillo is actually the second female president in the NHL but the first Buffalo’s Kim Pegula co-owns that team.)

The movement seems to validate the prediction of Kim Davis who since 2017 has served as an NHL executive vice president:

“The next 100 years” Davis said “will be defined by how our sport creates a more welcoming environment and opens its doors to new audiences.”

Camillo who has completed a hat trick of sports management jobs having worked earlier in the NBA and MLB said the only way to equal the playing field was to get more women into positions of authority.

“Twenty-five years ago when I was first coming into the professional world there was a subtle pressure to look and act like a man whatever that means” she said. “It came across in subtle encouragements like ‘Take up golf because that’s where business gets done.’ Well I don’t like golf. Getting to show my authentic self at work and not having to conform to succeed that’s gender equality.”

As recently as 2018 Camillo was a pioneering baseball executive. As the Washington Nationals’ chief revenue and marketing officer she was working contentedly not only in her favorite sport but in what essentially was her home town. Then late that year a headhunter contacted her about the Flyers opening.

“I definitely wasn’t looking” she said during a recent interview. “But what was so interesting to me was here you had an iconic brand in the Flyers a crazy sports town in Philadelphia and engaged fans. They were doing a $300 million transformation of the arena. And they were part of the Comcast organization. Just to be part of a Fortune 30 company was attractive. Next thing you know I went from taking a phone call to listening to an opportunity to taking the job.”

She had been one of 10 candidates interviewed by Scott who said he wasn’t worried about inserting a female executive into a male fortress.

“Hockey historically probably like all sports had challenges” said Scott. “But we knew what we wanted to do. With Ron Hextall leaving we brought in Chuck Fletcher a very progressive guy. And on the business side I thought Valerie could step into this and get running with the pack. She’s done that and she’s also really emerged as a great leader on the NHL side. Already she’s got a great following among those who work with her men and women.”

Sports as a career

A combination of nerd and jock Camillo grew up in northern Virginia immersed in sports both as a participant and a fan. Even as a youngster her ambition was a front-office job in team sports.

“I always cut a little bit of an unlikely figure” she said. “I was a young woman who knew a lot about sports stats and history. I would regularly test the guys. And somewhere over the years I decided that’s what I wanted to do.”

Her father worked in the defense industry while her homemaker mother was an avid baseball fan. From the start Camillo said she launched herself toward the glass ceilings she’d eventually help shatter.

“I’m a child of the ’70s and Star Wars was a formative part of my youth the toys I played with what engaged me creatively as a kid” she said. “I had a Millennial Falcon and I used to kick Han Solo out and let Princess Leia fly it. The little boy next door was my best friend and he and I would fight about it. So that was probably a sign of things to come.”

Her maternal grandfather a New Yorker turned her into a fan of the Yankees and especially their star catcher Thurman Munson. Vacationing in Wildwood N.J. in August 1979 she learned that that her idol had died in a plane crash.

“I don’t know why I liked him. I just I did” she said of Munson. “He was like my doll my first crush. I was only 6 when he was killed but I wrote his widow a letter to express how sad I was.”

An eager but not particularly gifted athlete Camillo played basketball softball and lacrosse in high school. She was limited to intramurals at the University of Virginia where she earned both an undergrad degree in commerce and her MBA.

“Twenty-five years ago there was a subtle pressure to look and act like a man whatever that means. It came across in subtle encouragements like ‘Take up golf because that’s where business gets done.’ Well I don’t like golf. Getting to show my authentic self at work and not having to conform to succeed that’s gender equality.” Valerie Camillo

For a decade and a half after graduation she worked for consulting firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton.

“Before I ever got into sports I had a great foundation in business data analytics and strategy” she said. “Then a little bit into my career I started to try to make the move into sports. Back then it was hard for team sports executives to project exactly how what I did could be applicable to a team.”

Then came “Moneyball” and the analytics explosion both on the field and in front offices. Teams were collecting more customer data and they wanted to know how best to exploit it. That was Camillo’s wheelhouse and in 2010 she began consulting the NBA as part of its Team Marketing and Business Operations Group.

“I Ioved working at the NBA but if you’re passionate about sports a team is where the action is” she said.

Back in the 1990s Camillo with an eye toward one day landing in its front office had been part of a Washington-area group that lobbied MLB for another baseball team. In 2005 the Montreal Expos moved there and became the Nationals. Nine years later Camillo joined them.

“How often does a dream became real?” she said.

For four years Camillo directed the Nationals’ money-making operations from tickets to broadcasting to licensing to concessions. If there’s one regret she said it’s that the team’s first World Series triumph came a year after she departed. Still her tenure cemented her understanding of sports finances.

“The question I’m often asked by young women is ‘How do I get to be president of a team?’” Camillo said. “And what I advise them is stay close to the money. Stay on top of the money.”

When she surprised everyone and left Washington and baseball for Philadelphia and the black-and-blue world of hockey she was warned to prepare for culture shock.

“I listened but it wasn’t my first time at that rodeo being the only women at the table or working in male-centered environments” she said. “During the interview process someone said to me ‘You know you’d be the first woman hired to be a president of an NHL club.’ Someone else said ‘It’s very macho and it may not be super warm.’ But my experience with the Flyers has been pretty opposite of that.”

Married living now in Newtown Square after an initial residence in Center City Camillo helped create some of the many new experiences at Flyers games all of them aimed at broadening an aging fan base.

“During the interview process someone said to me ‘You know you’d be the first woman hired to be a president of an NHL club.’ Someone else said ‘It’s very macho and it may not be super warm.’ But my experience with the Flyers has been pretty opposite of that.” Valerie Camillo

“We’ve got to be mindful of building the next generation of Flyers fans” she said. “We have to be mindful of attracting a diverse set of fans. Our challenge is how to create a customized fan experience.”

She hopes millennials who tend to be more social than older fans will be attracted to the Assembly Room and Revolutionary Row the new casual lofty Wells Fargo Center areas where they can mingle drink and watch hockey; or the Rage Room where they can smash things for a price.

Though 40 percent of Flyers single-game ticket-purchasers are women Camillo thinks that number can grow with new family-friendly amenities like the Sensory Room meant to provide a safe space for fans with autistic children.

“For anyone on the business side being able to take part in a $300 million transformation of the arena was a dream” she said. “Dave Scott told me they wanted a leader who could say what it should look like what it should be. They wanted someone to maximize the fan experience maximize revenue. That’s what was so attractive about this job. And I’ve been allowed the autonomy to lead the transformation.”

The COVID-19 pandemic of course has slowed and altered some of those plans. But the 76ers season is now underway and the Flyers will soon join them. What those seasons will look like in a few months and how the arena will adapt is still anyone’s guess.

“There have been a lot of unexpected and new challenges” Camillo said. “But we’re making the most of the hand we’ve been dealt. For those that are creative there are new opportunities and paths forward.”

And if any of those paths are treacherous Camillo with or without Holmgren’s help and likely in more sensible footwear will figure out a way to navigate them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3R5cGVzLW9mLW1pbGVzLWFuZC1wb2ludHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Types of Miles and Points,"In the interest of full disclosure OMAAT earns a referral bonus for anyone that’s approved through some of the below links.

There is a ton of vocabulary and jargon in the frequent flyer world which can be quite intimidating. You’ll pick up more of the terms as you go along but at the beginning it’s important to distinguish between a few different types of miles and points.

Airline Miles / Hotel Points

Fixed-Value Points

Flexible / Transferable Points

Airline Miles and Hotel Points

Most of us are familiar with at least the concept of airline miles and hotel points – those are essentially a rebate offered by a specific brand in exchange for loyalty to their company. Those companies set the earnings rates redemption values and all the other terms and conditions.

Not only are there airline miles to consider but you likely have (or have heard of) rewards points with a bank or credit card as well. These typically come in two varieties: fixed-value and transferable.

What are Fixed Value Points?

As the name might suggest fixed-value points can be redeemed towards a specific dollar amount of travel. The amounts vary by program but you’ll typically receive 1¢-2¢ per point towards travel.

These include (but are certainly not limited to):

Citi ThankYou points (with some exceptions)

Bank of America Worldpoints

US Bank FlexPerks Rewards

USAA Rewards

Wells Fargo Rewards

Capital One No Hassle Rewards (these are somewhat different than Capital One Miles)

Barclaycard Arrival Miles

Some programs require you to redeem through the bank portal while others will issue a statement credit.

In general however you are redeeming fixed-value points for tickets that could otherwise be purchased with cash.

So if a given airline ticket was selling for $100 and you had a fixed-value currency that gave you 1¢ per point towards travel you would need 10000 points for that ticket.

That’s why these programs advertise as having “no blackout dates” or having the ability to “choose any airline” – your bank is essentially purchasing retail airfare for you in exchange for points you’ve accumulated with their program. Because these tickets are typically revenue fares you will typically earn miles when you fly on a ticket procured with a fixed-value currency!

So why even bother with miles? Fixed-value points sound great!

Fixed-value points are fantastic if you want to travel on domestic economy tickets! Domestic tickets (especially in the US) can be surprisingly difficult to redeem airline miles for so fixed-value currencies are a great alternative.

However if you’re looking at traveling internationally particularly in premium cabins fixed-value points just won’t get you very far. An international business class ticket might require 110000 airline miles but since the retail price is likely upwards of $5000 you’d need over 500000 Bank of America points for example. And that’s a cheap premium cabin ticket. Some first class tickets would cost as much as a new car if paying cash.

So what are the other options?

What are Flexible / Transferable Points?

One of the major perks to bank points as opposed to airline miles is that as a consumer you’re insulated from dramatic changes or unannounced devaluations from a particular airline. So for many people it makes sense to focus on a flexible points currency with transferable rewards.

These programs typically allow you to transfer points directly to their airline or hotel partners. This gives you lots of options when it’s time to redeem your airline miles as you have the opportunity to search for award availability across alliances prior to committing to a certain mileage currency.

Credit Card Transfer Partners

One of the reasons I consistently recommend flexible point currencies is the versatility you have when transferring your points. The same significant balance of credit card points can be transferred to a variety of airlines or hotel partners therefore making them incredibly valuable when used strategically.

Each transferable currency has its strong (and weak) partners so it’s important to think about where you want your points to take you before stockpiling any specific one. The main flexible points currencies are American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards Capital One Mileage Transfer Citi ThankYou and Marriott Bonvoy.

American Express Membership Rewards Transfer Partners

And you have over a dozen loyalty programs to choose from:

Holders of the Citi Premier® Card Citi Prestige Card and Citi Chairman Card are also able to transfer their ThankYou Points to airline partners.

Brex Transfer Partners

Brex is a cool product that offers a streamlined and innovative solution for startups and tech companies. Their rewards can be transferred to the following partners:

Airlines Hotels Aeromexico Club Premier N/A though various hotels are bookable through the rewards portal. Air France/KLM Flying Blue Avianca Lifemiles Cathay Pacific Asia Miles Emirates Skywards JetBlue TrueBlue Qantas Frequent Flyer Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer

Marriott Bonvoy Transfer Partners

Earning Marriott points isn’t as easy or lucrative as it used to be though they do have more transfer partners than any other program:

It is worth noting that while most bank transfers are rather quick (and instant in many cases) Marriott transfers can take a few weeks depending on the program you’re transferring to.

So which miles or points should I be collecting?

Well that depends a great deal on your travel goals! There is always a bit of a balance between accruing the most points or the most valuable points and the only way to determine the best route for you is to know where and how you want to travel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcHVja3Byb3NlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1mbHllcnMtc2FtdWVsLW1vcmluLWZvcndhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia Flyers: Cross-training Samuel Morin is 'forward'-thinking,Next. 5 best games of the Johnny Gaudreau-era. dark

On each of those a breadcrumb connects back to you. The more breadcrumbs you have out in the world the easier it is to trace your activity whether for advertising or identity theft. Installing a password manager and enabling two-factor authentication can go a long way. But spending 30 minutes once a year closing accounts and deleting what you don’t need can further prevent any funny business paving the way not just for improved privacy but better performance as well.

In a tweet infosec blogger John Opdenakker laid out the idea of “security by removal.” In short the fewer accounts software files and apps we all have the less potential there is for data breaches privacy leaks or security issues. Think of it like data minimalism a Marie Kondo–style approach to data and security.

Step one: Delete the accounts you don’t use

We’ve said this before but once more with feeling: Delete your old accounts. Think of every online account you have as a window in a house—the more windows you have the easier it is for someone to see what’s inside.

Spend a day going through all the old accounts you used once and then forgot about; then delete them. Doing this will cut down on opportunities for that data to leak into the world. It also tends to have the nice side effect of getting rid of email clutter.

Step two: Delete apps you don’t use from your phone

It’s best to spend a few minutes every couple of months deleting apps you don’t need. If you’re anything like me you download all sorts of apps either to try out new services or because some store makes you download something you’ll use once and likely forget about. An app could be a black hole for data cause privacy concerns or serve as a vector for security issues.

Before you delete an app make sure to first delete any associated account you may have created alongside it. To remove the app once that’s done:

Android

Open the Play Store. Tap the hamburger menu in the top-left corner. Tap My Apps & Games > Installed > Alphabetical and change it to Last Used. For any app you don’t use anymore tap the name of the app and then tap Uninstall to get rid of it.

iPhone

Head to Settings > General > iPhone Storage to find a list of all your apps organized by size. This section also lists the last time you used an app. If it’s been awhile there’s likely no good reason to keep it around. Tap the app and then tap the Delete App button.

While you’re at it now’s a good time to give the remaining apps a privacy audit to make sure they don’t have permissions they don’t need. Here’s how to do so on Android and iPhone.

Step three: Audit third-party app access

If you use a social media account to log in to a service (like logging in to Strava with a Google account) you access social media accounts through third-party apps (like Tweetbot) or you use a third-party app to access data like calendars or email it’s worth periodically checking those accounts to remove anything you don’t need anymore. This way some random app won’t slurp data from an account after you’ve stopped using it.

All the major tech companies offer tools to see which apps you’ve granted access to your account. Go through and revoke access to apps and services you no longer use:

Facebook

Click the dropdown arrow in the top right then select Settings and Privacy > Settings > Apps and Websites. This includes apps you’ve granted access to Facebook and apps you use your Facebook account to log in to. Go through and remove anything here you don’t recognize or no longer need.

Google

Log in to your Google account and then head to the Security page (or click your profile picture > Manage Your Google Account > Security). Click on Manage Third-Party Access and then remove access to any apps you do not use. On this page you can also see any third-party services you’ve used your Google account to sign in to. Click any old services you no longer need and then Remove Access. You can also check on app-specific passwords. Head back to the security page then click App Passwords log in again and delete any apps you no longer use.

Twitter

Head to the Connected apps page while logged in (click on three-dot icon > Settings and Privacy > Security and Account Access > Apps and Sessions > Connected Apps). Revoke access to any apps you do not use.

Apple

Log in to your Apple ID and head to the manage page. Under the Security tab click Edit. Look for App-Specific Passwords and then click View History. Click the X icon next to anything you no longer use. Then scroll down to Sign in With Apple click Manage Apps & Websites and revoke access to any apps you don’t need anymore.

Step four: Delete software you don’t use on your computer

Outdated software is often full of security holes if the developer no longer supports it or you don’t run software updates as often as you should (you really should enable automatic updates). Bonus: If you’re often annoyed by updates getting rid of software you don’t use anymore will make the whole process go more smoothly. Before you do this be sure to save any activation keys or serial numbers just in case you need to access the software later on.

Windows

Open Settings > System > Storage and then click on Apps & Features. Under the Sort By dropdown select Install Date. Go through and remove anything you don’t need. If an app is unfamiliar search for it online to see if it’s something you need or if you can safely get rid of it. You can also search for it on Should I Remove It? (though we recommend skipping the Should I Remove It? application and just searching for the software’s name on the site).

While you’re here it’s a good idea to go through your documents and other files too. Getting rid of big old files can help improve your computer’s performance in some cases and clearing out your downloads folder periodically can ensure you don’t accidentally click on anything you didn’t intend to download.

Mac

Click the Apple icon > About This Mac and then select Storage > Manage > Applications. Go through and see if there are any apps you no longer need and delete them. If you have many apps it’s useful to click the Last Accessed option to sort by the last time you opened the app.

Step five: Remove browser extensions you don’t use

Browser extensions have a bad habit of stealing all sorts of data so it’s important to be careful what you install. This is also why it’s a good idea to periodically go through and remove any extensions you don’t really need.

Chrome

Click the puzzle icon > Manage Extensions. Click the Remove button on any extensions you don’t need.

Firefox

Click the three-dot icon > Add-Ons. On any extensions you no longer need click the three-dot icon next to the extension and then select Remove.

Safari

Click Safari > Preferences > Extensions. Click the Uninstall button on any extensions here you do not need.

Step six: Remove yourself from public records sites

If you’ve ever searched for your own name online you’ve probably come across a database that lists information like your address phone number or even criminal records. This data is accumulated by data brokers companies that comb through public records and other sources to create a profile of people.

You can remove yourself from these sites but it can take a couple hours of work to do so the first time you try it. Check out this GitHub page for a list of directions for every one of these sites. If you’re short on time focus on the ones with skull icons next to them like PeekYou Intelius and PeopleFinder.

Step seven: Reset and recycle (or donate) devices you don’t use

If you have electronics you don’t use anymore—old tablets laptops smart speakers cameras storage drives and so forth—factory-reset them (or if it’s a laptop wipe the storage drive) delete any associated accounts and then find a place to recycle or donate them.

Older computers tablets and phones often have more life in them and there’s always someone who can use them. Sites like the National Cristina Foundation can help you find somewhere to donate locally and the World Computer Exchange donates globally. If you can’t donate a device like an old smart speaker most Best Buys have a drop box for recycling old electronics.

The less cruft on your devices the better your general privacy and security. But it also tends to improve the general performance of your hardware so 30 minutes of effort is a win-win. Combined with a password manager and two-factor authentication these steps can stymie some of the most common security and privacy breaches we all face.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vbGVhZGVycy8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL3doeS1yZXRhaWxlcnMtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1zaG91bGQtbG9vay10by1jaGluYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why retailers everywhere should look to China,"O VER THE past ten months most people in the rich world have participated in the biggest shopping revolution in the West since malls and supermarkets conquered suburbia 50 years ago.

The COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit will be the main agenda of the EU for the next six months under Portugal’s presidency taken over from Germany.

The EU will specifically focus on COVID-19 vaccination and reducing the socio-economic impact of the pandemic. The outcome of the Brexit agreement will also be on the 27-member bloc’s agenda as the new trade deal between London and Brussels will be implemented in 2021.

Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said Portugal can be an “honest broker” under the terms of the new deal with the UK pointing to the diplomatic alliance between Portugal and the UK dating back to the 14th century.

In a statement announcing the priorities of its term presidency Portugal pledged to “promote recovery leveraged by the climate and digital transitions.”

The country also aims to implement a “European Pillar of Social Rights of the EU as a distinctive element for ensuring a fair and inclusive transition” as well as strengthening Europe’s autonomy while remaining open to the world. However the Western Balkans region is not among the priorities.

Portugal also plans to defend and consolidate the “rule of law” principle within the EU combating discrimination and promoting pluralism in the media according to the statement on the EU website.

Although EU member states reached an agreement for the 2021-2028 budget and recovery plan under Germany’s term presidency the technical process will be completed during Portugal’s term presidency with the funds set to reach 27 member states.

The postponed EU-Africa summit trade negotiations with India and the ecological and digital transition process will also be prioritized by the EU during the next six months.

Some international issues such as the recent developments in the Eastern Mediterranean Libya and Syria as well as the relations with Turkey and the EU will also be on the bloc’s agenda."

Williams plans to appoint Cea Weaver — campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All a statewide coalition of tenant groups — to the 13-person commission.

Weaver 32 has called for rent strikes by tenants and an eviction ban due to COVID-19.

“Cea Weaver is one of New York’s leading housing and progressive policy activists who has fought for equity on behalf of individuals and communities alike and our office is proud to have worked with her in these fights” Williams’ spokesman William Gerlich told The Post Saturday.

“The City Planning Commission is an instrument of real power with the ability to shape the future of our city in a progressive direction to create change in this moment of crisis and for years to come.”

Describing evictions as “violent” Weaver successfully pushed for a state law signed by Gov. Cuomo putting a “pause” on evictions amid the pandemic.

She also supported the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act of 2020 a bill that died last year but is expected to be reintroduced in January by state Sen. Julia Salazar (D-Brooklyn).

The bill would halt evictions and foreclosures until the end of the pandemic — plus one year to give tenants and homeowners time to catch up financially. It would compensate landlords for loss of income but give priority to “small mom and pops” before big companies.

Weaver — a member of the NYC local of the Democratic Socialists of America — has said she believes housing is a right and suggested that landlords “should not be profiting off something people deeply need.”

She endorsed the successful push to stop Amazon from building a second headquarters in Queens.

Weaver said Saturday she is weighing the nomination — which must be approved by the City Council — while undergoing a city background check.

“Ultimately when it comes to matters of land use in New York City my goal is to ensure that public land and public resources are used for the public good” she said.

Supporters hail Weaver’s courage in standing up for the little guy against powerful corporate interests.

Critics contend Weaver is bad for NYC’s comeback after the city lost billions of dollars in revenue due to the pandemic.

“With New York confronting an economic crisis of historic proportion it would be unfortunate if the City Planning Commission became another vehicle to block the creation of good jobs and much-needed housing and investment” James Whelan president of the Real Estate Board of New York said in a statement to The Post.

“It would be a significant setback for the City’s recovery.”

Williams can appoint one of 13 members on the planning commission.

The mayor appoints the chairperson who also serves as city planning director and six other members. The five borough presidents each appoint one member. The chair serves at the mayor’s pleasure while the other 12 commissioners sit for staggered terms of five years.

In 2013 Live Oak Bank got interested in chickens. The bank which formed five years earlier had grown fast by making Small Business Administration loans nationally to veterinarians medical practices funeral homes and other businesses that it understood well. CEO Chip Mahan wanted to add poultry farmers to the bank’s collection of specialty industries.

He called an El Dorado Ark. banker who was the nation’s most successful lender to chicken farmers recalls Lee Williams Live Oak’s co-founder and vice chairman. “The guy said ‘I’m perfectly happy down here.’”

That didn’t discourage Mahan says Williams who met him in the 1970s when both worked for Wachovia Bank in Winston-Salem.

“Just like he’s always done he called him in June and he called him in September” Williams says.

On the latter call the El Dorado banker revealed that he had developed cancer and that his employer was “‘treating me really really bad related to me being really really sick. And I’m ready to talk to you about taking my chicken-lending team and coming to work for Live Oak’” Williams says.

Live Oak started poultry lending in January 2014 and has since issued $1.2 billion in loans. It’s part of the reason the Wilmington-based bank with no branches tellers or ATMs has made more Small Business Administration 7(a) loans than any financial institution over the last three years.

Larger than life

Live Oak and its technology offshoot nCino which have a combined stock market value of nearly $10 billion are built in large part on the 69-year-old Mahan’s ability to recruit talent. So is Canapi Ventures the Washington D.C.-based investment firm that has raised $545 million for financial-technology investments and Apiture another affiliated tech company.

Mahan certainly has some technology credibility. In the 1990s he started the country’s first online-only bank in Atlanta. The Wilmington campus housing Live Oak nCino and Apiture has a design that has drawn architectural industry raves. But he takes issue with being portrayed as a Silicon Valley-style entrepreneur.

“We’ve got to get one thing straight” he says. “I am not a technical guy and I am not a visionary. I hang around guys that are really really smart. And then you give them a little capital and it’s amazing what they do.”

Those people say there is something amazing about Mahan. They’ve watched as he’s grown Live Oak from an idea to a bank with $8 billion in assets and $1.8 billion market value while developing other enterprises with potentially even greater prospects.

“He had the self-confidence of a successful entrepreneur” says Joseph Smith Jr. the N.C. banking commissioner when Live Oak was chartered. “He was a tough son of a bitch. He had a good idea. And he was willing to put his own money up and make a go of it.”

Mahan lured Huntley Garriott from Goldman Sachs Group to Wilmington to run Live Oak Bank in 2018. He calls his boss “a larger-than-life persona. … This company in a lot of ways is Chip’s persona.”

But Mahan’s entrepreneurial instincts haven’t always been so sharp.

Owning something

In the 1970s and early ’80s the Washington and Lee University graduate traveled across Tennessee and Kentucky for Wachovia selling cash management and other services to distilleries and other businesses. But he wasn’t happy working for someone else or with his $9000 annual salary. An early attempt to buy an equipment-rental franchise fizzled. In the early ’80s he spotted an opportunity: Farmers Bank & Capital Trust Co. in Frankfort Ky. the capital city where he spent his teenage years.

The stock was trading at just 25% of book value. “I got to thinking if I could get somebody to lend me the money — lend me three times what the stock’s trading for but still under book value — then we could basically buy the bank for free” he says.

Auto dealership owner Bill Gatton overheard Mahan talking about his idea on a flight between Lexington Ky. and Bristol Tenn. “I got off the plane and I went to his house and we talked until 3 a.m.” Mahan recalls. “He said ‘I’ll back you.’”

Before Mahan left his job in late 1982 to pursue the deal Wachovia CEO John Medlin gave him a warning: “‘You can’t do a hostile takeover of a community bank’” Mahan recalls Medlin saying. “‘It’s just not going to work.’”

Mahan was undeterred. “I thought I knew where the largest shareholders were because this was a small community where I grew up” Mahan says. He rented an office and started calling people. “I’m offering three times what the stock’s trading for. You know how much stock I got? Not one share.”

With a 3-year-old and 6-year-old at home Mahan had to “crawl on his belly” to get his job at Wachovia back. “But it was over after that. You just can’t go back” Mahan says. “It was exhilarating to think that you could actually own something.”

The internet beckons

Within a few months connections made during the Farmers Bank venture led to a chance to run another small community bank in Kentucky and then buy it with some other investors.

In 1985 that bank was acquired by Columbus Ohio-based Bank One which later became part of today’s JPMorgan Chase. Two years later Mahan raised $16 million and started Lexington Ky.-based Cardinal Bancshares which went public in 1992.

In 1993 over dinner with his brother-in-law Atlanta software company owner Michael McChesney Mahan heard about the internet for the first time. “I said ‘Well if people are going to go look at this stuff nationwide why don’t I advertise CDs [certificates of deposit] on the internet?’” Mahan says. “He said ‘You’re a dumbass’ — he’s way smarter than me — ‘What we need to do is put [budgeting software] Quicken on the web.’”

Mahan and McChesney flew to San Francisco and met with Marc Andreessen who helped create the first widely used web browser NCSA Mosaic and co-founded Netscape. Andreessen offered to write its software for $1 million.

McChesney nixed the deal insisting the company couldn’t let someone else own the source code. He would hire the programmers himself.

In 1995 they launched Security First Network Bank in Atlanta as the nation’s first FDIC-insured branchless online bank. It attracted just a few thousand customers who had to mail checks to the bank to deposit funds. In 1998 Mahan sold the banking operations to Royal Bank of Canada. (He’d sold Cardinal Bancshares a year earlier to another Kentucky-based community bank.)

While Security First had little success Mahan and McChesney knew they were on to something big. They spun off the technology created to develop Security First calling it S1. In the next few years it became one of the key early providers of online-banking technology for thousands of companies including JPMorgan Chase.

Team building

Chip Mahan has surrounded himself with these executives to lead Live Oak nCino Apiture and Canapi Ventures. Some are former colleagues at S1 or Wachovia.

Stepping away

In 2000 Mahan’s wife Peggy whom he’d met in Kentucky at age 11 developed cancer. Mahan quit his job as S1’s CEO but remained chairman and the couple moved to Wilmington to be closer to Duke University Hospital where she was being treated.

By 2005 Peggy’s cancer was in remission but S1 was struggling financially amid increased competition and management turmoil. Mahan returned as CEO just as activist investor Jeffrey Smith of the Starboard Value hedge fund was circling the company. Rather than wage a proxy battle S1 gave Smith a board seat where he exerted pressure successfully to put the company up for sale.

S1 directors met with 28 potential investors but attracted just one bid — from Mahan with backing from a San Francisco billionaire — for about $4 per share. The board turned it down. Mahan quit and sold all his stock the next day; it was trading at about $1.

The next week he was sitting around with Williams who had gained expertise in SBA lending while working with Mahan at Cardinal Bancshares. “We ought to start an SBA-only bank” Mahan suggested. And so Live Oak was born opening in 2008 as a state-chartered bank with a national online-lending platform.

Live Oak’s business model was to make SBA loans which are partially guaranteed by the government in industry sectors that have low default rates. It would hire lenders with deep expertise and connections in what is now 33 industry sectors.

Smith the banking commissioner says Live Oak showed a way to diversify business lending across the nation. “It wasn’t ‘bank everybody locally’ it was ‘bank everybody in an industry we understand deeply.’”

Aligning interests

An initial Live Oak investor was Neil Underwood who had met Mahan when he joined S1 in 2001 to head that company’s enterprise sales unit. Mahan told him about the new bank as the pair were sitting in a duck blind.

When Underwood expressed interest in investing Mahan inquired about his liquid net worth. After his hunting pal gave a number Mahan said “‘OK that will do’” Underwood says. “[I said] ‘You want all my liquid net worth that I’ve earned over the years in this bank?’

[Mahan replied] ‘Yep! Our interests have got to be aligned son.’”

Underwood joined Live Oak full time in 2010 and is president of the holding company. He didn’t give Mahan all his liquid net worth “but I gave him a large portion.” Government filings show Underwood now holds about 1.3 million shares or about 3.2% of the company with a mid-December valuation of about $60 million. Mahan owns nearly 16% worth about $300 million.

David Lucht who had worked with Mahan at Cardinal left the $10.5 billion Ohio-based FirstMerit Bank where he had been chief credit officer to join the new company.

“Although it was a startup I had kind of an inside knowledge that Chip usually had really good ideas” Lucht says. “I jumped at the chance.”

Leading lender

The idea has worked. Loan volume surged from $162 million in 2008 to $848 million in 2014 a year before the IPO. Three industries made up about 60% of the lending back then. Now the three biggest sectors — agriculture health care and veterinary — account for 30% with total loans topping $4.5 billion as of Sept. 30.

The lending is largely fueled by consumer deposits that grew by 60% to $4 billion over the previous 18 months. Live Oak sells online certificates of deposit that pay higher interest rates than most peers typically earning a wider profit margin because it doesn’t have the expense of branches.

The rapid growth hasn’t produced steady profit because of fluctuations in the sales of loans to other institutions. Net income peaked at $100 million in 2017 then slumped to $18 million in 2019. Shares that sold for $19 at the IPO reached $30 in mid-2018 before selling off over the next 20 months. Last March amid the stock market’s pandemic panic shares traded under $10. Since then they’ve quadrupled to more than $46 in mid-December.

In October Raymond James analyst Ammar M. Samma upgraded Live Oak from “outperform” to “strong buy” calling the third quarter the strongest in the company’s history. Live Oak “blew away our expectations this quarter” for its net interest margin and loan growth he wrote.

A few days later the SBA named Live Oak the agency’s largest lender by dollar volume processing more than 1000 loans worth nearly $1.5 billion in the 2020 fiscal year. It also ranked first in the two previous years.

Fintech future

While loans and deposits are Live Oak’s core what sets Mahan apart is his growing collection of financial-technology companies. The bank spun out nCino as a separate company in 2011 to focus on cloud software developed by the bank to manage its lending. Mahan and Pierre Naudé another former S1 colleague hired to run the business figured other companies would pay for the technology.

Revenue is expected to top $170 million this year and nCino (a play on encino the Spanish word for oak) calls itself the “worldwide leader in cloud banking.” It went public in July at $71 and traded for about $75 in mid-December. Though it has never reported a profit nCino’s market cap of $6.9 billion dwarfs Live Oak’s. Mahan owns more than 2 million shares or more than $150 million.

In 2018 Mahan partnered with Gene Ludwig founder and CEO of Promontory Financial Group (which is now owned by IBM) to found Canapi Ventures. The group raised $545 million from about 35 investors including banks and trade associations and lists seven fintech portfolio investments on its website.

Then there’s Apiture which has signed more than 400 financial institution clients for services to improve digital-banking offerings since Mahan’s team started the business nearly three years ago. The business is led by Chris Babcock another former S1 executive. In July it raised $20 million from investors affiliated with Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates and Nashville-based Pinnacle Bank. Mahan says Apiture has nCino-type potential.

Mahan’s success is having a big impact on Wilmington where the network of companies has become an important economic force. Live Oak’s three-building campus near a man-made lake seems more Silicon Valley than southern. Employees enjoy a 25000-square-foot fitness center fully paid health care with no copays or deductibles and an on-site cafeteria.

Because it profited from issuing Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020 Live Oak paid $10000 bonuses to each of its 600 employees including cafeteria workers. A few senior executives were excluded.

“The people that he hires the way that he invests in them is unique and it has landed them at the top of the list of the best banks to work for” says Peter Gwaltney president and CEO of the N.C. Bankers Association. “Part of their secret sauce is hiring smart people and letting them work in a casual relaxed environment with high expectations and the ability to make a really good living.”

Mahan sees his role as bringing people and money together and pointing them at problems.

Garriott says that he and Mahan talk frequently usually starting with a 5 a.m. exchange of emails but the elder banker almost never tells him what to do.

“He always has the veto since he’s the CEO and chairman” Garriott says. “But he hasn’t exercised it — maybe once in two years. … He’s really let me do my job which is probably hard for someone who actually made every decision for this company for so long.”

Mahan knows that managing senior executives isn’t so much about managing as it is about aiming and aligning.

“I never say ‘You work for me’” he says. “A Huntley Garriott or a Neil Underwood — unless they feel like they’re in charge they’re probably not going to do it. … You paint the target — we collectively paint the target — and then they go get that.”

But Mahan knows what the target is. And it’s not chicken farms or veterinarians or even software companies. The key is to reboot the “280 billion lines of code [that] run the entire banking business in the U.S. It’s 40 years old. None of it works worth a damn” he says. “Now you’ve got a chance to change the entire infrastructure of the largest industry in the U.S. and fundamentally the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc3RhZ2UvZ2FsbGVyeS8yMDIxL2phbi8wMi90aGUtcGljdHVyZS1vZi1kb3JpYW4tZ3JheS10aGUtbWFnaWMtdHJpY2tzLWFuZC10ZWNobmljYWwtZmVhdHMtYmVoaW5kLXN0Y3Mtc21hc2gtaGl0LWluLXBpY3R1cmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Picture of Dorian Gray: the 'magic tricks' and technical feats behind STC's smash hit – in pictures,"When the curtains close on each performance of Sydney Theatre Company’s one-woman show the most common phrase you’ll hear is ‘How did they do that?’.

The 2019/20 revenue figures are a stark indicator of the blow the coronavirus crisis has dealt to UK law firms: although the UK’s 100 largest firms generated a total revenue of £27.7bn in 2019/20 The Lawyer’s UK 200 data shows that this is the lowest year-on-year increase in five years. Although for the majority of firms the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was felt only in the final two months of the financial year this is the period when most make their profit after overheads have been paid for.

Revenue for the top 100 UK firms group rose 5 per cent from the £26.38bn posted in 2018/19 – about half of the 9.5 per cent rise seen in the previous year. You would have to go as far back as 2014/15 and 2015/16 to see a total value rise of such low proportions.

This is not the case for those operating in the alternative legal services provider (ALSP) sector who reported double-digit revenue growth according to the latest UK 200 report.

Boodle Hatfield tops the UK Independents (firms ranked 101-200) this year with a revenue rise of 5.7 per cent.

Joseph Hebert spent New Year’s Eve in a hotel room looking out at the Strip but he couldn’t join the party.

His celebration could come Sunday night if he claims the World Series of Poker Main Event title at the Rio. Hebert who won the U.S. portion of the Main Event on Monday is playing international winner Damian Salas heads-up for $1 million the trophy bracelet and a place in poker history.

So having to stay in his hotel room because of COVID protocols is no problem.

“This is something and a goal that I’ve always tried to attain so it’s worth every isolation possible” Hebert said Friday. “I would isolate myself for a year if I had to to have this opportunity.”

Hebert a 38-year-old poker pro from Metairie Louisiana already guaranteed himself $1553256 by prevailing at the U.S. final table. The heads-up match with Salas was originally scheduled for Wednesday but was delayed because of travel issues caused by coronavirus protocols.

That meant Hebert’s stay at the Rio was extended. He spent a couple of days with his fiancee and son before isolating.

“I got to celebrate New Year’s with them on a video chat” he said.

“You win $1.5 million and you think maybe you can celebrate a little bit” he added. “It’s kind of strange having to hold off but it’s a good thing.”

Hebert said he has spent the time responding to all the text messages and calls he received after his victory which he dedicated to his mother Linda who died unexpectedly in July from a pulmonary embolism.

“All the congrats and feeling all the love is just absolutely amazing especially for my mom” Hebert said. “Everybody’s reaching out and saying ‘What a wonderful story. She’s super happy for you and she’s dancing up there.’”

Hebert said he was also spending his time studying Salas and talking to players who were familiar with his game. The Argentine won the international final table Dec. 15 in Rozvadov Czech Republic. He finished seventh in the 2017 Main Event and drew notice for taking a long time to make his decisions.

“He’s very methodical about his approach to the game” Hebert said. “It’s going to be a duel. It’s going to be a battle.”

Salas was not available for an interview. PokerNews confirmed that he has arrived for the match.

The Main Event the $10000 buy-in No-limit Hold’em Championship was played in a hybrid online/live format this year because of the pandemic. Because of U.S. online poker laws two tournaments had to be held one for U.S. players on WSOP.com and one for international players on GGPoker.

A total of 705 players entered the U.S. portion and the international portion attracted 674 players for a total field of 1379.

The tournaments were played online until the final tables of nine were reached.

“We’ve seen memorable moments you can’t believe and discovered two central characters you can’t help but root for” WSOP executive director Ty Stewart said in a statement. “A dream will be dealt on Jan. 3 and that’s exactly what we need heading into 2021.”

Hebert has been in Las Vegas for nearly a month after arriving to play tournaments leading up to the Main Event. He said he hopes to finally head back to Louisiana to celebrate — with an extra $1 million in tow.

“I changed my flight for the fourth time — which is a good thing” he said laughing. “I’m not complaining.”

""These people won’t put their heads up again while the mainland [Chinese] authorities are as belligerent and antagonistic towards gaming as they now are."" When Packer first proposed the project in 2018 he made it clear having a high-roller members-only casino attached was crucial to its viability and that China was the biggest opportunity. Crown promised the NSW government that Barangaroo would deliver $1 billion in tax revenue in the first 15 years of operation. The casino would triple the value of international VIP gaming business coming into Sydney Packer claimed. But in October while giving evidence to the Bergin inquiry he conceded that would never eventuate. ""Clearly that’s wrong but that’s what I believed at the time"" Packer told the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) inquiry.

The billionaire businessman explained that in the original business case international high rollers would generate a third of Crown Sydney's earnings with local gamblers and its hotel and hospitality operations making up the balance covering the cost of construction. ""The upside in Crown Sydney was from the international VIP business"" Packer said. James Packer during the inquiry hearing. Getting out of Crown could lead to him forfeiting his control premium. Credit: Out of the $2.2 billion construction cost Crown also hopes to recoup $800 million from sales of luxury apartments in the tower. The penthouse is still for sale at a reported asking price of $100 million. Crown's grip on the China market was already slipping following the arrest of 19 Crown employees in China in 2016 for illegally promoting gambling (one of the main focuses of the Bergin inquiry) and Crown's subsequent exit from its Asian joint venture.

Crown then relied on ""junket"" tour partners to bring Chinese VIPs to Australia but that has been put on ice after the Herald and The Age exposed how many of its junkets had links to organised crime which was examined further at the Bergin inquiry. Crown has pledged to never work with junkets again unless state regulators implement a licensing regime for the controversial operators. And just last week the Chinese government passed even harsher criminal penalties for anyone organising Chinese citizens to travel overseas to gamble. Casino industry expert Ben Lee from the consultancy IGamiX Management & Consulting says this effectively closed-off the flow of Chinese high rollers to casinos like Crown Sydney. “It leaves them up the creek without a paddle"" he says. ""The only way they even can try to recover their investment [from Barangaroo] is to go aggressively after the local market.” That will include targeting lower-tier players – not just wealthy VIPs – who currently frequent Crown's Sydney rival The Star says Lee. That's possible because its table game-betting limit is only $25 which far from being ""high-roller"" stakes is what most patrons bet on the main gaming floor at Crown Melbourne.

“When you look at the table limit of $25 that’s a laugh"" he says. ""That’s not even the main hall limit in Macau. So while they were saying one thing they were really aiming for something else."" Green says that Crown could still attract some relative high rollers. But the inability to extend credit to Chinese gamblers here and get around China's tight capital controls – which was a key function of junkets – would limit the earning potential. ""It’s going to be a lot harder for them to carve much out of gaming itself"" Green says. Green thinks Crown will eventually be allowed to operate in Sydney but may face a long delay in opening the facility and stricter reporting conditions. There may also be some issues replacing its board. The Victorian government last month fast-tracked by two years its review of Crown's licence to this year in light of the evidence the NSW inquiry uncovered about what was happening at the Southbank complex.

Some industry watchers say the Bergin inquiry has jeopardised not just Crown Sydney but also the group's most important asset: Crown Melbourne. The Victorian government last month fast-tracked its next five-yearly review of Crown's licence due in 2023 to this year in light of the evidence the NSW inquiry uncovered about what was happening under its nose at the sprawling Southbank complex. Loading But another outcome which could address Crown's licensing issues is for it to be taken over by another operator. Australian market analysts have recently crunched the numbers on a possible merger between Crown and Star Entertainment to create a $14 billion gambling behemoth with casinos in Australia's four largest capitals. Packer for his part has shown himself to be a willing seller. He negotiated a full Crown takeover with US casino giant Wynn in April 2019 but that fell apart when details leaked to the press.",,,,,,,,,

From countless postponements to outright cancelations to even events held without any fans few things were worth celebrating this past year when it came to sports.

But we here at the Brainerd Dispatch sports department did find a few things worth remembering. Here are the top 10 sports stories for the year 2020:

No. 1: A world series first

Don’t worry we’ll mention COVID-19 soon enough but we decided to start with something good and unforgettable.

Oct. 21 marked the first time a Brainerd High School graduate appeared in a World Series game. Nick Anderson Major League Baseball’s top middle reliever entered Game Two in the bottom of the fifth inning and struck out Los Angeles Dodgers’ third baseman Justin Turner to end the inning.

The Tampa Bay Rays pitcher went 1 1/3 innings and allowed one hit one earned run and two strikeouts to earn the win to even the series at one game apiece.

In the bottom of the sixth after retiring the leadoff hitter Max Muncy he gave up a solo home run to Dodgers’ catcher Will Smith which trimmed the Rays’ lead to 6-3.

Anderson retired the next two batters including a strikeout of Edwin Rios to end the inning.

The Dodgers would go on to win the World Series and Anderson admittedly struggled during the postseason compared to his almost unhittable regular season.

That didn't stop MLB from honoring Anderson as one of the most dominant relievers in the game in just his second season in the league.

His stellar 2020 regular season earned him a spot on the All-MLB first team as one of the two relief pitchers. The All-MLB winners are selected with 50% coming from a fan vote and 50% coming from a panel of experts. It’s the second season MLB has announced an All-MLB team.

Anderson posted a 0.55 ERA in 16 1/3 innings in the 19 games he played in 2020. He struck out 26 and walked three.

He allowed one earned run all regular season and it came in his 15th appearance and 13th inning pitched.

For his two-year career Anderson is 7-5 with seven saves 22 holds and a 2.77 ERA. He’s appeared in 87 games with 12 games finished. He’s pitched 81.1 innings and allowed 25 earned runs on 57 hits and 21 walks -- four intentional. He owns 136 strikeouts.

When asked what it was like to pitch in the World Series despite few fans being allowed because of the pandemic Anderson said: “Man it was a lot of fun. I wish everything would have been normal but it was still a great experience. We'll see what happens this next year maybe be back there.”

No. 2: COVID cancels sports

It started March 12 and never got better.

The first remedy for COVID-19 was to limit spectators at the boys and girls state basketball tournaments.

“In a press release before 1 p.m. Thursday March 12 the Minnesota State High School League wrote that attendance at tournaments will be limited to rostered participants coaches event staff TV network partners credentialed media and a small number of school-approved spectators of each participating teams.

Starting Friday consolation and third-place games for state girls basketball and adapted floor hockey have been canceled.”

It went from bad to worse in a day.

“Due to the Coronavirus pandemic The Minnesota State High School League announced Friday that effective immediately the state high school girls basketball tournaments the boys’ high school section tournament games and next week’s boys’ state tournament have been canceled.”

Then the news turned to spring sports and the speculation and wait might have been worse than the actual announcement that spring sports would be canceled.

“The Minnesota State High School League announced Thursday April 23 that all activities and athletics that occur during the spring season are canceled for the 2019-20 school year.

This announcement comes from the MSHSL board of directors and comes on the same day Governor Tim Walz announced distance learning would continue for the rest of the school year.”

Restrictions were put in place for offseason contact and workouts. Gyms and weight rooms and pools remained closed. Speculation quickly turned to the fall sports season.

And the craziness ensued.

“The Minnesota State High School League announced Tuesday Aug. 4 that fall sports like boys and girls cross-country boys and girls soccer girls tennis and girls swimming and diving will go as scheduled while football and volleyball will be moved to spring.”

That decision didn’t last long however as mounting pressure from parent groups forced the MSHSL to change course mid-fall.

“Football and volleyball are happening earlier than expected in the 2020-21 school year.

The Minnesota State High School League announced Monday Sept. 21 after a meeting that volleyball and football will return in the fall and not play in the spring as initially decided in August.

ADVERTISEMENT

Both sports will begin practice Monday Sept. 28 with first games being possible Thursday Oct. 8 for volleyball and Friday Oct. 9 for football. Volleyball and football have already been holding practice which was deemed OK by the previous plan laid out by the MSHSL in August.”

And while most got in a regular season teams like the Brainerd Warriors and Pine River-Backus Tigers struggled to get in the allowed number of games. Brainerd couldn’t play its first game because of a COVID-19 outbreak in the school. The Warriors also failed to suit up for their final regular-season game because of a positive test on the team. The Warriors played in just four games last fall.

PR-B played in just two regular-season games but did get in one postseason game where they upset Walker-Hackensack-Akeley in the quarterfinals.

The victory should have allowed PR-B to play at least one more game but then COVID-19 made sure to add insult to injury by forcing all fall sports to end Friday Nov. 20. It also postponed the start of all winter sports.

Some sections choose to forgo the section semifinal round and push the top two seeds into a section title game. That’s why PR-B’s season ended with them winning their last game. Pierz and Pequot Lakes were pushed into their respective section title games. Unfortunately Aitkin which enjoyed a 6-1 season and was the top seed in Section 7-3A didn’t get that luxury. They were forced to end their season with a 56-6 section semifinal victory over Virginia.

The area did see one section title as the No. 3 seeded Crosby-Ironton Rangers topped the only other two teams left in its Section 7-2A tournament to win the program’s first section title.

No. 3: The end of a winning era

In any other normal year this news would have been No. 1 in sports and even on some news lists. But 2020 was far from normal and it started out that way.

“For the first time since 1975 a head coach other than Ron Stolski will be pacing the Brainerd Warriors sideline at Adamson Field in 2020.

Stolski a head coach for 58 total seasons the last 45 in Brainerd informed the 2019 team of his decision to resign in a meeting Wednesday Jan. 22 at Brainerd High School South Campus.”

Stolski retired at 80 years old and as the second-winningest football coach in Minnesota State High School League history.

On the day of his retirement Stolski talked about why he coached for so many years.

“One of the lines I use in my speaking across the country is ‘When you choose a life in teaching/coaching you choose to try to make a difference in the lives you touch’ Stolski said. “My fervent hope is that we have in some way accomplished that goal.”

Stolski finished with 389 career victories a few highlights were:

A 12-10 win over third-ranked Cretin-Derham Hall in the 1990 Class 2A state quarterfinals. A 36-35 regular-season win over Grand Rapids in 1992 when the Warriors rallied from a 20-point deficit halftime deficit. A 14-10 win in the final 65 seconds of the 2007 Class 5A state quarterfinals over sixth-ranked Wayzata. A 34-28 overtime win over sixth-ranked Centennial in the 2009 5A state quarterfinals scoring 14 straight points in the final seven minutes of regulation. The biggest gem of them all might have been a 13-10 win over third-ranked Eden Prairie in the 2010 5A state quarterfinals.

Thanks to COVID-19 the Brainerd community has not been allowed to give Stolski a retirement party. The committee organizing the event which was last scheduled for Sept. 19 at Cragun’s Resort will meet later this month to pick an appropriate date and place.

No. 4: Warrior Dance team still makes history

Before COVID-19 ruined everything the Brainerd lakes area did enjoy some athletic success.

For just the second time in program history Brainerd advanced to the Class 3A state jazz finals and then posted a program-best fifth-place finish Friday Feb. 14 at Target Center in Minneapolis.

“Our girls did great” Brainerd head coach Cindy Clough said after the event. “We were really proud of them. Oh my gosh everybody in the finals was fabulous. There were kind of three teams vying for that fifth and sixth place spot and Lakeville North was the one that didn’t make it in. They were close.”

Brainerd finished fifth after the opening-round qualifying to advance to finals. Clough said Brainerd was ranked sixth going in but topped Prior Lake which finished sixth and Lakeville North.

Brainerd also improved its score by 10 points in the finals.

A day later Brainerd was dancing in the Class 3A state kick finals and placed fourth.

“We performed way better at finals than we did at prelims” Clough said at the time. “Our scores went way up. We performed way better in the evening and we were pleased with that.

“We placed fourth which we are proud of. I think our kids were a little disappointed because they were so set on medaling. But with time they will look back and think it’s amazing what they accomplished.”

Prior to the state tournament Brainerd repeated as double section champions in both jazz and kick Feb. 1 in Forest Lake.

Brainerd scored four rank points in both categories. They beat Anoka by four rank points in jazz and Blaine by six rank points in kick.

No. 5: 2 collect state titles in the nick of time

Owen Bjerga of Staples-Motley celebrates being named Class 1A state champion at 160-pounds Saturday Feb. 29 at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. Bill Johnson / Picture Day Pro!

Owen Bjerga waited a whole year for redemption. Craig Orlando marked his place as one of the best to ever wrestle for the Raiders.

Staples-Motley Cardinals’ Bjerga and Bertha-Hewitt/Verndale’s Orlando captured Class 1A state wrestling titles before COVID-19 shutdown prep athletics.

“Bjerga at 160 pounds pinned Max Ehrich of Blue Earth in 1:58 in the semifinals to reach the finals. He then pinned Anthony Maher of BOLD in 1:55 to claim the title.

The state championship is extra special for Bjerga who was the No. 1 seed for the 160 Class 1A bracket since last season he finished second in heartbreaking fashion.

“It has not quite set in yet” Bjerga said. “It felt pretty good to do it like that. It’s hard to explain the feeling. For all the years of hard work to pay off. It’s pretty cool.”

Bjerga finished his senior season with a 45-1 record.

Orlando came in with two state titles at 285 pounds. Seeded No. 1 in the 285 Class 1A bracket Orlando pinned both of his opponents to reach the semifinals.

In the semifinals he won by a 1-0 decision over Dylan Nick of Westfield. Orlando pinned Scot Edwards of Adrian in 3:07 in the finals to finish the season 50-0 and as a three-time state champion.

Aitkin’s Marshall Larson and Crosby-Ironton’s John Paul Fitzpatrick each wrestled back to earn third-place finishes.

No. 6: Silence not a good thing at BIR

Ron Capps launches his funny car off the line at the 2019 Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals at Brainerd International Raceway. The entire 2020 racing season is on at the track. Steve Kohls / Brainerd Dispatch

It was inevitable with spectators not being allowed but like all things in 2020 Brainerd International Raceway was holding out hope.

That hope didn’t materialize as the NHRA canceled the Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals annually held Sept. 3 at BIR.

Originally scheduled for Aug. 13-16 the Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NHRA and BIR hoped to reschedule it this month but BIR’s location and climate this time of year presented scheduling challenges.

“We feel horrible having to deliver this news today because we have thousands of loyal fans who look forward to Nationals every year and plan their entire summer around it” BIR Owner Kristi Copham said in a press release at the time. “We also feel for local businesses that rely on the added revenue from Nationals weekend. It’s been a difficult summer for everyone but we appreciate everyone’s support and we hope to see everyone at next year’s Nationals.”

The one silver lining is that the NHRA is already scheduled to return next season.

Nitro-fueled NHRA drag racing returns to Brainerd International Raceway for the 39th Annual Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals on Aug. 19-22 2021 the NHRA announced Wednesday Oct. 7.

“We can’t wait for August 19th and I know our fans will be really amped up for the race after having to take this year off” Copham said. “We can’t thank our fans enough for being patient and understanding during last season. We felt horrible for having to cancel the race because our fans are the best drag racing fans in the world and deserve to get their annual dose of Nitro each year not to mention some quality time in The Zoo. We’re looking forward to putting on a great event next summer as we welcome everyone back.”

In an interview last summer Copham said the NHRA event accounts for 75% of BIR’s annual income.

No. 7: The beginning of the Jason Freed era

It probably wasn’t the start any first-year head coach would want especially one replacing a coaching legend.

COVID-19 created multiple complications for new Brainerd Warriors head football coach Jason Freed -- from a canceled opening-season game to the premature ending to the season.

The long-time defensive coordinator for the Warriors was promoted to head coach Friday March 6.

The Brainerd activities department received 12 applications and interviewed four candidates.

“This wasn’t a hard decision because we went through the process and Jason clearly separated himself from the rest of the pool” Brainerd activities director Charlie Campbell said about the hiring. “His previous experience as a head coach winning a state championship but beyond that success Jason really articulated a great vision for continuing on and advancing the foundations of a really strong Warrior football tradition that coach Stolski created.”

After having to cancel its opening game with Cambridge-Isanti Freed and the Warriors finally took to the field against St. Cloud Apollo Saturday Oct. 17.

The Warriors handed Freed his first victory as head coach of the Warriors with a 35-30 win over the Eagles.

Brainerd struggled against top competition the rest of the season before another case of COVID-19 forced the Warriors to end the season Thursday Nov. 12. Brainerd was to host Sartell and then head into the playoffs.

“It’s a tough thing to swallow” Freed said after informing his players of the news. “I told the kids that you all have things in life we think we can control but there are some things that we can’t control. We’ve been talking with the kids since this summer about ‘You control the controllables.’ This is one of those things where we can do our best to try and prevent but when it comes to it you can’t control it. It’s tough and it’s hard to let it set in.

“Our mantra all year has been Warrior Pride and our core values of purpose and maintaining relationships improving daily and discipline and effort. We just talked about those things and how they correlate with life and how it shows that we are a team.”

Brainerd finished the year 1-3.

No. 8: Running away from the pack

The abbreviated fall season wasn’t all bad.

In fact it displayed some dominating performances in cross-country with both the Staples-Motley Cardinals and Pequot Lakes Patriots sweeping their sections.

S-M’s Emmet Anderson won the Section 6-1A individual title with a time of 15:51.1 as the Cardinals boys claimed the section championship Tuesday Oct. 13.

On the same day Ethan Johnson’s fourth-place finish paced the Patriots boys to the Section 7-1A championship in Cloquet.

S-M beat West Central by two points. Behind Anderson were Issiah Tabatt (fifth in 16:59.4) Lyle Brownell (9th in 17:32) Logan Robben (10th in 17:33.3) Luke Brownell (13th in 18:00.3) Tanner Robben (18th in 18:15.7) and Grant Johnson (19th in 18:22.4).

The Patriot boys topped defending state champion Geno Uhbrom’s Greenway/Nashwauk-Keewatin team by four points.

After Johnson’s fourth-place finish was Jesse Clausen (7th in 17:30.5) Dawsin Ackerman (15th in 17:54.5) Collin Yahn (18th in 17:59.1) Charlie Schiessl (23rd in 18:24.4) and Isaak Geroy (30th in 18:33.4).

Calia Chaney and the Pequot Lakes Patriots girls showed the boys team how it’s done Monday Oct. 12 by winning the Section 7-1A title.

Chaney won the individual section title in 18:48.6 and the Patriots bettered Proctor by four points for the team title.

Following Chaney were Rian Zutter (4th in 20:01.8) Carly Chaney (6th in 20:28.7) Isabel Larson (43rd in 22:35.8) Emma Flaws (48th in 22:45.8) Lilix Gustafson (64th in 23:27.6) and Elisa Flaws (67th in 23:33.7).

The biggest winning margin belonged to the S-M girls team which captured the Section 6-1A title by 45 points over second-place West Central Thursday Oct. 15 in New London. It is the third-straight section title for the S-M girls.

Kyanna Burton’s third-place time of 19:15.8 paced S-M. She was followed by Aften Robinson (4th in 19:28.1) Auddrey Brownell (7th in 20:22.2) Ashley Robben (9th in 20:54.8) Naila Mikhaeil (14th in 21:22.0) Addisyn Cichos (45th in 22:44.6) and Arabella Moore (109th in 24:41.4).

No. 9: Winners of their final match

Continuing with the theme that it wasn’t such a terrible fall sports season the Pequot Lakes Patriots girls tennis team repeated as Section 7-1A winners.

Top-seeded Pequot swept the singles portion of the section final to defeat No. 4 Pine City 5-2 Monday Oct. 12.

The Patriots’ other victory came at No. 1 singles where Afton Crocker and Morgan Lueck rallied from a first-set loss to win 1-6 7-5 7-6 (7-3) to help Pequot finish the season 13-0.

Pequot dispatched Duluth Marshall 7-0 in the section semifinals and ousted Aitkin 7-0 in the quarterfinals.

Pequot posted a perfect 10-0 regular-season record to help them win the Mid-State Conference title.

There was no individual tournament nor state tournament this season.

No. 10: Haeg signs on for a Super Bowl ring

Here’s hoping next year’s top story is the first Brainerd High School graduate to play in a Super Bowl.

Brainerd grad and former Indianapolis Colts offensive lineman Joe Haeg signed a one-year $2.3 million deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Friday March 20.

“I think a lot of things came into play with Tampa” Haeg said following the signing. “My former O-line coach Joe Gilbert who was with me for two years in Indianapolis he’s there now. They also provided an opportunity that I was excited about. Going into it I know they were interested in me. It all piled up with a perfect storm and I was very happy to end up with the Bucs.”

Joe Haeg

Haeg and the Bucs are 10-5 heading into the final week of the regular season. The Bucs have already clinched a Wild Card spot in the upcoming NFL postseason.

Haeg has played in 11 games for the Bucs and started three of those. In Tampa’s 47-7 victory over Detroit Dec. 26 Haeg played 17 offensive snaps and eight special teams plays.

In his five-year career the former North Dakota State University grad has played in 66 games with 38 starts.

Both his grandmothers passed away from diabetic complications while a smattering of his relatives are also plagued by it. But he remains sanguine about this predisposition because he has the power of science behind him. A sizeable chunk of the diabetic risk factors are unrelated to genetics and Phua’s company Alchemy Foodtech is seizing upon that opportunity to prevent the chronic disease through food innovations.

He and his co-founder chief food scientist Verleen Goh invented alchemy fiber a patented ingredient made from 100% plant-based ingredients such as corn peas and tapioca. Alchemy fiber can lower the glycemic index of food by increasing its total fiber and prebiotic content. The ingredient can be easily added into a range of carbohydrates—including rice noodles and bread without compromising on taste color or texture.

“Many consumers are already educated on the dangers of consuming refined carbohydrates. Singapore for example launched a war on diabetes” Phua said. “But even though they know they should be eating less white rice and more brown rice many don’t and the biggest reason is taste.”

Alchemy fiber has been endorsed by time-honored Singaporean food brands like Boon Tong Kee and Yum Cha. These household names have relied on recipes passed down from generation to generation to make their mark in Singapore’s food-obsessed landscape over the decades.

Now alchemy fiber is available in five out of eight Boon Tong Kee outlets in Singapore. According to the company taste tests and customer feedback show that food products don’t just maintain their previous taste with the addition of alchemy fiber but taste better too. “When Yum Cha’s chef added alchemy fiber to congee it tasted smoother. Similar flavor tests with Indian restaurants and nasi lemak brands indicate that taste improvements are more apparent in flavored rice” said Phua.

Aside from restaurants Alchemy Foodtech is looking to launch its alchemy fiber products across multiple channels.

“We launched alchemy fiber in July as a reaction to Singapore’s circuit-breaker [lockdown] which came as a shock to everyone. Before that our business model was a purely business-to-business one” said Phua. “When COVID-19 hit we realized we had to develop business-to-consumer (B2C) products as more people stayed at home. More people started cooking and baking at home too.”

This spurred the company’s introduction of B2C products such as flour rice and pre-mixes. In addition the firm is working with healthcare partners such as Raffles Medical to sell alchemy fiber in their pharmacies as well with a view to introducing these products in their healthcare partners’ wards as well.

The company is riding a wave of opportunity because it contributes to Singapore’s plan to satisfy 30% of its nutritional needs with locally produced food by 2030. This helped it obtain significant financial and strategic support from the Singaporean government such as a SGD 750000 (USD 563 500) research grant awarded by Enterprise Singapore. Aside from financial backing the Singaporean government also tried to help the company get its day in the sun with generous endorsements such as a showcase at the F1 Grand Prix.

Recently much attention has been on alternative meats and proteins. But with carbohydrates making up between 45% and 60% of the average person’s nutritional intake tackling this food group head on is important too. Phua thinks that operating in the carbohydrate space as a technology enabler gives his company an advantage over other businesses. “We don’t want to fight with established food conglomerates and brands so we have strategic investors to enable us to collaborate. We also cooperate with many different [alternative] protein companies so that we can cross-promote each other.”

Alchemy Foodtech is on track to ramp up its growth plans with backing from a new batch of international investors. In December the company announced the close of its seven-figure bridge round led by public-listed Thai Union Group PCL alongside investors including Temasek-backed and Shanghai-based VC Bits x Bites; Fuschsia Venture Capital the ventures arm of Muang Thai Group Holding; and South Korea-based Sunbo Partners.

“In Asia there is already an entrenched belief that food is medicine compared to the West where they are seen as two very distinct things. We do want to expand to the US where diabetes rates are high but our approach will have to be radically different there.” Consequently the company’s goal is now to move overseas swiftly by working with strategic partners in Asia first especially those in China.

But Phua and Goh are thinking big. Although they have gained traction in Singapore and big conglomerates have already noticed their potential the company has a long road ahead. “We are starting with carbohydrates in using food innovations to address medical conditions” said Phua. “But in the future we are going to look at issues such as Alzheimer’s and Sarcopenia too which might also be helped through food tech.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ3VpbHR5ZWF0cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMS9pcy1waXp6YS1odXQtb3Blbi1vbi1uZXcteWVhcnMtZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Pizza Hut open on New Year's Day 2021?,Next.
